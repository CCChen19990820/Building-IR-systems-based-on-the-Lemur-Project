</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Some businesses deal exclusively with one or more branches of government, while others only have to deal with the government to get permission to embark on certain projects. This chapter focuses on areas in which businesses frequently come into contact with federal, state, and local governments, such as public financing, government contracts, lobbying, and dealing with administrative agencies. The <A HREF="b23.html">Environmental & Natural Resources Law</A> Chapter examines issues relating to business interaction with agencies protecting the environment. The <A HREF="b29.html">Intellectual Property & Computer Law</A> Chapter discusses how a business registers a trademark with federal and state authorities. The <A HREF="b18.html">Commercial Real Estate Law</A> Chapter covers zoning and land use variances. <A HREF="../appendices/appendixa.html">Appendix A</A> lists government sources of financing and management assistance.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Public Financing</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
One of the government's primary interests is to expand the economy and increase opportunities for a wider cross-section of the population to participate in the economy. In a poor economy, businesses lay off employees, and people without jobs tend to vote against incumbent politicians. Therefore, politicians have created a variety of government programs that aim to promote the interests of businesses. One of the most important means by which the government seeks to help businesses is by making available various forms of public financing so that businesses can expand and grow. Public financing is available from state, local and federal sources.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Federal Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal government offers a number of assistance programs primarily through an organization called the Small Business Administration (SBA). Created by Congress in 1953 to help small businesses, the SBA provides financial, procurement, advocacy and management assistance. Every year, the SBA guarantees bank loans totaling over three billion dollars for small businesses. Small businesses that qualify for SBA loans usually can receive far more favorable terms than they would otherwise be able to get. Most SBA loans are for a lengthy period of time and qualify for a relatively low interest rate. Despite their advantages, SBA loans are not right for all businesses: the SBA loan process usually takes longer than the conventional loan process, the SBA can require more personal guarantees and collateral, and the SBA sometimes restricts a business' ability to get additional financing as a pre-condition to the SBA loan.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>State Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
In Illinois there are various public sources of financing under the direction of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (DCCA). As the state's lead economic development agency, DCCA is committed to helping the state maintain the best possible climate in which to own or operate a business. Its First-Stop Business Information Center is designed to help answer questions about starting or expanding a business.
<P>
Other sources of financing from the state include the Certified Lender Program; Small Business Development Loan Program; Illinois Expert Finance Partnership; Surety Bond Guaranty Program; Business Development Public Infrastructure Program; Enterprise Zone Program; Business Expansion; Detention and Location Assistance; Illinois Small Business Development Center Network; and the Minority, Union, and Disability Business Loan Program. Each of these programs has its own standards for determining who qualifies for economic assistance and how much money is available for which ventures. Information on all of them is available from the DCCA.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Local Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
Many local government units provide assistance in various forms to new businesses. Some offer technical assistance or financial services, while others offer tax credits or loan packaging assistance. A program assisting local government with financing is the Community Development Assistance Program while the Community Development Support Unit provides technical assistance to local governments. A businessperson interested in programs offered in a given area should contact the business services or planning unit of the county or city in which the business is or will be located.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Government Contracts and Technical Assistance</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Of all the corporations in the United States, the single largest is the federal government. Likewise, of all the corporations in Illinois, one of the largest is the state government. Despite these figures, government entities are frequently overlooked by business managers as a source of business opportunities. There are a number of ways a business can secure government contracts at the federal, state, and local levels.
<P>
On the federal level, each individual federal agency receives requests for bids from small businesses. To receive copies of various federal agencies' requests for bids, a business files an application with each federal agency that the business wants to do business with. Many of these federal agencies have special programs specifically designed to assist small and minority-owned businesses because regulations require that a certain percentage of all government contracts be reserved for small or minority-owned businesses. The SBA provides assistance to small businesses in this regard by publishing a list called the Small Business Subcontracting Directory. The directory lists the major contractors to the federal government and which are most likely to be in need of subcontracting.
<P>
One of the missions the SBA takes most seriously is its goal of management assistance. To this end, the SBA offers a number of different programs that businesses can turn to for advice in such areas as marketing, buying, financial management and administration. Among these programs is the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), which puts small businesses in touch with retired executive volunteers who offer counseling and advice. The SBA's Office of Procurement Assistance helps businesses get information and develop strategies concerning selling to the federal government. The SBA also lobbies Congress and other federal organizations on behalf of small businesses.
<P>
There are several other government agencies that a small business should be aware of. For example, the various branches of the armed services offer assistance to businesses in securing defense-related contracts. The U.S. Army maintains an office known as the Defense Logistics Agency to assist small businesses with contracts. Also, the General Services Administration (GSA) helps businesses that want to sell their products directly to the government by providing information on which government agencies wish to purchase products.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Lobbying</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Lobbying is the business of persuading politicians to pass laws that are favorable to a particular person or agency and to defeat potential laws that are unfavorable to lobbyists or their clients. Despite the negative image that some lobbyists have, lobbying government on behalf of business is a long respected tradition in this country. Not only have lobbyists been around for many years, but many government agencies and departments rely on lobbyists to provide them with information necessary to make decisions and set policy. The government is not the large faceless machine it sometimes appears to be. There are people behind every decision and every regulation, and many of these people are sincerely concerned about staying abreast of changes in the law and industry and in promoting the economic vitality of the area they oversee.
<P>
There are laws governing lobbying at both the state and federal level, including requirements for lobbyists to identify the clients on whose behalf they lobby. Lobbyists who lobby the United States Congress are governed by federal lobbyist registration statutes. These laws require lobbyists to maintain and periodically file with the Clerk of the House of Representatives detailed records of major contributors and all expenditures made by the lobbyist or lobbying organization. Lobbyists are also required to register with both the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives.
<P>
Lobbyists who lobby the Illinois General Assembly must register with the Illinois Secretary of State. They also must inform the Secretary of State about themselves and about the party they intend to represent to the General Assembly. Lobbyists must report biannually to the Secretary of State about their expenditures. Supervision and enforcement of these regulations have become tighter in recent years.
<P>
Many law firms have attorneys who specialize in lobbying. In addition, there are non-legal political consulting firms available to perform lobbying services. Their employees are often experts at influencing government.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Dealing with Administrative Agencies</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
When the average person imagines how the government makes decisions, he or she envisions the House or the Senate deliberating in session or the chief executive sitting in his or her office poring over papers. While it might be nice to have direct input into these decisions, few business managers will ever be asked to testify before Congress or to personally advise the president. Instead, the decisions that most directly affect the average business are usually made by one of a variety of government administrative agencies set up to formulate rules and oversee their implementation. Because administrative agencies deal with a wide variety of substantive problems, it would be impossible to summarize in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> all the work they do. However, because administrative procedures are so similar from agency to agency, a business manager should have a basic grasp of how agencies make decisions and the role he or she can play in dealing with administrative agencies.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>The Limited Role of Administrative Agencies </STRONG></H3></A>
It is easier to understand the role of administrative agencies if one understands their constitutional limitations. Theoretically, it is Congress that makes all federal laws and the Illinois General Assembly that makes state laws. Realistically, it would be impossible for either of these two legislative bodies to handle every detail of the laws they create. Legislatures are forced to rely heavily on the advice of numerous administrative agencies in suggesting new laws and implementing existing laws. Frequently, Congress or the state legislature establishes an agency, gives it broad outlines to follow in regulating an industry, then delegates to that agency the power to make rules that industry must follow.
<P>
There are limits on how much authority Congress or the state legislature can delegate to administrative agencies. Once they are created, federal agencies must follow the federal Administrative Procedure Act and state agencies must follow the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act. The statutes creating the agency can sometimes be attacked as an overly broad delegation of legislative power or a particular agency action can be attacked as overstepping the proper bounds of the agency's authority. Thus, an important first step in challenging an agency action is to ask whether the agency has been properly delegated power and whether that power is being properly exercised. The next step in challenging an administrative action is to ask whether the agency has followed the procedures required by the federal or state Administrative Procedure Act.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>The Administrative Process </STRONG></H3></A>
Understanding how agencies work is easier if one understands that all agency actions must fit into one of three broad categories--rulemaking, adjudication, or informal agency action. Each of these categories has unique rules that apply to it, and each offers affected parties a different degree of input into the agency's decision making process. Thus, the first step for any business wanting input into a particular agency action is to determine which category the action fits into. The determination of what to call the agency action is rarely simple. The category that the particular action fits into determines how many procedural safeguards the agency must observe. An agency may try to avoid the cumbersome procedure required for one type of action by trying to fit it into another category of administrative action that requires less formal procedure. Many legal disputes over agency action have centered around how to characterize what the agency is doing, rather than the actions themselves.
<P>
Rulemaking is usually done quite informally after a period of notice and comment. An agency gives notice that it is considering adopting a proposed rule and gives notice to interested parties that may want to comment on the rule. The agency considers the comments and then can promulgate a final rule. Commenting on a proposed rule is one of the most direct ways in which businesses can have a voice in formulating new rules. Unfortunately, an agency is not required to heed comments received. Because the agency is not required to follow any of the comments received, an affected party often will try to argue that what the agency is doing is not rulemaking at all, but instead is adjudication. In a few instances, a new rule can only be made after the agency follows detailed procedures known as formal rulemaking.
<P>
Adjudication is a procedure very much like a civil court trial. Court rules and agency rules are not identical, but agency adjudication allows for direct examination of witnesses, testimony under oath before an administrative law judge and the development of a substantial written record upon which the agency's decision must be based.
<P>
Informal agency action is a very broad category in which the procedures vary considerably. Parties to informal agency action often have minimal procedural protection. For example, an agency might merely be required to give the reason for taking a particular action. It need not allow for public comments or other input into the process.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>The Role of Courts </STRONG></H3></A>
Although most administrative decisions are subject to judicial review, few are ever overturned on review. At the federal level, the Supreme Court has sent very strong signals to lower courts that they are not to overturn agency decisions absent very strong evidence that the agency acted erroneously. A business manager would be foolish to treat administrative agencies lightly because he or she assumes that a reviewing court will correct any mistakes the agency might make. The ability of reviewing courts to overturn agency action is so limited that the only sensible strategy is to assume that a case must be won at the agency level or not at all.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Freedom of Information Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Federal Administrative Procedure Act gives individuals, businesses, and organizations a very powerful tool to use in obtaining information from government agencies--the Federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The FOIA gives unprecedented access to government information. Under FOIA, an agency must make available to the public:
<UL>
<LI>Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders made in the adjudication of cases
<LI>Statements of policy and interpretation adopted by the agency but not published in the Federal Register
<LI>Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public
This general list is only a starting point, however, as there are a number of specific exceptions to what agencies must provide to the public. An agency is not required to disclose:
<LI>National security information
<LI>Internal personnel rules and files
<LI>Information specifically exempted by another statute
<LI>Commercial information
<LI>Financial Information
<LI>Trade secrets
<LI>Inter- or intra-agency memoranda
<LI>Personnel, medical, or other files, the disclosure of which would violate personal privacy
<LI>Law enforcement and investigation files
<LI>Data about financial institutions
<LI>Geological and geophysical information on oil and natural gas wells
</UL>
The definition of agencies subject to the FOIA is quite broad and includes independent regulatory commissions, the executive office of the president, other executive departments, all government corporations, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
<P>
FOIA requests are usually made in writing to the agency. Most agencies process so many FOIA requests that they have designated an officer to process the requests. The Code of Federal Regulations publishes the names and addresses of FOIA contacts in many agencies. Procedures for seeing these documents are very informal and no written request is necessary. The party making the request is obligated to describe the records reasonably well and to pay photocopying and search fees. Frequently requested documents may be made available at established Information Reading Rooms.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Health Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Health law is a relatively new area of legal specialization. Many lawyers are attracted to this evolving area of practice. Their clients range from health care consumers seeking assistance to pay for health care to large corporate health care providers seeking to buy nursing homes. Because of the diversity of clients, the health law practice area has numerous subspecialties.
This chapter covers subjects of most interest to businesses and health care providers. Employee benefits plans are discussed in the <A HREF="b21.html">Employee Benefits Law</A> Chapter. Medical malpractice is discussed in the <A HREF="b32.html">Professional Malpractice Defense Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Access to the Health Care System</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The state of Illinois has many fine health care providers and facilities, yet Illinois residents may face a number of access hurdles before receiving treatment. Patients, their families, and health care institutions all need to be aware of the legal framework that exists to guarantee access to health care.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Paying for Health Care </STRONG></H3></A>
For some, the most important health care issue is paying for health care. Several government-sponsored health care programs, administered primarily by the Illinois Department of Public Aid, provide payments to health care providers. In most cases, medical professionals have a right to payment within 30 days.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Medicaid </STRONG></H4></A>
Medicaid should not be confused with Medicare. Despite their similar names, the two programs are different. Medicare, described below, is a program funded and administered entirely by the federal government to provide health care to elderly persons and people with disabilities. Medicare coverage is uniform throughout the country. Medicaid is a cooperative program funded partly by the federal government and partly by the individual states, and administered primarily by the states that provide health care to indigent persons. Each state has wide latitude to decide how Medicaid operates within the state. In Illinois, Medicaid is administered by the Illinois Department of Public Aid.
<P>
The federal government's role in Medicaid is quite limited. It pays a percentage of the cost of each state's health care program for indigent people and ensures that every state's program complies with various federal requirements. The amount of money a state receives from the federal government is called the Federal Financial Participation (FFP). Each state's FFP is determined by a formula based on the state's per capita income and the amount of medical services the state chooses to provide to needy people within the state.
<P>
To receive Medicaid, a person must have assets with a low value and very low income as determined by a complex formula. In Illinois, a person generally can have no more than $3,000 in assets and $591 income per month, although there is a complex formula applied which considers the applicant's unique situation. There are several assets the formula does not count, including:
<UL>
<LI>Homestead
<LI>Automobile necessary for employment or otherwise to produce income, to receive health care, or essential for transporting a person with disabilities
<LI>Income-producing property
<LI>Household goods and personal effects
</UL>
Certain other assets are not counted, such as jointly held real estate if the other joint owner refuses to sell, and property that is tied up in probate.
<P>
As long as transfers are compensated, it is legal to restructure one's assets and income with the intent of qualifying for Medicaid. A person whose income is above Medicaid limits might be able to qualify for Medicaid under a spend-down provision. The spend-down is equal to the amount a person's income is over Medicaid limits. Medicaid occasionally agrees to cover the amount that a person's medical bills exceed a patient's spend-down. Many senior citizens find restructuring assets to qualify for Medicaid to be an especially attractive option, because Medicaid coverage pays for a wider variety of nursing care services and for a longer period of time than Medicare.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Medicare </STRONG></H4></A>
Medicare--also called Medical Assistance in Illinois--is a federal program administered by the Social Security Administration designed to cover some basic medical and health care costs of eligible individuals over age 65, as well as many people with disabilities. Medicare has become an enormous federal program, providing billions of dollars in coverage every year.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG><EM>Medicare Parts A and B </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Medicare has two basic divisions, called Part A and Part B. Medicare Part A, commonly known as Hospital Insurance, covers medically necessary hospital and related health care. Included in Part A are costs for such expenses as inpatient hospital care necessitated by acute illness, skilled nursing home care, certified hospice care for the terminally ill, inpatient psychiatric care, and care in the home by a certified home health care provider.
<P>
Medicare Part B, commonly known as Medical Insurance, is a voluntary health insurance program designed to cover some of the costs not covered by Medicare Part A, such as outpatient hospital services, outpatient physical therapy, speech pathology services, necessary ambulance service, and medical equipment. Unlike Part A, which is paid for out of Social Security taxes and is free to anyone who qualifies, Part B is an optional program that carries a small monthly premium.
<P>
People qualify for Hospital Insurance when they turn 65 years old or if they are covered by Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits. The person need not actually be receiving financial benefits through either of these two programs in order to receive Medicare benefits. Anyone age 65 or older not eligible for Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits still may receive Medicare Part A coverage by paying a monthly premium. Medicare Part B coverage is available automatically to anyone who qualifies for Medicare Part A benefits. In fact, all applicants for Medicare Part A benefits are enrolled automatically in Medicare Part B unless they opt out of Part B coverage. The federal government contracts with private insurance companies to handle routine claims processing, payment, and other functions under Parts A and B.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG><EM>Costs Not Covered by Medicare </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Medicare never was intended to provide comprehensive coverage for all medical needs of America's elderly population, but rather was intended to supplement private resources. Many health services are not covered by Medicare. For example, Medicare does not pay for:
<UL>
<LI>Custodial care intended to help the patient with his or her daily living needs such as help with bathing, walking, or exercising by someone without medical training
<LI>Dentures or routine dental care
<LI>Eyeglasses, hearing aids, and examinations to prescribe or fit them
<LI>Nursing home care (except skilled nursing care)
<LI>Prescription drugs
<LI>Routine physical checkups and related tests
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Insurance Issues </STRONG></H4></A>
Many people look for some form of private insurance to supplement Medicare and other government-sponsored health coverage. Some people are insured through their jobs, and even when they retire may be able to get continuation or conversion coverage from these group policies. Others join Health Maintenance Organizations.
<P>
Another popular option in Illinois is coverage under the Illinois Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan. This program was intended as an alternative to traditional health insurance. It benefits Illinois residents who are refused health insurance by private health insurance companies, or who can obtain insurance but only at an excessive rate. The Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan provides coverage for medically necessary treatment such as hospital services.
<P>
In Illinois, two additional programs help older people and people with disabilities pay for their Medicare coverage. In order to be eligible for these programs, an individual must have assets of no more than $4,000 and must live in Illinois. The Qualified Medicare Beneficiary Program (QMB) assists those who have Part A Hospital Insurance and whose income is at 100 percent or less than the federal poverty level. The Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary Program (SLMB) covers Part B Medical Insurance for individuals with incomes between 100 percent and 110 percent of the poverty level. These programs are run by the Illinois Department of Public Aid.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Access to Facilities </STRONG></H3></A>
Hospitals rarely refuse to treat a patient if the patient has health care insurance, but sometimes hospitals do refuse to admit patients. Federal and state laws governing the medical industry clearly forbid health care providers from discriminating in deciding whom to treat. The Internal Revenue Service requires hospitals to admit all paying members of their communities in order to enjoy tax exempt status. The Hill-Burton Act, which provides construction grants for many hospital projects, requires hospitals receiving grants under its programs to admit all paying patients. Medicare and Medicaid require all participating hospitals to provide care to all covered patients.
<P>
Fortunately, most of these laws guaranteeing access to health care facilities are invoked infrequently. Most hospitals are eager to admit patients. Sometimes, however, because of prejudices or a hospital's concern about being reimbursed, Medicare or Medicaid recipients have more difficulty accessing hospitals. The AIDS epidemic has made accessibility an issue in some recent cases in which hospital decision makers were concerned with the potentially enormous costs of fighting the disease, worried about spreading the disease, or objected to the lifestyles they assumed AIDS sufferers led. Hospitals and other providers of health care should be aware of the laws in this area, and should know that refusing a person health care based on personal bias is illegal.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Health Care Providers' Responsibilities</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once a patient and a health care provider have formed a relationship inside the health care system, the law guarantees the patient certain rights and requires certain duties of the health care provider. In addition to a general right to good medical care, which includes being informed of who is treating the patient, the recipient of health care has a right under the Illinois Medical Patient Rights Act to exercise informed consent, to refuse treatment, to obtain certain information in writing, and to have medical records treated confidentially. Other laws require health care providers to be involved in reporting and preventing abuse. Illinois law penalizes health care providers who violate patients' rights. 
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Consent to Care </STRONG></H3></A>
In general, a doctor may not diagnose or treat a patient without obtaining that person's informed consent first. Informed consent means the person has given consent after receiving all relevant information about the treatment, including the risks. Failure to get informed consent for treatment can subject the doctor to charges of battery, invasion of privacy, or malpractice.
<P>
Under some circumstances, the patient's consent is not required. If the person cannot consent for himself or herself, a guardian or close relative may give permission for medical treatment. In an emergency, the head of a health care facility will consent to treatment if a patient's close relatives cannot be reached. A patient's consent to treatment will be implied if the patient is unable to give consent and an emergency exists or if the patient can give consent but the doctor does not have sufficient time to properly inform the patient of all risks and alternatives. A doctor need not obtain a client's consent to treat mental illness, mental retardation, or chemical dependency.
<P>
Minors generally need the approval of a parent or guardian to undergo a medical or surgical procedure. Exceptions to this rule are emergencies, certain reproductive matters, and testing and treatment for certain sexually-transmitted diseases.
<P>
Most doctors know they should not treat a patient without any permission, so disputes in this area rarely center on whether a doctor had permission. More often, disputes turn on whether the doctor disclosed sufficient information for the patient's consent to be informed or whether the doctor went beyond the consented actions.
<P>
To give informed consent in Illinois, a patient must be given information about the foreseeable results and risks of a particular procedure and the reasonable alternatives. The physician does not have to disclose every possible risk. It is up to the doctor to decide what to tell the patient, based on the patient's best interests. All of these must be communicated in language the patient is likely to understand.
<P>
Experimental procedures or research may not be performed on a patient without the patient's consent prior to the procedure or research. A patient's consent or refusal to participate in experimental procedures or research must be recorded in the patient's permanent record.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Right to Refuse Treatment </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois law also gives patients the right to refuse treatment or medication. Patients who refuse recommended treatments must be informed of the likely medical and psychological results of such refusal, and documentation must be placed in their records. The right of parents to refuse medical treatment for their children is more limited.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Written Information </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois law provides that patients have the right certain information in writing. Every patient has a right to a written bill for services. If the bill is not understandable, the patient has a right to an explanation. Any patient admitted to a hospital must receive a copy of the Medical Patient Rights Act, or a written statement summarizing the rights described in the law. If the patient is a minor, or cannot read the statement, the hospital must give the written information to the patient's parent, guardian, or representative.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>HIV Testing </STRONG></H3></A>
Clinics and hospitals in Illinois test patients for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Because of the discrimination many HIV-positive people face, there is concern for confidentiality and anonymity of the test. While all health care providers are required to respect a patient's confidentiality, some clinics are committed to anonymous testing. At these sites, fictitious names or code numbers are used to hide the patient's identity.
<P>
Anyone interested in providing HIV testing should understand the important distinction between anonymous testing and confidential testing. A test can be confidential yet still be recorded on a patient's permanent record. Anyone with access to that record, including doctors, insurance companies, and health departments can learn that the person was tested. If the testing is anonymous, no one at the testing site knows the person's true identity so the test never becomes part of the person's permanent medical record.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Confidentiality </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois law provides that health care providers must keep confidential patients' medical records and any information patients provide them. For example, Illinois Rules of Evidence prohibit the introduction in court of confidential communications between a patient and a health care provider. The public policy behind this rule is the promotion of complete communication between doctors and their patients. Under other Illinois laws, a health care provider must have the patient's consent to release records to a third person. This general law does not prevent a doctor from releasing records to another doctor in an emergency for the purpose of treating the patient. It also does not prevent the release of records to the Illinois Department of Public Health.
<P>
Both of these protections will be set aside if they conflict with other public policies. For example, a doctor who is told by a patient that the patient plans to kill a particular person has a legal obligation to warn that person. Also, doctors have an obligation to report to the police anyone who comes for treatment of a suspicious wound, such as a stab or gunshot wound. Confidentiality also may be relinquished by people who are HIV-positive. The State of Illinois requires that a diagnosis of HIV-positive status be reported to the State Department of Public Health.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Anatomical Gifts </STRONG></H3></A>
Many people want to donate their bodies to science when they die. Many human organs can be transplanted into another person, giving the recipient a chance at a longer or more productive life. A wide variety of institutions also need bodies and organs for scientific, medical, and educational purposes. Unfortunately, many potential transplant recipients and many scientific and educational institutions are unable to get sufficient donations because too few people are willing to donate or do not know how to make their wishes known. To solve this problem, Illinois adopted the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act to govern the donation of bodies and body parts for transplant, medical, and scientific purposes.
<P>
Under this law, a person of sound mind, who is at least 18 years of age, may donate all or part of his or her own body. There are several ways for a donor to record his or her wish to make a donation. The donor may make the donation a provision in a will. If it is part of a will, the provision becomes effective immediately upon death, unlike other provisions of the will, which need to go through probate before they become effective. A will is not the best place for a donation, however, because its terms may not be known immediately upon death. A more common form of recording one's wish to make a donation is through use of a donor card often carried in a wallet.
<P>
A written donation statement must be signed by the donor and witnessed by at least two other people. A donation also may be made orally. Oral donations are effective if witnessed by at least two other people. A dying patient may communicate his or wish to make a donation to an attending physician who will act as one of the required witnesses. The attending physician must not be the physician who removes or transplants the organ. An intent to make a gift can be revoked orally or in writing.
<P>
If a dying person is unable to communicate and has not made his or her wishes known, a family member or guardian can make a gift of all or part of another person's body. There are statutorily prescribed categories of people who are authorized to make the gift, including the spouse, an adult child, a parent, an adult sibling, or a guardian. The law provides the exact method of authorization, as well as how people may object to making a donation.
<P>
The law forbids the sale of body parts. The recipient may not pay for an anatomical gift but may pay for the actual cost of transportation and transplant.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Reporting Abuse </STRONG></H3></A>
By law, certain members of society, by virtue of their professions and positions, are required to report child abuse. Persons required to report abuse--known as mandatory reporters--include health care professionals, teachers, law enforcement officials, child care providers and social workers. Virtually anyone who works directly with children to provide care, protection, and supervision is required to report instances, actual or suspected, of child abuse.
<P>
Mandatory reporters are obligated to report any abuse or neglect immediately to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). Failure of a mandatory reporter to report suspected child abuse is a class A misdemeanor, unless the reporter is a physician, in which case the physician will be reported to the Illinois State Medical Disciplinary Board.
<P>
Persons who report abuse or neglect in good faith are immune from civil or criminal liability. This means that if an investigation shows there was no abuse, the reporter cannot be sued as long as he or she reported the alleged child abuse with an honest belief and without knowledge of any facts or events contradicting the abuse or neglect.
<P>
Child protective service workers must request information from a person reporting child abuse. To expedite the attention given to a child in an abusive or neglected situation, the reporter should have the following items ready for report:
<UL>
<LI>Names and addresses of the child and his or her parents or guardian
<LI>The age, race, and sex of the child
<LI>Events surrounding the known or suspected abuse, including the extent of injuries and any evidence of prior abuse
<LI>Names and addresses of the alleged abuser
<LI>Information about the family of the victim, including information about other children in the home
<LI>Name, occupation, and actions taken by the reporter
<LI>Any other information regarding the child or family that might be helpful
</UL>
The name of the individual reporting the abuse or neglect must be kept confidential by the DCFS and may only be released by consent of the reporter or by court order.
<P>
Health care providers also are required, under the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986, to assist suspected victims of abuse by offering immediate information about services available in Illinois. Victims covered under the Act include battered women and abused high-risk adults with disabilities. A high-risk adult with a disability is someone over the age of 18 who has a physical or mental disability that prevents the adult from being able to protect himself or herself. The definition includes elderly people with disabilities. Persons who may be liable for abusing high-risk adults with disabilities, include family or household members covered under the Act as well as other persons who have responsibility for these adults, including workers in hospitals, nursing homes, and similar care facilities. Abuse of high-risk adults with disabilities includes physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation, including financial exploitation. Neglect includes failure to provide food, shelter, clothing, personal hygiene, and medical care, unreasonable confinement, and failure to protect the high-risk adult from abuse or from other hazards to health or safety.
People who know of or suspect abuse or neglect may make a report of any known or suspected incidence of abuse or neglect to the Illinois Department on Aging.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Employee Health Care</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A business owner or manager may be quite concerned with understanding the complexities of employee health care and the many state and federal regulations governing it. As health care costs rise, many business owners have found it impossible to continue to give their employees the same level of benefits they once had. At the same time, individual health policies have become prohibitively expensive, leaving more than 34 Americans uninsured. Health care issues have become a major reason for strikes and other labor disputes. In addition, workers increasingly are pushing for health care reform from politicians. How these reforms progress and the shape they eventually assume will have a tremendous effect on businesses. Many employers, whether large or small, may wish to seek an attorney's help to keep track of the many changes taking place.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Immigration Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
For centuries, people from around the world have been coming to the United States. They come to work, get an education, escape oppression, start a new life, do business, visit friends, or sightsee. Over the years, the United States has seen tremendous diversity in the countries immigrants come from and their reasons for coming here. In response to the incredible demand for permission to enter this country, the federal government has established a complex set of laws that determines who may enter this country and for what reasons. This chapter discusses legal immigration and travel to the United States and the responsibilities of employers under these laws.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>United States Citizenship</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
United States citizens have a right to travel to and live in the United States and enjoy the fullest protection of United States laws. People who are not citizens of the United States usually must have a visa to enter and may not enjoy the protection of all United States laws.
<P>
A person can become a United States citizen either through birth or through a process known as naturalization. A person can be a United States citizen from birth either by being born here, or by being born in a foreign country but having a parent who is a citizen of the United States. Anyone born in the United States has automatic citizenship, regardless of the parents' citizenship, and even if both parents are living in this country illegally at the time of the child's birth. The only exception is that children born to foreign diplomats in the United States do not get automatic citizenship. Anyone not born a citizen must be naturalized to become a citizen. Occasionally, a group of people is naturalized by treaty or by act of Congress. Usually, a person goes through the process individually.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Aliens, Immigrants, Nonimmigrants, and Residents</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An alien is a citizen of any country other than the United States. A person who comes here to stay permanently is called an immigrant. Someone who intends to return to his or her country of origin is called a nonimmigrant, even if he or she intends to stay for a substantial period of time. For example, a student might stay in the United States many years to complete an education and still be considered a nonimmigrant. The distinction between immigrant and nonimmigrant is crucial. Permission to enter as a nonimmigrant often is easier to get than permission to enter as an immigrant, so some people are tempted to claim they intend to return to their home country in order to enter this country. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is aware of this temptation and often will deny a nonimmigrant visa application to anyone suspected of wanting to remain permanently. Also, being granted a nonimmigrant visa sometimes can make it more difficult to get an immigrant visa later. A permanent resident is an alien who has been given permission to live permanently in the United States.
<P>
In a dispute with the INS over an applicant's true intent, the applicant always bears the burden of proving intent to remain here temporarily. For some people, this burden is nearly impossible to overcome. For example, the spouse of a permanent resident normally must wait over two years for available immigrant visas. If he or she claims to want to visit only temporarily, he or she must overcome the presumption that a married person would want to remain permanently with his or her spouse.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>The Visa System</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A visa is a stamp in a person's passport that gives him or her conditional approval to enter the United States. Most matters involving visas are handled by the INS. Most aliens apply for visas from a consulate or embassy of the United States in the alien's home country.
<P>
Citizens of some countries, primarily European countries and Japan, may enter the United States for up to 90 days without a visa. To be eligible, citizens of these countries must show the INS that they have a return ticket home and that they intend to engage in a type of business or tourist activity that would be allowed under a "B Visa," described below. Canadian citizens generally do not need visas to enter temporarily. In some instances, they must obtain INS approval in advance if they are coming here to work.
<P>
Congress establishes a complex set of quotas that limits the number of visas that can be granted for most types of visas. Whether an applicant receives a visa depends on the type of visa requested, the applicant's reason for traveling to the United States, and the applicant's country of origin. Probably the most important element to obtaining a visa successfully is knowing for which visa category to apply. For certain categories of visas and certain countries of origin, an applicant can wait many years before he or she even will be considered for a visa. Sometimes the wait would be much shorter if the applicant applied for a different type of visa. Unfortunately, once an applicant applies for one type of visa, it can be difficult to change the application to another class of visa. For this reason, it is wise to consult an immigration attorney before applying for any kind of visa.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Nonimmigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
There are different kinds of nonimmigrant visas, identified by the letters A­R, available for persons who do not intend to remain in the United States permanently. All nonimmigrant visas are based on what the applicant intends to do in this country. It is important that employers be aware of the variety of visas that exist. Following is a list of the categories of visas available.

<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Immigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
An applicant who intends to stay in this country permanently generally is admitted either on the basis of employment or family connections. The main exception is for political asylum seekers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Employment-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can receive permission to immigrate to this country on the basis of his or her employment. There are five categories of employment, known as preferences, through which aliens can be permitted to immigrate.
<P>
<STRONG>First Preference</STRONG>: Individuals of extraordinary ability, outstanding professors or researchers, and multinational executives.
<P>
<STRONG>Second Preference</STRONG>: Professionals with advanced degrees and aliens with exceptional abilities in science, art, or business. (Note: "Exceptional ability" is a different standard than "extraordinary ability" required for a first preference.)
<P>
<STRONG>Third Preference</STRONG>: Skilled workers, professionals, and other workers for which there is a shortage of workers in the United States.
<P>
<STRONG>Fourth Preference</STRONG>: Certain special workers, such as religious workers.
<P>
<STRONG>Fifth Preference</STRONG>: Investors creating employment for workers in the United States; the investment must be substantial (i.e., between $500,000 and $1,000,000).
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Family-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can get a visa as an immediate relative of a United States citizen if he or she is a child, spouse, or parent of the citizen. In addition, there are four family-based immigrant visa categories: 
<P> 
<STRONG>First Preference</STRONG>: Unmarried children of United States citizens.
<P>
<STRONG>Second Preference</STRONG>: Spouses and unmarried children of lawful permanent residents.
<P>
<STRONG>Third Preference</STRONG>: Married children of United States citizens.
<P>
<STRONG>Fourth Preference</STRONG>: Siblings of adult United States citizens.
<P>
Each preference is allotted a total number of visas. Generally speaking, the higher the applicant's preference, the shorter the wait to get a visa.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Special Classes of Immigrants </STRONG></H4></A>
Some groups of immigrants receive special treatment and fall outside the preference system described above. Diversity immigrants are immigrants from countries deemed under-represented in the pool of applicants for visas throughout the years. Under a new program implemented by the INS in 1995 a certain number of visas will be granted to applicants from low-admission countries and who have a high school education or two years of training or experience in a particular occupation.
<P>
Refugees and asylees also receive special treatment. A person is a refugee if he or she is outside the United States, is fleeing or has fled his or her country, and has a well-founded fear that if returned to the home country, he or she will be persecuted because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An asylee is an alien already in the United States who, like a refugee, has a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to his or her home country. The President and Congress decide each year the total number of refugees and asylees to accept into the country. Occasionally, Congress grants immigrant visas allotted for individuals from specific countries according to political factors. Recent programs have included China, Hong Kong, and Tibet.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Entry and Exclusion</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A visa only gives conditional approval to enter the country. Once an alien arrives in the United States with a visa, he or she must apply for entry from INS officials at the point of entry. For most aliens, this is a mere formality, but INS can exclude persons with valid visas for a variety of reasons, including communicable diseases, physical or mental disorders that pose a threat to others, drug addiction, or criminal history. Involvement in espionage or terrorist activity against the United States government or its people is grounds for exclusion. The Secretary of State also has broad discretion to bar entry of anyone whose presence would have an adverse effect on the foreign policy of the United States. Sometimes waivers are available for aliens who otherwise would be denied entry for certain reasons. For example, the child of a United States citizen may be granted a waiver to enter to receive treatment for drug addiction.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Getting a Green Card and Becoming a Naturalized Citizen</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Becoming a permanent resident is the first step that an alien must take to become a naturalized American citizen. People with permission to live in the United States permanently are issued "green cards" that allow them to work with few restrictions. A permanent resident can apply to become a naturalized citizen after five years, or three years if married to a United States citizen.
The INS is diligent in investigating marriages between United States citizens and aliens to ensure that aliens do not become permanent residents through sham marriages. Immigration law specifies that an alien seeking permanent residence based on a marriage to a United States citizen of less than two years first is granted conditional permanent resident status. After two years, the husband and wife must apply to the INS to remove this conditional status.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Deportation</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Deportation is the expulsion of an alien who entered illegally, or entered legally but has done something to become deportable. With few exceptions, any violation of the conditions of a visa, no matter how minor, is grounds for deportation to a person's country of origin. Conviction for any crime but the most minor also is grounds for deportation. Deportation can delay an alien whose long-term goal is to live permanently in this country. After being deported, aliens are forbidden to re-enter the country for five years. Aliens deported for aggravated felonies, such as drug smuggling, are barred from re-entry for 20 years or may be barred permanently. The delay in returning to the United States may be even greater for aliens from countries with long waiting lists. Returning home under a deportation order may result in the embassy's refusal to entrust the individual with another temporary visa.
<P>
There are a number of remedies to deportation, especially if the deportable person has lived in the United States for a long time, building a life that demonstrates good moral character. Even if the deportable individual has not been here long, there may be certain waivers or defenses to deportation. Among the most common is asking the court for "voluntary departure," which allows the individual to depart the United States on his or her own.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Business Concerns with Immigration Law</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Businesses often recruit foreign citizens with specialized skills to come to the United States and work for their companies. As discussed earlier in the description of visa categories, whether an employee can get a work visa depends, to a great extent, on his or her skills. Some immigration lawyers specialize in helping businesses meet the legal requirements for prospective employees to work in the United States.
<P>
All employers must verify that all employees are legally authorized to work in the United States, according to federal immigration laws. This verification is accomplished by having an employee complete an immigration document, known as Form I-9, at the time of hiring. If employers fail to verify that employees are eligible to work in the United States, they may be subject to warnings, penalties, fines, and even criminal prosecution. However, employers must also be careful that their procedure for verifying legal authorization does not discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, or citizenship status. Employers cannot hold a certain group of employees to tighter scrutiny than other employees, and they should not take national origin or citizenship status into account when making hiring decisions. There are a number of traps into which an employer might fall if procedures are not carefully established and implemented. For example, some employers have been fined for applying stricter application procedures to job applicants who did not speak English, were members of minority groups, or who had not lived in the United States for long. An experienced immigration attorney can advise an employer on how to establish procedures that verify the legal status of all employees without illegally discriminating.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>International Business Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The days when international transactions and business deals were only the realm of huge multinational corporations are over. Today even sole proprietorships are licensed to buy or sell products and services across national boundaries. There is no simple way to sum up all of the regulations a company might encounter doing business abroad. At a minimum, a United States company involved in an international business transaction will be bound by regulations of the United States (the home country), regulations of the country in which the business is conducted (the host country), and international regulations, which are derived from a variety of sources.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Home Country Laws</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The United States has many laws governing international transactions in goods and services. Among these laws are export controls, import controls, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Export Controls </STRONG></H3></A>
Generally speaking, federal regulations make it much easier for businesses to export than to import. Exports commonly are thought to be beneficial for the domestic economy so the government does not want to impede them. Most government involvement in exports is for the purpose of encouraging a greater volume of exports to existing trade partners, tearing down barriers to United States exports, and helping businesses find new markets for their products. Nonetheless, sometimes controls are placed on exports to protect national security, advance foreign policy, or protect the domestic economy from the drain of materials in short supply. Export controls include the requirement that a business acquire a license to export certain items that are sensitive, highly technological, or that might be used for military or other strategic purposes.
<P>
Most export controls are overseen by the Bureau of Export Administration, an arm of the United States Department of Commerce. Department of Commerce officials are an excellent source of information on compliance with general export regulations and licensing procedures.
Certain classes of exports administered by other federal agencies include:
<UL>
<LI>Endangered fish, wildlife, and birds such as bald eagles and golden eagles (Department of the Interior)
<LI>Tobacco seed or any live tobacco product (Department of Agriculture)
<LI>Arms, ammunition, instruments of war (Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls)
<LI>Narcotics and dangerous drugs (Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration)
</UL>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Import Controls </STRONG></H3></A>
As mentioned above, the federal government offers substantially more help to exporters than it offers to importers. A bewildering variety of government agencies are involved in one or more aspects of United States import policies and it may be difficult to determine which agency or agencies need to approve an import to bring it into the country legally.
<P>
The United States Customs Service assesses and collects duties, taxes, and fees on most imported goods, enforces customs and related laws, and administers certain navigation laws and treaties. The Customs Service publishes several general guides to help importers understand United States import regulations, which are available from regional offices.
<P>
A number of imports are subject to special treatment by other federal agencies before they may be brought into this country.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Agricultural Products </STRONG></H4></A>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG><EM>Dairy </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Most dairy products--including cheese and milk--are required to have special import licenses, and are subject to quotas administered by the Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service. Milk and cream imports also must meet the requirements of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Import Milk Act. Milk and cream importers need permits from the Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, and the Department of Agriculture.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG><EM>Agricultural Commodities </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Many agricultural commodities--such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts--must meet detailed import requirements related to size, grade, quality, and maturity. Commodities must pass inspection before they are allowed into the United States. Inspection certificates are issued by the Food Safety and Quality Service of the Department of Agriculture. The Agriculture Marketing Service of the Department of Agriculture answers general inquiries about importing fruits, vegetables, and nuts.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG><EM>Insects </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
All insects that could be harmful to domestic crops or trees are forbidden entry into the United States unless they are for scientific research. Other insects may be imported only with special approval from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG><EM>Livestock </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service imposes a variety of inspection and quarantine requirements on most livestock and animal by-products. Permits for import into the United States must be obtained before the item is shipped from its country of origin. Only certain ports of entry into the United States are set up to handle animal inspection and quarantine, so arrangements for import must be made well in advance to ensure that a desired point of entry can perform the appropriate inspection and quarantine. Exceptions to most of these inspection and quarantine requirements are available for imports from Canadian provinces and certain northern Mexican states.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG><EM>Meat </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Commercial shipments of meat and meat products are regulated by the Department of Agriculture and must be inspected by its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service as well as its Food Safety and Inspection Service before they are permitted entry into the United States. Noncommercial shipments of meat are regulated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which is enforced by the Food and Drug Administration.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG><EM>Plants </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The Department of Agriculture regulates the importation of plants and plant products. Certain endangered species may require special inspection and approval or may be denied entry altogether.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG><EM>Poultry </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Import of poultry and poultry products, including eggs, is controlled by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Food Safety and Quality Service of the Department of Agriculture. Permits, special markings, labeling, and in some cases foreign inspection certificates are required.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG><EM>Seeds </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Import of seeds is governed by the Federal Seed Act of 1939 and regulations of the Agricultural Marketing Service of the Department of Agriculture.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Arms, Ammunition, and Radioactive Materials </STRONG></H4></A>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG><EM>Arms, Ammunition, Explosives, and Instruments of War </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Import of arms, ammunition, explosives, and instruments of war is severely limited. These items may be brought into the United States only with express permission and license of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of the Department of the Treasury. Even temporary importation or transit across the territory of the United States is prohibited without a license from the Office of Munitions Control, Department of State.
<P>
Most radioactive materials are subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. License to import these items into the United States is granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Consumer Products </STRONG></H4></A>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG><EM>Appliances </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Household appliances must meet energy efficiency standards set by the Department of Energy, Consumer Products Efficiency Branch before they may be brought into the country. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission, Division for Energy and Product Information sets standards for labeling household appliances. Importers intending to bring any common household appliance into the United States should contact both of these agencies for the requirements in effect at the desired date of import.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG><EM>Flammable Fabrics </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Fabrics intended for wearing apparel or interior decoration must meet strict standards for non-flammability set by the United States Consumer Products Safety Commission. Some products that do not meet these standards may be brought into the country with special permission, provided they are intended for finishing or processing that will make them meet federal non-flammability standards.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG><EM>Radiation-Producing Products </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Many radiation-producing products--such as television sets, microwave ovens, sunlamps, and ultrasound equipment--are subject to radiation performance standards set by the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968. Any product with a performance standard set by the Act may be imported into the United States only with the permission of the Food and Drug Administration, National Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="200"><H4><STRONG><EM>Radio Frequency Emitting Devices </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Radios, televisions, tape recorders, and other radio frequency emitting devices may be imported only with documentation from the Federal Communications Commission that they are in conformity with, will soon be in conformity with, or are exempt from, the agency's requirements.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="210"><H4><STRONG>Food, Drugs, Cosmetics, and Medical Products </STRONG></H4></A>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="220"><H4><STRONG><EM>Food and Cosmetics </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Import of most food, beverages, and cosmetics is controlled by the Food and Drug Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services. Products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration are subject to inspection, and possible detention, at the border. Prohibited products are any products that are defective, unsafe, filthy, produced under unsanitary conditions, or branded in such a way that they are false, misleading, or improperly labeled. Seafood is subject to additional standards set by the National Marine Fisheries Service of the Department of Commerce.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="230"><H4><STRONG><EM>Biological Drugs </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Import of biological products for human use is regulated by the Public Health Service Act. Foreign producers intending to send their products to the United States must obtain licenses both for facilities and for individual shipments from the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services. Biological drugs for animal use are regulated by the Virus Serum Toxin Act, which is enforced by the Department of Agriculture. The Virus Serum Toxin Act requires special permits and labels before biological drugs for animal use may be imported into the United States.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="240"><H4><STRONG><EM>Drug Paraphernalia </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Import of drug paraphernalia is prohibited under the United States Code. Penalties for illegal import of drug paraphernalia include both jail time and fines. Prohibited items include water pipes, roach clips, miniature spoons, bongs, and cocaine freebase kits.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="250"><H4><STRONG>Gold, Silver, Currency, and Stamps </STRONG></H4></A>
Import of gold and silver is subject to detailed quality and marking regulations established by the National Stamping Act and enforced by the Department of Justice. Anyone importing into the United States or receiving from overseas more than $10,000 in monetary instruments, including currency, travelers checks, money orders, and negotiable instruments or investment securities, must file a report of the transaction with the Customs Service at the point of entry. It is illegal to import facsimiles of United States postage stamps, unless they are intended for philatelic, educational, historical, or newsworthy purposes. The Department of the Treasury regulates this area.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="260"><H4><STRONG>Pesticides, and Toxic and Hazardous Substances </STRONG></H4></A>
Pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, and rodenticides are governed by the Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1947 and the Federal Environment Pesticide Control Act of 1972. Import of these substances must be registered with the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances. Registration may be completed in advance of shipment. If the shipment is approved by the Agency, the Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances provides the importer with a Notice of Arrival that must be presented to Customs Service officials in order for the items to be released from custody.
<P>
Several federal regulations govern import of hazardous substances packaged for household use. Marking, labeling, and packaging regulations are enforced by the Department of Transportation, Office of Hazardous Materials Transportation. The Toxic Substances Control Act regulates imports of chemical substances that pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Customs officers are required to impound all imports of toxic substances until the importer shows proof of compliance with or exemption from the requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="270"><H4><STRONG>Textiles, Wool, and Fur </STRONG></H4></A>
Textile fiber products imported into the United States are subject to identification and marking requirements set forth in the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act. Wool products are regulated by the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939. The Act requires most wool imports to be clearly labeled to show the total wool weight and content of the product. Most fur imports are subject to regulation under the Fur Products Labeling Act. Information on these Acts and the regulations promulgated under them is available from the Federal Trade Commission.
<P>
<A NAME="280"><H3><STRONG>Voluntary Restraint Agreements </STRONG></H3></A>
Voluntary restraint agreements limit exports to the United States of certain products from certain countries. Voluntary restraint agreements are reached through trade negotiations between the United States government and representatives of foreign countries. An example of such an agreement is the limit on steel and machine tools manufactured in Japan and South Korea.
The Department of Commerce administers programs created under such agreements. An export certificate or license from the country of origin is required before any item subject to such an agreement is permitted entry into the United States.
<P>
<A NAME="290"><H3><STRONG>Foreign Corrupt Practices Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a federal law that forbids any citizen or resident of the United States from giving or offering to give gifts, bribes, or anything of value to a foreign official or political figure in an attempt to influence a decision. Although the text and intent of the FCPA are quite simple, the FCPA has been criticized by many United States business leaders as an unnecessary handicap to business efforts abroad. They argue the FCPA is an awkward, even elitist, attempt to impose United States values onto foreign transactions, despite cultural differences. The law itself recognizes the difficulty of imposing ethical standards in other countries, as evidenced by an exception for payments made to foreign government officials if the money or goods are "facilitative payments for routine government action." What constitutes "facilitative payments" or what type of actions are "routine government actions" is unclear. Business leaders concerned with how a transaction might be viewed under the FCPA should consult legal counsel experienced in this area.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="300"><H2><STRONG>Host Country Laws</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Because there are so many countries, each with unique import and export laws, corporate structures, and cultural norms, this chapter can offer only a brief sketch of where and how international businesses most likely will encounter the legal systems of other countries.
<P>
Each host country has its own laws that United States companies must obey when doing business there. These laws may create tax consequences, restrict the movement of capital, govern mergers, or require financial disclosure. Some host country laws have serious potential consequences. For instance, in some countries a company's capital and property can be nationalized with few, if any, due process protections. Businesspersons from the United States trying to establish businesses in Russia have experienced firsthand how difficult it can be to try to conduct business in a country where laws and monetary exchange rates sometimes change dramatically from day to day.
<P>
The United States Department of Commerce operates a National Trade Data Bank, which collects information on trade with specific countries. It also operates a Trade Information Center, which provides information for businesses wanting to do business overseas, and has numerous country desk officers who specialize in advising businesses and individuals on a particular country's economy, trade policies, political situation, and United States government policies toward that country.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="310"><H2><STRONG>International Law</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A variety of international codes, laws, and treaties regulate international sales, such as the Convention on International Sale of Goods. In addition, there are codes of conduct for international businesses that, although not enforced by any one legal body, generally are adhered to by parties actively engaged in international business.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="320"><H2><STRONG>International Contract Considerations</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As in domestic business transactions, contracts are the basis on which international trade is conducted. Many of the contracts entered into are similar to those used in every domestic business, such as employment contracts, distributorship contracts, and purchasing contracts. However, there are some issues that are of particular concern in the international arena. For example, international contracts usually specify which language will be used to conduct business and specify a set rate of exchange between currencies. In addition, because international business dealings involve governmental regulation at several levels, it is common to include a government approval clause in contracts. Such a clause states which partner in the contract is responsible for obtaining any governmental permission needed for the transaction.
<P>
Contracts also provide for the handling of any disputes that may arise between the parties. A contract may specify that parties will attempt arbitration before a lawsuit is filed. Contracts also include provisions governing choice of forum (country with jurisdiction in case of a dispute) and choice of law (which jurisdiction's laws will be followed to settle a grievance).
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="330"><H2><STRONG>International Letters of Credit</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Unlike domestic transactions in which the buyer and seller typically know each other or have access to reliable financial data about one another, in many international transactions the buyer and seller may not know each other and may have a difficult time learning more about each other. The seller may not know how creditworthy a buyer is or how shifts in exchange rates could alter the terms of the agreement. A buyer may not know the seller's reputation for quality and timeliness or whether the seller will be able to handle customs formalities sufficiently well to ship the product to the buyer.
<P>
In some international negotiations, a letter of credit may help facilitate the transaction. The term "letter of credit" actually is a shorthand way of referring to a complex set of agreements and documents in which a bank assumes responsibility for paying the seller and for assuring that goods are shipped properly. In a typical letter of credit transaction the buyer contracts with its bank to issue a letter of credit to the seller. The letter of credit is a promise from the bank to pay the specified amount to the seller if, and only if, the seller produces adequate documentation (such as invoices, bills of lading, and inspection certificates) proving that goods were shipped properly and will be received as agreed upon. The buyer and its bank make a separate arrangement between them so the bank is reimbursed. In some transactions the seller's bank also will be involved in guaranteeing payment.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Securities &amp; Venture Finance Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

A brand new business that survives more than a few years is bucking the odds. The vast majority of new businesses do not reach their first anniversary and only a handful reach their fifth. Lenders are keenly aware of these statistics, and thus they view funding startup businesses as highly risky. Conventional banks generally are wary of lending money to new businesses and usually require a large capital investment by the prospective business owner as well as a personal guarantee from him or her to repay the loan if the business cannot. In practice, securing money for a new venture largely depends on what owners can raise on their own. There are two basic ways for a new business to raise money--borrowing money and selling shares of ownership in the company. The following is a discussion of some options for those looking to finance new ventures.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Securities</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An option for business owners in need of capital but unable or unwilling to go into debt is to sell equity stakes in the business. Securities such as stocks and bonds are different from other commodities because they have no value by themselves. Rather, they are evidence of a debt owed to their holder. They are written secured promises to pay back money or other payment. All offerings of securities can be placed into one of two categories depending on the regulations that govern them. Securities that are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 are called private placements, while all other sales of securities are called public placements. Although the majority of business issue securities are exempt from registration requirements, it can be very difficult to discern whether a specific business is exempt.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Stocks and Bonds </STRONG></H3></A>
There are two different types of securities: stocks and bonds. Bonds are documents that signify a debt owed. Selling a bond is like a loan agreement in which the bond holder is promised the return of the original sum loaned out plus interest over time. Generally, a bond is secured with collateral, which ensures that the debt will be satisfied even in the case of default by the party that issued the bond.
<P>
Stocks signify an equity or ownership interest in a company. The unit of ownership is the share, and the holder of one or more shares in a company has some say in how the company is run, how profits are spent, and how the company's assets should be divided upon dissolution of the company. Some companies distribute profits to shareholders by paying dividends. Other corporations reinvest the profits within the business, thereby theoretically increasing the value of the stock.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Securities Markets </STRONG></H3></A>
The vehicles through which sales and purchases of securities are conducted are called securities markets. These markets do not necessarily have a physical location; sometimes they are just informal networks through which buyers and sellers of securities make transactions. The largest securities market--in terms of the value traded--is the bond market. The bond market is the means through which the United States government, state and local governments, and corporations borrow money from the public. Because bonds generally are less attractive to individual buyers and are more likely to be purchased by professional investors, bond markets are less widely regulated than are markets for common stock.
<P>
There are two kinds of markets for stocks--over-the-counter markets and exchange markets. An over-the-counter market is the less rigid of the two. This type of market exists via a network of transactions, with no permanent physical location. Instead, the market uses telephone and computer connections. This kind of market allows a wider variety of firms to participate in the trading of securities.
<P>
Exchange markets differ from over-the-counter markets in several important ways. Exchange markets operate in a facility in which actual transactions occur between parties on a trading floor. The New York Stock Exchange is the largest such exchange. Exchange markets differ further from over-the-counter markets in that they operate under stricter guidelines that govern who may and may not trade on the exchange. The distinction between over-the-counter and exchange markets is blurring because of new technologies which call into question the need for "floor" trading.
<P>
A securities firm makes its money in several different ways. In an exchange transaction, the firm charges a commission on the purchase or sale of the stock. In the case of over-the-counter stock, a firm is hired to create a market for a certain stock. In this case, the firm will sell the stock to customers at a price higher than the sale price to other brokers. The firm makes its profit from the difference between its cost for the stock and the price of stock as offered to the public.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Private Placements </STRONG></H3></A>
Private placements or offerings are sales of securities that are not subject to requirements for registration under the Securities Act of 1933. As these exemptions are fairly complex, and the punishment for breaking securities regulations are severe, legal advice from an expert in the field of securities regulation is highly recommended for business people with an interest in private placements.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Initial Public Offerings </STRONG></H3></A>
A business "goes public" when it solicits or concludes a sale of securities from a group of public investors. Although there are exemptions available under both federal and state laws, public offerings generally must comply with registration requirements set forth by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and state authorities. An initial public offering, often referred to as an IPO, is the first such public sale by an organization.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Regulation </STRONG></H3></A>
Largely because of the nature of securities--they do not have a value in and of themselves and therefore can be created and sold in unlimited amounts--there has developed a fairly sophisticated network of laws governing their use and sale. Securities law is governed by both state and federal laws, but all these laws have four main purposes:
<UL>
<LI>To ensure that investors have an accurate idea of what (and how much) they are getting when they purchase securities
<LI>To ensure disclosure of information concerning corporations or other entities that are trading in securities
<LI>To prevent fraud, insider trading, abuse of non-public information, or other price manipulation
<LI>To govern those who buy and sell securities on the secondary market to investors
</UL>
Securities regulations can be extremely technical. A business seeking to issue securities to finance its business should consult an expert. If the business is not exempt from registration, meeting the registration requirements can be quite expensive. On the other hand, public placements offer distinct advantages over private placements. Though complicated, securities regulations protect the investor or buyer of the securities. For this reason, sales of securities in violation of state and federal rules are subject to strict civil and criminal penalties, even if the violations are inadvertent or the result of ignorance.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Federal Laws </STRONG></H4></A>
There are a number of federal laws upon which much of the regulation of the sale of securities is based. The Securities Act of 1933 deals with the initial public offering of securities. The aim of this legislation is to prohibit fraud or deception in the sale of the securities by providing for full disclosure of facts concerning the securities for sale and the business and finances of the issuer. 
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulates trading in the secondary market. Like the earlier Securities Act of 1933, it requires disclosure of information about the offering. This Act established the Securities and Exchange Commission, the principal regulatory body policing securities markets. It also instituted several other restrictions on publicly held corporations, such as a restriction on the amount of credit that can be extended for the purchase of securities. The Act further requires brokers, dealers, and businesses that deal in securities to register with the SEC. It was amended in 1975 to give the government even broader powers over securities exchange and the structure of the market system.
<P>
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 regulates public issues of large securities. The Investment Company Act of 1940 regulates publicly owned businesses that deal primarily in the buying and selling of securities. The Investors Advisers Act of 1940 sets down rules for the registration and regulation of investment advisors, similar to those used in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 established the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which has the authority to oversee the liquidation of securities firms and to pay off debts owed to their customers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Illinois Laws </STRONG></H4></A>
In addition to federal securities laws, there are state securities laws, generally referred to as "blue sky laws." Like the federal laws, blue sky laws provide for registration of brokers and dealers, require information to be made available about securities open for trading, and also mandate penalties for fraudulent or deceptive practices.
<P>
The Illinois securities laws are administered by the Secretary of State. Alleged violators of Illinois securities law may be sued through the Office of the Attorney General, Secretary of State. Penalties include restraining orders, injunctions, and return of all unlawful sales, including profits made. Unlawful sales are voidable and can allow the purchaser to sue the seller for the value of the security plus interest. In addition, sellers of unlawful securities may be held criminally liable, subject to imprisonment, fines or both.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Registration of Securities </STRONG></H4></A>
Sale of securities, unless exempt, are unlawful unless the securities are properly registered with both the federal SEC and the Illinois Department of Commerce. In addition, Illinois regulates the registration of dealers, salespersons and investment advisors. Some of the broker-dealer issues regulated by blue sky laws include bonds and net capital, financial statements and reports, escrow agreements, advertising, service of process, appeals, takeover disclosures, insurance securities, and legal investments. Applicants for registration may be able to waive the examination requirements. Filing for registration must be done through the Illinois Secretary of State, or through the Central Registration Depository.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Exemptions </STRONG></H4></A>
Exemptions from many rules are available under both federal and state laws. The burden of proving an exemption is on the person raising it as a defense. If a security is exempt, it need not comply with the registration requirements. Dealers can apply for secondary trading authorization on Illinois Form 4(F)(2).
<P>
A limited offering (issuance of securities within a 12-month period) is exempt if made to not more than 35 residents of Illinois or if the aggregate price of the securities sold within the state does not exceed $100,000. A sale of securities to a relative, spouse or relative of the spouse will be deemed a sale to an additional purchaser.
<P>
Securities listed on the American, New York, Pacific Coast, Midwest and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges and the Chicago Board Options Exchange are exempt. Further, securities satisfying the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation National Market System are exempt from registration.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Filing Fees </STRONG></H4></A>
There is a non-refundable registration fee of 0.005 percent of the aggregate price of the securities registered for sale in Illinois. There are three different types of registration:  coordination, qualification and shelf registration. For securities to be eligible for registration by coordination, the issuer must meet the requirements specified by the Secretary of State. For registration by qualification, an issuer must file an application and fee with the Secretary of State. Any shelf offering by a single issuer can be registered for a one-time 12-month period. Offerings made by a series of issuers must be registered under separate applications. The minimum registration fee is $50 for any type of registration. The maximum fee is $2,500 for coordination, $1,500 for qualification and $600 for shelf registration. Issuers of face amount certificates are charged an additional annual fee of $1,000.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Debt Financing</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Selling securities is difficult and highly regulated. The cost of meeting these regulations, as well as the difficulty in convincing buyers that a business is a good investment, makes offering securities impractical for many startup companies. Another way of selling ownership in a company--by admitting partners into the deal for a cost (called a limited liability company)--is an option, but a business owner must be willing to forgo some of the profits and must convince prospective members they will make money. Further limiting the appeal of memberships in limited liability companies is the fact that they are not freely transferable to third parties. Thus, it is a somewhat easier task to raise money through debt financing from a bank, credit corporation, or local or state loan program. There are various ways a business can go about finding venture capital from public and private sources.
<P>
Anyone trying to use a lender to raise money for a new business will need to give a prospective lender detailed information about the form the new company will take. At a minimum, a prospective business owner will have to provide information about his or her current financial situation, including all business and personal assets and debts. Also, an applicant must be prepared to provide information about how the money requested will be spent and a full description of the intent of the business, along with information about the experience and management capabilities of the owner and those expected to be employed in top positions. A lender also will want to know how much money the owner plans to invest in the business and any projections of how much the business is expected to earn in its first year.
<P>
Retail and service-oriented businesses often have more difficulty obtaining financing because the funding for these types of businesses is used for expenses such as inventory, fixtures, and working capital--collateral that usually does not meet a lender's criteria for resale recovery. Often, these endeavors are financed primarily, if not fully, through equity. With that background in mind, following are various types of debt financing options that are available.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Conventional Bank Loans </STRONG></H3></A>
Bank loans are a common way of financing new ventures. The most advantageous to young businesses, but toughest to obtain, are unsecured loans. These are usually available only for short-term loans to borrowers with strong balance sheets, ample cash flow, and a low debt-to-equity ratio. Unsecured loans are usually made for less than one year, and the interest rate is based on the size of the loan, the financial health of the borrower, and the type of industry or business in which the borrower engages. Easier to obtain are a variety of secured loans, which can be structured in a variety of ways and which can give the lender a security interest in accounts receivable, inventory, or raw materials.
<P>
It is almost impossible to finance a business with 100 percent debt. Cautious bankers--and bankers are a cautious bunch--typically require that at least half of the startup costs be covered by the owner, and nearly any source of financing will require at least a 20 percent equity stake by the owner.
<P>
As noted above, financiers are more willing to provide funding for projects in which there is collateral that can be easily sold if necessary to recoup their investment. Thus, manufacturing and industrial operations historically are easier ventures to finance than retail and service businesses.
<P>
A bank is a corporation that earns money by maintaining savings and checking accounts, issuing loans and credit, and dealing in negotiable securities for governments and corporations. Banks invest the money entrusted to them by their customers. The investments that banks are allowed to make are regulated, and banks are defined by the limitations put upon them. The types of banks (in order from least to most regulated) are commercial banks, savings banks, and savings and loans.
Commercial banks are the most common and least regulated type of bank. These banks must have more deposits on hand than other types of banks in order to handle the daily transactions of the bank and prevent a money shortage (and the panic that can result). These types of banks are often publicly held corporations.
<P>
Savings banks are a rarer form of bank, although they are fairly common in the midwest. These are limited-service banks that were originally formed to encourage people to save their money. To this end, savings banks traditionally offered as their major service "time" savings accounts that prevented withdrawal of deposited money until a set period of time had elapsed. In modern times, the services of this type of bank have expanded somewhat. A business person looking for a lender should note that a savings bank sometimes offers higher interest rates on accounts than a commercial bank. This is because a savings bank does not have to keep as high a portion of its deposits in reserve as commercial banks. Savings banks are usually owned in the form of a partnership of depositors who receive dividends in the form of interest on their accounts.
The third type of bank is a savings and loan association. Despite news of scandals and problems in recent years, savings and loan banks traditionally have been highly regulated, conservative organizations whose primary purpose--other than encouraging savings--is to provide loans for homes and businesses.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Asset-Based Lenders </STRONG></H3></A>
Asset-based lenders use assets as collateral to lend money to businesses that would not ordinarily qualify for a bank loan. Businesses that are growing fast but have not established a credit history with a bank might find these lenders helpful. Generally, businesses that seek asset-based loans are high risks, so asset-based lenders charge a premium for their service. Some asset-based lenders will use a business' receivables and inventory as collateral. Others may prefer to use real estate or equipment as collateral.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Commercial Finance Companies </STRONG></H4></A>
Commercial finance companies specialize in financing high-risk applicants unable to obtain conventional bank financing. Their interest rates tend to be substantially higher than those offered by conventional banks because of the increased risks. Because commercial finance companies have more experience evaluating the liquidation value of failed businesses, they often are more willing to finance riskier applicants.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Venture Capital Companies </STRONG></H4></A>
Venture capital companies specialize in lending to startup companies or established companies expanding into new risky markets. Venture capital companies provide capital to businesses that might not be eligible for straight bank loans but have high potential in their market. These companies assess the viability of an emerging business and fund it by taking a stake in the company. They may prefer to acquire stock in the company as a way to finance the loan and insist on playing a substantial role in managing the company. Thus, the success of the venture capital firm depends on the success of the business. Many investors demand a say in management decisions in exchange for their investment capital--a demand that is an anathema to some entrepreneurs.
<P>
Only about one out of every ten investments reaps profits for venture capital companies, so they are choosy about where they place their money. Many firms specialize in certain areas in which they have expertise. Before approaching a venture capitalist, a business owner should prepare a solid business plan that takes into account marketing plans, cash flow, and research needs.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Public Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
There are many government programs charged with helping businesses succeed. One of the ways the government encourages new businesses is by making loans easier to obtain. The United States Small Business Administration (SBA) helps qualified small businesses get loans by offering lending banks guarantees on the loans. The SBA will guarantee 85 to 90 percent of a loan depending on the size of the loan (the maximum is $750,000). It is difficult to receive the SBA's help, however, without sizable investment capital from investors.
<P>
In addition to the SBA, there are a number of other government programs, at the local, state, and federal levels, designed to help specific kinds of businesses. For example, some programs are designed to assist minority owned businesses.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Franchises</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Strictly speaking, franchising is not a type of new venture financing, but it can be a way for an existing business to expand rapidly and move into new markets for a reasonable cost. A franchise is a right given to a private person or corporation to market a given product within a certain area. When a business with a trademark sells the rights to that trademark for use by a distributor of products or services, their relationship may be a franchise. Usually the business selling the franchise also provides market assistance to the buyer.
<P>
Franchises are governed by both state and federal law. It is extremely important to know these laws before starting a business that may franchise or if considering becoming a franchisee for another business. The laws are drafted using broad language and some people find themselves in violation of the laws, even though they are not engaged in activities they consider to be franchising.
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces laws and rules regulating franchises. These rules do not require a business to register with or seek the approval of the FTC before offering or selling a franchise; they only apply to franchises that are "in or affecting interstate commerce." Although there are differences between state and federal franchise laws, it is most important to remember that the name of a company is not important as long as the relationship meets the definition of a franchise. This means that if a business is entering into a limited partnership, it may also be entering into a franchise agreement. The FTC rules define a franchise as a "continuing commercial relationship" between two or more parties. This continuing relationship is further defined as one in which supplies for reorder are made available to the purchaser after the first required inventory is purchased.
<P>
There are three basic types of "continuing commercial relationships" covered by the rules:
<UL>
<LI>Package franchises, "business format" franchises, which are defined as prepackaged business programs developed and identified by the franchisor. McDonald's is an example of this type of franchise.
<LI>Product franchises, in which the franchisor sells goods that bear his or her trade name to a franchisee, who in turn sells them to the public under the same name. The dealer company maintains some degree of control over the selling of the goods by the franchisee in this arrangement.
<LI>Business opportunity ventures, in which the franchisor retains more control than in either of the previous arrangements. In this type of franchising agreement, the franchisee is required to buy and sell the goods or services of the franchisor or another business. The franchisor also arranges the location of the business, seeks out business for the junior partner, and even provides employees. An example of this type of arrangement is a vending machine route. The franchisor company finds a place to put the machines and sells the candy to the franchisee, but the franchisee collects the money and restocks the machines.
</UL>
Franchises also are discussed in the <A HREF="b15.html">Closely Held Business Law</A> and <A HREF="b26.html">Franchise &amp; Dealership Law</A> Chapters.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Adoption Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Adoption policy in the United States is undergoing a great deal of public scrutiny. News reports in recent years have featured dramatic stories of conflict between biological and adoptive parents, raising questions about how to balance the rights of both families and about which policies further the best interests of the adopted child. These cases have helped clarify important legal and social questions surrounding adoption. Although adoption remains a hotly debated and legislated area of the law, most adoptions proceed through the legal system with little, if any, conflict. For many families, adoption is a perfect way for adults to provide love and care to a child whose biological parents are not able to do so.
<P>
Adoption law, like most family law, is state law; there is very little federal regulation of adoption. Each state has the authority to create adoption laws and to regulate adoption agencies. One major exception to this rule concerns adoption of a child from another country. The United States Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) imposes regulations on such adoptions in addition to those imposed by the state; the adoptive parents must be United States citizens, for example. Adoption in Illinois is governed by the Illinois Adoption Act.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>What Is Adoption? </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In an adoption, parental rights are transferred from the natural or birth parents to the adoptive parents. Adoption is a legal transaction; the adoptive parents become legally responsible for the child they adopt and they obtain all legal parental rights with regard to the child. This legal proceeding is so complete that a new birth certificate is issued for the child. It shows the adoptive parents' names as the child's mother and father at the time of birth. The original birth certificate is retained but sealed, so it can be accessed only by court order.
<P>
Adoption may take place within a family. This kind of adoption sometimes is called a relative adoption. A stepparent who is responsible for providing the care, love, discipline, and guidance for the children of his or her spouse may formalize the relationship by adopting the stepchildren. As with any adoption, this can happen only if both natural parents agree.
<P>
It is possible for an adult to be adopted in Illinois. If the person being adopted is 14 years of age or older, that person must consent to the adoption. In addition, the adopted person either must be related to one of the adopting parents, or must have lived with his or her new family for at least two years prior to the adoption.
<P>
Most of the laws and regulations concerning adoptions are applicable to so-called stranger adoption or unrelated adoption. That is, people seek out a child to adopt through an acquaintance or an agency.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Open Versus Closed Adoption </STRONG></H3></A>
If the adoptive and birth parents know each other and remain in touch after the adoption, the adoption is said to be open. If they do not know each other and do not stay in touch after the adoption, it is said to be closed.
<P>
Open and closed adoptions are not the only two options available to parents; they exist at opposite ends of a continuum of choices. The degree of openness in an adoption is determined by the parties involved and may be quite complex. Most important to a successful adoption is that all expectations regarding openness and the role both sets of parents will play are clearly communicated and understood by all parties. Adoption facilitators or attorneys can assist in ensuring the most secure adoption plan in the best interests of the child.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Who May Adopt? </STRONG></H3></A>
People seeking to adopt in Illinois must reside in Illinois for at least six months prior to commencing the adoption proceedings. Commonly, married couples apply to become adoptive parents, although single or divorced people do have the right to adopt in Illinois. Married people must adopt together, however; one spouse may not seek to adopt a child without the consent and joint petition of the other spouse. If a person gets married while in the process of adopting a child, the new spouse must join in the adoption petition.
<P>
As a practical matter, it is easier for some people to adopt than for others. Agencies tend to prefer placing children with couples who have been married for a considerable length of time (generally at least three years) and who have financial security. People who are healthy and under 40 years of age usually will have an easier time also. People who do not fall within these general guidelines may be required to provide additional information to an agency considering their application. For instance, a single person may be asked whether there are family members who will be available to help with child care.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>Adoption Placements and Procedures </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An agency placement of a child for adoption is one made through a private or public state-licensed adoption agency. An independent placement is one arranged between the adoptive and birth parents without assistance of an agency. In this situation, the parties have come together through other means--usually through mutual friends. Approximately two-thirds of all adoptions in the United States are arranged through agencies.
<P>
In Illinois, all agencies specializing in adoption must be licensed as child welfare agencies under the Illinois Child Care Act. A hospital that is not licensed as a child welfare agency, for example, may not legally facilitate adoptions. In order to adopt in Illinois from an agency in another state, the agency must be licensed in accordance with the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children, or the agency must provide other means of showing it is a reputable organization that will take responsibility if the adoption fails.
<P>
Even with these regulations, however, not all licensed agencies are equal. Agencies differ in the services offered, adoptive clients served, geographic area served, fees charged, and age of child sought to be adopted. When dealing with an adoption agency, it is best to ask questions to determine whether the needs of the adoptive parents and the birth parents fit the services offered by the agency.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Initiating an Adoption </STRONG></H3></A>
Before an adoption of a child under the age of 14 can commence, the child's birth parents must voluntarily give up their parental rights by signing a document relinquishing all legal rights with regard to the child. Another way parental rights are terminated is involuntarily: the parents are declared unfit by a court of law. For example, a court may find that a parent has abandoned the child, severely abused the child, or has shown such little interest in caring for the child that he or she is not competent to be a parent. Usually, when birth parents relinquish their right to raise a child, however, they do so consensually. The right to care for the child and make decisions on his or her behalf may be given over to an adoption agency (discussed below) prior to the child's placement with his or her adoptive parents.
<P>
Both birth parents must relinquish parental rights. Without this consent, an adoption may not occur, with one exception: If the child was born out of wedlock, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services must provide notice of the adoption proceeding to the person presumed to be the father. If the father comes forward, his right to be the parent may be terminated only if he voluntarily consents or if he is declared unfit. If he does not respond to the notice, the adoption can proceed with the biological mother's consent only.
<P>
In Illinois, as in all other states, it is illegal to buy a baby. This means not only that adoptive parents may not pay a parent or a third person for the right to adopt a child, but the parents are prohibited from giving gifts to the birth mother, paying her living expenses, or doing anything else that could be considered buying the right to adopt a particular baby. This law does not prohibit adoption agencies or intermediaries such as attorneys from charging fees for their services. Most states, including Illinois, do allow the adoptive parents to pay for the birth mother's medical expenses related to the birth of the child.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Qualification </STRONG></H3></A>
Adoption agencies conduct a rather extensive examination of people who wish to adopt, to ensure that they are fit to do so. Agency workers perform a "home study," going into the potential parents' home to investigate that it is an appropriate place for a child. The home study also includes an interview, the purpose of which is to ascertain whether the potential parents are ready for the responsibilities of parenting. Some of the issues covered in the home study include:
<UL>
<LI>Is the house clean and safe?
<LI>Is there room for the child?
<LI>How long have the applicants been married?
<LI>Are both people eager to adopt?
<LI>Do the applicants have any experience with children?
<LI>Can they afford to have the child?
<LI>Will one parent stay home with the child or will they use day care?
</UL>
The goal of the interview and examination process is not to make sure the applicants have a lot of money, a big house, or a great deal of education. It is meant to verify that adoption is the appropriate choice for the couple and that they will be able to meet the specific needs of the child they are seeking to adopt. The home study also is an opportunity for the potential parents to obtain information from the agency worker and to have their questions answered.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Finalizing the Adoption </STRONG></H3></A>
Once the applicants have been approved to be adoptive parents and to adopt a particular child, the child is placed in the home on a tentative basis. This probationary period, which lasts six months, is designed to make sure that the placement is appropriate and that the new relationship will be successful. If problems arise, or if the parents change their minds about adopting, the adoption agency removes the child from the home and seeks a new home for the child.
<P>
If the tentative placement is successful, a court enters a final adoption order. At this point, the new birth certificate is issued, and the legal rights and responsibilities of parenting go into effect. A final order of adoption is--as its sounds--final. It may not be challenged by the birth parents or other parties (although the adoptive parents' fitness, if it became an issue, could be challenged in a separate court proceeding).
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Intercountry Adoptions </STRONG></H3></A>
As noted earlier, adopting a child from another country is regulated not only by Illinois law but by federal law, as well. The INS determines, according to its guidelines, whether a person or couple is qualified to adopt, approves the child for adoption based on a number of factors, including country of origin and level of health, and requires that all requisites for immigration to the United States be met. Although it is possible to adopt a child from another country independently, it is much better to go through an agency. Private agencies (public agencies do not facilitate intercountry adoptions) are experienced in avoiding the special problems that can arise when attempting to adopt in another country.
<P>
Intercountry adoptions can be quite a bit more expensive than domestic adoptions. In addition to travel expenses, INS fees, and fees for additional documentation, agency fees usually are higher, as are foreign court fees. Many people work with a foreign agency, as well, which is an additional expense. Intercountry adoptions also can be more difficult. The waiting period both before and after the adoptive parents qualify is longer, and there is more risk of medical and social factors becoming problematic.
<P>
All of this said, however, intercountry adoption is a perfect option for many people. Some people prefer to adopt a healthy infant, which is much more of a possibility because waiting lists in the United States are quite long. Finally, many of the procedures for adopting a child from another country--such as home studies, investigations of the birth and adoptive parents, forms, fees, and court petitions--are not much different than the procedures required in any adoption.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Other Adoption Services </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In addition to coordinating placement of a child with adoptive parents, most public and private adoption agencies provide other services to both sets of parents. Adoption facilitators may be available to provide personal assistance throughout the adoption, including facilitating communication between the parties. Directories, including photographs and background information, are maintained by adoption agencies. These lists are provided to assist the adoptive parents in choosing a child. Most agencies also maintain an attorney referral service, which can be an additional source for locating an adoption attorney.
<P>
Counseling frequently is offered to support birth parents through the decision to place their child for adoption. Larger agencies may even have counseling for relatives of birth parents who have decided not to raise a child themselves. Many agencies provide classes about adopting, which are designed to educate people about adoption laws and procedures. Some classes are tailored specifically to the parents' or child's situation; information about parenting a child of a different race, a child who is HIV-positive, or a child who has been abused may be available, for example. Other classes may function almost like support groups, in which people wishing to adopt exchange information and experiences. Some agencies provide classes, counseling, or even financial assistance for adoptive parents after the home placement, or even after the adoption is final.

<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Alternative Dispute Resolution
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is an increasingly popular trend that allows people to solve disputes outside court in a cooperative manner rather than through litigation. ADR techniques have been used successfully in disputes involving small and large businesses, the government, and the general public. ADR is becoming very popular in family law cases. It can be faster and cheaper than litigation. Because the parties settle out of court, expenses for depositions and clerical costs can be substantially reduced, and there is little or no waiting for trial dates. The use of ADR can also improve client satisfaction with the way disputes are resolved. You should contact an attorney for a referral to a qualified ADR provider.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>ADR Options </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
ADR may involve the use of mediation, arbitration, mediation-arbitration, neutral fact-finding, mini-trials, or summary jury trials instead of litigation and other formal, adversarial proceedings. 
<P>
Dispute resolution processes can be voluntary, mandatory, binding, or advisory. These dispute resolution options can be used at any point during a dispute. Some parties might choose to use ADR from the very beginning of a dispute, while others will turn to ADR after more traditional dispute resolution options become too lengthy or costly.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Mediation </STRONG></H3></A>
Mediation is an informal method of ADR that involves a trained third party (mediator or mediation panel) helping disputing parties negotiate a settlement to their conflict. Instead of presenting cases in a courtroom, each side meets privately with the mediator, as well as in joint sessions with the mediator and the other side. Mediation is nonbinding because the mediator does not have the power to impose a resolution upon the parties. Rather, the role of the mediator or mediation panel is to help the parties reach their own resolution. Mediation seeks solutions that satisfy all parties, and because the parties are empowered to control the outcome, the potential exists for a solution that addresses the interests of all parties. While courts are limited by law to specific remedies, mediation is limited only by the nature of the problem and the parties' own creativity. 
<P>
Although participation in some mediation programs may be mandatory, reaching agreement usually is voluntary. Mediation gives the parties a sense of involvement in the dispute resolution process, making compliance with the result more likely than in the case of an imposed solution. Parties sometimes stipulate beforehand that any agreement reached will be enforceable as a contract. However, if the parties do not reach agreement between themselves, there is no agreement to enforce and the parties are free to use other methods to solve their dispute. Even in cases in which the parties cannot reach an agreement, the process of mediation may better define the dispute and help each party understand how a judge or jury might react to the case in court. Agreement can be reached on some issues while the parties agree to seek an advisory or binding judgment on the issues that remain in dispute. 
<P>
Parties who use ADR successfully can learn valuable skills to help them address future conflicts more creatively. Mediated cases are usually settled in less time than litigated cases, and both parties can achieve considerable cost and time savings. Even people who believe they could win a court case sometimes prefer to mediate rather than incur court costs and lawyers' fees, which could swallow a large part of any award received. 
<P>
With the exception of some disputes involving public interest, mediation is considered to be private and confidential. Pursuant to the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Center Act, all communications and documents, including work notes made and used during mediation, are confidential and cannot be used in a court of law should there be subsequent litigation. 
<P>
Mediation currently is used to resolve disputes in a wide variety of settings. Whether the dispute is between students, neighbors, family members, businesses, or parties to an accident, whether it involves a claim, governmental agencies, or nations, the mediation process is an effective tool for achieving solutions by mutual agreement rather than by court order.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Mini-Trial </STRONG></H3></A>
In a mini-trial, each party presents its position in trial-like fashion before a panel that can include selected representatives for both parties (such as managers or executives), neutral third parties, or both. Every panel has one neutral advisor. Mini-trials help to define the issues and develop a basis for realistic settlement negotiations. The representatives from the two sides provide an overview of their positions and arguments to the panel. As a result, each party becomes more knowledgeable about the other party's position. After hearing each side's presentation, the panel, including the advisor, meets to develop a compromise solution, as in the mediation process. The neutral advisor also may issue an advisory opinion regarding the merits of the case. The advisory opinion is not binding unless the parties agree beforehand that it will be binding and enter into a written settlement agreement. The primary benefit of a mini-trial is that both parties have an opportunity to develop solutions, because each side has representation and access to detailed information.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Arbitration </STRONG></H3></A>
Like a mini-trial, arbitration allows both parties to present their cases to a neutral third party or a panel of third parties who are experts in a particular area. An arbitration panel differs from a mediation panel because it is chosen by both sides, much like attorneys choose members of a jury. The parties stipulate in advance as to whether the decision of the arbitrator will be binding or nonbinding. If binding, the decision is enforceable in court in the same manner as any other contractual obligation. 
<P>
Arbitration is best used in cases involving factual conflicts that can be resolved by experts on a particular subject. For many, this is a distinct advantage to arbitration. Many people feel more comfortable knowing their dispute is settled by an expert who is knowledgeable in a particular field, rather than by a judge who is accustomed to handling a wide variety of diverse cases. 
<P>
Some arbitration cases can be as complex and expensive as litigated cases; however, usually they are settled without much publicity. This can be a significant advantage if a dispute involves sensitive issues, such as trade secrets or future business plans, or if the parties prefer to remain out of the public eye. 
<P>
Illinois has adopted the Uniform Arbitration Act, which declares valid and enforceable an agreement to arbitrate. The Act regulates how the time and place of the hearing is determined, how the arbitrator will decide the matter, and how the award delivered, if these details are not set forth in the contract. It also states that Illinois courts will enforce arbitration awards. 
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Mediation-Arbitration </STRONG></H3></A>
Mediation-arbitration combines mediation and arbitration. The parties agree in advance that if they are unable to resolve their dispute using mediation, they will seek arbitration and receive an advisory or binding judgment on all or part of the issues that remain in dispute. In these instances, the mediator typically will switch roles and, as the arbitrator, provide the judgment. 
<P>
The mediation-arbitration process has advantages over using arbitration or mediation alone. There is greater incentive for parties to cooperate in the mediation stage of the process because they know if they are unable to come to an agreement voluntarily, they may have a solution imposed upon them in the arbitration stage. Also, mediation-arbitration can be less expensive, because the same person usually acts as both the mediator and the arbitrator. This saves time and money that would otherwise be spent educating a new arbitrator or taking a dispute to court.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Neutral Fact-Finding </STRONG></H3></A>
Neutral fact-finding is an informal process in which an agreed-upon neutral third party is asked to investigate a dispute, usually one involving complex or technical issues. The third party analyzes the facts in the dispute and issues his or her findings in a nonbinding report or recommendation. This process can be especially useful in handling allegations of gender or racial discrimination within a company, for a variety of reasons. Such cases often provoke strong emotions and internal division within a company. If both parties are employees of the same company, there may be conflicts of interest that would interfere with a supervisor's or manager's ability to conduct a fair and impartial investigation of an allegation. To avoid the appearance of unfairness, a company may turn to the outside neutral third party in hopes of reaching a settlement all employees will respect. 
<P>
A variation of neutral fact-finding is Early Neutral Evaluation (ENE). Parties using ENE have their attorneys present the core of the dispute to a neutral evaluator in the presence of the parties. This occurs after the case is filed in court but before discovery of facts is conducted. The neutral evaluator then gives a candid assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the case. If the parties cannot settle, the neutral evaluator helps narrow the dispute and suggests guidelines for managing discovery.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Summary Jury Trial </STRONG></H3></A>
Summary jury trial is a court-managed process which takes place after a case has been filed but before it reaches trial. In a summary jury trial, each party presents its arguments to a six-person jury. Abbreviated opening and closing arguments, as well as an overview of arguments, are presented. Counsel are usually given one hour each for their presentations, and are limited to presenting information that would be admissible at trial. No testimony is taken from sworn witnesses, and proceedings generally are not recorded. Because the proceedings are nonbinding, rules of evidence and procedure are more flexible than at a normal trial. 
<P>
The jury renders an advisory, nonbinding decision based on the information provided. The verdict in this setting serves to give counsel and their clients insight into their case, and may suggest a fair basis for settlement of the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved by counsel at or immediately following the summary jury trial proceeding, a pretrial is held before the court to discuss settlement. 
<P>
A summary jury trial proceeding typically concludes in less than a day, but will, on rare occasion, extend beyond a full day. The proceedings may be presided over by either a district court judge or a magistrate assigned by the judge.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>ADR Training and Education </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Under the Illinois Not-For-Profit Dispute Resolution Center Act, all mediators must have at least 30 hours of training in conflict resolution techniques, and they are subject to ongoing peer review. These mediators are volunteers, and the mediation process prescribed by the Illinois General Assembly is voluntary. However, the method for dispute resolution is formalized under the Act. Each judicial circuit has funding for a dispute resolution center, which is organized to provide free mediation services. The disputes mediated at these centers include, but are not limited to, those referred from the courts. Illinois has recognized that ADR has the potential to lift a burden from an overworked judicial system, as well as to resolve disputes more efficiently and amicably.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Finding an ADR Provider </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As noted, Illinois has numerous dispute resolution centers which provide mediation services. Courts also will provide lists of licensed attorneys who are trained as arbitrators to parties wishing to resolve a dispute through arbitration. Other ADR providers are listed in <A HREF="../appendices/appendixa.html">Appendix A</A> of the <STRONG><A HREF="../../ilhome.html">Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Illinois Business Guide</A> </STRONG>
<P>
Several steps should be taken when choosing a provider. Parties should ask potential mediators about their mediation training and about their substantive knowledge of the issues in dispute. If, after selecting a mediator, a party to the dispute genuinely feels that the mediator has shown bias, has a conflict of interest, or lacks the skills or experience necessary to mediate the case, he or she should voice the concern. 
<P>
There is a wide range of ADR providers with varying levels of specialization, expertise, ability, and quality. The kind of ADR provider appropriate to a particular dispute depends on the kind of dispute, the parties, how much money is involved, the level of expertise necessary to handle a matter, and how far the parties are into the dispute. Some community dispute resolution programs offer juvenile mediation, victim-offender mediation, and post-divorce visitation mediation. ADR providers offer dispute resolution services for these conflicts as well as for large, multi-party disputes. Some providers have special areas of expertise, such as corporate or environmental dispute resolution. Many ADR providers specialize in the area of divorce and family law. Because of the sensitive issues involved, family and divorce mediators must meet more stringent requirements to be recognized by the court.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Costs </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The costs of ADR vary depending on the type of dispute, the type of ADR process chosen, and the experience and expertise of the ADR provider. Because Illinois dispute resolution centers use trained, volunteer mediators, usually there is no charge for their ADR services. Arbitrators appointed by the court under the Uniform Arbitration Act are compensated for their services and reimbursed for expenses; these costs usually are divided among the parties. The costs of for-profit ADR providers vary depending upon the experience and expertise of the provider chosen. Some ADR providers charge an hourly rate while others charge a flat fee for handling an entire matter from initiation to resolution. Even if a given ADR provider charges a substantial hourly rate, using ADR can often resolve a dispute quickly, saving the client time and money.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Arts, Entertainment & Intellectual Property Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Whether a person is an aspiring author, a musician in a band, or a tinkerer who hopes to invent an indispensable product, arts, entertainment, and intellectual property issues and accompanying legal rights will arise.
The law of arts, entertainment, and intellectual property crosses over many lines. A person involved in one of these areas may be confronted with contract, copyright, trademark, business organization, or tax issues. This chapter will highlight some of the specific issues a person may encounter in these areas. Other chapters in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> also may be useful, including <A HREF="c23.html">Small Business Law</A> , <A HREF="c04.html">Constitutional Law</A>, and <A HREF="c06.html">Contract Law</A>. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Protecting Creative Work  </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Intellectual property is a creation such as a song, poem, company logo, or invention, through which the creator has expressed an idea and in which he or she has certain rights under the law. Although an author or inventor may be granted these rights, it is up to the person, not the court system, to protect his or her interest. If infringement--the unauthorized use of subject matter--occurs, the person who has the right may go to court to seek a remedy for the infringement. 
<P>
There are different categories of intellectual property. Which category is applicable depends on the particular subject matter in question. A copyright protects the interest in an original writing, while a patent protects the interests in an invention. 
<P>
Intellectual property law can be very technical and complicated. An attorney with experience in the particular intellectual property area should be consulted to adequately protect one's intellectual property rights.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Copyright </STRONG></H3></A>
A copyright is the exclusive legal right given to a creator of original literary or artistic work. Copyright protection is provided by federal law, and is granted to original works of authorship fixed in a tangible form of expression. Authorship includes literary works, such as novels, poems, and short stories; musical works, including any accompanying words; dramatic works, including any accompanying music, dance works, paintings, photographs, sculptures, movies and sound recordings; and architectural works. Copyright protection applies to a wide range of expression, from computer software to advertisements. What all these items have in common is an original expression of an idea. Copyright applies to the expression of the idea, not the idea itself. Copyright is separate from the subject matter of the copyright. For example, if a person buys a painting from an artist, he or she buys the painting only and not the copyright. If the buyer makes copies of the painting and sells them, he or she is infringing on the artist's copyright. 
<P>
Copyright protection originates from the time the work is created. A work does not have to be published in order to receive copyright protection. Copyright gives the creator of the work the exclusive right to perform, display, reproduce, and distribute copies of the work, and to prepare other works based upon the copyrighted work. An owner of a copyright can sell one, some, or all of these exclusive rights. For example, an author of a novel can sell the movie rights to one person and the paperback rights to another.
The owner of a copyright is typically the creator of the work. However, when a person is employed by another and creates the work while doing his or her job, the copyright is owned by the employer, not the employee. This is known as work made-for-hire. If an independent contractor contracts to create a work, he or she should address the copyright ownership issue up front.
There are no applications to fill out in order to have copyright protection. As stated previously, copyright is created when a work is created. However, a person may give notice that a work is copyrighted and register a copyright. For works created after March 1, 1989, it is no longer necessary to place a copyright notice on the work. However, it is a good idea to place the copyright notice on all creative works to give notice of the copyright claim. If there is an infringement of a copyright, a court will not allow the infringer to claim that he or she did not know the work was copyrighted if a notice was placed on the work. 
<P>
A copyright notice contains three parts:
<UL>
<LI>The word "Copyright," the abbreviation "Copr.," or the &copy; symbol
<LI>The year the work first was published
<LI>The name of the copyright owner
</UL>
The federal law states that notice should be in a manner and location to give reasonable notice of the copyright claim. A copyright notice on a work should be in a conspicuous location. 
<P>
A person also may register a copyright, which is not required, but provides several benefits. Registration creates a presumption that the copyright claim is valid and the potential for an award of attorney fees and statutory damages in an infringement case. Copyright registration also is a prerequisite to bringing an action for copyright infringement. 
<P>
Registering a copyright is relatively straightforward. In general, a person should register within three months of publication. To register, a person must complete an application supplied by the Copyright Office of the Library of Congress and return the form to the Office with a filing fee and copies of the work. The number of copies to be supplied depends on whether the work has been published, whether the work has been published outside the United States, and whether the work is a contribution to a collective work.
Copyright protection lasts a limited time. The time period depends on when the work is created and whether it was published. Generally, works created on or after January 1, 1978, have copyright protection from the time of creation throughout the creator's life, plus an additional 50 years. For works made during the course of employment, the duration of copyright is 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever is shorter. 
<P>
When a party uses a copyrighted work without authorization, copyright infringement occurs. The owner of the copyright can bring a federal civil action against the infringer. The plaintiff in an infringement action must prove that he or she is the owner of the copyright and that the defendant infringed upon one of the plaintiff's exclusive rights. If the plaintiff has registered as the owner of the copyright, the law presumes that the plaintiff is the owner of the copyright. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the defendant had access to the plaintiff's work and the defendant's work is substantially similar to the plaintiff's work. Once the plaintiff proves these elements, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that the defendant's work was created independently. An innocent infringer--a person who relied on an authorized copy in which the copyright notice was omitted and who had no reason to believe the work was protected--may have a defense to an infringement claim. An innocent infringer is not liable for actual or statutory damages. 
<P>
Before the infringement issue is resolved through a trial or settlement, a copyright owner can go to court and ask for a restraining order against the defendant to prevent the defendant from continuing the alleged infringement activity. If the activity is determined to be infringement by the court, it may grant an injunction, permanently barring the defendant's actions. A plaintiff who prevails in an infringement case can recover money damages as provided by statute or actual damages incurred as a result of the infringement, plus any profits made by the infringer. The choice of damages is made by the plaintiff. Attorneys' fees may be granted by the court in a successful infringement case. 
<P>
Although a copyright gives its owner exclusive rights, "fair use" of a copyrighted work is not considered an infringement of copyright. Fair use includes copying for purposes such as news reporting, teaching, research, and comments and criticisms. Factors to be considered in determining whether use is fair use include the purpose of the use, whether the use was for profit, the amount of the work used, and the effect of the use upon the value of the work. There also are exceptions for libraries and teachers.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Patents </STRONG></H3></A>
A patent is a right granted by the federal government to an inventor to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention. The rationale behind the patent is to reward an inventor for the time and effort used in the creation of an invention. A patent is granted for a limited time period. After a patent expires, the inventor loses the exclusive rights to the invention. A patent protects an invention only in this country. If an inventor wishes to have protection in other countries, those countries patent procedures must be followed. An invention must be new, useful (except for a design patent, which must be ornamental), and not obvious in order to be granted a patent. There are three categories of patents. A utility patent is granted to anyone who invents or discovers any new or useful process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or any improvement thereof. A new industrial or technical process may be patented. A utility patent is granted for a term of 17 years. 
<P>
A design patent is granted to anyone who invents a new, original, and ornament design for an article of manufacture. The appearance of the article is protected under this patent. A design patent is granted for a term of 14 years. A plant patent is granted to any person who invents or discovers and asexually reproduces a distinct and new variety of plant. A plant may be a mutant, hybrid, or newly found seedling, except a tuber propagated plant or a plant found in an uncultivated state. A plant patent is granted for a term of 17 years. 
<P>
In order for a patent to be granted, an application must be filed. A patent application is made to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which is part of the Department of Commerce. A patent application is confidential; however, if a patent is granted, the application becomes public information.
The application includes three components. First the applicant must submit a written document that describes the invention and states the claims of the inventor. The statement must be in such detail that a person knowledgeable in the subject matter area could build and use the invention based upon the information provided. The claims state the patented characteristics of the invention. This document also must contain a declaration by the inventor that he or she believes himself or herself to be the original and first inventor of the application's subject matter. The declaration must be notarized.
The second component of the application is drawings illustrating the invention. An inventor should supply as many drawings as necessary to describe the invention. The third requirement is the filing fee. The fees may be reduced by 50 percent if the patent applicant is an individual, small business, or a nonprofit organization. 
<P>
After a patent application is filed, a patent examiner reviews the application. The examiner may allow the patent, reject the application, or object to the application. A rejection means that the examiner believes the invention should not be granted a patent, while an objection means that there is a problem with the application, which can be fixed. The inventor can amend his or her patent application to address the concerns raised by the examiner. An inventor may appeal a patent rejection. 
<P>
A patent will not be granted if the invention was in public use or on sale in the United States, or was the subject of a patent application in another country that had matured for more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application. An inventor's own use of the invention may bar him or her from receiving a patent if the invention was used for more than one year prior to application. 
<P>
Patents are granted only to the inventor; however, an inventor may sell his or her rights to the patent or sell licenses under which another pays a fee to use the patent. A license may be exclusive or nonexclusive. If the rights to a patent are assigned, this assignment should be registered with the Patent and Trademark Office. 
<P>
Before an inventor applies for a patent, a search should be done to determine whether a patent already has been granted for the invention. This search may be expensive. The Public Search Room of the Patent and Trademark Office is the primary source of information. Also, Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries have been established at the Illinois State Library in Springfield and at the Chicago Public Library. 
<P>
When a patent is granted, an inventor must pay an issuance fee. Also, maintenance fees for the patent are paid three times during the patent period to keep the patent in force.  
<P>
The Patent and Trademark Office maintains a register of attorneys and agents who meet the legal, scientific, and technical requirements to practice patent law, and who agree to uphold high standards of professional conduct. A person seeking to have his or her invention patented should contact a patent law attorney.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Trademark </STRONG></H3></A>
A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol, or design, or a combination of these items, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods of one party from those of another. A service mark is the same as a trademark except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product. This section will use the terms "trademark" and "mark" to refer to both trademarks and service marks. 
<P>
Rights to a trademark arise when a trademark is used or an application to register is made and the applicant intends to use the mark. A trademark gives the owner exclusive use of the trademark as long as it is used to identify goods or services. 
<P>
Registering a trademark is not required; however, registration of a trademark, like registration of a copyright, provides benefits that make it worthwhile. The owner of a federal trademark registration is presumed to be the owner of the trademark and is entitled to use the trademark nationwide. A trademark may be registered with either the Patent and Trademark Office or the Illinois Secretary of State. Registration in one office does not register the trademark in the other office.  
<P>
An application for federal trademark registration is in two stages. First, the application must be accepted. Once the application has been accepted, the process to determine trademark registration begins. An application to register a trademark is filed in the name of the owner, who can be an individual, partnership, or corporation. An owner who has not yet used the trademark may make an application based on an intention to use the trademark. Use of a trademark in promotion or advertising before the trademark is used with products or goods does not qualify as use. If an owner files an application based on intent to use the trademark, he or she must use the trademark and submit proof of this use to the Patent and Trademark Office before the trademark will be registered. 
<P>
The application consists of a completed application form, a drawing of the mark, and a filing fee. There is a separate filing fee for each class of goods or services listed. The Patent and Trademark Office maintains a list of over 40 class categories, from furniture to clothing to chemicals. If the application is based on the use of the trademark, the application must include three examples per class showing actual use of the trademark. A separate application must be filed for each trademark a person wishes to register. The applicant must be careful when identifying goods and services, because an application may not be amended later to add goods or services not within the scope of the original identification. 
<P>
After an application is filed, it is reviewed to determine if it meets the minimum requirements. If it does, the application is given a serial number and the applicant is sent a receipt. If minimum requirements are not met, the application and the fee are returned to the applicant. After an application is accepted, an examining patent and trademark attorney reviews the application to determine whether the trademark should be registered. If the attorney decides that the trademark should not be registered, he or she sends a letter to the applicant stating the grounds for refusal. The applicant must respond with objections within six months or the application will be abandoned. If the applicant's response does not overcome the attorney's objections, a final refusal will be issued. A common reason for refusing to register a trademark is the likelihood of confusion between the applicant's trademark and a trademark that already has been registered. 
<P>
If there are no objections to the application or the objections have been overcome, the attorney will approve the trademark for publication in the Official/Gazette, a weekly publication of the Patent and Trademark Office. Any party who believes that it may be harmed by registration of the trademark has 30 days to file an opposition to the trademark with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. 
<P>
If no oppositions are raised, the application continues in the registration process. The next step depends on whether the application is based on actual use of the trademark or intent to use the trademark. If the application is based on the actual use of the mark, the Patent and Trademark Office registers the mark and issues a registration certificate. If the application is based on the party's intent to use the trademark, the Office issues a Notice of Allowance. The applicant has six months from the date of the notice either to use the trademark and send to the Office a Statement of Use with three samples of use per class, or to request an extension of time. If the Statement of Use is filed and approved, the Patent and Trademark Office then issues a registration certificate. There is an additional fee per class for these filings. The term of a federal trademark registration is ten years, with ten-year renewal terms. 
<P>
Before a person applies for federal registration of a trademark, a search should be done to determine whether there are any conflicting trademarks. The application fee is not refunded if a conflicting trademark is found. Also, one would not want to spend resources on a trademark that is not available. The Public Search Library of the Patent and Trademark Office and the Patent and Trademark Depository Libraries at the Illinois State Library in Springfield and the Chicago Public Library are sources of trademark information. 
<P>
Besides registering a trademark claim, a person also may give notice to the public that trademark rights are claimed. The "TM" symbol or the "SM" symbol may be used to notify the public of the claim. Use of the registration symbol &#174; is permitted only when the trademark has been registered with the Patent and Trademark Office. 
<P>
A trademark also may be registered with the Illinois Secretary of State's Office. A state trademark registration is not equivalent to federal registration. A trademark that is registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office does not need to be registered with a state because federal registration gives the owner the rights to that trademark nationally. However, a party who has not registered a trademark federally may wish to file the trademark with the state. For example, if a person is operating a small business in Illinois and has no intention of expanding the business, he or she may consider registering the trademark with the Secretary of State to protect his or her interests only in the state of Illinois. State registration only provides protection in that state, so a person can have a trademark registered in Illinois and another person legally could use the same trademark in Michigan. 
<P>
A trademark registration in Illinois costs less time and money than the federal registration. A party must submit an application to the Secretary of State's office with the appropriate filing fee. A trademark registered in Illinois is protected as long as the trademark continues to be used. The initial term of a trademark registration is ten years, with subsequent renewal periods. Registering an assumed name or a corporate name in Illinois is not trademark registration and does not provide trademark protection. See the <A HREF="c23.html">Small Business Law</A> Chapter for further information on assumed name registration.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Artists' Rights and Obligations  </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
It is believed that there is a unique bond between an artist and the work he or she creates. Based on this belief, artists have specific rights. These rights are known as moral rights (in French, "droit moral"). Moral rights protect, among other things, the integrity of an artist's work so that it cannot be changed without his or her permission. Moral rights originated in France and are recognized in a number of countries including, in a limited way, the United States. However, the United States does not recognize all moral rights. There are also differences between states in protecting artists' moral rights. If an artist wants to ensure certain rights that are not provided by law, one option is to put these rights into a contract. Contracts are discussed below.
The right of an artist to create or not create a work is included in moral rights. Disputes over the right to create usually arise when an artist refuses to create or complete a work for which he or she was commissioned. Artists rarely are forced to create because courts are reluctant to force the performance of services and because the party contracting for the work also may be reluctant to have the artist forced to finish the work. However, an artist who fails to fulfill his or her duties under a contract is liable for damages. 
<P>
In 1990, the federal Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA) was passed. This Act applies to paintings, drawings, prints, or sculptures, and amends federal copyright law by providing certain artists with attribution and integrity rights. VARA permits an artist to claim credit for the work he or she has created. If an artist's work is distorted, mutilated, or modified, the artist also has the right to stop the use of his or her name as the artist if such use becomes prejudicial to the artist's honor or reputation.  
<P>
VARA also provides the artist the right to prevent destruction of a work of recognized stature. What constitutes a work of recognized stature is determined by scholars, curators, and collectors. This protection may be limited if the work is placed on a building. 
<P>
An artist's economic rights give the artist the right to receive profits from resale of his or her work. Authors and entertainers typically enjoy royalty payments from subsequent reproduction and syndication. Fine artists, on the other hand, receive payment upon the initial sale only and, unfortunately, fail to receive profits from resale. Neither the United States nor Illinois provide statutory economic rights to artists. If an artist includes in a sales contract a provision requiring a share of profits from any resale, enforcement of such a provision may be a problem. 
<P>
Although the United States Constitution guarantees the freedom of expression, this right has limitations, some of which are especially applicable to artists and entertainers. Obscene material is not entitled to constitutional protection. The United States Supreme Court created the following test to use in determining whether material is obscene: the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. This standard is difficult to apply in the abstract, and can vary widely from community to community.
Injudicious speech sometimes can lead to a defamation suit. Defamation is a false statement that damages another person's reputation or character, such as false accusation of a crime, dishonesty in business, or unchastity. Libel is written defamation and slander is spoken defamation. 
<P>
A defamatory statement must be a statement of fact, not a statement of opinion, to be actionable. There is a difference between stating a person is "a jerk" (opinion) and stating a person is "a convicted murderer" (fact). No matter how damaging a statement may be, if the statement is true there is no action for defamation (although there may be grounds for a different lawsuit, such as harassment). The defamatory statement must be communicated to a third party (publication), and must identify the party being defamed.
Once a plaintiff in a defamation case has proven that the defendant published a false, defamatory statement of fact about the plaintiff, the plaintiff must prove that the statement was made with actual malice or with negligence. The standard used depends on whether the plaintiff is considered a public figure or a private person. A public figure is a celebrity, politician, police officer, or citizen active in public policy. If the plaintiff is a public figure, he or she must prove that the defendant acted maliciously by deliberately failing to verify the defamatory statement. A plaintiff who is a private person only must prove that the defendant was negligent in publishing the statement and should have known that the statement was false.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Contracts </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Artists and entertainers have many reasons to make contracts. They may enter contracts for performances, consignment agreements, recording agreements, or booking agreements. The following is a list of some of the common contracts an artist or entertainer is likely to encounter in his or her career. (For more information on contracts, see the <A HREF="c06.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter.)
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Shopping Agreement </STRONG></H3></A>
A shopping agreement is an agreement that an artist or a group of artists (such as a musical band) makes with an agent or manager who then "shops" around trying to find work for the artist(s). A shopping agreement should clearly spell out how long the contract is in effect. The time period should be long enough to give both parties time to evaluate each other, but not so long as to restrict the parties to a clearly unsatisfactory arrangement. A shopping agreement also should state in what manner the agent or manager is to be paid (usually a 10 to 20 percent commission) and who is responsible for expenses.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Management or Booking Contract </STRONG></H3></A>
When an artist or group of artists is managed and/or promoted by another party, the parties should execute a management or booking contract. The agreement should sufficiently define all the rights and responsibilities of each party. Items of particular importance include specific commitments by the manager or agent to promote the artist's or group of artists' career; the management fee or commission; how the manager or agent will settle any disputes regarding conflicting booking obligations; and how the agreement will be affected if a group changes its name, members, or artistic style.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Performance Agreement </STRONG></H3></A>
A performance agreement is an agreement between a performer and an organization or person producing (paying for) the performance. A performance agreement should at least state the basics: who will perform; where and when the performance will take place; the manner and hours of the performance; amount of compensation for the performance; and the manner and form of promotion of the performance. A more detailed agreement may include who will pay attorneys' fees for any disputes and the manner in which disputes will be settled (e.g., arbitration, mediation). Performers also should make certain that the person signing the contract is the person responsible for making payment after the performance, or an authorized representative thereof.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Mutual Release Agreement </STRONG></H3></A>
A mutual release agreement outlines how to manage the legal and financial aspects of an artistic group's break-up. Having a mutual release agreement is especially important if the departure of a member is not voluntary. Important elements include the departing member's rights to use the group's material; the departing member's right to future royalties; and which member, if any, has the right to continue using the group's name.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Consignment Agreement </STRONG></H3></A>
A consignment agreement is an agreement between an artist and an art dealer (or gallery owner) whereby the artist delivers a work of art to an art dealer for the purpose of sale. Upon selling the artwork, the art dealer usually receives a commission or some other form of compensation. In an effort to protect artists from bankrupt or unscrupulous gallery owners or art dealers, Florida law requires that all consignment agreements be in written form and include the following provisions:
<UL>
<LI>The proceeds of the sale must be delivered to the artist at a schedule agreed to by the artist and the art dealer
<LI>The art dealer is responsible for the stated value of the artwork in the event of loss or damage while the artwork is in possession of the art dealer
<LI>The artwork will only be sold by the art dealer for an amount at least equal to that agreed to by the artist in writing
<LI>The artwork may be used or displayed by the art dealer only with prior written consent of the artist and only if the artist is acknowledged in such use or display
<LI>An artwork delivered to an art dealer for the purpose of sale or exhibition, and the artist's share of the proceeds of any sale by the art dealer creates a priority in favor of the artist over any claims, liens, or security interests in the artwork by creditors of the art dealer
</UL>
After delivering the artwork to the art dealer, the artist should place a tag on the artwork giving notice that the work of art is being sold on a consignment basis (or the art dealer can post a sign in his or her place of business stating that some of the artworks being sold are consignment pieces). Adhering to the above provisions better enables artists to protect themselves against possible loss.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Forming a Business </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In order to adequately protect any assets, artists and entertainers should give careful consideration to business formation. A person may want to form a corporation, a partnership, or remain a sole proprietor. There are definite advantages and disadvantages to each business form. For more information, see the <A HREF="c23.html">Small Business Law</A> Chapter.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Bankruptcy Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>


If a person falls behind in paying off debts and it appears that the person will not be able to make payments as they come due, it is better to take action rather than let one's financial situation deteriorate. For many people, the answer to financial problems is to declare bankruptcy, a legal proceeding in federal court that allows a person to be released from the obligation of paying some or all debts. 
<P>
It is often said that bankruptcy gives a debtor a fresh start, but filing bankruptcy is not a panacea for all financial problems because it is not painless. Declaring bankruptcy can seriously damage a person's credit rating, making it difficult to establish credit or take out loans. Many people can work themselves out of even very serious debt without ever going near a bankruptcy court, so declaring bankruptcy should not be an automatic first step for someone experiencing financial problems.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Bankruptcy Code </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Bankruptcy law is federal law. The United States Constitution grants to the federal government the exclusive right to make bankruptcy laws. Pursuant to this authority, the federal government created the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure, and a system of Bankruptcy courts to handle bankruptcies throughout the country. This is not to say that bankruptcy law is uniform throughout the nation, however. Although the federal government has final authority to make all bankruptcy laws, in some instances the Bankruptcy Code grants to individual states the power to deviate from federal rules in limited circumstances. For instance, the bankruptcy code allows a debtor to keep certain assets, known as exempt assets, that creditors cannot reach to satisfy a debt. The bankruptcy code gives states the authority to expand the categories of exempt assets if they choose. Thus, the amount of assets beyond the reach of creditors differs depending upon the state where the debtor files for bankruptcy. 
<P>
The Bankruptcy Code creates different categories of bankruptcy, known as chapters, appropriate for different debtors. The two most common forms of consumer bankruptcy are Chapter 7 and Chapter 13.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Chapter 7 </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The vast majority of bankruptcy cases are Chapter 7 cases. Chapter 7 is often called liquidation bankruptcy. Chapter 7 is commonly used by individuals who want to walk away from their debt simply, but it may also be used by businesses that want to terminate their operations and liquidate their assets. When a debtor files Chapter 7, the bankruptcy court appoints a person to administer the case. This person is called the trustee. The debtor turns over some or all debts and assets to the trustee. The trustee then liquidates the property by selling it off and dividing the resulting cash among the creditors. 
<P>
Under Illinois law, a person who files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy is permitted to retain up to $7,500 of equity in the person's residence; up to $1,200 in equity in the person's car; up to $2,000 in personal property such as cash and furniture; all necessary clothing, books and family pictures; up to $750 in implements, professional books or tools of the trade; and all professionally prescribed health aids for the person or one of the person's family members. These assets are called exempt assets. A person filing for bankruptcy must properly request these exempt assets in a bankruptcy case.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Step 1: Petition and Schedules </STRONG></H3></A>
A Chapter 7 case begins when the debtor files a petition with the bankruptcy court. Any individual, partnership, or corporation can file Chapter 7 regardless of the amount of debt or whether the debtor is solvent or insolvent. The petition should be filed with the court serving the area where the debtor lives or where the debtor's principal place of business or assets are located. 
<P>
Along with the petition, or shortly thereafter, the debtor files with the court several schedules listing current income and expenditures, a statement of financial affairs, all executor contracts, existing or potential lawsuits by or against the debtor, and any recent transfers of assets. If a debtor does not reveal a debt in these schedules, the bankruptcy court cannot discharge or cancel that debt. Any debt omitted from these schedules is called a non-scheduled debt and is not affected by the bankruptcy.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Step 2: Stay </STRONG></H3></A>
Filing the petition automatically stops (stays) all of the listed creditors from trying to collect the money owed them. The stay arises automatically, without any judicial action, although the court usually does notify creditors of the filing of the petition. The stay is effective from the time of filing, even if the creditors do not receive notice until much later. As long as the stay is in effect, creditors cannot generally start or continue actions against the debtor to collect on the debt. Lawsuits, garnishment actions, even telephone calls to the debtor must cease. 
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Step 3: Creditors Meeting </STRONG></H3></A>
After the debtor files a Chapter 7 petition, the court appoints a trustee to administer the case and liquidate assets. The trustee usually calls a meeting of the debtor, the debtor's attorney, and the creditors. The debtor must attend this meeting. Creditors may attend in order to ask questions, and examine documents concerning the debtor's financial affairs and property. In most consumer bankruptcies, all of the debtor's assets are either exempt or subject to valid liens, so there are no assets for creditors to pursue. In these cases, known as "no asset" cases, it is likely that no creditors show up at the creditors meeting. If it appears that a case will have assets to pursue, creditors usually show up at this meeting to gather information about the case because they plan to ask the bankruptcy judge to declare some of the debts non-dischargeable, they plan to challenge the exempt status of some asset, or they plan to file claims.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Step 4: Claims </STRONG></H3></A>
After the creditors meeting, the creditors can file a claim against the debtor with the court. If the case has non-exempt assets free of security interests, these will be used to satisfy valid claims.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Step 5: Liquidation, Discharge, and Reaffirmation </STRONG></H3></A>
The trustee's primary role is to sell off the debtor's non-exempt assets in a way that maximizes the amount the creditors receive for their claims. Revenues from assets subject to security interests, such as property subject to a mortgage, is used to satisfy the debt on the particular asset. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy concludes when the trustee sells the debtor's property, distributes the cash to the creditors, and discharges the remaining debt. The discharge extinguishes the debtor's remaining personal liability on the debt. Certain items are non-dischargeable and thus unaffected by the bankruptcy. Non-dischargeable debts include:
<UL>
<LI>Alimony and child support
<LI>Most tax obligations
<LI>Most student loans
<LI>Liability for damages resulting from willful or malicious acts
</UL>
Creditors can ask the court to deny an individual debtor a discharge. The grounds for denial of discharge are extremely narrow and requests for denial are rarely granted. Grounds for denial include:
<UL>
<LI>The debtor fails to adequately explain the loss of assets
<LI>The debtor perjured himself or herself or failed to obey lawful orders of the court
<LI>The debtor fraudulently transfers, conceals, or destroys property that should be in the estate
</UL>
Because a secured creditor has rights that permit the creditor to seize pledged property, a debtor may want to reaffirm a debt even after it has been discharged if the debtor wants to keep the property. A reaffirmation is an agreement between the debtor and the secured creditor that the creditor will not exercise the creditor's right to take back the asset so long as the debtor makes payments.
<P>
A debtor must wait six years before the debtor can file for Chapter 7 again.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Chapter 13 </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Chapter 13 bankruptcy is often referred to as a "wage-earner plan," because it is generally used by people with stable incomes who want to repay at least some of their debts but are currently unable to do so. A debtor may file Chapter 13 bankruptcy if the debtor's financial crisis is temporary and the debtor expects income will grow enough in the next few years to pay off all debts. The main advantage to Chapter 13 is that the debtor is allowed to keep the debtor's property while a court-approved repayment plan is in effect. However, only an individual with less than $100,000 in unsecured debts and less than $350,000 in secured debts is eligible to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Corporations and partnerships cannot file Chapter 13 bankruptcies, although this option is available to a small business operated by a sole proprietor. In addition, the debtor must have a job or prove to the court that the debtor has the ability to earn stable income.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Step 1: Petition </STRONG></H3></A>
The petition required for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is similar to that described above for Chapter 7. The debtor provides the court with the following:
<UL>
<LI>Lists of all creditors, including the amount and nature of claims
<LI>The source, amount and frequency of debtor income
<LI>Lists of all property
<LI>Detailed descriptions of the debtor's monthly living expenses, including food, clothing, shelter, utilities, taxes, transportation, and medical care
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Step 2: Stay </STRONG></H3></A>
Filing a Chapter 13 petition automatically stays most actions against the debtor. So long as the stay is in effect, creditors generally cannot start or continue lawsuits or garnishment actions, or even phone the debtor demanding repayment. Chapter 13 also has a special stay provision that prohibits creditors from collecting consumer debt owed to the debtor by a third person.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Step 3: Plan </STRONG></H3></A>
Within 15 working days of filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the debtor presents a plan to the court that spells out how the debtor proposes to pay off debts over a three-year period or, by permission, over a five-year period. The plan must provide for the full payment of claims entitled to priority. For reasons of public policy, the Bankruptcy Code has several categories of unsecured claims that have priority over other unsecured claims, including:
<UL>
<LI>Costs of administering the bankruptcy
<LI>Employees' wages, salaries, and commissions
<LI>Contributions to employee benefit plans
<LI>Deposits accepted by the debtor for personal items or services that the debtor did not deliver 
<LI>Taxes
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Step 4: Creditors Meeting </STRONG></H3></A>
A creditors meeting is usually held about 20 to 40 days after the petition is filed. The debtor and trustee must attend the conference, but creditors have the option to attend. Trustee and creditors can question the debtor about financial affairs and terms of the plan. Any problems with the plan are usually solved during or shortly after this meeting. 
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Step 5: Confirmation Hearing </STRONG></H3></A>
After the creditors meeting, the bankruptcy court determines at a bankruptcy hearing whether the plan is feasible and meets the standards for confirmation set by the bankruptcy code. Creditors are allowed to object to confirmation. The most common objections are that the debtor has not pledged sufficient disposable income to the plan or that the creditors receive less than they would if the debtors assets were liquidated in a Chapter 7 proceeding. 
<P>
For most plans in Illinois, the Bankruptcy Court allows a five-year repayment plan. The court occasionally reduces the size of some of the dischargeable debts. During this five-year period, a portion of the debtor's paycheck goes to a court-appointed trustee who divides the money among the debtor's creditors. 
<P>
If approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the plan prevents a debtor's creditors from garnishing wages or repossessing property.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Step 6: Discharge </STRONG></H3></A>
A Chapter 13 debtor is entitled to a discharge if the debtor successfully completes all payments under an approved plan. The discharge releases the debtor from all debts provided for or disallowed under the plan. Creditors provided for under the plan may not start or continue actions against the debtor to collect a discharged obligation.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Advantages of Chapter 13 over Chapter 7 </STRONG></H3></A>
Filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy has advantages over a Chapter 7 liquidation. Unlike a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, there is not a six-year waiting period before the debtor can file bankruptcy again. Thus, with only a few exceptions, the debtor can file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy at any time after filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy. This means that if the debtor is unable to make the payments specified in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan, the debtor can still act to discharge debts through a Chapter 7 liquidation. 
<P>
The non-dischargeable debts under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy are generally the same as the non-dischargeable debts in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. However, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows the debtor to discharge a few more types of debts than does a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 
<P>
If the debtor owns an unincorporated business, such as a freelance consulting business, the debtor can continue to own and operate the business under a Chapter 13 plan. Under a Chapter 7 liquidation, a Bankruptcy Court may order that such a business or its assets be sold. Also, the automatic stay of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy protects any co-signers of consumer debts, whereas Chapter 7 offers only very limited protection of others who may share the debtor's obligation. 
<P>
Finally, certain homeowners may prefer a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, because in many instances it allows them to make up past payments on their mortgage. When someone falls behind in making mortgage payments or is in actual default, a lender quite often "accelerates" the payments. For a debtor in this situation, filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy may allow the debtor to "decelerate" or reduce those monthly payments and may even reinstate the mortgage by wiping out a prior default. However, if saving a house is the primary reason for filing bankruptcy, the homeowner should talk through all the possibilities with an attorney, because the laws governing this area are extremely complicated and it is easy to make a costly misstep.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="170"><H2><STRONG>Conversion </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Bankruptcy Code allows a debtor to convert a Chapter 7 case to Chapter 13 or vice versa as long as the debtor meets the eligibility requirements of the new chapter and the case has not previously been converted from the new chapter. In other words, the debtor is not allowed to repeatedly convert the case from one chapter to another.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Involuntary Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Unlike the types of situations described above, in which the debtor decides whether to file bankruptcy, in an involuntary bankruptcy creditors force the debtor into bankruptcy. Under certain conditions, creditors can petition the Bankruptcy Court to initiate a Chapter 7 or 11 (but not a Chapter 13) bankruptcy against a debtor (see the <STRONG><A HREF="../../ilhome.html">Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Illinois Business Guide</A></STRONG> for a discussion of Chapter 11 bankruptcy). The court will only accept such a petition if it is signed by at least three creditors who are owed a total of at least $5,000 in unsecured debt. If a debtor has fewer than 12 unsecured creditors, however, just one unsecured creditor owed at least $5,000 can file an involuntary bankruptcy petition. 
<P>
Involuntary bankruptcy is rare, but if someone does file a petition against a debtor in Bankruptcy Court, the debtor has an opportunity to file an answer to the petition and refute any charges made by creditors in the petition. If the judge sides with the debtor, the court dismisses the petition and can make the creditors pay reasonable attorney's fees and any money the debtor loses in defending the case. In addition, if the judge decides that the petition was filed in bad faith the court may also award the debtor punitive damages.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Effects of Declaring Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The old adage that it is better to know how to swim before jumping into deep water applies to anyone considering filing bankruptcy. Although under federal law it is illegal for an employer to discharge or discriminate against an employee who has filed a bankruptcy case, there are other potentially adverse effects of which to be aware.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Poor Credit Rating </STRONG></H3></A>
Consumer laws allow credit agencies to list on reports of a person's credit history all of that person's bankruptcy filings in the preceding ten years. This means that mortgage companies, banks, credit card companies, landlords, employers, and all others who can legally obtain a copy of a person's credit report will know about that person's troubled financial past. Filing bankruptcy can make it difficult to obtain credit for those ten years. 
<P>
According to the Illinois State Bar Association, while each case is different, some people find that obtaining future credit is easier if they file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy and attempt to repay some of their debts, rather than file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and make no attempt to repay.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Creditor Scrutiny </STRONG></H3></A>
One of the first events in a bankruptcy is a meeting between the debtor and all the debtor's creditors. At this meeting, the creditors and a court-appointed trustee are allowed to examine all of the debtor's financial records, such as bank statements and loan documents, and ask questions about how money has been spent. For anyone with anything unsavory or illegal to hide, such as gambling debts with a bookie, a bankruptcy proceeding can be incriminating.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Cost </STRONG></H3></A>
Understandably, bankruptcy attorneys are very careful about a client's ability to pay legal bills. A bankruptcy attorney will usually collect enough money in advance from a near-bankrupt client to handle a typical bankruptcy filing. This may be more than some clients can pay, especially if there is any contest with creditors. In addition, the trustee in charge of a bankruptcy case is paid by commission, a percentage of the money that the trustee distributes to pay creditors.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="230"><H2><STRONG>Other Forms of Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There are three other kinds of bankruptcy filings that are not discussed more fully in this chapter because of their limited relevance to consumers. Knowing about them can help one better understand bankruptcy options.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 9 </STRONG></H3></A>
Chapter 9 is a very rare form of bankruptcy available only to municipalities.
<P>
<A NAME="250"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 11 </STRONG></H3></A>
Chapter 11 is available for corporations, partnerships, and individuals but is mostly used by troubled corporations and partnerships. Chapter 11 allows the debtor to remain in operation while being sheltered from some of its debts. Chapter 11 bankruptcy is discussed more fully in the <STRONG><A HREF="../../ilhome.html">Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Illinois Business Guide</A> </STRONG>
<P>
<A NAME="260"><H3><STRONG>Farm Bankruptcies </STRONG></H3></A>
Chapter 12 is available only to family farmers and is designed to allow farmers to stay in business while attempting to pay off their debts. Chapter 12 offers several advantages over other bankruptcy chapters because it recognizes the seasonal nature of most agricultural income, the difficulty of predicting in advance how much a farmer will profit from a crop, and the fact that most farmers need much more credit than do most individuals. Chapter 12 was originally scheduled to be repealed on October 1, 1993, but the repeal date was pushed back to October 1, 1998. Chapter 12 bankruptcy is discussed more fully in the <STRONG>><A HREF="../../ilhome.html">Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Illinois Business Guide</A></STRONG>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="270"><H2><STRONG>Transfers to Avoid Losing an Asset in Bankruptcy</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Some transfers that are valid outside the context of bankruptcy are invalid in bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Code empowers a bankruptcy trustee to invalidate certain transfers made prior to a bankruptcy filing.
<P>
<A NAME="280"><H3><STRONG>Fraudulent Conveyances </STRONG></H3></A>
The Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act is designed to remove any temptation a debtor may have to hide property, by giving it to a relative, for example, before declaring bankruptcy. Any transfer of the debtor's assets made within 90 days of filing bankruptcy, or one year if a relative or business associate is involved, is carefully scrutinized by the Bankruptcy Court. If the court determines that the debtor attempted to defraud creditors by selling property at a below-market price, the court can order that property or other assets be given over to the trustee. Anything sold at a reasonable market value before a bankruptcy filing cannot be recovered by the court under the rules of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act.
<P>
<A NAME="290"><H3><STRONG>Preferences </STRONG></H3></A>
A preference occurs when a debtor treats one creditor more favorably than another. For instance, if a debtor with only $100 owes $100 each to creditors A and B and pays A completely, leaving nothing for B, then A has received a preference. Bankruptcy condemns preferences if the following conditions exist:
<UL>
<LI>Transfer is for the benefit of a creditor
<LI>Transfer is made for debt owed prior to the initiation of bankruptcy
<LI>Debtor is insolvent at the time of transfer
<LI>Transfer is made 90 days before filing of the bankruptcy or one year before filing if made to an insider such as a relative or director of a corporate debtor
</UL>
Creditors receiving preferences can be forced to return them to the debtor's estate.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="300"><H2><STRONG>Collection Agencies and the Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Although not a part of Bankruptcy Code, laws regulating collection agencies are usually of concern to anyone experiencing financial difficulties. Both state and federal laws limit the kinds of activities that a collection agency can engage in as it tries to collect a debt. These laws only apply to third-party collection agencies and not to in-house collections. That is, if a creditor tries on its own to induce its delinquent accounts to pay their overdue bills it is not required to follow the laws governing collection agencies. But if a creditor turns collection matters over to a collection agency, the collection agency's employees must follow the rules. Laws regulating debt collection agencies are discussed more fully in the <A HREF="c05.html">Consumer Protection</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="310"><H2><STRONG>Alternatives to Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Anyone in financial trouble has undoubtedly received many letters from creditors demanding payment on debts owed. Even a very demanding creditor may have a change of heart once a debtor mentions the possibility of filing bankruptcy, because creditors know that bankruptcy means that they may only get a fraction of what is owed them. 
<P>
Anyone confident that existing financial problems are only temporary may want to consider asking major creditors to accept reduced payments for a short period or asking for a short delay in making payments. Provided that the debtor has not already given creditors reason to doubt the debtor's sincerity, e.g., by completely ignoring their letters or by consistently breaking promises, chances are good that creditors will agree to one of these plans. 
<P>
As mentioned above, creditors know that bankruptcy means they will probably get just a small fraction of the total sum owed them. A creditor also knows that if it sues to collect its money, it must ask a judge to issue a court order to garnish the debtor's wages. This is time-consuming and costly. All these factors make it more likely that a creditor will agree to a repayment plan. 
<P>
Many creditors can be understanding if approached with a reduced or delayed payment plan accurately spelling out the debtor's financial situation and showing that the debtor is trying to spread out meager resources in a way that tries to please everyone. A consumer credit counselor can help set up such a plan. Credit counselors can help to analyze and organize one's finances to set up a deferred or reduced payment plan. 
<P>
In a typical case, a credit counselor devises a repayment plan that is then described in a form letter to be mailed to the debtor's major creditors. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using credit counselors, however. On the plus side, creditors who see that a debtor has taken the effort to consult with a credit advisor may be more likely to accept a repayment plan because seeing a credit counselor shows that the debtor is serious about getting out of debt. But credit counseling services also charge fees for their work, which may be more than an already-stressed budget can handle. However, there are some nonprofit agencies that offer credit counseling for a sliding-scale fee.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Civil Appellate Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

After a decision is rendered in a civil case by a trial judge or jury, the party who "loses" has the right to have the decision reviewed by a higher court. This process, known as the appeals or appellate process, is the subject of this chapter. Court proceedings prior to appeal are outlined in the <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Case: Civil & Criminal</A> Chapter. The court system in general is covered in the <A HREF="c02.html">Illinois Judicial Systems</A> Chapter.
<P>
Appellate courts are set up just to make appellate decisions. So, too, many lawyers practice only appellate law. One reason for this legal specialty is that arguing an appeal is quite different from representing a party in a trial.
<P>
A party who disagrees with a judge's or jury's decision should seek the advice of an appellate lawyer regarding the prospects of a better outcome on appeal. A party served with a notice that the opposing party is appealing the decision likewise should contact an appellate attorney.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>What Is an Appeal? </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Appeal is the term used to describe the process by which a higher court reviews the decision of a lower (trial) court. The right to appeal an adverse legal decision is granted by the United States Constitution and the Illinois Constitution. This appeals system provides a check on the power of a judge or jury. Judges who interpret the law erroneously will have their decisions overturned by a court with authority to do so. Judges know that their governance over every case may be checked by an appellate court.
<P>
Some appeals are granted only at the discretion of the appellate court. The United States Supreme Court, because it cannot review every single case decided in the federal system, hears appeals only at its discretion.
<P>
A party who had a court decision made against him or her is the party with the right to appeal. (Only under very rare circumstances can a party appeal a favorable decision on the ground that he or she disagrees with the reasoning of the decision.) The party who appeals is known as the appellant. In opposition to the appellant is the appellee, the party who agrees with the outcome of the trial and who will argue during the appeal that the judge's or jury's decision should be left alone.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Requirements for Appealing a Decision </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Finality </STRONG></H3></A>
Not every determination made by a judge is appealable. Only final judgments, decisions that conclude the case in that court once and for all, are appealable. If a particular decision was not final, it is not time for an appeal.
<P>
Throughout the course of any civil trial, the trial judge may make numerous decisions. The judge may rule on a motion to limit the scope of questions that may be asked in a deposition, or may grant or deny a request that the case be dismissed on the ground that there is insufficient evidence of wrongdoing. Any court order that does not complete the case is not considered a final order. For example, if the judge denies a motion to dismiss, the proceedings will continue and the order denying the motion is considered an interim or interlocutory order, not a final order. On the other hand, if the judge grants the motion to dismiss the case, that order is final. A decision regarding the subject matter of the case has been made: sufficient grounds do not exist for the case to continue. The final decision (also called a final disposition, final judgment, or final order) disposes of the case as far as that court is concerned.
<P>
Generally, a final decision is made after a hearing. The judge or jury has heard all the evidence, and it makes a decision. A finding that the plaintiff proved or failed to prove his or her case ends the litigation at that stage. The final order is appealable.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Timeliness </STRONG></H3></A>
If the lower court has not yet rendered its final decision, the appeal is not appropriate. For another court to give its input into the proceedings while they are still going on would be confusing and inefficient for everyone involved.
<P>
Thus, only a final decision is appealable. The right to appeal, though, does not last forever. Parties are bound to keep things moving along by exercising the right to appeal within a reasonable length of time after the final judgment is rendered. Like a statute of limitations, every court has a rule dictating the length of time after the final judgment during which an appeal may be made. For example, in the federal system, a federal district court's final decision generally must be appealed within 30 days (or 60 days if the United States or its agent or officer is a party) or the party who wishes to appeal loses that right forever.
<P>
Sometimes, there is a question as to when the final judgment of the trial court was entered. In an employment discrimination case in which a plaintiff sought back pay and other damages, a court issued an order setting forth its findings of fact and conclusions of law and stating that judgment was for the plaintiff and against the defendant. Some months later, the court issued another order awarding back pay and a retroactive promotion to the plaintiff. Yet another order was entered in the next month, in which the court granted the plaintiff attorney's fees and litigation expenses. A question arose about when the clock started ticking for the defendant to file a notice of appeal. Which order was the final order for purposes of appeal? The appeals court held that the last order, granting fees and expenses, was the final judgment in the case, because it dispensed with the last of the issues raised in the plaintiff's complaint.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>The Scope of Review </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
What an appeals court has authority to decide is limited. The appellant must outline the specific question it wants answered by the appeals court. The question may be as broad as, "Did the trial court err in deciding in favor of the plaintiff?" or it may be very specific. Usually, the appellant asks that several critical questions be answered. Historically, rather than "filing an appeal" a party was said to file a "writ of error." The writ of error was a request to a higher court to overturn the lower court's final decision based on a critical error in reasoning or, simply, because the decision was wrong.
<P>
A plaintiff who loses an age discrimination case, for instance, may file an appeal challenging the bases upon which the trial judge made his or her decision. This appeal might be structured as:
<UL>
<LI>Did the trial judge err when she ruled that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act did not apply?
<LI>Did the trial judge err when she ruled that the plaintiff was required to show that he was replaced by a worker outside the protected age group?
<LI>Did the trial judge err when she ruled that the plaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case?
</UL>
Because appeals are structured in this way, it is sometimes said that the actions of the trial judge are on trial, not the actions of the parties to the original litigation.
<P>
In fact, the parties do not have a chance to re-litigate the case before the appeals court. The trial level is the only opportunity to submit evidence, examine and cross-examine witnesses, and argue the facts and the law of the case. The appeals court only considers whether the trial was conducted properly and whether the outcome was reached by proper application of the law to the facts. As noted above, the only question for an appeals court may be very specific, such as whether a particular document should have been submitted. But only issues that were raised originally in the trial court can be challenged at the appellate level.
<P>
The body of evidence--argument, testimony, and objections considered in the trial court--is all that may be considered by the appeals panel. This body of evidence is called the record. Every piece of evidence and every argument made by the parties' lawyers is recorded into one big document, the record, which is said to "close" once the trial is over. Once the record is closed, no more evidence can be included. Also, no more objections to evidence can be made.
At the appeals level, the court is restricted to review of the record. A party cannot offer new evidence or new objections for the appellate court to consider. The age discrimination plaintiff, for example, may not ask the appellate court to overturn the decision of the trial judge based on a new document that the trial judge never saw. The trial was the only opportunity to present the document. On the other hand, the plaintiff may argue on appeal that the judge should have allowed his coworker to testify, as long as the plaintiff made that argument in his original case. He may give the appellate court an indication of what the coworker would have said, so the court can weigh whether the exclusion of the testimony was harmful to the plaintiff's case.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>The Appellate Decision </STRONG></H3></A>
Because the appeals court only reviews the actions of the lower court--not the actions of the parties--its decision is couched in terms of whether the lower court made the right decision. The options for an appeals court are:
<UL>
<LI><B>Affirm</B>: The appeals court may affirm the lower court's decree, judgment, or order, which is a declaration that the decision of the lower court was right and it will stand.
<LI><B>Error</B>: If the appellate court holds that the lower court's decision was erroneous, it will reverse, modify, or remand (see below). It may rule that the mistake was a harmless error, which means that even though there was an error, it did not affect the outcome of the case enough to make a difference. Maybe a particular witness should have been allowed to testify, but the testimony would have been similar to that of a witness who did take the stand and whose testimony did not carry much weight, so the jury probably would not have found the excluded testimony very compelling. Excluding the witness was harmless error.
<LI><B>Modify</B>: A final trial court decision may be affirmed by a higher court with minor modification that does not affect the substance or general findings of the decision.
<LI><B>Remand</B>: The remand of a case is the sending it back to the lower court with instructions about what the lower court should do. Usually, a remand means there were errors in the trial court's decision to such an extent that the appellate court cannot correct the errors itself. The lower court must reconsider the case based on the appellate court's instructions.
<LI><B>Reverse</B>: An appeals court decision to reverse a case is a ruling that the trial court should have reached the opposite conclusion. A finding for the plaintiff should have been a finding that the defendant was not liable; a finding for the defendant should have been a ruling that there was enough evidence to find the defendant liable. Unlike a remand, the appeals court has enough evidence in the record to make a determination to reverse. Sometimes, the appeals court reverses and remands at the same time. In this situation, the court has enough information to reverse the trial court's bottom line, its ultimate decision, but some questions (such as the amount of damages) still need to be worked out on remand.
</UL>
In addition to these different options, appeals courts often hand down decisions that combine several different rulings. A court may reverse in part and affirm in part, or it may affirm a judgment as modified by the points described in its opinion.

<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Appeals Courts and Appellate Procedure </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>The Federal Appellate Structure </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal appellate system consists of 13 federal circuits, each of which has one appellate court, called a court of appeals, and the United States Supreme Court. Within each of the federal circuits are several federal district courts that serve as trial courts for issues of federal concern. Parties who are dissatisfied with the outcome of a district court case have the right to appeal to the court of appeals encompassing that district. Illinois is located in the Seventh Circuit; thus, a case heard in a federal district court in Illinois (such as the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois) would be appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which is located in Chicago. (Indiana and Wisconsin are in the Seventh Circuit also.)
<P>
The United States Supreme Court hears some cases that are appealed "as of right." Mandatory appeals to the Supreme Court are made only in cases decided by a district court composed of three judges, chiefly in actions to enjoin legislative apportionments on constitutional grounds. Most cases reach the Court by an application process known as petitioning for certiorari. Review by the United States Supreme Court requires more than just the belief by a party that the wrong decision was made in his or her case; the case must be of important enough concern to federal law that its issues should be decided by the Court.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Illinois' Appellate Structure </STRONG></H3></A>
Like the federal judicial system, the Illinois court system has three tiers, two of which are appellate. Illinois' judicial circuit courts are the trial-level courts in which actions are filed. There are 22 judicial circuits in Illinois. Circuit courts also have some appellate authority, as final orders of lower tribunals and administrative actions sometimes are appealable to the circuit courts. There are five judicial districts, each of which has an appellate court--the court with appellate jurisdiction in standard cases. The judicial districts have courts in Chicago, Elgin, Ottawa, Springfield, and Mount Vernon. The Illinois Supreme Court is the highest court for determining important questions of Illinois law. Located in Springfield, the Illinois Supreme Court directly reviews the final decisions of the appellate courts.
<P>
The right to appeal an adverse decision is granted by the Illinois Constitution. Generally, the appellant must file a Notice of Appeal and pay a filing fee within 30 days of the final order.

</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

This chapter outlines some criminal law issues and focuses on misdemeanors, for which punishments are relatively less severe than for felonies. Felonies are covered in the <A HREF="c13.html">Criminal Law: Felonies &amp; White Collar Crime</A> Chapter, along with white collar crimes, the rights of persons accused of crimes, and the rights of crime victims.
<P>
This chapter also discusses driving-under-the-influence violations, as well as the juvenile justice system. The <A HREF="c16.html">Family Law</A> Chapter covers domestic abuse and protective orders, and the <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Case: Civil &amp; Criminal</A> Chapter describes criminal procedure. Private causes of action that result from criminal conduct are covered in the Personal Injury Law Chapters.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Criminal Codes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Criminal law defines conduct that is prohibited by the government and the range of penalties that can be imposed for violating these prohibitions. Depending on the nature of the crime, a person who violates a criminal law incurs penalties including fines and/or imprisonment. By definition, misdemeanors are crimes for which a person may be committed to no more than one year of imprisonment. Illinois also has laws that allow the authorities to seize property connected with the commission of a crime. For example, a person convicted repeatedly for driving under the influence of alcohol may have his or her driver's license confiscated and driving privileges revoked by the government. Similarly, a person charged with violating laws connected with controlled substances must forfeit the substances as well as the raw materials used to make the drugs, vehicles and real property used to further the crime, and any money or other proceeds from the sale of the controlled substances.
<P>
Every crime is defined by a list of elements. In a criminal trial, the prosecutor attempts to prove all the elements of the crime the person is accused of committing. If all elements are proven, the judge or the jury finds the person guilty of the crime. However, even for minor criminal violations, the accused may not be found guilty unless the jury or judge finds him or her guilty "beyond a reasonable doubt."
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Attempt, Conspiracy, Aiding and Abetting </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Anyone who, with intent to commit a crime, takes a substantial step toward committing the crime may be guilty of attempt to commit a crime. Merely thinking about committing a crime, or even preparing to commit a crime, is not an attempt; there must be a substantial step. For example, if a group of teenagers talks about how easy they think it would be to walk out of a store with a pair of jeans, they have not committed a crime, nor have they committed an attempted crime. However, if they deactivate a store's alarm system so it cannot detect what passes through the doors, they probably have committed a tampering or vandalism crime as well as attempted theft. They have taken a substantial step toward the commission of the theft.
The law of conspiracy and the law of aiding and abetting are other general doctrines that apply to a wide range of offenses. Conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime. For example, if three people conspire to preclude all potential renters who fall within a protected group from renting apartments in their building, and if the apartment manager actually rejects those people, they all can be charged with both conspiracy and violating the civil rights law. Even if a conspirator backs out of the conspiracy, but the other conspirators commit the crime, all conspirators may be criminally liable if the acts were reasonably foreseeable.
<P>
A person who aids or advises another in committing a crime may be guilty of aiding and abetting, and may be criminally liable for the acts of the other person, as well. Thus, if someone intentionally advises another how to commit a crime, both people are equally liable under the law.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Misdemeanors </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Criminal codes penalize a variety of activities, and many offenses are listed as violations of the law under the Illinois Criminal Code. Under the Criminal Code, misdemeanors range from unlawfully interfering with a public utility to criminal trespass to a residence, a vehicle, or real property, to intentionally damaging a traffic sign or traffic light. Under the law, many crimes are misdemeanors on the first offense, but become felonies on the second offense. This means that, for example, retail theft of property valued at less than $150 is a misdemeanor the first time. If a person already has been convicted of retail theft (shoplifting) and is arrested again for a similar action, the person will be charged with felony retail theft.
<P>
As mentioned, misdemeanors usually carry a maximum punishment of a fine and less than one year of incarceration. Crimes for which a person may be punished by more than one year in jail or in prison are categorized in Illinois as felonies.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Crimes Causing Harm to Property </STRONG></H3></A>
Theft, burglary, and robbery are felonies in Illinois unless the value of the property taken is under $300. Similarly, whether a crime against property is charged as a misdemeanor or a felony depends on the value of the property taken or damaged. The statute prohibiting criminal damage to property, for example, proscribes knowingly or recklessly damaging another's property, setting a fire on another's property, injuring another's domestic animal, and setting a stink bomb or other offensive-smelling compound on another's property. If the damage to the property is no more than $300, these crimes are misdemeanors; if the damage equals more than $300, the crimes are felonies. Similarly, criminal defacement of property is knowingly damaging another's property with paint, an etching tool, a writing instrument, or a similar device; the severity of punishment depends on the level of offense, which is a misdemeanor or felony depending on whether the property damage exceeds $300. In contrast, trespass to another person's property generally is a misdemeanor, while arson is always a felony.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Civil Rights Crimes </STRONG></H3></A>
The Illinois Human Rights Act forbids discrimination in employment, housing, financial credit, and public accommodations on the basis of age, ancestry, citizenship, color, disability, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex, or unfavorable military discharge. Violation of these prohibitions can subject the violator to criminal prosecution.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Sex Crimes </STRONG></H3></A>
Some actions involving sex are illegal misdemeanors under Illinois law, unless the person charged has been convicted of a previous offense or unless a child is involved, in which case they are felonies that carry more severe punishment. Prostitution, pimping, and solicitation are misdemeanors.
<P>
It is criminal sexual abuse, sometimes called statutory rape, for any one to have sexual penetration or sexual conduct with a victim under the age of 17. Criminal sexual abuse also can be sexual conduct other than sexual penetration in which force is used or the victim was unable to consent.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Alcohol and Drug-Related Traffic Offenses </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Alcohol and drug-related traffic offenses, commonly known as driving under the influence (DUI) are frequently prosecuted crimes in Illinois. If a person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is .10 or greater and the person is in physical control of a motor vehicle, he or she is considered to be driving under the influence. Even if a person's BAC is more than .05 but less than .10, the person may face DUI charges if there is other evidence to show DUI. It is a DUI-related offense to carry alcoholic beverages in a vehicle, unless the beverages are sealed in the original containers. A person also can be held liable for serving alcohol to someone who commits a DUI offense.
<P>
A person age 21 or over who is convicted of DUI the first time faces a mandatory sentence of losing driving privileges for at least one year, as well as possible imprisonment. If the person had a child in the car at the time of the arrest, the judge must add to the punishment a fine of $500 to $1000 and five days of community service. Subsequent convictions carry increased jail time, higher fines, mandatory community service for ten days, and/or loss of driving privileges for up to six years.
<P>
Illinois recently began a "zero tolerance" campaign to address the problem of DUI, especially among drivers under age 21. The first time a person under age 21 is convicted of DUI, he or she automatically loses driving privileges for two years and may face imprisonment and a fine, as well. Subsequent convictions have more severe mandatory penalties. For drivers under age 21, "zero tolerance" means it is illegal to drive with a BAC of more than .00, even if the BAC is not as high as what some people consider enough to make them intoxicated. For the first such offense a driver automatically loses his or her license for three months; for subsequent offenses he or she loses driving privileges for one year. Refusing to submit to chemical testing for BAC also carries with it a mandatory suspension of driving privileges.
Other alcohol or drug-related traffic offenses include reckless homicide (discussed in the <A HREF="c13.html">Criminal Law: Felonies &amp; White Collar Crime</A> Chapter) under the influence and aggravated DUI. Aggravated DUI is committed if the offender:
<UL>
<LI>Has three or more DUI convictions
<LI>Commits DUI while driving a school bus full of children
<LI>Is convicted of DUI after a collision that caused great bodily harm or permanent disfigurement or disability
<LI>Has a second DUI conviction after a DUI conviction that caused reckless homicide or great bodily injury
</UL>
Aggravated DUI carries with it a loss of driving privileges for one year, a minimum fine of $10,000, and possible imprisonment for one to three years.
<P>
Numerous other offenses connected to DUI are misdemeanors in Illinois. Offenses include:
<UL>
<LI>Falsifying a driver's license
<LI>Failing to carry valid automobile insurance
<LI>Allowing one's residence to be used by children under the age of 21 to drink
<LI>Selling alcohol to a minor or an intoxicated person
<LI>Knowingly renting a hotel or motel room to a person under the age of 21 who is drinking alcoholic beverages
<LI>Allowing a person under the influence of alcohol to operate one's vehicle
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Juveniles and the Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Illinois has a juvenile court system for minors that operates separately from other courts. The purpose of this separate system is to help serve the best interests of juveniles, rather than simply punish them. Generally, minors under age 17 who run afoul of the law are said to commit delinquent acts rather than crimes. The distinction is one of words only. Delinquent acts committed by a minor are called crimes if committed by an adult. Minors between the ages of 15 and 17 who commit certain crimes, such as first degree murder, are prosecuted as if they are adults.
<P>
The most significant distinction between the juvenile court system and adult criminal courts is in courtroom procedures. Juvenile courts generally are less formal than other courts. For example, minors being adjudicated or giving courtroom testimony in some cases can have a supportive person present during their testimony. Juvenile cases are heard in an adjudication hearing by a judge who determines the guilt or innocence of a minor accused of committing a delinquent act. Sometimes these hearings are closed to the public. Records made by law enforcement officers about delinquent minors must be kept confidential and separate from other arrest records. Only under certain circumstances may records from juvenile court be used in other legal proceedings.
<P>
Illinois has strict laws that seek to address juvenile gang violence. When the state seeks to try a violent juvenile delinquent on criminal charges, it may include in its petition evidence that the criminal activity was gang-related, and the judge may consider this evidence and order the minor tried as an adult. For example, if a 16-year-old minor allegedly committed a forcible felony that was part of criminal gang activity, and the minor already was declared a juvenile delinquent, the judge will order the case to be heard in criminal court.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Crime Victims' Rights </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Some crime victims have the right to compensation for the crimes committed against them. This means that a crime victim may receive compensation for certain expenses or losses, such as medical expenses or loss of support if the crime victim becomes unable to support dependents. There are requirements that must be met for a victim to get reimbursement, and victims must file an application for consideration with the Illinois Court of Claims for compensation. The maximum amount a victim can receive from the Court of Claims is $25,000.
<P>
Under some Illinois laws, the victim may receive compensation from the person who committed the crime. This is called restitution. For example, a person whose vehicle is stolen may be able to receive compensation for the vehicle. In this case, the state arranges to collect the money from the criminal and sends a check to the victim when all the restitution has been made.
<P>
The Illinois Victims Rights Constitutional Amendment gives all victims the right to be treated with fairness, the right to privacy, the right to make a statement at sentencing, and the right to reasonable protection from the accused during the criminal justice proceedings. Victims of the most violent crimes also have the right to be notified of the status of the investigation, whether an indictment has been brought, the time and place of any hearings, and when the defendant is released from custody.
<P>
If the court does not order restitution, or if a prosecutor does not press charges, the victim still has the option to seek compensation directly by suing the offender in civil court. This option is discussed more fully in the <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Case: Civil &amp; Criminal</A> Chapter.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Criminal Law: Felonies & White Collar Crime
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

This chapter outlines how the criminal justice system operates and describes the most serious criminal violations--felonies and white collar crime. It also includes information about the rights of persons accused of crimes and the rights of crime victims. Domestic abuse and protective orders are covered in the <A HREF="c16.html">Family Law</A> Chapter. Criminal procedure is covered in the <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Case: Civil & Criminal</A> Chapter. Private causes of action that result from criminal conduct are covered in the Personal Injury Law Chapters. Finally, misdemeanors, the juvenile justice system, and driving-under-the-influence violations are covered in the <A HREF="c12.html">Criminal Law: DUI & Misdemeanors</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Criminal Codes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Criminal law defines conduct that is prohibited by the government and the range of penalties that can be imposed for violating these prohibitions. Persons who violate criminal laws incur penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment or, in some states, execution. All crimes are defined by statutes. These statutes are collected and organized into books of rules known as criminal codes. In addition to the Illinois state criminal code, which applies only in Illinois, the federal government has a criminal code that regulates certain crimes nationwide. Most criminal activity violates either a state law or a federal law, not both; however, an important exception is drug crimes, which can be prosecuted in either state or federal court or both.
<P>
Every crime is defined by a list of elements. In a criminal trial, the prosecutor attempts to prove all the elements of the crime the person is accused of committing. If the judge or the jury decides all the elements of the crime have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused person is guilty of the crime. If the prosecutor cannot prove all the elements, the accused cannot be found guilty of the crime.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Attempt, Conspiracy, Aiding and Abetting </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Anyone who, with intent to commit a crime, takes a substantial step toward committing the crime may be guilty of attempt to commit a crime. Merely thinking about committing a crime is not a crime; even preparation for a crime is not a substantial step. For example, if someone buys a gun with intent to kill another person, the act of buying is mere preparation. However, going to a person's house after buying a gun with intent to kill the person may be a substantial step that is enough to charge a person with attempting to commit a crime.
<P>
The law of conspiracy and the law of aiding and abetting are other general doctrines that apply to a wide range of offenses. A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime. For example, if three people conspire to commit murder, at least one of them takes action to further the conspiracy, and the murder actually occurs, they all can be charged with both conspiracy and murder. Even if a conspirator backs out of the conspiracy, but the other conspirators commit the crime, all conspirators may be criminally liable if the acts were reasonably foreseeable.
<P>
A person who intentionally aids or advises another in committing a crime may be guilty of aiding and abetting, and may be criminally liable for the acts of the other person, as well. Thus, if someone intentionally advises another how to commit robbery and lends the robber a car to use in the getaway, both people are equally liable under the law.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Offenses </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Criminal codes penalize a variety of activities. Generally, an offense is any violation of the Illinois Criminal Code. The Criminal Code makes a major distinction between felonies and misdemeanors. A felony is a crime for which a person can be sentenced to one year or more in the penitentiary, or to death. Misdemeanors are crimes for which a person can be sentenced to less than one year in the penitentiary.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Felonies </STRONG></H3></A>
The most violent crimes, such as murder and rape, as well as so-called white collar crimes, generally are felonies under the Illinois Criminal Code.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Crimes Causing Harm to Persons </STRONG></H4></A>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG><EM>Homicide and Suicide </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Homicide is the unlawful killing of another human being. There are several types of homicide: murder, manslaughter, and reckless homicide. All forms of homicide are felonies.
<P>
Murder is the unlawful killing of another with intent to kill. Murder is divided into subcategories by degree of seriousness. First degree murder is killing someone with intent to kill or to cause great bodily harm, or knowing that one's actions will cause death or create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm. First degree murder also includes unlawful killing during the commission of a forcible felony. Second degree murder is similar to first degree murder, except at the time of the killing the offender has the unreasonable belief that the killing is justified, or the offender is acting under an intense and sudden passion resulting from being provoked.
<P>
Manslaughter and reckless homicide differ from murder because these crimes do not require proof of intent. Under Illinois law, involuntary manslaughter is unintentionally killing another person while engaged in an action that is likely to cause death or great bodily harm, if the action is done recklessly. However, if the cause of death is by a person recklessly driving a motor vehicle, the crime is called reckless homicide.
Suicide is taking one's own life. Suicide and attempted suicide no longer are crimes in Illinois. However, it is a crime to induce another to commit suicide.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG><EM>Assault and Battery </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Under Illinois law, assault and battery are separate crimes. Assault is defined as an act that makes another person have reasonable apprehension of battery. Battery means intentionally or knowingly and without legal justification causing bodily harm to another person, or making an insulting or provoking physical contact with a person. Aggravated assault is an assault with a mask or a weapon, or an assault against a person the offender knows is a government employee, a person with a disability, a police officer, or a senior citizen. Aggravated battery is a battery committed under the same particular circumstances as aggravated assault. Other laws make battery of particular people, such as family members, criminal acts. These laws include domestic battery, battery or aggravated battery of an unborn child, aggravated battery of a child or institutionalized mentally retarded person, and aggravated battery of a senior citizen. A separate statute makes transmission of HIV a crime if the person knows he or she is infected with HIV and contaminates another person through sexual contact, donation of blood or other body fluids, or sells or shares drug paraphernalia. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG><EM>Rape </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Criminal sexual assault--also known as rape--is a felony that carries with it severe penalties. Criminal sexual assault is sexual penetration by force or threat of force, without consent of the victim, or against a minor. Aggravated criminal sexual assault is criminal sexual assault when one of the following occurs:
<UL>
<LI>A dangerous weapon was used or displayed
<LI>The offender caused bodily harm
<LI>The rape occurred during the course of another felony
<LI>The victim was over 60 years of age
<LI>The victim had a physical disability
<LI>The victim was under nine years of age
<LI>The victim was institutionalized and severely mentally retarded
</UL>
It is criminal sexual abuse, sometimes called statutory rape, for any one to have sexual penetration or sexual conduct with a victim under the age of 17. Criminal sexual abuse also can be sexual conduct other than sexual penetration in which force is used or the victim was unable to consent.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG><EM>Kidnapping </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Kidnapping is secretly and knowingly confining a person against his or her will, or using deceit, enticement, force, or threat of force to cause a person to go from one place to another with the intention of secretly and knowingly confining that person against his or her will. Confining a child 12 years old or younger without the consent of the child's parent also constitutes kidnapping. Aggravated kidnapping is kidnapping under additional circumstances or with additional actions, such as kidnapping while wearing a mask or with a dangerous weapon, or kidnapping for ransom. All forms of kidnapping are felonies.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG><EM>Intimidation </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The crime of intimidation is defined as intending to cause another person to act a certain way by threatening the person by phone, by mail, or in person. The threats can include threatening to
<UL>
<LI>Hurt the person, another person, or property
<LI>Physically confine or restrain the person
<LI>Commit a crime or accuse the other person of committing a crime
<LI>Expose the person to hatred or ridicule
<LI>Cause a strike or boycott
</UL>
In Illinois, intimidation is a felony.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG><EM>Stalking </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Stalking also is a felony. Stalking is the crime of knowingly following a person or putting the person under surveillance without justification, combined with threatening the person or causing the person to believe the stalker will harm him or her physically. The acts of following or watching must occur on at least two separate occasions to be stalking. A person commits aggravated stalking by actually causing physical harm. Another form of aggravated stalking is stalking that violates an order of protection. Orders of protection are described in detail in the <A HREF="c16.html">Family Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG><EM>Hate Crime </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Illinois law prohibits hate crime, which is defined as a crime such as assault, battery, or theft committed against a person because of his or her ancestry, color, disability, gender, national origin, race, or sexual orientation. For example, a group of white youths who chased and beat two black youths, referring to them using racial insults, were guilty of a hate crime in Illinois.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Federal Drug and Gun Laws </STRONG></H4></A>
Federal laws contain harsh penalties for distributing controlled substances, especially if firearms are even remotely involved. For example, any person who possesses, with intent to distribute, five grams of crack cocaine is subject to a mandatory sentence of five years without parole. If a gun is available for use or is being carried during a drug transaction--even if it is not used--a mandatory five-year sentence must be imposed consecutively to a conviction for the drug offense. Thus, the person with five grams of crack cocaine with intent to distribute would receive a mandatory ten-year sentence without parole if he or she was carrying a gun. In most circumstances, federal judges cannot depart from these mandatory sentences. Penalties for controlled substance offenses become even harsher as quantities of the contraband increase.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Crimes Causing Harm to Property </STRONG></H4></A>
Depending on the value of the property involved, as well as the level of violence, most property crimes are felonies in Illinois. The legal definition of theft is obtaining, exerting control over, and intending to deprive; or knowingly using, concealing, or abandoning so as to deprive a person of his or her property. This definition is much broader than what most people think of as theft. It can include writing bad checks, keeping found property without making a reasonable attempt to find its rightful owner, misusing trade secrets, unlawfully tapping into cable television or other television services, interfering with public utilities, or taking large sums of money by deception from persons over age 60. Unless the value of the property taken is $300 or less, the crime of theft is a felony. Additionally, theft always is a felony if a firearm is involved or if the accused has been convicted previously of theft, burglary, or robbery. Burglary, because it involves entering or remaining in a building or dwelling without authority and with the intent to commit theft or a felony there, generally is a felony. Not only is it burglary to enter a house unlawfully with the intent to steal money or property, but it also is burglary to enter with the intent to commit a felony such as arson or murder. Similarly, robbery almost always is felonious. Robbery is unlawfully taking personal property from another person or in the presence of the other person while using or threatening to use force against the person. Aggravated robbery is robbery committed with a dangerous weapon.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>White Collar Crimes </STRONG></H3></A>
Although there is no fixed definition of white collar crime, a number of nonviolent crimes frequently are grouped together as white collar crimes. The term "white collar crime" generally is used to describe crimes that have cheating or dishonesty as their common basis. These crimes typically are committed by professionals or entrepreneurs under cover of legitimate business activity. Such crimes may be difficult to prosecute because of their complexity. Often they carry lesser penalties because they are not associated with violence. However, defendants convicted of white collar crimes may incur enormous fines, be ordered to pay restitution, or spend time in jail. Today, there is a trend toward stricter punishment for white collar crimes, as people recognize the financial damage white collar criminals inflict on society.
<P>
As a practical matter, it is impossible to describe every activity that fits within the definition of white collar crime, because white collar crime takes many forms. Some criminal actions are prohibited by specific laws narrowly drawn to outlaw a particular activity. Other actions are not covered by specific laws but instead are prosecuted under one or more "catch-all" laws criminalizing dishonest behavior generally.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Bribery </STRONG></H4></A>
Federal law and Illinois law both prohibit bribery. The purpose of most bribery statutes is to prevent people from seeking preferential treatment from public officials and to prevent public officers from using their offices for personal gain. Specifically, if a government official is offered or seeks anything of value for himself or herself in exchange for performing an official act, a fraudulous action, or any action in violation of his or her official duty, the elements of bribery may be met.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Computer Crime </STRONG></H4></A>
Computer crime is an area of the law in which the government appears to be playing catch-up with the growth in new technologies. Some variations of computer crime are so new that there are no specific laws to address them, and general laws in existence do not seem adequate in proscribing the particular illicit activities.
<P>
Generally, the conduct specifically outlawed by federal statute includes:
<UL>
<LI>Knowingly accessing a computer, without authorization or exceeding authorization, and thereby obtaining confidential national security information
<LI>Intentionally accessing a computer, without authorization or exceeding authorization, and thereby obtaining the financial information of a financial institution or of a credit card issuer
<LI>Intentionally accessing, without authorization, a computer of a federal department or agency used exclusively by that department or agency or affecting the government's use thereof
<LI>Knowingly, and with intent to defraud, accessing a federal interest computer, without authorization or exceeding authorization, to further a fraud or obtain anything of value
<LI>Intentionally accessing a federal interest computer, without authorization, to alter, damage, or destroy information and thereby causing a loss of $1,000 or, if medical information is affected, any amount
<LI>Knowingly, and with intent to defraud, trafficking in any password or similar information through which a computer is accessed, without authorization, if such computer affects interstate or foreign commerce or is used by or for the government
</UL>
Illinois law also recognizes the crimes of computer tampering, aggravated computer tampering, and computer fraud. Computer tampering occurs when a person knowingly and without authorization:
<UL>
<LI>Accesses a computer, program, or data, whether or not the person obtains data or services
<LI>Accesses a computer, program, or data, and damages or destroys the computer, program, or data
<LI>Inserts a "program" into a computer knowing that it contains information or commands that will damage or destroy that computer or other computers, or that will alter, delete, or remove a program or data
</UL>
Aggravated computer tampering occurs when a person commits computer tampering and knowingly disrupts government or other public services or causes great bodily harm to a person.
<P>
A person commits computer fraud when he or she knowingly accesses, uses, damages, or destroys a computer, program, or data, or obtains money, property, or services of another in connection with a scheme to defraud. Computer crimes carry severe penalties, especially as the value of the property damaged or stolen increases.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG>Embezzlement </STRONG></H4></A>
To embezzle means to take another's money or property through abuse of an official job or position of trust. Embezzlement can take many forms. An accountant might use sophisticated methods to falsify records and skim profits. A bank teller might walk home with an extra 20 dollars from his or her drawer. Both of these actions constitute embezzlement.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="200"><H4><STRONG>False Statements </STRONG></H4></A>
The crime of making false statements is not specific to white collar criminals, but this crime is broad enough to encompass activities that might not be unlawful if not for associated false statements. To convict someone of false statements requires proof of a statement made willfully and knowingly that contains a false material fact or conceals a material fact.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="210"><H4><STRONG>Fraud </STRONG></H4></A>
Fraud is intentionally lying in order to induce someone into relying upon the lie to part with something of value. Like embezzlement, fraud can be either complex or simple. The federal government has three general anti-fraud statutes for mail fraud, bank fraud, and wire fraud. Mail fraud has two elements: (1) a scheme devised or intending to defraud or for obtaining property or money by fraudulent means, and (2) using the mails in furtherance of that fraudulent scheme. The "scheme to defraud" element of mail fraud is deliberately broad. It encompasses a wide variety of criminal activity, including credit card fraud, securities fraud, medical drug fraud, and frauds based on political malfeasance. Because the mail fraud statute uses such broad language and because it is relatively easy to prove, mail fraud is one of the most common charges brought by federal prosecutors. Charges of mail fraud frequently are made even in cases in which more specific crimes have been charged.
The federal wire fraud statute is similar to the mail fraud statute, but requires an interstate or foreign transmittal of a communication by wire, radio, or television. The federal bank fraud statute criminalizes the conduct of any party who "knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises."
<P>
In addition, Illinois law prohibits fraud generally, as well as specific fraudulent acts. In Illinois, fraud includes such crimes as public aid wire fraud and deceptive collections practices. The crime of deceptive practices occurs when a person who has an intent to defraud uses a threat or deception for an unlawful purpose, such as to
<UL>
<LI>Sign a document transferring property or creating a financial obligation
<LI>Use his or her position as an officer or manager to receive an investment
<LI>Issue a false check to pay taxes, buy property, or pay for services
</UL>
Although generally the crime of deceptive practices is a misdemeanor, if the property at issue is worth $150 or several transactions within a 90-day period exceed $150, the crime becomes a felony. Check fraud, deception of financial institutions, false personation, forgery, and possessing another's identification card (such as a card for an automated teller machine) also are crimes under Illinois law.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="220"><H4><STRONG>Obstruction of Justice </STRONG></H4></A>
Obstruction of justice is a category of offenses of interference in one of the three branches of government. Obstruction of justice can take many forms, including assaulting a process server, improperly influencing a juror, stealing or altering a record of process, and obstructing a criminal investigation by officers of a financial institution. Picketing, parading, or using sound amplification devices in front of a courthouse, a building or residence occupied by a judge, juror, witness, or court officer, may be prosecuted as obstruction of justice.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="230"><H4><STRONG>Perjury </STRONG></H4></A>
Federal perjury laws penalize anyone who willfully or knowingly makes false statements under oath. The sworn statements may be written or oral and need not be made in court; a person may perjure himself or herself in deposition or written testimony. A related law against subornation of perjury makes it illegal for anyone to procure another person to commit perjury.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="240"><H4><STRONG>Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act </STRONG></H4></A>
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was established to fight the influence of organized crime on legitimate businesses. Under federal criminal law, defendants may be found guilty of violating RICO if they engage in "racketeering activity" under the auspices of an enterprise that affects interstate commerce, or if they are involved in the collection of an unlawful debt. There are 9 state and 35 federal offenses specifically listed as racketeering activity. The 9 listed state offenses are murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery, arson, bribery, dealing in obscene materials, and dealing in narcotics or other dangerous drugs. While drug smuggling, murder, bribery, and extortion of "protection money" are examples of the activities to which RICO originally was applied, more recently it has been used to prosecute an increasing variety of criminal actions.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="250"><H4><STRONG>Securities Fraud and Insider Trading </STRONG></H4></A>
A broad range of illegal behavior is prosecuted under securities fraud statutes. Criminal prosecutions require the prosecutor to show that the accused acted willfully; if the accused is found in violation, he or she is subject to criminal penalties, civil penalties, or both. The securities fraud statutes recognize that deception may take many forms and thus are worded broadly to prohibit "any device, scheme or artifice to defraud" in securities sales.
<P>
There are two general categories of securities fraud. The first involves the sale of securities to investors for far more than their actual value. The second involves the sale of legitimate securities for illegal purposes. An example of the first type of fraud is selling shares in dry oil wells. An example of the second type of fraud is sale of legitimate stock by a broker who conceals information about his or her own involvement with the brokerage company. These acts are prohibited by rules established by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<P>
Insider trading prosecutions have been some of the most publicized white collar prosecutions of the 1980s and 1990s. Surprisingly, "insider trading" is not defined in any specific statute; it is a term used to describe insiders (such as officers of a corporation) taking unfair advantage of information to make money or avoid losing money in securities. Generally, insider trading means that an insider with material, non-public information engages in trading without disclosing that information to the public first. These crimes typically are prosecuted under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. However, prosecutors are not confined to using specific securities fraud statutes to prosecute securities fraud. General anti-fraud statutes may be used instead of, or in addition to, specific securities fraud laws. For example, parties engaged in securities fraud may be charged with violating mail and wire fraud statutes.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="260"><H4><STRONG>Tax Crimes </STRONG></H4></A>
Often, people charged with other white collar crimes are accused of committing a tax crime also. Failing to file a tax return or filing a false tax return is a crime, as is interfering with the administration of the internal revenue laws. Specific laws prohibit obstruction, extortion, or bribery with regard to a tax official.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="270"><H2><STRONG>Defenses and Punishment </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In some criminal trials, the prosecutor proves all the elements of a crime but the person accused is not punished because he or she has a valid defense.
<P>
Self-defense sometimes is used as a defense. The general rule for self-defense is that a person may use any amount of force--except deadly force--that he or she reasonably believes is necessary to prevent immediate unlawful harm to a person. Using deadly force is permissible only when it reasonably appears to be necessary to avoid immediate death or serious injury to a person, or to prevent the commission of a felony in the actor's dwelling. If a person claims that he or she acted in self-defense, the prosecutor must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that self-defense was not the reason for the crime.
<P>
By itself, intoxication is not a defense to a crime. In rare cases, intoxication works like a defense, if there is proof that the person accused of the crime was unable to form the necessary intent to commit a crime. Someone who is intoxicated may not be found guilty of a crime that requires he or she acted intentionally, but the intoxicated person may be guilty of another crime that does not require intentional actions.
In the area of white collar crime, the same defenses are available to defendants as those available in crimes generally. Some people accused of white collar crimes also claim entrapment by the government; they argue they were induced to act, and would not have acted unlawfully otherwise. Another common defense by businesses is that a particular businessperson was acting alone, without the authority of the company behind him or her. Businesses further argue that once it was discovered that an officer or employee was acting unlawfully, the business acted immediately to resolve the situation. Sometimes a business avoids criminal liability altogether if it shows that it took proper action to correct a situation as soon as managers were made aware of a problem.
Felonies and white collar crimes carry the strictest punishments, such as lengthy imprisonment, heavy fines, or even death. Federal sentencing guidelines contain a method for calculating fines to be paid by organizations that commit crimes. Businesses that are found guilty of operating for a primarily criminal purpose incur fines equal to their total assets.
<P>
Illinois also has laws that allow the authorities to seize property connected with the commission of a crime. For example, any money or other profits connected with computer fraud may be seized by the government. Similarly, a person charged with violating laws connected with controlled substances must forfeit the substances as well as the raw materials used to make the drugs, vehicles and real property used to further the crime, and any money or other proceeds from the sale of the controlled substances.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="280"><H2><STRONG>Crime Victims' Rights </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Victims of the most violent crimes have rights in the Illinois criminal justice system. Under the Bill of Rights for Victims and Witnesses of Violent Crime Act, a victim of violent crime generally has the right to be notified of the status of the investigation, whether an indictment has been brought, the time and place of any hearings, and when the defendant is released from custody. The Illinois Victims Rights Constitutional Amendment also gives all victims the right to be treated with fairness, the right to privacy, the right to make a statement at sentencing, and the right to reasonable protection from the accused during the criminal justice proceedings.
<P>
Some crime victims also have a right to compensation for the crimes committed against them. This means that a crime victim may receive compensation for certain expenses or losses, such as medical expenses or loss of support if the crime victims becomes unable to support dependents. There are requirements that must be met for a victim to get reimbursement, and a victim must file an application for consideration with the Illinois Court of Claims for compensation. The maximum amount a victim can receive from the Court of Claims is $25,000.
<P>
Under some Illinois laws, the victim may receive compensation from the person who committed the crime. This is called restitution. For example, a person whose vehicle is stolen may be able to receive compensation for the vehicle. In this case, the state arranges to collect the money from the criminal and sends a check to the victim when all the restitution has been made.
<P>
If the court does not order restitution, or if a prosecutor does not press charges, the victim still has the option to seek compensation directly by suing the offender in civil court. This option is discussed more fully in the <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Case: Civil & Criminal</A> Chapter.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Elder Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Elder law is one of the fastest-growing specialty areas of legal practice today. As recently as ten years ago, almost no one would have described their legal practice as an elder law practice, because most lawyers assumed that the concerns of elderly clients were indistinguishable from the interests of any other group. Because few lawyers focused their practices on senior citizens, many seniors felt their unique concerns were ignored by the legal profession.
<P>
All this is changing rapidly. As the average age of Americans rises, society is becoming increasingly aware of the unique problems facing elderly people, as well as the professional opportunities available in serving them. Governments have responded with a wide array of state and federal programs designed to guarantee financial and physical well-being for the elderly and to fight age-based discrimination. As senior citizens take a more active role in asserting their rights, an increasing number of the elderly have sought legal representation from lawyers sensitive to their needs.
<P>
Elder law is not a well-defined area of legal specialization. Elder law borrows from many other areas such as health, probate, estate planning and trusts, civil rights, and even consumer protection. Each of these areas is discussed fully in separate chapters of this <STRONG>Guide.</STRONG>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Age Discrimination in Employment </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
With longer life expectancies and better access to health care, more people are staying active longer and want to remain in the work force past traditional retirement age. Also, many elderly people need the income from employment. Consequently, employers have far more elderly employees, and the number of elderly job applicants is higher than at any other time in history. Unfortunately, incidents of age-based job discrimination are also on the rise.
<P>
Seniors in Illinois have two basic means--one state, one federal--with which to counter age discrimination in the workplace: the Illinois Human Rights Act and the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Illinois Human Rights Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Illinois Human Rights Act (IHRA) is a comprehensive anti-discrimination law prohibiting labor organizations, employers and employment agencies from discriminating based on age (over the age of 40), ancestry, arrest record, citizenship, color, disability, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex, or unfavorable military discharge. Under IHRA, it is illegal in most instances for an employer to use a person's age as a basis for decisions regarding hiring, recruitment, pay, promotion, transfer, discharge, discipline or privileges if the person is over the age of 40. For example, an employer cannot replace an older worker with a younger worker simply because the employer wants a young work force. Involuntary retirement before the age of 70 generally is prohibited. IHRA does permit an employer to offer various insurance plans or other fringe benefits to an employee based on age as long as the cost to the employer is reasonably equivalent for all employees.
<P>
Any person who feels victimized by a violation of IHRA may bring a civil action directly against the employer or may file a charge with the Illinois Department of Human Rights. If a person files a charge of discrimination with the Department of Human Rights, he or she must do so within 180 days of the discriminatory act. For example, if an older person is fired and believes the motive was age discrimination, the charge must be filed within 180 days of the employer's notice of termination.
<P>
Any individual who files an employment discrimination lawsuit must show
<UL>
<LI>That the employee is a member of the protected class (in this case, the protected age group)
<LI>That he or she is qualified to do the job
<LI>That he or she was rejected for the job or was fired from the job despite being qualified
<LI>That the employer filled the job with someone with similar qualifications
</UL>
The limitation period for filing a lawsuit directly against the employer is two years from the date of the discriminatory act.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) also prohibits age-based discrimination by labor organizations, employers, and employment agencies. Under ADEA, employers are prohibited from using age as a basis for making hiring, firing, promotion, or compensation decisions, or from limiting, segregating, or classifying employees in any way that would deprive or tend to deprive an individual of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his or her status. ADEA specifically prohibits the use of job advertisements that specify an applicant should be "young," a "recent graduate," or that use terms such as "retired" or "over 65."
ADEA has five major exceptions to its coverage. Employers accused of violating ADEA usually invoke one or more of these exceptions as a defense for their actions:
<UL>
<LI><B>Tenured Faculty Members</B>: Until recently, ADEA did not prohibit compulsory retirement at age 70 for tenured faculty members at institutions of higher learning. This exception expired on December 31, 1993, so compulsory retirement ages for tenured faculty are no longer permissible.
<LI><B>Executives and Policy Makers</B>: A small number of high-level employees with substantial executive authority are not covered by ADEA and can be subjected to compulsory retirement at age 70. This exception is a very narrow one and does not allow for compulsory retirement policies for mid-level managers.
<LI><B>Good Cause</B>: An employer is permitted to discharge an employee for "good cause," a catch-all category that includes many different forms of failure to do a job adequately.
<LI><B>Occupational Requirement</B>: In certain narrowly defined situations, an action otherwise impermissible under ADEA may be legal if the employer's action is "reasonably necessary to the operation of the business" or is based on "reasonable factors other than age." For example, employers may have mandatory retirement policies for firefighters and airplane pilots.
<LI><B>Bona Fide Seniority Systems and Employee Benefit Plans</B>: Generally, it is permissible for an employer to adopt a bona fide seniority system or employee benefit plan as long as the system or plan is not intended to evade the purposes of ADEA.
</UL>
A victim of age-based discrimination can bring an action under ADEA against his or her employer within two years of a non-willful violation or within three years of a willful violation.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Relationship Between IHRA and ADEA </STRONG></H3></A>
The relationship between IHRA and ADEA is complex, primarily because ADEA was not intended to supersede or replace existing state regulations regarding age-based discrimination. Both laws cover age discrimination in employment. An aggrieved person may file a charge with the Illinois Department of Human Rights for relief under IHRA, or may file a charge with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) based on discrimination in employment under the ADEA. However, there are rules concerning the relationship between the state and federal systems. Because of the complex interplay between the two laws and because they have different statutes of limitation, a lawyer or representative of the EEOC or Illinois Department of Human Rights can advise a victim of age discrimination how, when, and where to proceed against an employer.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Health Care Decisions and Protective Arrangements </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
With people living longer than ever before and medical technology advancing at a rapid pace, more people are beginning to plan now for their future health care. Illinois law provides for different arrangements in which people set forth in advance what will happen should they become incapacitated and unable to make health care decisions. These arrangements are designed to protect individuals who, in varying degrees, are unable to care for themselves. Because much of the law in this area is new and is evolving rapidly, it can appear confusing, even contradictory, at times. This is one area of law for which it is especially important to hire good legal counsel who can be relied upon to stay abreast of important new laws and recommend appropriate changes.
<P>
Living wills and powers of attorney for health are two written documents covering decisions in this area. If people do not create these documents, their health care decisions may be covered by the Illinois Health Care Surrogate Act. Under this act, a surrogate or a guardian--usually a family member--may be appointed to make important decisions about a person's health care if he or she becomes unable to do so. When a patient becomes unable to make a decision about life-sustaining treatment, and is diagnosed with a condition that will require such a decision, the health care provider must inquire about the existence of  a living will or power or attorney for health care. If neither of these documents exists, the physician is authorized to rely upon a surrogate to make the decision. The patient must be informed that a surrogate has been appointed and who the surrogate is. Any decision made by the surrogate decision maker should be made in accordance with the patient's wishes.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Living Will </STRONG></H3></A>
Despite its popular name, a living will is not actually a will at all. A living will is a document spelling out how much and what kind of medical care its writer (declarant) wants if he or she becomes terminally ill and incapable of communicating his or her wishes. "Terminally ill" means the person has an incurable or irreversible condition and the use of medical procedures only delays and prolongs the dying process. Living wills are controversial and, although many states refuse to recognize them, they are recognized in Illinois.
<P>
Any competent adult can make a living will. Although many people have living wills drafted by their lawyers at the same time they have traditional wills drafted, living wills do not need to be drafted by lawyers. Illinois has a suggested living will form, which people can use if they wish. Many people seek advice from a doctor before drafting a living will so they can describe their wishes specifically, taking into account the kinds of medical technology currently available to them. Also, it is useful for a person who signs a living will to inform his or her doctor of what the living will says. The most important point about a living will is that the individual decides how much and what kind of health care he or she wants.
<P>
<TABLE WIDTH=100% Border=2>
<TR><TD>
<P ALIGN=Center><FONT SIZE=6><B>Declaration</B></FONT></P>

This declaration is made this ________ day of ________ (month, year).  I, ________________ , being of sound mind, willfully and voluntarily make known my desires that my moment of death shall not be artificially postponed.
If at any time I should have an incurable and irreversible injury, disease, or illness judged to be a terminal condition by my attending physician who has personally examined me and has determined that my death is imminent except for death delaying procedures, I direct that such procedures which would only prolong the dying process be withheld or withdrawn, and that I be permitted to die naturally with only the administration of medication, sustenance, or the performance of any medical procedure deemed necessary by my attending physician to provide me with comfort care.
<P>
In the absence of my ability to give directions regarding the use of such death delaying procedures, it is my intention that this declaration shall be honored by my family and physician as the final expression of my legal right to refuse medical or surgical treatment and accept the consequences from such refusal.
<P>
<B>Signed</B> ________________________ 
<P>
<B>City, County and State of Residence</B> ________________________  
<P>
The declarant is personally known to me and I believe him or her to be of sound mind.  I saw the declarant sign the declaration in my presence (or the declarant acknowledged in my presence that he or she had signed the declaration) and I signed the declaration as a witness in the presence of the declarant.  I did not sign the declarant's signature above for or at the direction of the declarant. At the date of this instrument, I am not entitled to any portion of the estate of the declarant according to the laws of intestate succession or, to the best of my knowledge and belief, under any will of declarant or other instrument taking effect at declarant's death, or directly financially responsible for declarant's medical care.

<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Power of Attorney for Health Care </STRONG></H3></A>
Living wills can be used only for terminal illnesses. Treatment decisions for non-terminal illness can be addressed by the creation of a power of attorney for health care. A power of attorney for health care is a document that one person (principal) signs in order to give another person (agent) authority to make health care decisions if the principal becomes incapacitated. Unlike a living will, a person's health condition does not have to be terminal for a power of attorney for health care to be effective.
<P>
The power of attorney for health care sets out exactly what the agent will do if the principal becomes unable to make health care decisions. It may state that the agent has complete authority to make health care decisions based on what the agent believes is best, or it may state specifically what the health care decisions should be. For example, the principal may declare that every measure should be used to keep him or her alive, or that medical treatment should be stopped under certain circumstances.
<P>
A principal must be at least 18 years old in order to create a power of attorney for health care. Illinois has a suggested short form power of attorney for health care, or a principal may write his or her own power of attorney for health care as long as it contains certain information required by law. The power of attorney for health care must name the agent, describe the power the agent will have, and be signed by the principal and dated while the principal still is able to make his or her own decisions.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Guardianship </STRONG></H3></A>
The Illinois Guardians for Disabled Adults Act provides that a court may appoint a guardian, if a person (ward) becomes mentally or physically incapable of making personal or financial decisions. The guardian may be appointed as a guardian of the person or guardian of the person's estate, or both. The purpose of guardianship is to promote the well-being of disabled adults, and to prevent abuse, neglect, and exploitation.
<P>
To create a guardianship, any person can petition the court, whether that person is a potential guardian, a potential ward, or a third person. Usually a petition is made by a family member or close friend concerned about the person's competence to manage property or make personal decisions. A petition must include the name and other information about the person, the value of the person's property, and the name and other information about the proposed guardian. It also must set forth the reasons why guardianship is needed. The petitioner has the burden of proving the ward's incapacity and the court applies a standard of the best interest of the ward in making its decision. 
<P>
A ward can be restored to capacity by petition to the court. Anyone can bring a petition and must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the ward no longer is incapacitated and is able to make provisions for personal care or management of his or her property.
<P>
For many families, guardianship causes a drastic change in the family relationship, especially if  not all family members agree that a petition for guardianship should be filed. Some of this potential stress can be avoided if an aging person creates a living will or power of attorney for health care while still legally competent. Another option is to create a living trust, which is discussed in the <A HREF="c21.html">Estate Planning, Wills &amp; Trusts Law</A> Chapter of this <STRONG>Guide.</STRONG>
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Commitment to a State Institution </STRONG></H3></A>
There are three ways an individual in Illinois can be committed to an institution for mentally ill persons. Commitment sometimes becomes an issue for elderly people.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Voluntary Commitment </STRONG></H4></A>
A person 18 years of age or older in Illinois may request voluntary admission to a mental health facility. This voluntary admission may be done very informally without application. The facility director will deem the individual suitable to be admitted after an examination. Voluntary admission also may be requested formally by filing an application with the facility director. Any person admitted voluntarily to a mental health facility must be informed of his or her right to be discharged. Persons admitted informally may be discharged at any time during normal day-shift hours starting from the first day after admission. People who are admitted by way of the formal voluntary admission procedure must apply for discharge in writing, and will be discharged within five days of the request.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Emergency Hold </STRONG></H4></A>
Any adult may petition the director of a mental health facility to admit someone on an emergency basis. The hospitalization must be necessary to protect the admitted person from hurting himself or herself or others. The petition must be accompanied by a certificate from a physician or a clinical psychologist, and it must state the reasons why the person should be admitted involuntarily. The person held under an emergency admission has the right to a medical examination within 24 hours and a right to a hearing within five days.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Judicial Commitment </STRONG></H4></A>
Any adult may petition a court for judicial admission of another individual to a mental health facility. The person petitioning for involuntary judicial admission must file the petition in the county where the person sought to be admitted resides. The petition must state the facts that make commitment necessary and the names and addresses of witnesses to these facts. Upon the filing of a petition for commitment, the court will set the matter for hearing or, if the petition does not contain physicians' certificates, will order an examination. The proposed patient receives notice of the hearing and a written summary of his or her rights. No involuntary admission may be made unless the court finds that the person is unable to care for himself or herself, or that the person is a danger to himself or herself or others. A judge may involuntarily commit someone to a state institution for an initial period of up to 180 days. After that period, the patient is entitled to periodic review of his or her case and possible release.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Social Security </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Congress passed the Social Security Act in 1935 to create a very broad social safety net for all United States workers and their families. The Social Security Act and its amendments started several public benefit programs. Most of these programs are financed by taxes levied on workers. Employers automatically deduct a portion of each worker's paycheck and match that amount with money from their business or organization. Self-employed workers are responsible for paying the entire amount themselves.
<P>
The three largest programs within the Social Security Act are Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Health Insurance (RSDHI); Supplemental Security Income (SSI); and Medicaid. RSDHI is the name of the federal government's benefits program for workers and retirees, and therefore is of special interest to seniors.
RSDHI itself contains three separate programs to cover retirement, disability, and health insurance (Medicare).
These three programs are extremely complex. Although detailed descriptions are beyond the space limitations of this book, a general familiarity with them is helpful for understanding one's entitlements.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Retirement and Survivors Insurance </STRONG></H3></A>
Despite the fact that Retirement and Survivors Insurance (RSI) is only one branch of RSDHI, which in turn is only one branch of the Social Security Act, when most people refer to Social Security they actually mean RSI. Payments from RSI are the Social Security checks that millions of Americans receive each month. Social Security was not intended to be a person's sole source of income, but to supplement other income sources such as pensions, insurance, savings, and investments. However, for many, RSI is their only source of income.
A worker gains RSI coverage by performing covered employment for a certain amount of time. The term "covered employment" means most types of work including full- or part-time wage or salaried work, self-employment, farm work, membership in the United States Armed Services, employment in private nonprofit organizations, most domestic work, and most federal, state, and local government employment. The only major exceptions are railroad employees separately covered by the Railroad Retirement System, federal workers hired before 1984, and certain religious workers. The rules of eligibility and benefit amount are quite complex and provide limited coverage for spouses, children, and survivors.
<P>
Generally, a person begins receiving RSI benefits at age 65; however, a worker has the option of initiating benefits at age 62. All benefits are based on what is called the primary insurance amount (PIA): the amount a worker is entitled to if he or she retires exactly at age 65. The amount of the monthly check varies depending on how much the worker made each year. The higher his or her pay, the higher the benefits, up to a maximum dollar amount. A person who initiates benefits at age 62 receives a reduced monthly amount equal to a percentage of his or her PIA. This is a permanent reduction that amounts to approximately seven percent of the PIA for each year a person receives benefits before age 65. Postponing the receipt of benefits until after age 65 can entitle a worker to receive higher monthly amounts. Cost-of-living increases are built into the system so that the monthly amount automatically increases each year as the national cost of living rises.
<P>
Family members receive benefits based on the worker's retirement benefits. The spouse of an eligible worker draws spousal benefits on the worker's account--usually one-half of the worker's PIA--if the spouse is at least 62 years old or cares for a child eligible for child's benefits on the worker's account. Other bases for family eligibility are
<UL>
<LI>Spousal benefits for a divorced spouse if he or she was married to the insured worker for at least ten continuous years and has not remarried
<LI>Full benefits for a surviving widow or widower of a fully insured worker from age 65
<LI>A one-time death benefit (currently $255) for surviving relatives of fully insured workers who apply within two years of the worker's death
<LI>Benefits for the child or grandchild of an insured worker if he or she was dependent on the worker when benefits began, is unmarried, and 
<LI>Is 18 years old or younger
<LI>Is 19 years old or younger but enrolled as a full-time elementary or secondary school student, or 
<LI>Is older than 18 years but became disabled before reaching age 22
</UL>
As a general rule, an eligible individual must apply for RSI benefits in order to receive them. It is wise to apply at least two months before the desired start of payments, because completing paperwork takes some time. Failure to apply for benefits as soon as one is entitled to them can forfeit earned benefits. Anyone interested in learning how much he or she is likely to receive in RSI benefits can visit a local Social Security office and request an estimate of future benefits based on one's earnings.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Railroad Retirement System </STRONG></H3></A>
The Railroad Retirement System is a federal income insurance program specifically for workers in the railroad industry. Originally, this system was independent of the Social Security Administration, but in 1974 its provisions were integrated into the Social Security System. The integration was not entirely smooth, however, which has led to complex and confusing rules that are often the source of errors in awarding benefits.
<P>
Most of the rules for Railroad Retirement closely parallel those for RSI. A retired railroad worker is eligible for monthly benefits if he or she worked for a railroad employer for at least ten years before reaching age 65. As with RSI, a worker can opt to retire earlier, at age 62, but will receive reduced benefits. Anyone with fewer than ten years employment in the railroad industry is ineligible for railroad benefits, but the years of railroad employment can be added to years of non-railroad employment for purposes of calculating RSI benefits.
<P>
Some railroad workers who retired before January 1, 1975, are entitled to draw both full RSI benefits and full Railroad Retirement benefits. Most other workers, however, have their RSI benefits reduced by the amount of the Railroad benefits.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Disability Benefits </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal government has two disability benefit programs administered by the Social Security Administration for qualified applicants: RSDHI Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). These two programs are similar and are governed by many of the same rules. An individual who qualifies for one program occasionally can receive benefits from both programs simultaneously.
<P>
Both RSDHI and SSI programs define disability as "inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determined physical or mental impairment which can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months." The physical or mental disability must be "of such severity" that an applicant not only is unable to do the work he or she did previously, but is unable to engage in any kind of gainful work.
The applicant for either RSDHI disability or SSI has the burden of proving by medical evidence that he or she is disabled or blind. Most applicants must wait five full months before their benefits begin. Each applicant's case is reviewed periodically to determine whether his or her condition has improved to the point that he or she is able to resume working.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>RSDHI Disability Insurance </STRONG></H4></A>
RSDHI Disability Insurance provides benefits for workers with substantial work histories in covered employment who are unable to continue work because they became disabled before reaching age 25. The term "covered employment" includes most types of work. The disabled worker and his or her dependents usually are eligible for RSDHI disability benefits. In some cases, disabled survivors of an insured worker can receive benefits.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG>Supplemental Security Income </STRONG></H4></A>
SSI is a nationwide income maintenance program designed to help persons with limited income and assets who are elderly, blind, or disabled. Although SSI is administered by the Social Security Administration, it is not funded by Social Security taxes. SSI differs from RSI because it is based on financial need only. A person's work record is not relevant in determining eligibility for SSI. Thus, a disabled person under age 65 who has not worked a sufficient amount of time to qualify for RSDHI disability may be eligible to receive SSI disability benefits.
<P>
To receive SSI, a person must be 65 or older, be blind or disabled, and have financial need. The formula for determining SSI eligibility and benefits takes into account both income level and assets. A person qualifying on the basis of blindness or disability must be referred to vocational rehabilitation services. If the disability is related to alcohol or drug dependency, the applicant may be required to enroll in an appropriate treatment program or risk losing eligibility. Residence in a public institution, such as a prison or certain hospitals, disqualifies an applicant. These people should take appropriate steps to get any pensions, annuities, retirement, disability benefits, worker's compensation benefits, unemployment insurance, or veterans benefits to which they may be entitled.
<P>
When the federal government created SSI, it replaced many state-administered welfare programs for the elderly, blind, and disabled. The State of Illinois chose to continue its own program to supplement SSI benefits. This program is known as State Supplemental Payments (SSP). SSP provides additional assistance to qualified elderly, blind, and disabled persons, including those whose income levels are above the SSI standards. The purpose of SSP is to help very poor Illinois residents who are unable to work but whose needs are not met by other federal or state programs.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Medicare </STRONG></H3></A>
Medicare--also called Medical Assistance in Illinois--is a federal program administered by the Social Security Administration designed to cover some basic medical and health care costs of eligible individuals over age 65 as well as many people with disabilities. Medicare has become an enormous federal program, providing billions of dollars in coverage every year.
<P>
Medicare should not be confused with Medicaid. Medicaid is a program administered by the Social Security Administration to pay doctor and hospital bills of people with limited income and assets. Medicare benefits are available to qualified individuals regardless of financial need. Because Medicare is closely linked to RSI, Disability Insurance, and Railroad Disability benefits, a basic understanding of the eligibility requirements and application procedures for those programs is helpful for an understanding of Medicare.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="210"><H4><STRONG>Medicare Parts A and B </STRONG></H4></A>
Medicare has two basic divisions, called Part A and Part B. Medicare Part A, commonly known as Hospital Insurance, covers medically necessary hospital and related health care. Included in Part A are costs for such expenses as inpatient hospital care necessitated by acute illness, skilled nursing home care, certified hospice care for the terminally ill, inpatient psychiatric care, and care in the home by a certified home health care provider. People qualify for Hospital Insurance when they turn 65 or if they are covered by Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits.
<P>
Medicare Part B, commonly known as Medical Insurance, is a voluntary health insurance program designed to cover some of the costs not covered by Medicare Part A, such as outpatient hospital services, outpatient physical therapy, speech pathology services, necessary ambulance service, and medical equipment. Unlike Part A, which is paid for out of Social Security taxes and is free to anyone who qualifies, Part B is an optional program that carries a monthly premium of under $50.
<P>
The federal government contracts with private insurance companies to handle routine claims processing, payment, and other functions under Parts A and B.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="220"><H4><STRONG>Costs Not Covered by Medicare </STRONG></H4></A>
Medicare never was intended to provide comprehensive coverage for all medical needs of America's elderly population, but rather was intended to supplement private resources. Many health services are not covered by Medicare. For example, Medicare does not pay for
<UL>
<LI>Custodial care provided by someone without medical training and intended to help the patient with his or her daily living needs, such as help with bathing, walking, or exercising
<LI>Dentures or routine dental care
<LI>Eyeglasses, hearing aids, and examinations to prescribe or fit them
<LI>Nursing home care (except skilled nursing care)
<LI>Prescription drugs
<LI>Routine physical checkups and related tests
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="230"><H4><STRONG>Insurance Issues Related to Medicare </STRONG></H4></A>
Many seniors look for some form of private insurance to supplement Medicare coverage. Some seniors are able to get continuation or conversion coverage from group policies they had through their jobs. Another popular option for seniors is to join a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). HMO coverage is similar to continuation or conversion coverage, but many HMOs have more complicated rules for persons who are covered by Medicare, so it pays to learn about a particular HMO's policies regarding Medicare benefits before signing up.
<P>
Illinois seniors who are refused health insurance by private health insurance companies, or who can obtain insurance but only at an excessive rate may be able to get coverage under the Illinois Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan. This program was intended as an alternative to traditional health insurance, and provides coverage for medically necessary treatment such as hospital services. 
<P>
In Illinois, two additional programs help older people and people with disabilities pay for their Medicare coverage. In order to be eligible for these programs, an individual must have assets of no more than $4,000 and must live in Illinois. The Qualified Medicare Beneficiary Program (QMB) assists those who have Part A Hospital Insurance and whose income is at 100 percent or less than the federal poverty level. The Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary Program (SLMB) covers Part B Medical Insurance for individuals with incomes between 100 percent and 110 percent of the poverty level. These programs are run by the Illinois Department of Public Aid.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Employment Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Workers enjoy many rights designed to make the workplace safe and free from illegal discrimination and harassment. This chapter outlines some of the important federal and state laws governing the legal relationships and problems between employers and employees.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Employment Relationship </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The extent of a worker's rights depends upon the legal relationship between the worker and his or her employer.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Independent Contractor Versus Employee </STRONG></H3></A>
When a worker gets paid to do a task or provide a service for another person, the worker is an independent contractor or an employee. The distinction is important both for the business and the worker, but it is not always clear. For a worker, the classification determines the benefits to which he or she is entitled, whether the worker is covered by workers' compensation, and whether the worker is protected by federal and state wage and hour regulations. Employees enjoy substantially more protection in the workplace than do independent contractors.
<P>
Whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee is based on the work performed, not the worker's title. The more control an employer has over a worker, the more likely it is the worker is an employee. On the other hand, the more a worker acts like an independent business enterprise, the more likely the worker is an independent contractor. In some cases, the status is clear: A worker who arrives at a set time every day, is trained by the employer, uses the boss's tools or equipment, and is paid by the hour, week, or month, most likely is an employee. Someone who works for more than one company at a time, sets his or her own hours, and realizes a profit or risks a loss, probably is an independent contractor.
<P>
A worker or an employer who is unsure about the legal status of his or her employment relationship can seek advice from the Internal Revenue Service, the Illinois Department of Revenue, the Illinois Department of Employment Security, or the Illinois Department of Labor.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Employment at Will </STRONG></H3></A>
The state of Illinois recognizes the traditional rule of employment at will. This means that all workers in Illinois are at-will employees unless the employer takes some action to create a different relationship. There are several ways an employer can alter the relationship. An employer might enter into an oral or written contract guaranteeing to employ someone for a specific period of time or promising to terminate the employee only for specified reasons. An employee handbook or collective bargaining agreement may limit the employer's right to terminate employees. Sometimes employers inadvertently limit their right to fire employees if, by their actions, the employers give the employees reason to believe their jobs will continue. For example, if an employer promises a job to someone from out of state and that person moves to Illinois specifically to take the job, the employer probably has changed the employment relationship. The employment is not at will because the employee has gone to the trouble and expense of moving after reasonably relying on the promise of new employment.
<P>
The implications of the at-will relationship are far-reaching. Unless there is an agreement to the contrary, an employer may discharge an employee at any time for any legal reason. As long as an employee is not fired for an illegal reason--such as racial or gender discrimination--an employer does not need a good reason to fire someone. Even a silly reason is enough. It also means that an employee may resign at any time, for any reason, with or without giving notice. The employee is free to leave for any reason at all, even if by doing so he or she greatly inconveniences the employer.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>Government Administered Benefits </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Three programs administered by the state and federal governments are of particular interest to workers: Unemployment Compensation Insurance, Workers' Compensation Insurance, and Social Security. The benefits a worker enjoys under any of these programs depends upon the terms and conditions of employment.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Unemployment Insurance </STRONG></H3></A>
Unemployment insurance provides benefits to employees who are laid off, fired, or forced to leave their jobs. Most employees are covered by unemployment insurance, a program administered by the state and funded by employer contributions.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Application </STRONG></H4></A>
Unemployment benefits are not automatic; the worker must apply for them from the Illinois Department of Employment Security. After gathering information about an applicant, the department makes an initial determination whether the person is eligible to receive benefits. If the department's decision is that the employee is eligible, it informs the former employer. Because the former employer contributes to pay the benefits, the employer has the right to some of the information given by the former employee to the department and has an opportunity to present information.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Eligibility </STRONG></H4></A>
To be eligible to receive unemployment benefits, the employee must have worked for the employer for a certain length of time and must have made a certain amount of money in wages. The time period is called a base period, and it is based on the calendar quarter system. Eligible employees must have made at least $1,600 in wages during the base period. To collect unemployment benefits, a person also must be available for work, have registered for work with the Illinois Job Service, and meet a few other provisions.
<P>
Not everyone who leaves a job is eligible to receive unemployment benefits. An applicant is not entitled to receive benefits if the applicant
<UL>
<LI>Is an independent contractor or a commission-only salesperson
<LI>Is a student hired by the educational institution in which he or she was enrolled
<LI>Is fired for misconduct
<LI>Quits for any reason other than an illegal or intolerable work environment
<LI>Participates in a labor strike
<LI>Refuses an offer to work again for the former employer
<LI>Fails to seek, apply for, or accept suitable work
</UL>
Because employers and employees often have different ideas of what constitutes a reasonable work environment, the issue in most disputed unemployment claims is whether the employer created an intolerable workplace environment. Only certain kinds of employer actions give an employee a legitimate reason to quit a job and still collect unemployment benefits. Some of these valid reasons include:
<UL>
<LI>Sexual harassment by an employer, or inaction by an employer who was informed of instances of sexual harassment
<LI>A substantial cut in pay or benefits
<LI>Drastic changes in working conditions or hours without an employee's consent
<LI>Requiring an employee to break the law or work under obviously unsafe conditions
</UL>
Demotions, modest decreases in wages or benefits, disagreements over management policy, and reasonable changes in workplace hours or employee regulations are conditions of employment that do not create an intolerable working environment for purposes of eligibility to collect unemployment benefits.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Benefits </STRONG></H4></A>
If the department decides that an applicant is eligible to receive benefits, the former employee receives a weekly benefit of a percentage of his or her previous average weekly salary. The benefit cannot exceed a maximum ceiling amount determined by the average statewide salary calculated each year. Benefits are paid for up to 26 weeks or until an applicant has received the maximum amount allowed, whichever is sooner. As long as the recipient continues to look for permanent work, working a part-time or temporary job will not terminate unemployment benefits. The recipient keeps a portion of his or her weekly income, and the benefits are reduced by any income in excess of a designated amount.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Workers' Compensation </STRONG></H3></A>
Workers' compensation provides benefits to employees injured in the workplace, regardless of how the injury happened. With few exceptions, all Illinois employees are covered by workers' compensation administered by the Illinois Industrial Commission.
<P>
The benefits available to workers include death benefits, permanent or temporary total disability, permanent or temporary partial disability, and medical and related expenses. The benefit amounts are determined by state guidelines and can be as high as two-thirds of a worker's salary at the time of the injury.
Workers' compensation is discussed further in the <A HREF="c26.html">Workers' Compensation Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Social Security </STRONG></H3></A>
Social Security provides benefits for retired workers. A worker gains Social Security coverage by performing "covered employment," which includes full- or part- time wage or salary work, self-employment, farm work, service in the United States Armed Services, work in private nonprofit organizations, most domestic work, and most federal, state, and local government work. The covered employment must be for a certain amount of time each quarter of the year.
<P>
The usual age to begin receiving Social Security benefits is 65; however, a worker has the option of initiating benefits at age 62. The amount of each monthly check depends on how much the worker made each year. The higher his or her pay, the higher the benefits, up to a maximum dollar amount.
<P>
Social Security is discussed in greater detail in the <A HREF="c24.html">Social Security Law</A> and <A HREF="c14.html">Elder Law</A> Chapters.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Civil Rights in the Workplace </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Four major federal laws--the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the Civil Rights Act of 1991; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967; and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990--protect the rights of workers to be free from workplace discrimination in the United States. Illinois workers have additional protection under the Illinois Human Rights Act. For example, the Americans with Disabilities Act only applies to employers with 15 or more employees after July 26, 1994. But the Illinois Human Rights Act covers alleged discrimination based on physical, mental or perceived handicap by any Illinois employers with one or more employees. In addition, the Illinois law covers more types of discrimination than the federal laws. Employees also should be aware that there may be local anti-discrimination laws applicable to their employment situation. For example, Cook County and the City of Chicago both have employment rights laws that apply to all employers with employees. That is, even an employer with one employee in Chicago or Cook County is subject to local employment laws.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>In General </STRONG></H3></A>
Most employment discrimination is outlawed by the two major civil rights acts passed by Congress in 1964 and 1991 and by the Illinois Human Rights Act. Through a combination of these laws, Illinois workers are protected against discrimination based on age, ancestry, arrest record, citizenship, color, creed, disability, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex, or unfavorable military discharge.
<P>
People frequently refer to "Title VII" rights when they are talking about a particular section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII prohibits discrimination in a wide number of employment areas, including advertisements for jobs, apprenticeship programs, benefits, firing, hiring, layoffs, promotions, recalls, recruitment, testing, training and transfers. Title VII also prohibits retaliation against a person who files a charge of discrimination, participates in an investigation of discrimination, or opposes an unlawful employment practice.
<P>
Under certain extremely limited circumstances employers are allowed to base their employment decisions or practices on a person's marital status, race, sex, etc., if the employer can demonstrate a truly legitimate need. For example, it is legal to hire only women to be attendants in women's locker rooms. Religious institutions may refuse to hire individuals based on their religious beliefs, but only for positions that are directly related to the performance of religious duties; they generally are not allowed to discriminate when hiring individuals for secular tasks such as secretarial or janitorial work.
<P>
Certain employers, such as police departments, may base some employment decisions on an applicant's physical abilities. Other types of hiring criteria are allowed if they measure skills that are truly essential for an applicant to have in order to perform a particular job, and if they are not applied in a selective or discriminatory way. For example, an employer may require applicants for administrative jobs to pass typing or computer skills examinations. 
<P>
Proving discrimination in the workplace depends on the specifics of each situation. Generally, it is easier to prove discrimination from a repeated pattern of behavior rather than an isolated incident. For example, if several Mexican immigrants are passed over for promotions in favor of non-immigrants, and all the people involved have the same qualifications, a good case may be made to charge unlawful discrimination. In addition, any documented evidence showing an employer is prejudiced against a class of people can strengthen a discrimination case. If an employer makes statements such as "blacks don't take orders well" or "women aren't capable of making tough management decisions," this likely will increase an applicant's chances of proving discrimination, especially if the statements are made repeatedly and in the presence of witnesses.
<P>
A person who feels that he or she has been unfairly discriminated against or harassed in the workplace may file a complaint with the Illinois Department of Human Rights or the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The Illinois Department of Human Rights enforces the Illinois Human Rights Act, and the EEOC enforces the federal civil rights acts that apply to the workplace. When a person files a complaint with one agency, that agency cross-files with the other agency. A victim of discrimination only has 180 days to file a complaint with either agency. Another option for a victim of discrimination is to hire a private attorney to pursue a claim against an employer. A civil action for violation of the Illinois Human Rights Act must be filed within two years of the termination or other occurrence.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Age Discrimination </STRONG></H3></A>
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) expands Title VII prohibitions against age discrimination. Most employers may not enforce mandatory retirement policies, except under a few very specific circumstances in which age is a valid qualification for doing a particular job, such as firefighting, police work, or flying airplanes. Anyone age 40 or over who works for an employer with 20 or more employees is protected by the ADEA and cannot be retired against his or her will, regardless of age, as long as he or she can do the job. The Illinois Human Rights Act contains similar provisions that apply to Illinois employers with only one employee. Other federal and state laws prevent discrimination based on age, with some exceptions allowing employers to force an employee age 70 or older to retire.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities </STRONG></H3></A>
The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) is a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on a person's physical or mental ability. The ADA makes it illegal to fire or to refuse to hire someone because that person lacks physical or mental abilities that are not essential to the job; the ADA does not change an employer's right to employ only people who have the skills to perform the "essential duties" of a job. For example, an employer may not refuse to hire as a daycare provider a person with epilepsy, simply because the potential employee cannot drive to a hospital in an emergency. In this example, driving is not an essential duty of the job, so it is not a valid reason to discriminate against an applicant who is unable to get a driver's license because of his or her epilepsy.
<P>
The ADA requires employers to make "reasonable accommodations" for applicants or employees with disabilities. The employer must do whatever is reasonable to accommodate a person's disability, including modifying work schedules, providing special training, changing the work environment, buying or modifying special equipment, or reassigning to another position an employee who no longer is able to do the "essential duties" of a job. A reasonable accommodation is one that does not place an undue burden on the employer. Using pre-employment tests that identify and exclude applicants with disabilities is permissible only if the tests are unequivocally job-related.
<P>
The ADA only protects from discrimination people with permanent conditions that limit a major life activity. Thus, the ADA does not cover an employee who has a sprained ankle that is expected to heal fully, even though that employee is disabled for a period of time. A person with a permanent disabling condition that is controlled by drugs, physical therapy, or by some other treatment is covered by the ADA, such as an epileptic whose seizures are controlled by medication. The ADA also prohibits discriminating against individuals with AIDS or HIV, or people who have completed or are still participating in drug rehabilitation programs. However, an applicant or employee currently using illegal drugs is not protected by the ADA.
<P>
The ADA is administered by the EEOC. Discrimination against persons with disabilities also is prohibited by the Illinois Human Rights Act.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Sexual Harassment </STRONG></H3></A>
Everyone has the right to be free from sexual harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment is prohibited by the Illinois Human Rights Act and is punishable as an illegal form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Sexual harassment can take many forms:
<UL>
<LI>Sexual or sexist comments about a coworker's appearance
<LI>A mandatory dress code that provokes others to make sexually explicit comments
<LI>Unwanted sexual contact or touching
<LI>Sexual suggestions or pressure to have sexual contact
<LI>Sexual jokes or explicit sexual comments that embarrass a coworker
<LI>Sexual or pornographic pictures displayed or passed around
</UL>
Sexual harassment is illegal if participation in any of the above activities is required to get or keep a job, to be promoted, or to qualify for benefits, or if the activity makes it harder for a worker to do his or her job by creating a hostile environment. The behavior must be unwelcome, undesirable, and offensive to be considered sexual harassment. The law uses the "reasonable person" standard to determine what is offensive: If a reasonable person would find an action offensive, then it is offensive under the law.
<P>
Determining what kind of behavior constitutes sexual harassment may depend on the circumstances; however, some general descriptions of sexual harassment can be made. A single, or occasional, sexual joke or sexual comment is not sexual harassment unless the comment unequivocally offers workplace advancement in return for sexual favors. Unwanted touching of someone else's body is sexual harassment. Someone who repeatedly tells lewd or obscene jokes that make other employees uncomfortable may be guilty of sexual harassment, especially if the person has been told that he or she makes the workplace uncomfortable. A case for sexual harassment in this example would be weakened if the person claiming harassment participates in the joke-telling.
<P>
In addition to laws designed to give victims a civil remedy against sexual harassment, criminal laws provide remedies against the most serious forms of unwanted sexual contact.
<P>
People who believe they are victims of sexual harassment should contact the EEOC, the Illinois Department of Human Rights, or the Illinois Human Rights Commission.
<P>
If a harasser's behavior crosses the line into assault, battery, or rape, the victim may file criminal charges against the perpetrator. These crimes are discussed in the Criminal Law Chapters.
<P>
Anyone fired or forced to leave a job because of sexual harassment may be entitled to receive unemployment insurance benefits while searching for a new job.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Pregnancy Discrimination </STRONG></H3></A>
Title VII protects pregnant workers and job applicants from discrimination. Employers may not refuse to hire a woman because she is pregnant, fire a woman because she is pregnant, take away benefits or accrued seniority because a woman takes maternity leave, take away benefits from a single woman who has a baby, or fire or refuse to hire a woman who has an abortion.
<P>
Generally, an employer must treat pregnant women the same as other workers who cannot perform their jobs for short periods of time. Thus, if an employer allows employees to take leave for a broken leg or short-term illness, the employer must allow pregnant women to take leave under the same terms and conditions. Pregnancy leave also is protected under the Family and Medical Leave Act (discussed below). 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Other Workplace Rights and Responsibilities </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Wages and Hours </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal minimum wage for adult workers age 18 and over is $4.25 per hour. Employers must pay at least the minimum wage, even to employees who earn tips, and employers may not force employees to share their tips with other workers or managers, although employees may do so voluntarily. There are some exceptions to the minimum wage law. For example, workers under 18 years of age must be paid a minimum wage of $3.75 per hour. Generally, employers also must pay hourly employees one-and-a-half times their regular rate for every hour over 40 hours worked in a week.
<P>
Certain salaried workers are exempt from minimum wage standards and overtime regulations. To be exempt, an employee must be in an executive, administrative, or professional position and receive at least $250 each week in salary or fee. The employee must supervise at least two other workers, manage an office or a business operation, be a skilled artistic performer or a teacher, or work in a profession requiring advanced knowledge, such as engineering.
<P>
Employment laws also regulate child labor. For example, no child under the age of 12 is allowed to work, except for children who are members of farm families and who live and work on farms. Students who are 14 or 15 years old may work only three hours per day during the school year, and only eight hours per day during school vacations. All child workers under the age of 16 must have employment certificates.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Substance Abuse in the Workplace </STRONG></H3></A>
Under certain circumstances, employers in Illinois may compel employees to pass drug and alcohol tests as a condition of employment. These tests must not be given in a discriminatory way, and if passing a drug or alcohol test is a job requirement, then all employees performing that job must be subject to the testing requirement.
An employer may test an employee for drugs and alcohol only if the test is part of a reasonable policy that seeks to prohibit the use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace. For example, an individual who has undergone treatment for the illegal use of drugs may be tested subsequently under reasonable circumstances to ensure that he or she remains rehabilitated. A reasonable policy also may include testing of all employees in safety-sensitive positions. Federal law governs and allows workplace testing for use of alcohol and illegal use of drugs in the defense, nuclear, and transportation industries.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Parenting, Family, and Medical Leave </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal government requires certain employers to provide parenting, family, and medical leave to qualified employees. The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) allows qualified employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to attend to family matters, including health emergencies. Under the Act, a qualified employee may take an unpaid leave following the birth or adoption of a child, after acquiring a foster child, to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition, or to care for his or her own serious health condition.
Men and women are entitled equally to this leave, but not every worker is qualified. A person must be a full-time government employee, or employee of a company with 50 or more employees who has worked for the company at least 12 months and at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately prior to taking leave.
<P>
Under most circumstances, an employee may elect or the employer may require the use of any accrued paid leave for periods of unpaid leave under the FMLA.
<P>
When the leave is foreseeable, an employee must provide the employer with at least 30 days' notice of the need for the leave. If the leave is not foreseeable, the notice must be given as soon as it is practical. An employer may require medical certification of a serious health condition from the employee and may require periodic reports during the period of leave of the employee's status and intent to return to work. In addition, an employer may require a fitness for duty certification upon return to work in appropriate situations.
<P>
The employee is not entitled to accrue benefits such as vacation time or sick leave during a leave under the FMLA. Any benefits accrued by the employee at the time of the leave, however, stay with the employee. During the leave, the employer must maintain the health benefits the employee was receiving at the time leave begins, at the same level and in the same manner as if the employee had continued to work.
<P>
When an employee returns from leave under the FMLA, the employee is entitled to be restored to the same job the employee left when the leave began. If the same job is not available, the employer must place the employee in an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, duties, and responsibilities. Under the Act, employers are prohibited from discriminating against or interfering with employees who take FMLA leaves.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Privacy </STRONG></H3></A>
Employees' right to privacy at work is a hotly debated issue today as increasing numbers of employers are using searches, surveillance, and eavesdropping in an attempt to better monitor their employees' activities. The law in this area is evolving and is largely unsettled, but it is fair to say that an employee surrenders some of his or her right to privacy at the workplace door. Employers have more of a legal right to monitor employees than governments have to monitor citizens.
<P>
When a court must determine whether an employee's right to privacy was violated, it looks at whether the employee's expectation of privacy in a particular situation was reasonable. For example, the expectation of privacy is more reasonable for items in a locked desk drawer than for items left out on a desk. Similarly, it is more reasonable to expect privacy during a personal phone call made on a pay phone than for a work-related call on the employer's phone.
<P>
The reasonable expectation standard is not a very strong guarantor of employee privacy. An employer may expand his or her right to search or monitor simply by giving notice to employees. Once an employee receives notice that the employer reserves the right to monitor calls, search offices, read electronic mail, or film the workplace, there is very little reasonable expectation of privacy.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Whistleblowing </STRONG></H3></A>
It is illegal for an employer to fire a worker in retaliation for reporting a violation of law or for refusing to participate in activity the employee believes to be illegal. If an employee acts in good faith and reports suspected illegal activities to the employer, a governmental agency, or law enforcement officer, the employee cannot be fired or be treated adversely. This workplace right is covered by workers' compensation laws. An employee who is terminated for whistleblowing may sue the employer for retaliatory discharge.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Employee Access to Personnel Records </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois law gives employees the right to inspect personnel records. The right to inspection means each employee may review records kept about him or her regarding employment qualifications, promotions, transfers, compensation, discharge, and disciplinary actions. Employees are allowed to obtain the final score of any examinations required for employment. They may not access reference letters or specific portions of employment examinations. Employers are not required to keep personnel records, so the right to inspect records only applies if the records exist.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Family Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Family law touches most people at least once in their lives. When getting married or dissolving a marriage, reaching adulthood, or having children, people need to be aware of how their legal status changes. Most family law is state law; there is very little federal regulation of families. Because each state has the authority to regulate families within its BORDERs, this chapter is specific to Illinois.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Reaching the Age of Majority in Illinois </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In Illinois, a person legally becomes an adult at age 18. With a person's 18th birthday come most of the rights, privileges, responsibilities, and obligations of adulthood. These rights include the right to vote, the right to make contracts, the right to marry without permission from parents or guardians, and the right to serve on a jury.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Marriage in Illinois </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Common law marriage is not recognized in Illinois. People must be legally married to be entitled to spousal rights and to be bound by spousal obligations. A legal marriage requires a marriage license and an exchange of vows before an official authorized to formalize the vows. Officials authorized to conduct weddings include clerks of court, judges, and licensed religious officials. The exchange of vows must be witnessed by at least two other individuals.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Who May Marry </STRONG></H3></A>
In Illinois, an unmarried man and an unmarried woman, both of sound mind and both at least 18 years old, may marry without the permission of others. Men and women between 16 and 18 years old may marry if they have the consent of both parties' parents or guardians, or with judicial approval. Illinois law prohibits marriage of people who are already married, as well as marriage between an ancestor and descendant, brother and sister (even if siblings by adoption), aunt and nephew, and uncle and niece. First cousins are not allowed to marry each other unless they are both at least 50 years old or they can prove one of the parties to the marriage is permanently and irreversibly sterile. Illinois is obligated by the Constitution of the United States to give full faith and credit to any marriage recognized by any other state.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>License Requirements </STRONG></H3></A>
Marriage licenses may be obtained through the clerk of court in any county in Illinois. Each applicant must provide his or her name, address, date and place of birth, gender, social security number, and occupation. If either party was married before, the application must include information concerning the previous marriage, and where and when it was dissolved or declared invalid, or the date and place of death of the former spouse. The application also must include the parents' names and addresses and a statement as to whether the parties are related to each other. Marriage license applications must be signed by the parties and accompanied by a licensing fee and proof that the parties are of legal age to marry and that the marriage is not prohibited for any reason. 
<P>
When the county clerk provides the marriage license, he or she gives the couple written information regarding sexually transmitted diseases, inherited metabolic diseases, and fetal alcohol syndrome. Within ten days after the marriage is solemnized, the person officiating the marriage ceremony must complete the marriage certificate form and forward it to the county clerk, who then registers the marriage.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Prenuptial Agreements </STRONG></H3></A>
A prenuptial or premarital agreement, also known as an antenuptial agreement, is a contract between parties made before they are married regarding what rights each has to the other's property upon dissolution of the marriage, legal separation, or death. Prenuptial agreements made in Illinois after January 1, 1990, are governed by the Uniform Premarital Agreement Act. These contracts are valid and enforceable in Illinois if they are made voluntarily, are fair and reasonable, use precise words, are in writing, and are signed by both parties.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Rights Within Marriage </STRONG></H3></A>
Spouses have an obligation to support one another and their children. Providing necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter is the responsibility of both spouses. Married individuals have the right to one's own earnings, to sue and be sued (including the right to sue each other), to make contracts, to act as each other's attorney in fact or agent, and to transfer property. Spouses are responsible for each other's contracts, debts, and damages, and must provide a home and support. When one spouse dies, the surviving spouse typically has the right to receive a certain percentage of his or her spouse's property. It is difficult, through not impossible, to disinherit a partner to a valid marriage.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Termination of Marriage </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Dissolution, also known as divorce, ends a marriage. A marriage is dissolved by a Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage issued by an Illinois state court. The court also decides related issues such as custody, visitation, child support, spousal maintenance, division of property, and responsibility for payment of marital debts.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Grounds for Dissolution </STRONG></H3></A>
In order for an Illinois court to grant a divorce, at least one of the parties must be a resident of Illinois at the time the action is filed and must maintain that residency for a minimum of 90 days prior to the entry of the judgment. Divorce may be granted on no-fault grounds or on fault grounds. 
<P>
A judge may grant a no-fault divorce if the parties have lived separately for a continuous period of more than two years, there has been an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage due to irreconcilable differences, and attempts to reconcile have failed or future attempts would not be in the best interest of the family. If the parties are in agreement that the marriage should be dissolved, and they have lived separately for six months, they may waive the two-year separation requirement by signing a written stipulation. 
<P>
Divorce granted on fault grounds means that the dissolution of the marriage is based on one spouse's fault or misconduct. Although the fault of a party may not be considered by a judge in dividing property, awarding child support, or awarding spousal maintenance, wrongful behavior may be considered when the judge is determining child custody if the behavior is relevant to the child's or children's best interests. In Illinois, the grounds for a fault divorce include:
<UL>
<LI>Adultery (sexual intercourse with another person of the opposite sex)
<LI>Attempted murder of the spouse
<LI>Conviction of a felony
<LI>Bigamy (the spouse was already married to another at the time of marriage)
<LI>Desertion (the spouse has willfully left the home for one year or more)
<LI>Extreme and repeated physical or mental cruelty
<LI>Habitual drunkenness or excessive use of addictive drugs for two years or more
<LI>Infection of the spouse with a communicable sexually transmitted disease
<LI>Permanent impotence at the time of the marriage
</UL>
The party alleging one of these grounds must also allege and prove that the ground occurred without any provocation on their part. For example, a wife who files for divorce based on desertion must also allege and prove that she did not provoke the husband to desert her.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Minimizing Litigation and Attorney Fees in Divorce Cases </STRONG></H3></A>
Although Illinois law does not require that a person be represented by an attorney, due to the complexities of the substantive laws and procedural laws in divorce cases, each person should be represented by an attorney so that their rights can be protected. Prior to seeing an attorney for a divorce, a person should make a list of all assets and debts which they know exist, gather available information concerning those assets and debts, as well as the incomes of both spouses. 
<P>
People who are going through a divorce may agree with one another as to the resolution of all of the issues that have or will arise in their case; in doing so, Illinois encourages the use of postnuptial agreements, commonly referred to as Marital Settlement Agreements. Such an agreement is a contract which adjusts, defines, and details all of the rights, duties, and obligations which will result when the marital relationship is dissolved. The contract usually becomes incorporated into and becomes part of the Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage, although in certain cases, only certain sections of the contract should be incorporated into the final Judgment. Although these agreements may be oral, the better practice is that they be written. These agreements normally resolve such issues as child custody and visitation, child support, spousal maintenance, division of marital property and debts, allocation of attorney fees, as well as many other related issues. It is important to note that matters involving support and property division may have serious income tax consequences which need to be addressed. 
<P>
Matters on which the parties disagree, however, must be decided by a court. The litigation process may begin with court appearances to resolve temporary custody, visitation, child support, spousal maintenance, and attorney fee issues, as well as to have injunction orders entered to prevent dissipation of property. After the attorneys have discovered the existence of all of the property of the parties and the value thereof, have ascertained the income and debts of the parties, and have completed discovery regarding all other issues in the case, the parties may request a pre-trial conference with a judge to try to settle all disputed issues. Any issues that are not settled at the pre-trial conference must be decided by the court at a trial.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Child Custody </STRONG></H3></A>
Child custody is determined by a court based upon the best interests of the children. Some of the factors which the courts consider in determining what is in the best interests of the children are the sincerity of each parent's desire to have custody, the wishes of the children, the interaction and interrelationship of the children with their parents, siblings and others, the children's adjustment to their home, school, and community, the mental and physical health of the individuals involved, past physical violence on the part of each parent, the ongoing occurrence of domestic abuse, and the willingness and ability of each parent to encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the children. 
<P>
Having custody of a minor child can mean sole legal custody, which is the right to make major decisions affecting the child's life (such as medical care, education and religion), and normally also includes physical custody, which is the actual possession and control of the child subject to reasonable visitation by the non-custodial parent. If the parents have joint legal custody, the children reside mostly with one parent, known as the residential parent, who is responsible for the routine decisions affecting the children, but both parents share the responsibility for and have a say in making the major decisions regarding the children. If they have joint physical custody, both parents are involved in even the day-to-day decisions affecting their children, and the children spend time with both parents, although not necessarily an equal amount of time with each. In matters where the parties have joint custody, the time each parent spends with their children is known as parenting time. Also, in order for a court to award joint custody, it must determine that the parents have the ability to cooperate effectively and consistently with each other in matters that directly affect the joint parenting of the children. The court must also order the parents to produce a Joint Parenting Agreement which, among other things, will normally provide for mediation of future disputes regarding the children. Child custody is modifiable by a court if changing circumstances warrant a modification.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Visitation and Parenting Time </STRONG></H3></A>
Typically, the non-custodial parent is granted visitation rights unless the court feels that such visits would be detrimental to the children. Parents may make child visitation agreements themselves, but if a friendly agreement cannot be reached, the court sets a schedule for visitation, or it orders that the non-custodial parent be allowed reasonable visitation. Since the term "reasonable" is very subjective, the better practice is to have a detailed visitation provision so that the parties and the children have more certainty as to when the children will be with each parent. Certain other people, such as grandparents, who have close relationships with the children, may also be allowed some form of visitation. Visitation is modifiable by a court if changing circumstances warrant a modification.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Child Support </STRONG></H3></A>
Child support is financial assistance provided by the non-custodial parent (or, in the case of joint custody, by the non-residential parent) to help support the children. Child support is not deductible by the paying parent and is not taxable to the recipient parent. The amount of child support a court orders is based on statutory guidelines which militate that a percentage of the payor's net income from all sources be paid depending on the number of children. For one child, the percentage is 20 percent, two children 25 percent, three children 32 percent, four children 40 percent, five children 45 percent, and six or more children 50 percent. The court can consider other factors affecting the amount of child support it will order, including each parent's income, the children's needs (including special needs such as medical and psychological needs), the needs of the parents, and the standard of living the children would have enjoyed if the parties remained married. Child support is an independent obligation and must be maintained despite any other problems between the parents, such as disagreements about visitation. 
<P>
A recently enacted federal law requires employers to withhold wages from employees who are under a court order to provide child support after January 1, 1994. In Illinois, the law provides that if a court receives evidence that a parent is even one month behind in paying child support, the court must order the payment to be withheld from the person's income. The court may also enter an order requiring the paying parent's employer to withhold wages from the paying parent and pay that sum directly to the recipient parent or to the clerk of the court who sends it to the recipient parent. A court also may order an unemployed person who is obligated to pay child support to seek employment and to provide the court with proof that he or she is diligently looking for employment. Child support is modifiable by a court if changing circumstances warrant a modification. Child support can only be modified (increased, decreased or abated) by a court, and past due payments of child support accrue interest and are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Spousal Maintenance </STRONG></H3></A>
Spousal maintenance, formerly known as alimony, is financial support provided by one ex-spouse to the other. Spousal maintenance is normally deductible by the paying parent and taxable to the recipient parent if certain criteria are met. Either spouse may seek spousal maintenance. Factors that a court evaluates in setting spousal maintenance include the income and property of each party, including marital property apportioned and non-marital property assigned to the parties; the needs of each party; the present and future earning capacity of each party; any impairment of the present and future earning capacity of the party seeking maintenance due to that party devoting time to domestic duties or having foregone or delayed education, training, employment, or career opportunities due to the marriage; the time necessary to enable the party seeking maintenance to acquire appropriate education, training, and employment, and whether that party is able to support himself or herself through appropriate employment or is the custodian of a child making it appropriate that the custodian not seek employment; the standard of living established during the marriage; the duration of the marriage; the age and the physical and emotional condition of both parties; the tax consequences of the property division upon the respective economic circumstances of the parties; and contributions and services by the party seeking maintenance to the education, training, career or career potential, or license of the other spouse. Maintenance may be either temporary or permanent. If a party agrees to give up a claim for maintenance, it may not be renewed at a later date unless the right to do so is reserved. Maintenance can only be modified (increased, decreased, or abated) by a court, and past due payments of maintenance are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Division of Property </STRONG></H3></A>
In divorce actions, courts are authorized to fairly divide all marital property owned by either spouse alone, together with a third party or with the other spouse. Marital property is defined as all property acquired by either spouse during the marriage, except the following, which is known as non-marital property: property acquired before the marriage; property acquired by gift or inheritance; property acquired in exchange for property acquired before the marriage or in exchange for property acquired by gift or inheritance; property acquired by a spouse after a judgment of legal separation; property excluded by valid agreement of the parties; and any judgment or property obtained by judgment awarded to one spouse from the other spouse. For purposes of distribution of property, all property acquired by either spouse after the marriage and before a judgment of dissolution of marriage or declaration of invalidity of marriage, including non-marital property transferred into some form of co-ownership between the spouses, is presumed to be marital property, regardless of whether title is held individually or by the spouses in some form of co-ownership. 
<P>
In a divorce proceeding, the court will assign each spouse's non-marital property to that spouse and will also divide their marital property, without regard to marital misconduct, in fair and equitable proportions (not necessarily equally) considering all relevant factors, including the contribution of each party to the acquisition, preservation, or increase or decrease in value of the marital or non-marital property, including the contribution of a spouse as a homemaker or to the family unit; the dissipation by each party of the marital or non-marital property; the value of the property assigned to each spouse; the duration of the marriage; the relevant economic circumstances of each spouse when the division of property is to become effective, including the desirability of awarding the family home, or the right to live in it for reasonable periods, to the spouse having custody of the children; any obligations and rights arising from a prior marriage of either party; any valid antenuptial agreement of the parties; the age, health, station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, and needs of each of the parties; the custodial provisions for any children; whether the apportionment is in lieu of or in addition to maintenance; the reasonable opportunity of each spouse for future acquisition of capital assets and income; and the tax consequences of the property division upon the respective economic circumstances of the parties. 
<P>
Special attention is paid to the particular needs of the parties in making the division. In the case of a business or another kind of property that cannot be split, the court will award the property to one spouse and order that party to pay the other for the lost interest in the property. Pensions and other retirement assets accumulated during the marriage are also subject to equitable distribution. In Illinois, a spouse who contributed support and financial resources while the other received an education is entitled to some compensation for his or her investment. It is important to note that marital debts must also be equitably apportioned between the parties.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Invalid Marriages </STRONG></H3></A>
A Declaration of Invalidity of Marriage (formerly called an annulment) is a judgment issued by a court finding that a couple's marriage is invalid and thus, never legally existed. A distinction must be made between void and voidable marriages. Void marriages are those which never legally existed for any purpose, such as bigamous marriages and marriages between certain family members too closely related by blood. Voidable marriages are those where one of the parties may bring an action to have the marriage declared invalid because of an impediment which existed at the time of the marriage. Voidable marriages may result in cases of fraud or when proper consent for the marriage was not obtained. For example, if one party engaged in fraud regarding his or her willingness to cohabit or to consummate the marriage, or was physically incapable of consummating the marriage, the marriage may be declared invalid. If a party has engaged in fraud regarding paternity or pregnancy, or was under age 18 and did not have parental consent or judicial approval at the time of the marriage, the court may declare the marriage invalid. It is important to note that there are time limits imposed by law wherein a party to a voidable marriage must seek to have the marriage declared invalid or they will be found to have ratified the marriage and have thus waived their right to invalidate the marriage. It is also important to note that a legal annulment is different from an annulment granted by a church. A religious annulment is spiritual, rather than legal in nature, and does not affect the legal status of the marriage. Likewise, a legal invalidation may not satisfy the requirements for a religious annulment. Also, children born during a marriage that later is declared invalid are legitimate. Finally, if a person has entered into an invalid marriage with the good faith belief that they entered into a valid marriage, they may be entitled to maintenance from the other party.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Legal Separation </STRONG></H3></A>
A legal separation involves many of the same procedures as dissolution. A court may make decisions regarding custody, visitation, child support, spousal maintenance, and attorney fees. However, the court does not decide the property rights of the parties. After a Judgment of Legal Separation, the couple remains legally married, and unless and until a Judgment of Dissolution is entered, remarriage is forbidden. A legal separation is granted on the basis of a party living separate and apart from their spouse without fault. Sometimes a legal separation is sought by those whose religious beliefs prohibit divorce but who still desire child support and spousal maintenance. It should be noted that any property acquired by a spouse after the entry of a Judgment of Legal Separation is excluded from marital property should the parties subsequently obtain a dissolution.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Paternity </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Paternity is the condition of being the father of a child. While the identity of a child's mother usually is obvious from birth, the identity of the father may be unclear. Decisions regarding child custody, visitation, and child support frequently turn on whether a court has established a man's paternity of a child. 
<P>
Illinois law presumes a man is the father of a child if any of the following elements apply:
<UL>
<LI>He and the child's mother were married to each other at the time the child was born or conceived
<LI>He and the child's mother marry after the child is born, and he consents to being named as the child's father on the birth certificate
<LI>He and the child's mother have signed an acknowledgment of paternity in accordance with Illinois Department of Public Aid rules
<LI>He and the child's mother have signed a petition to establish the parent and child relationship by consent, in accordance with the Illinois Parentage Act
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Abuse </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Abuse is not easily defined. The legal definition of abuse is evolving and changing in response to society's changing understanding of the problem. More members of society are becoming responsible for reporting and preventing abuse. For example, under Illinois law, health care workers are obligated to provide suspected victims of domestic abuse with immediate and detailed information about the services available to them. Other professionals must report abuse they know about or suspect. Abuse of family members is against the law, but different rules and standards apply to different categories of abuse.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Domestic Abuse </STRONG></H3></A>
Domestic abuse -- also called domestic violence -- is defined by the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986 as physical abuse, harassment, interference with personal liberty, willful deprivation, or intimidation of a family or household member. When people talk about domestic abuse they usually mean the abuse of a woman by her present or former husband or boyfriend; "child abuse" and "elder abuse" often are referred to separately. Domestic abuse includes actual or threatened physical harm, sexual abuse, and assault to the extent that immediate physical harm is feared. The term also includes emotional abuse, such as harassment, intimidation, and threats. 
<P>
There are several options available to a victim of domestic abuse. A victim may file criminal charges, file a civil suit seeking damages, or seek an order of protection against the abuser. Usually, the first step is to seek an order of protection from a family or county court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="210"><H4><STRONG>Orders of Protection </STRONG></H4></A>
An order of protection is a court order prohibiting the abuser (the respondent) from continuing the abuse against the person bringing the action (the petitioner) or against any minor children in the household. The order forbids the offender from physically harming or causing fear of harm. The order is enforceable throughout the state of Illinois.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="220"><H4><STRONG><EM>Requirements </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Orders of protection can be obtained at the circuit courthouse in the county where the victim lives. To protect the victim and substantiate his or her claim against an abuser, it is important that application be made as soon as possible after the abuse occurs. The petition for an order of protection usually must be made by the victim; however, if the victim is unable to file the petition due to age, disability, or health, someone may file the petition on the victim's behalf. 
<P>
For a court order to be granted, a petition must be supported with evidence of the abuse; thus, the abused person must fill out an affidavit describing the events or incidents surrounding the abuse, the effects of the abuse on the petitioner, and the need for protection. When completing the paperwork, it is helpful if the abused person provides a picture of the abuser. If a picture is unavailable, a description of the offender is needed along with the offender's work and home addresses. A prepared statement of all incidents of abuse, past and present, and including dates and notes, can help document the need for protection. 
<P>
If necessary, the abused person may request an emergency order of protection. These orders also are called temporary or <STRONG>ex parte</STRONG> orders of protection. An emergency order might be necessary when an abused person is in danger and the protection is needed immediately. This kind of order of protection is valid only for up to 21 days but may be extended by the court for good cause shown.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="230"><H4><STRONG><EM>Hearing </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
A hearing at which a judge will consider whether to issue a long term (up to two years) plenary order of protection normally is set within 21 days but may be extended by the court for good cause shown. Further, upon two days notice to the petitioner, a respondent subject to an emergency order of protection may appear and petition the court for a rehearing of the original <STRONG>ex parte</STRONG> order of protection. The hearing is held so that the abused person and the person accused of abuse can tell the judge about the events surrounding the alleged abuse. In order to notify the person accused of the abuse of the hearing, the sheriff of the county in which the accused lives serves the papers on the accused. 
<P>
Regardless of whether the accused person attends the court hearing, the abused person -- or a representative if he or she is unable to attend due to age or disability -- must be present. The hearing is the opportunity to present evidence of abuse and for the person accused of the abuse to respond. At the hearing, the person alleging abuse should present medical records, police reports, and all other factual data which may be used as evidence of the abuse. 
<P>
At this point, the judge usually rules on the matter by granting the petition or dismissing the matter. In order to grant the petition, the judge must believe that the petitioner needs protection for his or her safety. If the judge dismisses the matter, he or she does not believe that the request for protection is supported by the evidence. 
<P>
Usually an order of protection prohibits the offender from contact with the victim, including visits to the victim's school or workplace when the victim is present. In some cases, the court may order a trial for cases in which the abuse is denied. A judge also may include other orders in the order for protection, such as temporarily changing child custody or visitation arrangements of children, granting the petitioner exclusive use of the residence, making the abuser pay restitution or receive counseling, or amending child support or spousal maintenance arrangements.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="240"><H4><STRONG><EM>Violations of Orders of Protection </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
When an order of protection is granted and the offender attempts to violate the order, the police should be contacted through the 911 emergency system and notified of the order. Police officers must respond immediately, and they have a duty to do everything possible to prevent further abuse. Once an order of protection is enforced by the police (usually by removing the abuser from the premises), a complete police report should be filed documenting the incident. Police officers may arrest the abuser. 
<P>
Violating an order is a criminal offense. Even if the officer does not make an arrest, he or she still must inform the victim of his or her right to request criminal proceedings, and advise the victim to seek medical help, take photographs to document the abuse, and keep evidence such as damaged clothing. Law enforcement officers also must file reports of every incident and investigate any believable allegations of abuse.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="250"><H4><STRONG><EM>Changing an Order </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
If circumstances arise making a change in the order necessary, a petition must be filed to set another hearing in the same court. The process is similar to that described above. A modification of the order of protection may be made if the abuser has violated the order since it was issued, or if the petitioner wishes to add another provision to the order that was not included originally. If an extension of the protection period is needed, the petitioner should file a motion with the court stating there has been no significant change in circumstances since the order was issued.
<P>
<A NAME="260"><H3><STRONG>Child Abuse </STRONG></H3></A>
Child abuse is a serious problem that may take many forms, including neglect, physical abuse, mental injury, and sexual abuse. Threatened injury, including any statement, overt act, condition, or status that would be considered a risk of child abuse, is also included in the definition of child abuse. Illinois has numerous laws concerned with protecting children from abuse, including the Abused and Neglected Child Reporting Act, the Children's Advocacy Center Act, and the Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Act. 
<P>
<STRONG>Neglect</STRONG> is the failure of a person responsible for a child to supply necessary food, clothing, shelter, or medical care when that person is able to do so, or the failure to protect the child from imminent and serious danger to his or her physical or mental health. Neglect may only be charged against a person who is legally responsible for the child. Neglect does not, however, cover instances where a parent or guardian in good faith relies on spiritual prayer for a sick child. 
<P>
<STRONG>Physical abuse</STRONG> is any physical injury, actual or threatened, inflicted upon a child by other than accidental means by a person responsible for the child's well-being. Physical abuse also includes any physical injury that cannot be explained by the child's medical history, and any means of discipline or control not authorized by law as acceptable for use with persons who are mentally challenged or impaired. 
<P>
<STRONG>Mental injury</STRONG> is any harm done to a child's psychological capacity or emotional stability. Evidence of such harm is any observable or substantial impairment of a child's ability to function normally as compared with other children of the same culture. Repeated and habitual mental or emotional abuse by the person responsible for the care and nurturing of the child can cause serious problems in the child. Symptoms of mental injury may include emotionally disturbed behavior, low self-esteem, inappropriate interaction with others, inability to communicate with others, extreme hostility and anger, anti-social behavior, and speech and learning disorders. 
<P>
<STRONG>Sexual abuse</STRONG> occurs when any person in a position of authority over a child has sexual contact with the child. Sexual contact includes any touching, fondling, or molestation, clothed or naked, of intimate parts of the child or the abuser. Intimate parts include the genitals, groin, inner thighs, buttocks or breasts. A person in a position of authority over the child includes a parent or person acting in the role or place of a parent. A person in a position of authority also includes anyone responsible for, either directly or through another person, the care, supervision, health or welfare of the child, no matter how brief, at the time of the abuse. Sexual abuse can also include involving a child in prostitution or pornography. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="270"><H4><STRONG>Reporting Child Abuse </STRONG></H4></A>
Neglect and abuse are leading causes of death in children. By law, certain members of society, by virtue of their professions and positions, are required to report child abuse. Persons required to report abuse -- known as mandatory reporters -- include health care professionals, teachers, law enforcement officials, child care providers, and social workers. Virtually anyone who works directly with children to provide care, protection, and supervision is required to report instances, actual or suspected, of child abuse. 
<P>
Mandatory reporters are obligated to report any abuse or neglect immediately to the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). Failure of a mandatory reporter to report suspected child abuse is a class A misdemeanor, unless the reporter is a physician, in which case the physician will be reported to the Illinois State Medical Disciplinary Board. 
<P>
Persons who report abuse or neglect in good faith are immune from civil or criminal liability. This means that if an investigation shows there was no abuse, the reporter cannot be sued as long as he or she reported the alleged child abuse with an honest belief and without knowledge of any facts or events contradicting the abuse or neglect.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="280"><H4><STRONG>Contents of a Report of Child Abuse or Neglect </STRONG></H4></A>
Child protective service workers must request information from a person reporting child abuse. To expedite the attention given to a child in an abusive or neglected situation, the reporter should have the following items ready for report:
<UL>
<LI>Names and addresses of the child and his or her parents or guardian
<LI>Age, race, and sex of the child
<LI>Events surrounding the known or suspected abuse, including the extent of injuries and any evidence of prior abuse
<LI>Names and addresses of the alleged abuser
<LI>Information about the family of the victim, including information about other children in the home
<LI>Name, occupation, and actions taken by the reporter
<LI>Any other information regarding the child or family that might be helpful
</UL>
If a child is in immediate danger, any person may report actual or suspected abuse to law enforcement through the emergency 911 system. The name of the individual reporting the abuse or neglect must be kept confidential by the DCFS and may only be released by consent of the reporter or by court order.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="290"><H4><STRONG>After an Abuse Report </STRONG></H4></A>
Once a report is filed, the DCFS must protect the child and other children in the family while trying to keep the family together. Depending upon the urgency of the report, an investigation usually follows. If a child is in immediate danger, the child may be removed from the home, even against the parent's or guardian's wishes on a temporary basis. If a DCFS worker believes the child should be kept away from the home for the child's safety, a court order is necessary.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="300"><H4><STRONG>Investigation of Child Abuse </STRONG></H4></A>
In investigating a report of child abuse or neglect, DCFS workers are not required to obtain parental permission before interviewing the victim of the alleged abuse. By the time the investigation concludes, however, the parent or guardian must be informed that the child has been interviewed. 
<P>
The initial objectives of the investigation by DCFS workers are to evaluate the existence of any physical or emotional damage to the child, identify the risk of harm to the child, determine the urgency of the claim, and decide whether immediate intervention is required. After these factors have been assessed, the goals are to determine whether or not the family is a candidate for treatment, and to initiate and monitor treatment and its progress. If the worker decides that judicial intervention is needed, an action is initiated in juvenile or family court.
<P>
<A NAME="310"><H3><STRONG>High-Risk Adults </STRONG></H3></A>
Included in the Illinois Domestic Violence Act of 1986 are provisions dealing with the problem of abuse of high-risk adults with disabilities. A high-risk adult with a disability is someone over the age of 18 who has a physical or mental disability that prevents the adult from being able to protect himself or herself. The definition includes elderly people with disabilities. Family or household members are covered under the Act as persons who may be liable for abusing high-risk adults with disabilities, as well as other persons who have responsibility for these adults, including workers in hospitals, nursing homes, or other similar care facilities. Abuse of high-risk adults with disabilities includes physical abuse, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation, including financial exploitation. Neglect includes failure to provide food, shelter, clothing, personal hygiene, and medical care, unreasonable confinement, and failure to protect the high-risk adult from abuse or from other hazards to their health or safety. 
<P>
People who know of or suspect abuse or neglect may make a report of any known or suspected incident of abuse or neglect to the Illinois Department on Aging. Law enforcement officers in Illinois are required by law to assist high-risk adults in petitioning for an order of protection. The police also have the authority to enter premises or to make warrantless arrests in situations in which there is the probability of death or great bodily harm to a high-risk adult, or to prevent criminal activity. Health care workers must assist suspected victims of abuse by offering immediate information about services available in Illinois.
<P>
<A NAME="320"><H3><STRONG>Other Remedies for Abuse </STRONG></H3></A>
Any person who has been abused may seek an order of protection. In addition, the abuse of some victims must be reported by designated mandatory reporters to agencies designed to address the abuse. There are other remedies for victims of abuse. Abusers are subject to arrest for the crimes they commit. Domestic battery, aggravated battery of a child or institutionalized mentally retarded person, aggravated battery of a senior citizen, and criminal neglect of an elderly or disabled person are specific crimes in Illinois. Victims may wish to work with prosecutors to have offenders tried on criminal charges. It is also possible under some circumstances to file a civil lawsuit against offenders for damages. Criminal hearings and civil lawsuits are discussed further in the chapters, <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Case</A> and <A HREF="c12.html">Criminal Law</A> in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG>
<P>
People with any questions about abuse or about other aspects of family law, such as marriage or divorce, should contact the agency or organization that deals with their problem, or should seek the advice of an attorney.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Immigration Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

For centuries, people from around the world have been coming to the United States. They come to work, get an education, escape oppression, start a new life, do business, visit friends, or sightsee. Over the years, the United States has seen tremendous diversity in the countries immigrants come from and their reasons for coming here. In response to the incredible demand for permission to enter this country, the federal government has established a complex set of laws that determines who may enter this country and for what reasons. This chapter discusses legal immigration and travel to the United States.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>United States Citizenship </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
United States citizens have a right to travel to and live in the United States and enjoy the fullest protection of United States laws. People who are not citizens of the United States usually must have a visa to enter and may not enjoy the protection of all United States laws. 
<P>
A person can become a United States citizen either through birth or through a process known as naturalization. A person can be a United States citizen from birth either by being born here, or by being born in a foreign country but having a parent who is a citizen of the United States. Anyone born in the United States has automatic citizenship, regardless of the parents' citizenship, and even if both parents are living in this country illegally at the time of the child's birth. The only exception is that children born to foreign diplomats in the United States do not get automatic citizenship. Anyone not born a citizen must be naturalized to become a citizen. Occasionally, a group of people is naturalized by treaty or by act of Congress. Usually, a person goes through the process individually.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Aliens, Immigrants, Nonimmigrants, and Residents </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An alien is a citizen of any country other than the United States. A person who comes here to stay permanently is called an immigrant. Someone who intends to return to his or her country of origin is called a nonimmigrant, even if he or she intends to stay for a substantial period of time. For example, a student might stay in the United States many years to complete an education and still be considered a nonimmigrant. The distinction between immigrant and nonimmigrant is crucial. Permission to enter as a nonimmigrant often is easier to get than permission to enter as an immigrant, so some people are tempted to claim they intend to return to their home country in order to enter this country. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is aware of this temptation and often will deny a nonimmigrant visa application to anyone suspected of wanting to remain permanently. Also, being granted a nonimmigrant visa sometimes can make it more difficult to get an immigrant visa later. A permanent resident is an alien who has been given permission to live permanently in the United States. 
<P>
In a dispute with the INS over an applicant's true intent, the applicant always bears the burden of proving intent to remain here temporarily. For some people, this burden is nearly impossible to overcome. For example, the spouse of a permanent resident normally must wait over two years for available immigrant visas. If he or she claims to want to visit only temporarily, he or she must overcome the presumption that a married person would want to remain permanently with his or her spouse.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>The Visa System </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A visa is a stamp in a person's passport that gives him or her conditional approval to enter the United States. Most matters involving visas are handled by the INS. Most aliens apply for visas from a consulate or embassy of the United States in the alien's home country. 
<P>
Citizens of some countries, primarily European countries and Japan, may enter the United States for up to 90 days without a visa. To be eligible, citizens of these countries must show the INS that they have a return ticket home and that they intend to engage in a type of business or tourist activity that would be allowed under a "B Visa," described below. Canadian citizens generally do not need visas to enter temporarily. In some instances, they must obtain INS approval in advance if they are coming here to work. 
<P>
Congress establishes a complex set of quotas that limits the number of visas that can be granted for most types of visas. Whether an applicant receives a visa depends on the type of visa requested, the applicant's reason for traveling to the United States, and the applicant's country of origin. Probably the most important element to obtaining a visa successfully is knowing for which visa category to apply. For certain categories of visas and certain countries of origin, an applicant can wait many years before he or she even will be considered for a visa. Sometimes the wait would be much shorter if the applicant applied for a different type of visa. Unfortunately, once an applicant applies for one type of visa, it can be difficult to change the application to another class of visa. For this reason, it is wise to consult an immigration attorney before applying for any kind of visa.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Nonimmigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
There are different kinds of nonimmigrant visas, identified by the letters A-R, available for persons who do not intend to remain in the United States permanently. All nonimmigrant visas are based on what the applicant intends to do in this country. Following is a list of the visa categories.

<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Immigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
An applicant who intends to stay in this country permanently generally is admitted either on the basis of employment or family connections. The main exception is for political asylum seekers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Employment-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can receive permission to immigrate to this country on the basis of his or her employment. There are five categories of employment, known as preferences, through which aliens can be permitted to immigrate.
<P>
<STRONG>First Preference</STRONG>: Individuals of extraordinary ability, outstanding professors or researchers, and multinational executives.
<P>
<STRONG>Second Preference</STRONG>: Professionals with advanced degrees and aliens with exceptional abilities in science, art, or business. (Note: "Exceptional ability" is a different standard than "extraordinary ability" required for a first preference.)
<P>
<STRONG>Third Preference</STRONG>: Skilled workers, professionals, and other workers for which there is a shortage of workers in the United States.
<P>
<STRONG>Fourth Preference</STRONG>: Certain special workers, such as religious workers.
<P>
<STRONG>Fifth Preference</STRONG>: Investors creating employment for workers in the United States; the investment must be substantial (i.e., between $500,000 and $1,000,000).
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Family-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can get a visa as an immediate relative of a United States citizen if he or she is a child, spouse, or parent of the citizen. In addition, there are four family-based immigrant visa categories:
<P> 
<STRONG>First Preference</STRONG>: Unmarried children of United States citizens.
<P>
<STRONG>Second Preference</STRONG>: Spouses and unmarried children of lawful permanent residents.
<P>
<STRONG>Third Preference</STRONG>: Married children of United States citizens.
<P>
<STRONG>Fourth Preference</STRONG>: Siblings of adult United States citizens.
<P>
Each preference is allotted a total number of visas. Generally speaking, the higher the applicant's preference, the shorter the wait to get a visa.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Special Classes of Immigrants </STRONG></H4></A>
Some groups of immigrants receive special treatment and fall outside the preference system described above. 
<P>
Diversity immigrants are immigrants from countries deemed under-represented in the pool of applicants for visas throughout the years. Under a new program implemented by the INS in 1995, a certain number of visas will be granted to applicants from low-admission countries and who have a high school education or two years of training or experience in a particular occupation. 
<P>
Refugees and asylees also receive special treatment. A person is a refugee if he or she is outside the United States, is fleeing or has fled his or her country, and has a well-founded fear that if returned to the home country, he or she will be persecuted because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An asylee is an alien already in the United States who, like a refugee, has a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to his or her home country. The president and Congress decide each year the total number of refugees and asylees to accept into the country. Occasionally, Congress grants immigrant visas allotted for individuals from specific countries according to political factors. Recent programs have included China, Hong Kong, and Tibet.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Entry and Exclusion </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A visa only gives conditional approval to enter the country. Once an alien arrives in the United States with a visa, he or she must apply for entry from INS officials at the point of entry. For most aliens, this is a mere formality, but the INS can exclude persons with valid visas for a variety of reasons, including communicable diseases, physical or mental disorders that pose a threat to others, drug addiction, or criminal history. Involvement in espionage or terrorist activity against the United States government or its people is grounds for exclusion. The Secretary of State also has broad discretion to bar entry of anyone whose presence would have an adverse effect on the foreign policy of the United States. Sometimes waivers are available for aliens who otherwise would be denied entry for certain reasons. For example, the child of a United States citizen may be granted a waiver to enter to receive treatment for drug addiction.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Getting a Green Card and Becoming a Naturalized Citizen </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Becoming a permanent resident is the first step that an alien must take to become a naturalized American citizen. People with permission to live in the United States permanently are issued "green cards" that allow them to work with few restrictions. A permanent resident can apply to become a naturalized citizen after five years, or three years if married to a United States citizen. 
<P>
The INS is diligent in investigating marriages between United States citizens and aliens to ensure that aliens do not become permanent residents through sham marriages. Immigration law specifies that an alien seeking permanent residence based on a marriage to a United States citizen of less than two years first is granted conditional permanent resident status. After two years, the husband and wife must apply to the INS to remove this conditional status.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Deportation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Deportation is the expulsion of an alien who entered the United States illegally, or entered legally but has done something to become deportable. With few exceptions, any violation of the conditions of a visa, no matter how minor, is grounds for deportation to a person's country of origin. Conviction for any crime but the most minor is also grounds for deportation. Deportation can delay an alien whose long-term goal is to live permanently in this country. After being deported, aliens are forbidden to re-enter the country for five years. Aliens deported for aggravated felonies, such as drug smuggling, are barred from re-entry for 20 years or may be barred permanently. The delay in returning to the United States may be even greater for aliens from countries with long waiting lists. Returning home under a deportation order may result in the embassy's refusal to entrust the individual with another temporary visa. 
<P>
There are a number of remedies to deportation, especially if the deportable person has lived in the United States for a long time, building a life that demonstrates good moral character. Even if the deportable individual has not been here long, there may be certain waivers or defenses to deportation. Among the most common is asking the court for "voluntary departure," which allows the individual to depart the United States on his or her own. In any case, anyone facing deportation should seek the advice of counsel well in advance of a deportation hearing.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Personal Injury Law: General
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Personal injuries, as their name implies, are injuries to an individual person. Crimes are wrongful acts against society. The government punishes those who commit crimes with criminal penalties. For personal injuries, the government does not punish the wrongdoer but gives the victim the right to pursue a private, civil lawsuit, called a tort action, against the wrongdoer. Some wrongful acts are both crimes and torts, and can subject the wrongdoer to both criminal penalties and tort remedies. This chapter outlines the actions that lead to most personal injury lawsuits, including general accidents and injuries, use of defective products, and injuries occurring to workers on the job. The <A HREF="c20.html">Personal Injury Law:  Transportation</A> Chapter deals with actions that result from transportation-related accidents. The <A HREF="c19.html">Personal Injury Law: Medical &amp; Professional Malpractice</A> Chapter discusses medical and legal negligence.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>General Concepts of Tort Law  </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Tort laws are based on the premise that when someone does something to harm another person physically, mentally, or financially, the person harmed ought to be compensated for the loss. Tort lawsuits are governed by a set of rules that are different from the rules that govern criminal lawsuits.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Degree of Fault Needed to Recover  </STRONG></H3></A>
There are three kinds of torts -- negligence, intentional misconduct, and strict liability. Each requires the plaintiff to show a different degree of fault to recover from the defendant.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Negligence  </STRONG></H4></A>
A person is negligent if he or she fails to act as a reasonable person would act in a similar situation. Examples of negligence include inattentive driving that causes an automobile accident, or a store owner failing to repair a defective escalator that causes a fall. If a reasonable person would have driven attentively, or if a reasonable store owner would have fixed the unsafe escalator, the person who drove inattentively or failed to make repairs could be found negligent by a judge or jury. Negligent behavior is almost never criminal.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Intentional Misconduct  </STRONG></H4></A>
Intentional misconduct occurs when someone, acting deliberately, does something that hurts another person or damages that person's property. The law does not require that the person intend to cause the injury he or she actually inflicts, only that he or she acted deliberately or with complete indifference toward a person's own safety or the safety of others. For example, a driver of an automobile may intend only to scare a pedestrian by swerving toward the pedestrian, but if the driver hits the pedestrian, the driver commits intentional misconduct. Intentional misconduct can be more difficult to prove than negligence, but often a plaintiff can recover greater damages if he or she can show the defendant acted intentionally. Intentional misconduct is often criminal behavior also. Examples of intentional misconduct include assault and battery.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Strict Liability </STRONG></H4></A>
In some situations, a plaintiff can recover for injuries received even if the defendant uses utmost care. In these situations, a defendant is said to be strictly, or absolutely, liable for any damages resulting from his or her actions. The principle behind strict liability is that some activities are necessary but so dangerous that even a reasonable person cannot make them completely safe. As a social policy, defendants are permitted to engage in certain activities but are held strictly liable for any injury resulting from the activity. Strict liability claims most commonly result from extremely dangerous activities such as blasting, excavating, or demolishing a building or from defective products. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Comparative Fault </STRONG></H4></A>
Tort law attempts to compensate victims if their injuries are caused by another person. When one person clearly causes all of another person's injury, blame is easy to place. In many other cases, however, the victim's actions help cause the injury or make it worse than it would otherwise be. For instance, a negligent driver might injure a pedestrian who is negligently walking in the street, instead of on a sidewalk where a prudent pedestrian normally walks. A person injured by a defective chain saw may have suffered more severe injuries by negligently failing to wear safety goggles while using the chain saw. In these cases, a judge or jury must calculate how much each party is at fault. Each state has its own rules for calculating damages that can be recovered when a victim is at least partially to blame for his or her own injury. 
<P>
Illinois has a comparative fault rule. Under the comparative fault rule, a judge reduces the amount of any damage award by the percent that the victim's own actions contributed to his or her injuries. For example, if a jury finds that a plaintiff suffered $100,000 in damages, but was 30 percent at fault, the judge reduces the damage award by 30 percent to $70,000. The reduction may be made only up to 50 percent. If the victim is more than 50 percent at fault, he or she collects nothing.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Vicarious Liability </STRONG></H3></A>
There are several ways a person can be held liable for the actions of another person. This is known as vicarious liability. For example, a parent might be held responsible for damage caused by his or her child if the parent knows that the child is likely to injure someone, the parent has the ability to control the child, and the parent negligently fails to exercise any control over the child. The owner of a vehicle can be held responsible for accidents caused when another person drives the vehicle if the owner negligently entrusts the vehicle to the other driver. The most common form of vicarious liability is called <STRONG>respondeat superior</STRONG> Under respondeat superior, an employer is responsible for torts committed by employees within the scope of their employment. A business owner is not usually responsible for acts committed by independent contractors. For example, if a pedestrian is struck and injured by a person driving to a party, the victim has a claim against the driver. If the pedestrian is hit by a person driving a delivery van for his or her employer, then respondeat superior gives the pedestrian claims against both the driver and the employer. As a practical matter, personal injury plaintiffs often focus their recovery efforts on the employers because employers usually have more money or better insurance.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Burden of Proof  </STRONG></H3></A>
The burden of proof in a civil lawsuit is less strict than the proof required in a criminal case. In a criminal case, the state must prove a person's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The state is required to meet this high standard because a defendant's liberty, and possibly even life, are at stake. The plaintiff in a personal injury lawsuit need only show that it is more probable than not that an injury was caused by the defendant's actions. If the jury finds that the evidence even slightly favors the injured party, then it must find for the plaintiff. The personal injury plaintiff need only meet this lower standard because the defendant's life and liberty are not at stake. 
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Defenses  </STRONG></H3></A>
Sometimes people are allowed, or privileged, to commit acts that otherwise constitute assault or battery, and not be liable for damages. If one acts in defense of self, others, or one's land, the use of force can be justified. Illinois has a "Good Samaritan" law that states that a civilian has no duty to provide aid to an injured person; however, once a person voluntarily assists someone, he or she becomes liable for any injury that results from the failure to exercise due care. Law enforcement officials and firefighters have a defense to liability if they injure someone while providing good-faith emergency care. For example, if a firefighter responds to a call and in trying to help the victim accidentally worsens the victim's injury, the firefighter has a defense to charges of assault and battery.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Damages  </STRONG></H3></A>
The damages a victim may collect depend on the type of tort alleged. For torts to the body, a plaintiff can collect lost wages, diminished earning capacity, costs of medical care, pain, and suffering. For torts to property, a plaintiff can recover diminished value of the property, replacement costs, or cost of repair. 
<P>
In a lawsuit alleging intentional misconduct, the plaintiff often may be able to recover punitive damages in addition to any awards for injuries, pain, and suffering. Punitive damages, designed to punish people or organizations for unlawful acts, are usually very large sums of money. Until recently, there were few limits to punitive damages. Although federal and state legislatures have recently passed laws capping punitive damages in certain types of cases, it can still be to the plaintiff's advantage to convince a jury that injuries were the result of an intentional act and not mere negligence. 
<P>
A wrongful death lawsuit is a lawsuit filed by the surviving relatives of a person. For example, under Illinois law, any dependent heirs, such as sons or daughters, of a person killed by a defective product can sue the manufacturer for loss of that person's future income. Surviving relatives cannot, however, sue a manufacturer to collect damages for the pain and suffering of a person wrongfully killed by a manufacturer's defective product. However, the estate of the deceased person can sue to collect money needed to pay any bills for medical treatment received by the person before he or she died. 
<P>
A surviving spouse can sue for damages to recover for loss of advice, comfort, assistance, and protection. Illinois recognizes a viable fetus as a "person."  Therefore, any personal injury action that can be brought by one who was born can also be brought on behalf of an unborn, viable fetus.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Suing the Government  </STRONG></H3></A>
There was a time when citizens could not sue the government for torts committed by government employees. The federal and state governments enjoyed complete immunity from tort lawsuits. This immunity has been partially waived, but there are limits on tort actions against the government. Although the federal and most state governments now permit suits for personal injuries suffered because of the negligence of a government employee or as a result of a dangerous condition on government property, there are limits on how much can be collected and when a suit must be initiated. Typically, the State of Illinois may only be sued in the Court of Claims for actions of breach of contract with the state, tort by an agent of the state, and tort by an escaped inmate.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Areas of Personal Injury Practice  </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Lawyers practicing general personal injury law generally fall into one of three practice areas: product liability, general accidents and injuries, and workers' compensation.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Product Liability </STRONG></H3></A>
Injuries resulting from defective products are the basis of some personal injury lawsuits. Product liability lawsuits frequently receive attention in the media. Stories of people recovering damages for faulty breast implants, exploding gas tanks, or flammable children's clothing all make headlines. Because a faulty product line can injure many people, product liability lawsuits are sometimes brought as class action lawsuits in which many injured people -- the class -- bring one united lawsuit against the manufacturer, share legal costs, and split any award. 
<P>
Product liability claims usually rely on one of three theories: strict liability, negligence, or breach of warranty. Each of these has its standards and potential damages. Often a single injury leads a plaintiff to bring claims under all three theories against the manufacturer. For example, a person injured when a microwave oven explodes might allege that the oven's manufacturer breached a warranty, negligently manufactured the oven, and that the oven was so dangerous that its manufacturer should be held strictly liable for all injuries it caused.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Strict Product Liability  </STRONG></H4></A>
Strict liability makes the manufacturer of a product liable to someone injured while using the product if the product was unreasonably dangerous. This theory focuses on the product itself. In Illinois, a person alleging strict product liability must show that:

<LI>The product was in a defective condition, so that it was unreasonably dangerous even if used for its intended purpose
<LI>The defect existed when the product left the manufacturer's control
<LI>The defect caused the plaintiff's injury
</UL>
For example, if a chair had a defective leg that made it unsafe to sit on, the leg was defective when the chair left the manufacturer, and that weak leg caused injury to a person who fell after sitting in the chair, the manufacturer may be strictly liable for damages.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Negligent Design or Manufacture  </STRONG></H4></A>
Manufacturers can be sued for negligence. If a manufacturer negligently designs or manufactures a product, the manufacturer is liable to those hurt by the product. Unlike strict liability theory, which focuses on the product, negligence claims focus on the manufacturer's actions in designing and manufacturing the product. As in all negligence cases, the manufacturer can be found liable if a judge or jury finds that the manufacturer failed to exercise the degree of care that a reasonable manufacturer would exercise in manufacturing the product or that the product was not manufactured according to the manufacturer's own specifications. 
<P>
Under this theory, the manufacturer of the faulty chair might be liable if the company did not conduct reasonable inspections to ensure that products were checked for defects before being sold to consumers. It is important to note that the manufacturer is not negligent merely for failing to produce a perfectly safe product. Illinois courts use a reasonable care balancing test that asks jurors to balance the likelihood and seriousness of harm against the feasibility and burden of possible precautions that might have avoided the harm. For example, manufacturers might not be required to install a safety feature if doing so would make the product prohibitively expensive or impossible to use. In these cases, the manufacturer has a duty to warn users of the product of the risks associated with its use so that users can protect themselves. This is why ladders, for example, have so many warnings on them. No ladder can be made perfectly safe, so manufacturers warn consumers of their dangers. 
<P>
Some of the most convincing evidence of negligence is evidence of the actions of other manufacturers of similar products. If a manufacturer fails to take precautions or to provide warnings that are standard in the industry, there is a strong likelihood a jury will find that the manufacturer was negligent.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Breach of Warranty  </STRONG></H4></A>
Manufacturers can also be liable for product injuries caused by a breach of warranty. Breach of warranty lawsuits may involve the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which is a bundle of statutes adopted in Illinois and other states to govern many commercial transactions. Under the UCC, a product must be fit for its intended purpose. If a consumer buys a product and is hurt while using it for a purpose for which it is clearly intended, the manufacturer can be liable. A product must also be fit for a particular purpose for which the seller knows the buyer is purchasing the item. A manufacturer also may make additional warranties to the consumer. The breach of any of these warranties can make the manufacturer liable to consumers hurt by the product. In some situations, a manufacturer is allowed to disclaim some of these warranties, so a plaintiff must check to determine which of the warranties apply.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>General Accidents and Injuries  </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A broad variety of accidents and injuries may lead to personal injury lawsuits. Some of the most common are discussed in this chapter. Libel and slander are discussed in the <A HREF="c09.html">Arts, Entertainment &amp; Intellectual Property Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Assault and Battery  </STRONG></H3></A>
Many people believe that assault and battery are one action. They are actually two closely related but distinct actions. Assault is the attempt or threat to inflict injury on another person when coupled with the apparent ability to carry out the attempt or threat. Assault does not require actual physical contact. For example, if someone threatens to strike a neighbor and appears capable of carrying out the threat, the person making the threat may be liable for assault even though he or she never touches the neighbor. Battery is similar to assault but requires actual unwelcome physical contact. The physical contact need not be so strong as to injure the other person. For example, a person can commit battery by touching another person in an unwelcome sexual manner.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Illegal Confinement  </STRONG></H3></A>
Illegal confinement, also known as false imprisonment, is confinement by force, threats of force, or physical barriers when one has no right to do so. Unlike in other states, Illinois merchants are not permitted to make a person suspected of shoplifting wait against his or her wishes for the police to arrive. If the merchant keeps the suspect longer than is reasonable or necessary under the circumstances (beyond the person's wishes), the merchant may be liable for illegal confinement.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Landowner Liability  </STRONG></H3></A>
There are several ways a landowner may be liable to someone injured on the landowner's property. Business owners and home owners may be sued if they do something wrong that causes others to be injured on their property. A business owner sometimes is sued for injuries caused by people committing crimes on his or her property if the business owner did not take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of customers. An example of this type of case occurs when a person is attacked in a parking lot and then sues the lot's owner for failing to provide security measures that could have prevented the attack. 
<P>
In general, a landowner is not liable for the injuries of a trespasser; however, the landowner must take reasonable care to protect the people he or she knows come on the property for legitimate purposes, such as letter carriers. A landowner may be responsible to children injured on his or her property if there is something on the property -- like a swimming pool -- that is dangerous, the children are likely to exercise less care than adults, and the landowner fails to exercise sufficient care to prevent injury to a reasonable child. Other states place a greater liability on landowners in this scenario through what is commonly called the "attractive nuisance doctrine." Illinois does not recognize the attractive nuisance theory. 
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Workers' Compensation  </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois' workers' compensation system compensates workers for injuries occurring in the workplace. Without a workers' compensation system, workers injured on the job would have to prove that their employers' negligence led to the injury. Because the system does not require proving negligence, a worker injured on the job has a better chance of being compensated than if he or she is injured in some other way and has to file a civil lawsuit. Instead of filing suit, a worker notifies her employer of the injury and the employer then contacts its insurance carrier, which handles payment of any medical bill and other claims made by the employee. All employers subject to the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act must either carry workers' compensation insurance or demonstrate they have the financial resources to cover any reasonably anticipated claims. 
<P>
The trade-off for this relatively easy route to compensation is a limit to the amount of money that can be awarded for a work-related injury. With few exceptions, employers or their insurers are only required to pay for medical expenses, permanent injuries, and/or lost wages. An employer cannot be made to pay for emotional distress such as pain and suffering. 
<P>
Often a worker contacts an attorney because the employer or its insurance carrier refuses to pay a workers' compensation claim, maintaining that either the injury was not work-related or that the benefits demanded exceed those justified for the injury. Sometimes a dispute arises after an employer stops making workers' compensation payments. When disputes arise, a worker has a variety of options, including an administrative conference, small claims court, or -- as a final option -- a hearing before a workers' compensation judge. 
<P>
The most common way to resolve disputes is through a semi-formal administrative conference, subject to rules established by the Illinois Department of Labor and Industry. At the conference, a Department representative acts as an informal mediator and referee who decides what kind of evidence may be considered by those attending. Typically, the employer, an investigator from the insurance company if the employer is not self-insured, the Department representative, the injured employee, and the employee's attorney attend the conference. The goal of a conference is to reach a voluntary resolution to the dispute. If the parties cannot resolve their dispute, the Department representative issues a judgment that everyone is obligated to follow. Such a judgment can be appealed to the Department by anyone involved in the conference. 
<P>
Going to small claims court is another way to resolve disputes over a workers' compensation claim. Both the employer and employee, however, must agree to turn over the dispute to a conciliation court, and the amount of the dispute cannot exceed $5000. Either party can decide whether to be represented by an attorney in such a proceeding. 
<P>
Finally, a dispute over a workers' compensation claim can be taken to a special workers' compensation court, where a judge will formally hear evidence about the injury and will resolve the dispute in a written decision that both sides must follow. Anyone disagreeing with the decision has a right to appeal it to the Illinois Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals and, if still unsatisfied, to the Illinois Supreme Court.

</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

For injuries caused by the negligence of a medical professional or lawyer, the government generally does not punish the wrongdoer but gives the victim the right to pursue a private, civil lawsuit, called a tort action, against the wrongdoer. This chapter outlines the actions that lead to most professional malpractice lawsuits. General accidents and injuries and injuries occurring to workers on the job are discussed in the <A HREF="c18.html">Personal Injury Law: General</A> Chapter. The <A HREF="c20.html">Personal Injury Law: Transportation</A> Chapter deals with actions that result from transportation-related accidents.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Professional Malpractice </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A malpractice lawsuit can be brought against any kind of professional, including psychologists, clergy, accountants, financial advisors, doctors, and lawyers. Two common types of professional malpractice claims are those against doctors and lawyers.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Legal Malpractice </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There is no precise definition of legal malpractice. Generally speaking, a lawyer commits legal malpractice when he or she fails to provide quality legal services to a client. Bad conduct that is not unique to lawyers may lead to a lawsuit, but it does not constitute legal malpractice. For instance, a lawyer who misses deadlines, inadequately prepares for a trial, or represents both sides in a dispute without informing both parties, commits legal malpractice. A lawyer who steals funds from, assaults, or defrauds a client, has committed a crime but probably has not committed legal malpractice. Many of the steps discussed in the <A HREF="c01.html">How to Hire an Attorney</A> Chapter may help a consumer avoid malpractice disputes. 
<P>
A legal malpractice lawsuit generally has four elements: duty, breach, injury, and proximate causation. A judge or jury examines all four elements in a legal malpractice trial, and if any element is missing, the plaintiff cannot recover.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Duty  </STRONG></H3></A>
The duty a lawyer owes his or her client has two components. The lawyer must exercise the legal skill that a competent attorney would exercise, and must meet all of his or her fiduciary obligations to the client. Fiduciary obligations include a duty of undivided loyalty to the client's interests and confidentiality. No lawyer is expected to know the law so well that he or she can give perfect answers to obscure legal questions. Lawyers are expected to know how to research issues and to recognize their limits when they reach an unsettled or unclear area of law. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Breach </STRONG></H3></A>
A lawyer commits a breach if he or she fails to do his or her duty. Breach is frequently the toughest element to prove in a legal malpractice lawsuit, because a lawyer can make mistakes and still not commit a breach. Law is an inexact science. Even competent lawyers frequently disagree on the best course of action in a particular legal matter. Sometimes, the strategy chosen is a combination of knowledge about the law and how the lawyer thinks a judge or jury will react to the facts of a case. A client may be able to show that another lawyer would have pursued a different strategy, and still the client may be unable to show that the first lawyer committed a breach.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Injury  </STRONG></H3></A>
A plaintiff must show that he or she was injured by the lawyer's breach of duty. For example, a lawyer might miss a deadline, but if he or she is subsequently granted an extension, the client is not injured. If missing the deadline bars the plaintiff's claim, however, he or she has been injured. A lawyer might forget to assert a claim, but if the claim would have been denied anyway, the client has not been injured. Usually a plaintiff only recovers direct economic losses, such as the money needed to pay another attorney to re-do legal work, any fees or penalties paid, or any interest income lost, because of an attorney's malpractice. It is difficult, although not impossible, to recover for speculative losses, that is, for what might have happened if a different lawyer had been hired, emotional losses, or legal expenses incurred hiring a new lawyer to sue the previous lawyer.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Proximate Cause  </STRONG></H3></A>
Finally, the client must show that the breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. Proximate cause is a thorny legal concept that essentially asks whether the breach was sufficiently responsible for the injury so that the lawyer should be held responsible. Proximate cause is easiest to prove if a lawyer misses a deadline or gives advice that is clearly wrong. In these cases, the client usually can show exactly what would have happened had the lawyer met the deadline or given correct advice. Proximate cause is more difficult to show in cases in which a lawyer pursues a course of action in trial that works to the client's disadvantage. In this case, the client has to show what the judge or jury would have done had the lawyer chosen another strategy. This can be difficult to show. The client needs to prove, to the judge or jury's satisfaction, what another lawyer would have done, and how the jury in the underlying case would have reacted to that strategy. The first lawyer might argue successfully that even if a different strategy had been pursued, the outcome of the case would have been the same. 
<P>
Attorneys who try legal malpractice cases have had increasing success recently with new theories of liability for legal malpractice. One trend focuses on attorney investments and financial dealings. Courts have found that a lawyer breached a fiduciary duty to a client by failing to reveal stock ownership in an opposing corporate party, or by using insider information learned about the client to make profits in the stock market. Another growing trend is for the court to allow claims brought against lawyers by persons other than clients. For example, the beneficiaries under a client's will might bring a legal malpractice action against a lawyer who incorrectly drafted a deceased client's will if the beneficiaries are dissatisfied with their share of the estate. Depositors in a failed savings and loan company might sue lawyers who gave advice to the savings and loan. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Medical Malpractice  </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Medical malpractice includes many forms of liability-producing conduct that occur in rendering medical services. Medical malpractice does not apply solely to medical doctors. Psychiatrists, dentists, nurses, and hospitals can be sued for medical malpractice. Wrongful conduct that is not unique to doctors or other health care professionals may give rise to a legal action, but does not meet the definition of medical malpractice. For example, a patient might bring a breach of contract claim against a doctor who fails to provide services agreed upon in a contract, or a patient might bring fraud charges against a doctor for misrepresenting his or her expertise. These are not medical malpractice claims.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Elements of Medical Malpractice  </STRONG></H3></A>
A medical malpractice lawsuit -- like a legal malpractice action -- generally has four elements: duty, breach, injury, and proximate causation. A judge or jury examines all four elements in a medical malpractice trial, and if any element is missing, the plaintiff cannot recover.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Duty  </STRONG></H4></A>
A doctor who has agreed to treat a patient has a duty to that patient to use at least the same level of care that any other reasonably competent doctor would use to treat a condition under the same circumstances. One problem in determining duty is that the average juror or judge may not be able to determine what a doctor should have done in a particular instance. Medical malpractice lawsuits require expert testimony from another doctor as to the standard of care that should have been given. The plaintiff needs an affidavit from a medical expert when starting a lawsuit. 
<P>
There are many complex questions in deciding what testimony to allow. In every case, the judge must decide whether a doctor's actions are to be judged against all other doctors or only against doctors specializing in a particular type of practice. Some judges may allow evidence of what other doctors in the same region would do, while some judges allow testimony about what doctors in other parts of the country would have done. Success in a medical malpractice case frequently depends on how a judge answers these questions. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Breach  </STRONG></H4></A>
A person breaches a duty when he or she fails to use the same level of care another reasonably competent professional would exercise in the same circumstances. Breach is frequently the toughest point to prove in a medical malpractice lawsuit, because competent doctors frequently disagree on the best course of action in a particular medical matter. Like law, medicine is an inexact science. A client may show that another doctor would have taken a different course of action and still be unable to show the first doctor committed a breach. The plaintiff must prove the level of care a reasonably competent professional would have exercised and show that the defendant's actions fell short of that level.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Injury </STRONG></H4></A>
Injury is usually not difficult to prove in medical malpractice actions. A patient who dies or  suffers a permanent disability or chronic pain obviously has been injured. Often, it is the doctor who has most trouble disproving this element because it can be difficult to prove that a patient who claims to be injured is not. Many legitimate injuries, such as whiplash, have few quantifiable manifestations even though they cause their sufferers to feel pain. An injury need not be permanent to be compensable.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Proximate Cause  </STRONG></H4></A>
Finally, proximate causation can be difficult for a patient to prove because a bad result does not necessarily equal malpractice. Even with excellent treatment, a patient might not recover totally from the condition for which he or she seeks treatment. A doctor accused of malpractice might be able to show that even had a different treatment been followed, the patient would have suffered identical injuries.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Third-Party Lawsuits  </STRONG></H3></A>
Third persons can sometimes bring medical malpractice lawsuits against doctors. For example, a person who gets an infectious disease from a friend might sue the friend's doctor for inadequately treating the disease. A person injured in an automobile accident might bring a medical malpractice lawsuit against the driver's doctor if the doctor medicated the patient without telling the patient not to operate a vehicle while under the effect of the medication.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Consent Forms  </STRONG></H3></A>
Consent forms required by most doctors and hospitals typically include warnings that patients must assume all the risks of any surgical procedures. By signing one of these forms, a patient does not give up all rights to sue if things go wrong. Such an agreement may not be valid if a doctor does not fully inform the patient of risks associated with a particular procedure. Even a valid consent form is no protection for a doctor who either performs surgery that goes beyond the consent given or who fails to perform a procedure according to well-accepted medical standards.

Though accidents can occur virtually anywhere and under any circumstances, some of the more serious and costly accidents occur while people are involved in transportation-related activities. This chapter provides a brief overview of the laws and issues regarding automobile, maritime, railroad, and aviation accidents. It should be stressed that tort litigation involving transportation-related activities can be extremely complicated. Retaining an inexperienced lawyer may result in a plaintiff losing a lawsuit or not receiving the recovery that he or she deserves. It is important that plaintiffs choose attorneys with appropriate levels of experience and familiarity with the subject matter of the lawsuit.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Automobile Accidents </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Like any state, Illinois has its share of serious automobile accidents. Illinois requires its residents to carry minimum vehicle liability insurance for their vehicles. The purpose of the requirement is to ensure coverage for motorists involved in accidents with uninsured drivers. Each person in an accident files a claim with his or her own insurance company asking for reimbursement for any medical bills resulting from the accident and for any economic losses such as lost wages. The minimum insurance requirements are $40,000 for injury or death of more than one person in an accident, $20,000 for injury or death of one person in an accident, and $15,000 for damage to the property of another person. Illinois' mandatory insurance provides insurance to cover motorists who have an accident with an uninsured or underinsured motorist. The Illinois Safety Responsibility Law requires at-fault uninsured motorists to pay for the damages they cause or face license plate and driver's license suspensions. Inquiries about the Safety Responsibility Law may be made to the Illinois Department of Transportation. 
<P>
A lawsuit for a motor vehicle accident in Illinois requires proving fault. If a jury awards damages as a result of such a lawsuit, the law requires that the damage award to the injured motorist be reduced by any amount of money already received under the insurance benefit system.

Recreational boaters, cruise ship passengers, sailors on commercial ships, longshore and harbor workers, and off-shore oil employees may at some point in time become injured and require the services of an attorney. When choosing an attorney regarding a maritime matter, it is very important to choose someone experienced in maritime law. The law governing maritime issues is a complicated jumble of federal statutes, United States Supreme Court decisions, and centuries-old common law. A general practitioner unfamiliar with the dips and turns of maritime law may have difficulty properly representing a client.

<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Railroad Accidents </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The October 1995 deaths of seven high school students in Fox River, Illinois, whose school bus was hit by a commuter train at a railroad crossing, is a reminder that railroad accidents remain an all-too-frequent occurrence. By law, railroad carriers have a duty to maintain the reasonable safety of their tracks, particularly around railroad crossings. Railroad carriers can be held liable if an accident occurs where there are defective or an insufficient number of warning lights and signs. Additionally, railroad engineers and crews have a duty to keep a lookout for potential problems and to sound the train's horn when approaching potentially dangerous areas. Persons crossing or near railroad tracks also have a duty to act reasonably. Remember that Illinois recognizes the doctrine of comparative negligence. If a person is partially responsible for an accident, any damage award he or she receives can be reduced by the extent to which he or she was responsible. 
<P>
Railroad employees who are hurt on the job are entitled to recover damages from their employer under the Federal Employer's Liability Act (FELA). FELA is like a workers' compensation program for railroad employees. FELA enables railroad employees to recover for any injury "resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of [the railroad], or by reason of any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, tracks, roadbeds, works, boats, wharves or other equipment."  Recovery under FELA is the exclusive remedy for railroad employees injured on the job.

<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>Aviation Accidents </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
While commercial aircraft remain the safest means of long distance travel, accidents do happen, and the litigation that follows an airline crash is notoriously complicated. Plaintiff lawyers in airline cases face a variety of difficult issues. For example: What law (federal or state) should be used? Where is the best forum for the trial? Should lawsuits be brought individually or as a class action? Who should be sued as a defendant aircraft manufacturer; aircraft operator or owner; airport operator, manufacturer or corporate officers; component-parts manufacturers)? What is the best theory of recovery (strict liability, negligence, breach of warranty, statutory)? What is the best method of proving damages? How should evidence of the crash be preserved? It is obvious, therefore, that when choosing an attorney to represent your interests after an airline accident, it is best to choose someone with experience in airline tort litigation.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Estate Planning, Wills &amp; Trusts
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Although no one likes to think about dying, there are good reasons to prepare for this inevitable event by setting up a plan to distribute one's estate after death. A person's estate consists of all his or her property and possessions, and includes bank accounts, real estate, furniture, automobiles, stocks, bonds, life insurance policies, retirement funds, pensions, and death benefits. If a person plans well, his or her estate can often be passed on after death quickly, easily, and subject to fewer taxes. 
<P>
This chapter discusses the most common estate planning tools -- wills and trusts. Living wills, guardianship, and conservatorship are discussed in the <A HREF="c14.html">Elder Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Wills </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A will is the most common document used to specify how an estate should be handled after death. Anyone designated to receive property under a will (or trust) is called a beneficiary. A will can be simple or elaborate, depending upon the size of the estate and the wishes of the person who makes it, called the testator. Many types of post-death instructions can be described in a will. A will can describe who should receive specific items of furniture, art work, or jewelry. A will can name a guardian who will take care of minor children should there be no surviving parent. A will can disinherit a child if the testator does not want the child to receive any part of the estate. The options for what a person can do with a will are varied but limited. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Requirements for a Valid Will </STRONG></H3></A>
Each state sets slightly different formal requirements for the creation of a legal will. In Illinois, a person must be at least 18 years old and must be of sound mind and memory in order to make a legal will. Sound mind and memory means that the person has no disability that prevents the person from understanding the full nature of the will document. In Illinois, a will must be in writing and must be signed by the testator. The will must also be witnessed, in the special manner provided by law, by at least two other people. A handwritten will, often called a holographic will, is valid in Illinois provided that it is witnessed and signed by two people. Individuals must sign their own wills, but if they are illiterate or otherwise incapacitated, they can direct another person, in the presence of witnesses, to sign for them. A will is valid until it is revoked or superseded by a new will. An individual provision can be changed by a codicil, which is described in the section, Changing and Updating Wills. 
<P>
It is not necessary to hire an attorney to create a will. A non-attorney can create a will, but he or she must pay close attention to the details outlined above. Smaller estates can be described simply, and making a will to disperse a smaller estate can be done by almost anyone. The simplest will in history ever to be declared valid by a court contained only three words: "All to wife." However, a lawyer's guidance is very helpful if the testator has complicated property holdings or an estate with many assets, especially if they are located in several different places. In these cases, an attorney's help can ensure that the transfer of property described in the will is done in a way that minimizes the survivor's tax liability. Also, a complicated estate may require documents in addition to the will, such as trust agreements, to ensure that all of the person's wishes are carried out. 
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Personal Representative </STRONG></H3></A>
A will typically appoints someone called a personal representative to carry out the specific wishes of the person who has died -- the decedent. The personal representative should be a trusted friend or family member who should be made fully aware of his or her duties before the decedent dies. Under state law, a personal representative appointed by a testator must be a resident of the United States, but need not be a resident of Illinois. A personal representative must do many things, including collecting and managing the decedent's assets; collecting any money owed at the time of death; selling assets, if necessary, to pay estate taxes or expenses; and filing all required tax returns. Because a personal representative is allowed to charge a fee for doing this work, choosing a friend or family member who is also a beneficiary to fill this role may be a good choice, as he or she may not charge the full amount allowed by law. It is wise for a testator to name one or more contingent personal representatives who can take over the responsibilities of the primary personal representative if the primary personal representative is unable to assume the responsibilities of the position. 
<P>
If a person does not name a personal representative in his or her will, state law establishes the order in which a probate court appoints relatives to act as personal representative. If none of these family members agree to be the personal representative, the circuit court may appoint a professional administrator to do the job.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Appointing a Guardian for Children </STRONG></H3></A>
A person with minor or dependent children can name in a will a guardian to care for those children should there be no surviving parent. If a person fails to name someone to assume the role of guardian, the probate court appoints someone. The person chosen by the court will usually be a close relative or friend, but it may not be the person the parent would have chosen. As with the selection of a personal representative, it is important that the potential guardian understand the provisions of the will and is willing to accept the responsibilities of being a guardian. Also, the testator should name an alternate guardian in case the primary guardian is unable to accept the responsibility. Of course, the selection of a guardian for children is likely to influence how the parent wants to distribute his or her property. Otherwise, a decedent's money might go to one person while his or her children go to another person. The parent may want to give property to someone only if the recipient accepts guardianship of a child. In this way, the guardian is given the financial resources to care for the child.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Planning for Incapacity </STRONG></H3></A>
People drafting wills often use the opportunity to plan for the possibility of their own incapacity. By preparing a document called a power of attorney, they can give another person of their choosing full legal authority to act on their behalf should they become unable to handle their personal and financial affairs. Without a power of attorney, a person's family might need to go to court to have someone appointed to handle the person's legal affairs. If a power of attorney is made part of the will, it is essential that the will be made known to family members before the testator becomes incapacitated. If a will is kept secret, locked away in a safe deposit box until a person dies, it will be too late for the power of attorney provisions to be useful. 
<P>
Some people also use a document called a power of attorney for health care to make health care decisions in advance in case they subsequently become incapacitated. Creating a power of attorney for health care is discussed in the <A HREF="c14.html">Elder Law</A> Chapter. 
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Restrictions on Wills </STRONG></H3></A>
In order to protect spouses and dependent children, Illinois law prevents a person from entirely disinheriting a spouse or child without the consent of the one who is disinherited. Under Illinois law, a spouse is entitled to at least $10,000, plus $5,000 for each dependant child. This amount is intended to support the decedent's family for the first nine months following the death of the decedent. A spouse receives this amount of money whether or not there is a will. This spousal award is considered a preferred claim and a debt of the estate. 
<P>
The provisions of this law may be overcome in two ways. First, a will may specifically state that its provisions are meant to stand in the place of the spousal award, <STRONG>and</STRONG> the spouse does not renounce the will. In this case, the terms of the will would govern distribution. Second, the spouse may renounce the will, and take an elective share of the estate. In this case, distribution of the estate would be governed by statute. Note, however, that renunciation would not be available to a spouse who had signed an agreement during the life of the decedent in which the spouse agreed to abide by the terms of the will. Occasionally this happens through a prenuptial agreement, for example, in which a second spouse agrees that an entire estate will go to children from a first marriage. A person may legally disinherit an <STRONG>independent</STRONG> child by clearly specifying in a will that the child not receive any of the estate. 
<P>
There are other restrictions on wills. Anything owned in joint tenancy with another person will go to the surviving joint tenant. Arrangements must be made to end the joint tenancy before death if one joint tenant does not want the other to inherit the jointly held property. Because there may be significant tax consequences in doing so, these changes should be made only after consulting an attorney. Other possessions not considered part of an estate are those already promised to someone else. For example, a testator cannot specify in a will that someone other than the beneficiary of a life insurance policy gets the benefits described in that policy. However, a person can designate his or her estate as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. In this case, the money from the policy will be added to other estate assets and will be distributed according to the will. Similarly, the money from a retirement plan goes to the persons named on the plan, regardless of whether they are beneficiaries in a will. Laws designed to uphold public policy also limit what can be done with a person's assets after death. For example, conditions in a will encouraging someone to do something illegal or immoral in order to inherit money or property would not be enforced.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Changing and Updating Wills </STRONG></H3></A>
The provisions of a will are valid until they are changed, revoked, destroyed, or invalidated by the writing of a new will. Changes or additions to a will can be included in a document called a codicil. Codicils must be written, signed, and witnessed in the same way as a will. Wills cannot be changed simply by crossing out existing language or writing in new provisions. In order to avoid making a new will or codicil each time a person's possessions change, a will can specify that personal property is to be distributed according to instructions outlined in a separate document. A person can then revise the separate document as often as necessary, without observing all of the formalities required to change the will itself. 
<P>
If someone dies with a will that is not up-to-date, people may not be provided for adequately. For example, a person chosen to be a personal representative or guardian may have died or fallen out of favor with the author of the will, or a favorite charity may no longer be in existence. A significant amount of case law has dealt with how a probate court is to proceed with a will that has become unenforceable because of changed circumstances. These headaches can be avoided if a will is reviewed at least every two years and revised for major changes in tax laws or for personal events such as births, deaths, marriages, divorces, or significant changes in the size of the estate. It is also a good idea to review a will if its author moves to another state, because the new state of residency may have different inheritance and tax laws. 
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>The Right of Election </STRONG></H3></A>
As discussed previously, Illinois' probate code protects surviving spouses from being entirely disinherited by a decedent spouse. A surviving spouse who is unsatisfied with his or her portion under a valid will is allowed to exercise the right of election and take a statutory share of the estate. If the decedent left no descendants, the spouse's statutory share is half of the decedent's estate. If the decedent left descendants, the spouse's statutory share is one-third of the decedent's estate. Thus, the one-third portion is the minimum amount a surviving spouse may receive. A will can give more to the surviving spouse, but if it gives less, the surviving spouse can simply elect to forego his or her share under the will in favor of this statutorily guaranteed one-half or one-third share. Note however that the statutory share is not available to a spouse who has entered a contract during the life of the descendent to accept the provisions of the will.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Dying Without a Will </STRONG></H3></A>
If a person does not have a will or has not adequately planned for the distribution of the person's estate at death, survivors can face a complicated, time-consuming, and costly process. Often survivors wind up having to pay more taxes on their inheritance than they would have paid had there been a will or other estate planning tool. To provide for surviving friends and relatives, or to support favorite causes or charities, a person can plan for the distribution of his or her estate after death. With planning, an estate can be distributed as fairly as possible with as little tax burden as legally allowed. 
<P>
When a decedent leaves no will or fails to dispose of all property through a will, the decedent is said to have died intestate. When a person dies intestate, the circuit court steps in to divide the decedent's estate among the decedent's surviving relatives decedents, according to a formula set out in the state inheritance laws. 
<P>
A circuit court applying the state inheritance laws first deducts from the estate the funeral expenses and administration costs, the surviving spouse and child's award, any money owed to the federal government, any money due to employees of the decedent, any unpaid medical bills or other expenses of the decedent's last illness, any money owing to state or local government, and any other debt owed (in that order of preference). 
<P>
After all the claims against the estate are paid, and if the decedent has a surviving spouse and no children, the entire estate goes to the spouse. If there are children and no surviving spouse, the entire estate is divided equally among the children. If there is both a surviving spouse and children, half of the estate goes to the spouse, and the remaining half is divided equally among the children. If the decedent leaves neither a spouse nor children, the estate goes to the decedent's parents, brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews. If the decedent leaves none of these relatives, the estate goes to the decedents grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. If none of these relatives exist, investigation continues down the line of inheritance in an attempt to locate the decedent's nearest kin. Illinois law does not distinguish between kin of whole or half-blood. If, however, the decedent leaves no kin, the estate goes to the county where the decedent lived or in which the estate property is located. 
<P>
One problem with relying on a circuit court applying state inheritance laws to distribute one's estate is that it may not distribute the estate in the manner the decedent would have wanted. State inheritance laws only recognize relatives. The inheritance laws never permit the circuit court to support a decedent's close friend, lover, or favorite charities. Clearly, for most people, writing a will (or creating a trust) is advisable.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Trusts </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A trust is another frequently used estate planning device that manages the distribution of a person's estate.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Mechanics of a Trust </STRONG></H3></A>
To create a trust, the owner of property (grantor) transfers the property to a person or institution (trustee) who holds legal title to the property and manages it for the benefit of a third party (beneficiary). The grantor can name himself or herself or another person as the trustee. A trust can be either a testamentary trust or a living trust. A testamentary trust transfers the property to the trust only after the death of the grantor. A living trust, sometimes called an <STRONG>inter vivos</STRONG> trust, is created during the life of the grantor and can be set up to continue after the grantor's death or to terminate and be distributed upon the grantor's death. 
<P>
Unlike a will, which in some cases can be drafted without the help of an attorney, a person should never draft a trust without the aid of a lawyer. Many complex laws regulate trusts and trusts must be carefully structured if they are to take advantage of beneficial tax treatment. An experienced attorney should always assist a person in drafting a trust so that it is valid, meets the needs of the estate, and does not conflict with any previously drafted will.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Advantages and Disadvantages of Trusts </STRONG></H3></A>
Trusts have many advantages over wills. All trusts have the advantage of allowing the grantor to determine who receives the benefit of the money, when they receive it, and what conditions must be met. If a spouse is unable or unwilling to manage assets, if children are minors or unable to handle money responsibly, or if a beneficiary is disabled, creating a trust can be a better way of passing on assets. Both living and testamentary trusts are popular ways of providing for beneficiaries' future educational or medical costs. 
<P>
Some advantages are particular to living trusts. First, a living trust can give its grantor substantial tax advantages. Second, possessions held in a living trust are not subject to estate administration by the circuit court after the grantor dies. Survivors do not have to reveal the details of any possessions held in trust through the public filing process that takes place during probate. In addition, if the grantor owns real estate in another state, establishing a living trust for the title to that property may allow survivors to avoid probate in the other state. A living trust can free the grantor from the burden of overseeing his or her financial affairs because a trustee manages all the assets of a living trust. More importantly, a living trust allows a trustee to manage the trust funds in the event that its creator becomes incapacitated or mentally or physically unable to oversee his or her possessions. If a living trust contains all of a person's assets, then he or she may not need a will, and his or her survivors may be able to avoid probate. If only part of a person's possessions are held in living trust, then a will is necessary to distribute those items in the estate not placed into a trust. However, a pour-over provision in a will can place any possessions remaining upon death into a pre-existing living trust. 
<P>
The primary disadvantage of a living trust is that it involves the loss of some flexibility and control over one's assets. Unlike wills, which become effective only at death, a living trust becomes effective immediately upon its creation. For the person who wants to retain unrestricted control over his or her estate, a will or a testamentary trust is a better estate planning tool because it can be changed at any time prior to death. 
<P>
The primary advantage of a testamentary trust is that it allows the grantor to retain unrestricted control over his or her estate. A testamentary trust becomes effective only upon the death of its grantor. Like a will, a testamentary trust can be changed at any time prior to death. 
<P>
The primary disadvantage to testamentary trusts is that they do not take advantage of the beneficial tax treatment given to living trusts. Because a testamentary trust only takes effect when the grantor dies, the grantor cannot enjoy any tax advantage during his or her life. Also, most testamentary trusts must go through probate.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Revocable and Irrevocable Trusts </STRONG></H3></A>
A living trust can be either revocable or irrevocable. As implied by their names, a revocable trust can be changed or revoked after its creation, while an irrevocable trust cannot be changed or revoked. A revocable trust is quite often devised to supplement a will and/or to name someone to handle the grantor's affairs should the grantor become incapacitated. A trust usually must be made irrevocable if the grantor wants to avoid income or estate taxes. Tax authorities consider the grantor of a revocable trust to be the owner of the property because he or she still controls the property. For this reason, income from assets held in a revocable trust must be reported as income to the grantor for income tax purposes. At the death of the grantor, property in a revocable trust is included in the estate for calculating estate taxes. 
<P>
An irrevocable trust is often designed to be the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. Such a life insurance trust can also spell out how the policy's money is distributed to survivors. In addition, irrevocable trusts are often set up to manage money given to minors and to charities. Finally, an irrevocable trust can be used to transfer assets to another person in the event that the grantor requires expensive medical care. Although doing so may protect the grantor's family by ensuring that the cost of medical care does not wipe out the family fortune, it may also make the grantor ineligible to receive federal and state Medical Assistance. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Probate </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
With few exceptions, the estate of a person who dies owning property in his or her name cannot be legally distributed without first going through probate. Only if all of a decedent's property is held in joint tenancy or in trust can survivors avoid probate. Probate can operate with court supervision, called supervised administration, or without court supervision, called independent administration. Some simple, small estates may be administered through summary administration. 
<P>
Regardless of the type of administration, the first duty of the circuit court is to determine whether the decedent left a valid will. The person in possession of a decedent's will must file it with the clerk of the circuit court within 30 days of the decedent's death. If the decedent left a valid will, the court oversees the process of settling the estate according to the terms of the will. If the decedent did not leave a will or if the circuit court determines the will is invalid, the court applies the state inheritance laws, described earlier, to the estate. 
<P>
Summary administration is available if the estate is $50,000 or less, all claims against the estate are known, there are no taxes due, and all the heirs and legatees consent to the process. In a summary administration, the circuit court determines the rights of the claimants, directs payments and distributes the estate at a single hearing. 
<P>
Independent administration permits the personal representative to administer the estate without court orders or filings. Unless disputes arise between the beneficiaries or with third parties, or unless requested to intervene by the personal representative or an interested party, the court is involved only to open and close the estate. Independent administration increases family privacy, because no inventory or accounting is usually filed. The process also reduces the time involved in probate. If an interested person objects to independent administration, the court must supervise the administration. 
<P>
Supervised administration requires the personal representative to file specific documents with the court, such as an estate inventory and periodic accountings. The personal representative must also obtain court approval to perform such duties as selling or leasing estate property. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>Avoiding Death Taxes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A carefully created estate plan can considerably reduce the tax burden on an estate. Illinois has no estate tax provisions. Other than income taxes, only the federal estate tax applies to decedents who were Illinois residents or whose property was located in Illinois. Under federal tax law, a person is allowed to leave $600,000 tax-free to one or more individuals, other than a surviving spouse. The surviving spouse is entitled to receive an unlimited amount tax-free. If the estate is a very large one, however, and the entire estate is left to the surviving spouse, that surviving spouse may lose the option of giving $600,000 tax-free to individuals of his or her own choosing. The federal government's inheritance tax scheme is quite complicated, however an experienced tax attorney can help an individual avoid paying unnecessary estate taxes. 
<P>
Regardless of whether the recipient pays state or federal estate taxes, there may be income tax consequences for the recipients under a will.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Real Estate Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Real estate law involves rights in the ownership and possession of land and buildings attached to land. Real estate law often is referred to as the law of real property to distinguish it from the law of personal property, which includes all other property. A stumbling block for many consumers entering the real estate market is the number of unfamiliar terms frequently used by real estate professionals. Because real estate is one of the oldest areas of the law, it uses many old terms and concepts, but many rights and responsibilities regarding real estate have evolved and been updated as society has changed. 
<P>
This chapter summarizes some of the real estate concepts and terms one involved in real estate is likely to encounter, the process one goes through to buy or sell a house, and the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Encumbrance </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An encumbrance is a legal interest in property held by someone other than the owner of the property. An encumbrance is not an ownership interest in real property, but it creates some kind of obligation for the owner. An encumbrance attaches to the property, not the property owner, so the property may be bought and sold even though there is an encumbrance attached.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Easement </STRONG></H3></A>
An easement is the right to use another person's land for a particular purpose. There are many forms of easements. Public utility companies frequently have utility easements that permit them to run gas, water, or electrical lines through the property of others. The owner of property near a lake might buy from the owner of lake shore property an easement to cross his or her property to access the lake. A person who owns property that is land-locked may receive an easement from an adjacent land owner to have access in and out of the property. This is called a right of way.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Deed Restriction </STRONG></H3></A>
Deed restrictions may also be known as covenants, conditions, or restrictions. Deed restrictions, which usually are included in the seller's deed to the buyer, generally are imposed to maintain certain standards. Restrictions may limit the color one may paint a house, the kind of trees one may plant, or the size of home one may build on the property.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Lien </STRONG></H3></A>
A lien is a charge against property that provides security for a debt or obligation of the property owner. The lien holder does not own the property. Some liens are voluntary, such as when the owner of property takes out a mortgage. Other liens may be imposed. For example, a lien may be imposed on property for nonpayment of taxes. One of the most common liens is the mechanics lien. A mechanics lien arises when someone furnishes labor or materials to improve a piece of property. A worker or supplier who is not paid may file a notice of lien with the county recorder and the property owner and collect the amount owed from a subsequent sale of the property.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Assessment </STRONG></H3></A>
An assessment is a value placed on real property by a local taxing authority for the purpose of levying taxes. Real estate taxes are calculated by multiplying the assessed value of a piece of property by the tax rate. Most properties are reassessed periodically, and a property's assessed value may not be the same as its actual market value. A special assessment is a tax levied on a piece of property to pay for improvements that benefit the particular property, such as streets, sidewalks, and street lighting. Special assessments are liens on the property until they are paid.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Real Estate Ownership </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Typically, ownership of real estate includes the following rights:
<UL>
<LI>To sell
<LI>To use the property as security for loans (encumber)
<LI>To improve the land or buildings on the land
<LI>To use and possess the property
</UL>
Property can be owned by one or more persons. The two common ways in which parties co-own a piece of property are joint tenancy and tenancy in common.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Joint Tenancy </STRONG></H3></A>
Although joint tenancy is a popular way for a husband and wife to own property, there is no requirement that joint tenants be married or that there only be two joint tenants. Owners in joint tenancy have a right to sell, encumber, and possess the entire property. When one joint tenant dies, the remaining joint tenants automatically take the deceased joint tenant's share of the property by right of survivorship. The surviving joint tenants are required to file a death certificate and an affidavit with the county recorder. Joint tenancy allows the surviving joint tenants to avoid probate, transfer and death taxes.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Tenants in Common </STRONG></H3></A>
Tenants in common, like joint tenants, share the right to possess, sell, and encumber the property. Unlike joint tenants, however, tenants in common do not have a right of survivorship. Upon the death of one tenant in common, his or her ownership interest passes to his or her heirs as part of the estate.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Advantages and Disadvantages of Co-Ownership </STRONG></H3></A>
Although there are advantages to co-owning property, there are drawbacks as well. If co-owners cannot agree on use, sale, or possession of a piece of property, they may have to go to court to resolve the matter in a partition action. In a partition action a joint tenant or tenant in common asks the court to split the property in a fair and just manner. Real property may be difficult to divide and partial interests may be difficult to sell, so a court will usually order that the property be sold and proceeds from the sale distributed to the co-owners in relation to their interests.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Residential Real Estate </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The most common consumer real estate transaction involves the sale of a home. Unlike years past, today a home buyer has a variety of options in deciding the type of dwelling to buy. Single family houses are still the most common selections for home buyers. Single family homes provide the maximum amount of privacy and freedom to their owners, but they may also be the most expensive option and require the most upkeep. 
<P>
Condominiums and townhouses may be an option for some purchasers. Both give their owners many of the advantages of home ownership, such as tax deductibility of mortgage interest, without some of the responsibilities some people consider to be disadvantages, such as lawn care and exterior upkeep. Residents usually pay association fees to cover maintenance. 
<P>
A homestead is not a particular type of dwelling; instead, it is a tax classification that can dramatically lower what a homeowner pays in real estate taxes. People who live in the property they own are taxed at a much lower rate than if they rent out that property to others. If a person buys property that currently is rental property, he or she must fill out an application to change the property's tax status; otherwise, the person could end up paying non-homestead taxes for the first year of ownership.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Title </STRONG></H3></A>
Title to real estate is the ownership of the property. Title may refer to the actual ownership or to the documentary evidence of that ownership. Title is what gives the owner the right to the property. In order to sell a piece of property, all title matters must be cleared. Usually, this is accomplished through a title search. A title search is a diligent search of all records relating to the property to determine whether the owner is authorized to sell the property and whether there are any claims against it. If any defects in title are discovered during the title search, the seller usually has time to cure the defect. 
<P>
Often people have title insurance to protect them against any hidden defects in the title. There are two types of title insurance. One type protects the lender's interest in the property and the other protects the home owner's interest.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Deeds </STRONG></H3></A>
A deed is a written instrument that transfers the title of property from one person to another. There are many different types of deeds. Generally, in Illinois, title is transferred by a general warranty deed. A general warranty deed provides the greatest protection to the purchaser because the seller pledges or warrants that he or she legally owns the property and that there are no outstanding liens, mortgages, or other encumbrances against it. A warranty deed is also a guarantee of title, which means that the seller may be held liable for damages if the buyer discovers that the title is defective. A warranty deed is no substitute for title insurance, however, because a warranty from a seller who later dies or goes bankrupt may have little value. 
<P>
Another type of deed used is a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed relinquishes whatever interest, if any, the seller may have in the property to the buyer. A quitclaim deed gives the buyer the least protection of any deed. If the seller is the sole owner of the property, the quitclaim deed is enough to transfer title, but the buyer takes a risk by accepting a quitclaim deed because it offers the buyer no guarantee that the title is valid. Quitclaim deeds customarily are used during the property settlement phase of a marriage dissolution.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Recording </STRONG></H3></A>
In Illinois, real estate owners and parties with real estate interests are required to file with the county all documents affecting their interest in property in order to give public notice of the interest. Since 1992, Illinois titles are transferred under the abstract system. Abstract records go back hundreds of years and an abstract of title is a record of all the entries for that property.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Buying or Selling a Home </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Because Illinois has many programs to help people buy a home, home ownership is a possibility for people at all income levels. Buying a home may be both rewarding and stressful. Every home purchase involves a number of complex legal issues, unfamiliar terminology, and lots of paperwork. Knowing how the process works may reduce much of the headache.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Real Estate Agents </STRONG></H3></A>
One of the first decisions for someone interested in buying or selling a home is whether to use the services of a real estate agent. Real estate agents are hired to help buyers and sellers meet to complete the sale of a house. Home buyers and sellers may choose to work with an agent exclusively or non-exclusively. 
<P>
A person who decides to work with an agent will sign several contracts to clarify the relationship between the consumer and the agent. These contracts may include provisions regarding dual agency. This term refers to the arrangement in which an agent represents both the buyer and the seller of the house. It may be difficult for one agent to represent both a buyer and a seller fairly. When the agent finds a buyer for a house that the agency has listed, the agent's dual loyalties become apparent. The seller wants the highest price possible while the buyer wants to pay the lowest price. The contracts state what the agent may share with the other party and which information must remain confidential.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Seller Disclosures </STRONG></H3></A>
In Illinois, the Residential Real Property Disclosure Act requires that when a seller signs the standard purchase agreement, he or she must attach a disclosure document. This document must disclose to the buyer any material defects, which are known hazards or problems with the structure or the heating, plumbing, mechanical, or electrical system. Just because problems are listed on this statement does not mean that the seller must repair the problems, but the buyer may request either repair or a price break because of the problem. In some communities, the seller also is required to complete an inspection report. In that case, an inspector checks the house for defects and these defects are listed in the report.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Home Warranties </STRONG></H3></A>
Whenever a builder sells a home in Illinois, the home comes with an implied warranty of habitability. This means that the builder guarantees that there are no major problems with the home, even problems that may not be apparent right away. The buyer has a reasonable amount of time to discover any major problems covered under the warranty. For example, if it rains every day for a month and the roof does not leak, everyone may assume the roof is sound. If the roof begins leaking during a rainy period a year later, it is probably too late to claim the house was sold with a defective roof. The buyer had a reasonable amount of time to discover the defect. The leaky roof would not be covered under the implied warranty of habitability. 
<P>
Illinois law also provides that any residential unit sold by installment contract is voidable unless there is attached to the contract information about dwelling code compliance. The seller may attach either a certificate of compliance, or may include an express written warranty that the home has not been the subject of any dwelling code violations in the past ten years. If there have been violations, the seller must attach a copy of every notice of violation. 
<P>
Home buyers should be aware of state laws dealing with removal of lead-based paint from a home. The Lead Poisoning Prevention Act requires owners to remove, replace, or secure and permanently cover walls covered in lead-based paint. Owners must take care of lead problems after receiving notice from the Department of Public Health. Failure to comply with the Act may subject the owner to criminal misdemeanor charges.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Foreclosure </STRONG></H3></A>
Nobody in the process of buying a house wants to think about the possibility of falling behind in house payments to the extent that the bank or mortgage company will foreclose on the loan and claim possession of the house. Nevertheless, it is wise for a consumer to understand why a lender forecloses on a piece of property, so the consumer can minimize the possibility of losing a house
<P>
Up to a point, a lender will typically work with a homeowner who falls behind in making payments because the lender does not want to go through the hassle and expense of foreclosing on a property. Homeowners should communicate with their lenders if there are financial difficulties present that make paying the mortgage difficult. It can take months for a lender to begin a foreclosure, and more months before it is completed, so usually there is time to get the money needed to assure a lender that there will not be a default. After a lender begins the foreclosure process, there is a period of time called a redemption period during which a homeowner can stop the foreclosure by making all delinquent mortgage payments plus the lender's court costs and attorney fees. 
<P>
In Illinois, a lender may accept the deed to the property instead of foreclosing. The property owner loses the property, but if he or she truly has no other way to avoid foreclosure, offering the deed as a way to satisfy the debt can prevent his or her credit rating from being severely damaged by a foreclosure. However, because lenders generally want cash and not real estate, there is no guarantee that a lender will accept a deed offered in lieu of foreclosure. 
<P>
A notice of foreclosure must state the name of the person whose property is subject to foreclosure, the court, the case number, the name of the person who holds the title to the property, a legal description of the property, and the mortgage identification information. It must be signed by the foreclosing party or the party's attorney.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Landlord -- Tenant </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Under Illinois law, whenever the owner (landlord) of a house, apartment, room, or any other living space agrees to let someone else (tenant) use the space for a fee, the two parties enter into a legally binding rental contract. General contract principles are discussed in the <A HREF="c06.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter. Rental contracts are a special class of contracts that are governed by many unique rules. This section discusses the laws applicable to rental contracts.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Leases </STRONG></H3></A>
The terms of any rental agreement are stated in the lease. A lease can be an oral agreement or a written document. There are two general types of leases: the periodic lease and the lease for a definite term. A periodic lease continues for a specific time period and is automatically renewed at the end of the period for an indefinite time without a specific end date. For example, parties may agree on a month-to-month lease without specifying how many months the renter will stay. The lease continues until one party terminates it. Most periodic leases will state the rules for notice: how much time each party has to give notice of termination, and the form the notice must take. If the periodic lease does not specify when or how notice is to be given, the parties must follow state law. Illinois law requires that a party to a year-to-year lease give 60 days' notice, a party to a week-to-week lease give one week notice, and a party to any other periodic lease give 30 days' notice. All notices must be written. 
<P>
A term lease is a rental agreement specifying a definite time period. For example, a lease for one year is a term lease. Term leases are almost always written. If the parties to the lease do not state when and what kind of notice is required, the lease automatically ends on the last day of the time period.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Security Deposits </STRONG></H3></A>
A landlord has the right to insist that a renter pays a security deposit before moving in. The security deposit -- also called a penalty deposit -- is used to pay for any damage beyond ordinary wear and tear that the tenant might do to the rental property, or to satisfy any debts between the tenant and landlord. The deposit cannot be used by the renter to pay rent. There is no limit to how much the landlord may require for a security deposit. The landlord may increase the security deposit at any time during a periodic lease if the tenant is given proper notice, which generally is one rental period plus one day. If the lease is a term lease, no changes may be made to the deposit until the lease comes up for renewal or the parties agree otherwise. 
<P>
At the end of the tenancy, the landlord must return the deposit to the renter. If the landlord rents to 25 or more tenants, the landlord must pay five percent interest on the security deposit. The landlord is allowed to keep some or all of the deposit if there have been damages or if the tenant does not give timely written notice of termination. If the tenant has paid a penalty deposit, the landlord may keep only the amount necessary to repair damages. The landlord may keep the entire amount of a security deposit, even if the actual damages are not that high. Within 30 days of the termination of the lease, if the landlord plans to keep the deposit, he or she must provide the former tenant with an itemized statement of the damages the tenant caused. In any case, the landlord has 45 days to return the deposit to the tenant.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Repairs </STRONG></H3></A>
Owners of rental property are required to keep the property in reasonable repair. This requirement cannot be waived by the parties, but the tenant may agree to make repairs or perform maintenance if the arrangement is in writing and the tenant receives compensation in return. For example, a renter might agree to make routine plumbing repairs in return for a reduction in rent or payment from the owner. If the parties have not agreed the tenant will do repairs, repairs remain the responsibility of the landlord. If something needs repair, the tenant by law must notify the landlord and give the landlord a reasonable opportunity to make the repairs or have them made. If the owner refuses to make repairs, the renter has several options.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="240"><H4><STRONG>Call an Inspector </STRONG></H4></A>
The renter may call local fire, health, housing, or energy inspectors to investigate whether there is a code violation in the unit. If the tenant believes there is a lead-based paint problem, he or she should call the Department of Public Health. If an inspector finds a code violation, the inspector has authority to summon the owner to appear in court. Often, an inspector's report of a code violation is enough to convince a landlord to correct problems. Calling an inspector is a necessary first step to several of the other options described in the following sections. The law provides protection for a renter if the owner attempts to evict the renter in retaliation for calling an inspector. Under the Lead Poisoning Prevention Act, a landlord is prevented from retaliating against a renter with an elevated blood lead level.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="250"><H4><STRONG>Withhold Rent </STRONG></H4></A>
If there is a serious problem in a unit, the renter may withhold rent. Under extreme circumstances, the tenant may withhold rent and claim constructive eviction. This means that the rental unit has become uninhabitable because of the problem; in effect, the landlord has evicted the tenant by failing to make the unit livable. Before withholding rent, the renter should notify the owner, in writing, of the needed repairs and give the owner an opportunity to make repairs. If the landlord does not make repairs, the tenant should notify local inspectors, as described above, and get a written copy of the inspector's report. If repairs still are not made, the tenant should notify the landlord, in writing, that all or part of the rent will be withheld until repairs are made. 
<P>
If the tenant is claiming constructive eviction, he or she must prepare to leave the rental property within a reasonable time after withholding rent. The tenant cannot stay in the apartment or house without paying rent and claim it is not livable. Illinois recognizes the failure to remedy certain problems as a breach of the warranty of habitability. The tenant would have the right to claim constructive eviction under any of the following circumstances:
<UL>
<LI>No heat
<LI>No water or no hot water
<LI>Electricity, gas, or any other utility shut off
<LI>Flooding
<LI>Leaking or damaged pipes or other plumbing fixtures
<LI>Landlord changed or plugged locks
<LI>Pests
<LI>Lead-based paint hazard
<LI>Fire damage
</UL>
Withholding rent is a drastic step that should only be taken if the tenant has a strong case against the landlord.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="260"><H4><STRONG>Criminal or Civil Action </STRONG></H4></A>
Under Illinois law, a landlord may be charged with criminal housing management for extreme failure to comply with the implied warranty of habitability. Criminal housing management is recklessly or intentionally permitting the physical condition of residential real property to be or remain in a condition that endangers a person's health or safety. A person who feels his or her landlord should be charged with criminal housing management may contact the attorney general's office and request the landlord be prosecuted for this crime. 
<P>
A tenant who has suffered damages by a landlord's gross failure to remedy problems may bring a lawsuit or civil action against the landlord for damages. Usually, damages are limited to the actual amount of money the renter has lost by the landlord's negligence or breach of contract, such as the cost of replacing personal property damaged by chronically leaking pipes. Sometimes, however, renters can recover lost wages, medical costs, or even payment for emotional damages. A tenant who believes he or she has a case against a landlord should contact an attorney for guidance.
<P>
<A NAME="270"><H3><STRONG>Eviction </STRONG></H3></A>
Under no circumstances may a landlord forcibly remove a tenant from rental property. In order to get a tenant out of a rental unit, the landlord must bring a lawsuit against the tenant. Legitimate grounds for bringing a suit include nonpayment of rent, breach of a lease, or refusal to leave a unit after the tenancy expires. The Illinois Retaliatory Eviction Act prohibits a landlord from evicting a tenant for complaining to any governmental authority, such as a housing inspector. 
<P>
The landlord first must give the renter written notice of the eviction, which must state the reason he or she plans to start eviction proceedings. The tenant has five days to pay all rent owing, if nonpayment of rent is the reason for eviction. If the reason for eviction is a violation of the lease, the landlord is required to give the tenant ten days' notice. The landlord then must file a complaint in court against the tenant. At the hearing, each side has an opportunity to present its side of the story, through witnesses, with the assistance of counsel, and by presenting evidence. The tenant has a right to a trial by jury. The judge will deliver an opinion. The judge may order the tenant to move immediately, but usually gives the tenant two weeks to vacate. If the judge decides the tenant has no legal reason for refusing to leave the property, the judge may order the sheriff to force the tenant out. If the sheriff has to perform the eviction, the tenant's property may be stored on-site or in a warehouse.
<P>
<A NAME="280"><H3><STRONG>Tenant's Rights </STRONG></H3></A>
Tenants enjoy a number of rights, even if those rights are not specified in the rental contract. The tenant has a right to quiet enjoyment of the premises, which means that the landlord may not interfere illegally or unreasonably in the tenant's life, just because the landlord owns the property. Renters have the right to use the rented premises in any way, as long as it is legal.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="290"><H4><STRONG>Privacy </STRONG></H4></A>
Generally, a landlord may enter a tenant's unit only with the tenant's consent, except in an emergency. After a tenant has given notice of termination, a landlord has the right to enter the unit to show it to prospective renters. A landlord also may enter for a "reasonable business purpose," such as maintenance, only after giving the tenant reasonable notice. If a landlord fails to get permission or give notice, the landlord is trespassing and may be sued. The tenant whose privacy rights have been violated may recover damages.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="300"><H4><STRONG>Access </STRONG></H4></A>
Tenants have a right of access to the property they rent. It is illegal for a landlord to lock a tenant out of his or her unit without a court order. A tenant who is unlawfully locked out may petition the court to get back in. The court has authority to order law enforcement officers to help the tenant regain access. If the court finds that the landlord knew or should have known that the lockout was illegal, it may order the landlord to pay damages.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="310"><H4><STRONG>Sublease </STRONG></H4></A>
Subleasing is having someone else take over a tenant's rights and obligations under a lease before the original lease expires. The tenant has a right to sublet a unit if the lease does not prohibit doing so. If the new tenant does not pay rent, damages the unit, leaves before the lease expires, or breaches another condition of the lease, the landlord may hold the original tenant responsible. The original tenant then may sue the new tenant for those costs.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="320"><H2><STRONG>Utilities </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Generally landlords who rent property are responsible for paying the utility bills. A landlord and a tenant may agree in the lease that the tenant will obtain his or her own account with the utility companies, as long as the tenant is responsible only for utilities in his or her unit. It is unlawful for landlords to request or require that tenants pay utility bills for common areas or other units. If a landlord fails to pay a utility bill which he or she is responsible, a tenant may pay the bill and deduct the payment from his or her rent.
<P>
<A NAME="330"><H3><STRONG>Utility Suspension </STRONG></H3></A>
Landlords who are responsible for paying for the provision of utilities are forbidden under Illinois law from shutting off utilities, except in emergencies or for repairs. A tenant whose electricity, water, or heat are terminated because the landlord has failed to pay the bills has several options. The tenant may stop paying rent, as noted above. The tenant may recover 100 percent of the rent paid for any period during which he or she did not have utility service, and each tenant in the landlord's building may recover up to $300 in damages. Utility companies must abide by certain guidelines prior to shutting off service. In the case of rented property, utility companies must give tenants ten days' notice prior to terminating service, and the exact date service will be terminated must be provided.
<P>
<A NAME="340"><H3><STRONG>Cold Weather Utility Rule </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois has a state policy that no residence should be denied essential utility service during the winter due to a failure or inability of the consumer to pay the utility bill. This law dictates that people working for utility companies and residents will work together in a fair manner and that they will act in good faith to resolve any problems with paying for or providing utility service in the winter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="350"><H2><STRONG>Discrimination in Housing </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Federal and Illinois laws prohibit home sellers and landlords from discriminating on the basis of age, ancestry, citizenship, color, creed, disability, marital status, national origin, race, religion, reliance on public assistance, sex, or unfavorable military discharge. The law prohibits discrimination against families with children under the age of 18. Some areas have local laws that provide additional protection from discrimination. For example, Chicago has a city ordinance forbidding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
<P>
Following are some examples of prohibited actions by landlords, owners, or real estate agents:
<UL>
<LI>Failing to rent to people of a particular race
<LI>Using restrictive covenants to prohibit people of a particular ethnic origin from living in a development
<LI>Charging a blind tenant extra for keeping a guide dog (unless the dog actually causes damage to the property)
<LI>Failing to design housing that is accessible to people with disabilities.
</UL>
Depending on the nature of the violation, federal or state agencies are responsible for enforcing non-discrimination laws. The Illinois Human Rights Act, for instance, is enforced by the Illinois Department of Human Rights.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Small Business Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

There are several ways to organize a business, and the option selected depends on various factors. The option chosen by a small family-owned and operated venture may not be the same choice of a company with several owners and many employees. Each option has benefits and drawbacks. The option selected by a business may change over time as the business' needs, identity, size, budget, and liabilities change. A person may start out as a sole proprietor but decide years later to incorporate. Before a person or persons decide what option would best meet their needs, an attorney experienced in business matters should be consulted.
The <STRONG>Law & Leading Attorneys: Illinois Business Guide</STRONG> contains information on issues of concern to businesspersons as well as listings of leading Illinois business attorneys.
<P>
The following is a brief summary of the common forms of business organizations. At the end of the chapter, issues that may affect all forms of business will be outlined, including registering an assumed name and obtaining tax identification numbers and licenses.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Sole Proprietorship </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A sole proprietorship is the simplest form of business organization. One person owns, manages, and controls the business. A sole proprietorship may have employees, but only the owner is in charge of the business. The owner receives the business profits and losses. This person is also responsible for any debts the business may incur. Income, expenses, and losses are reported on the business owner's individual tax return. 
<P>
A sole proprietorship is relatively easy to organize. The business owner must acquire the appropriate licenses, if any, and tax identification numbers, and must register the business name. There are no specific state filing requirements for this business option.
<P>
The benefits of the sole proprietorship include having complete control over the business, ease of the initial set-up, and having business profits taxed at the individual taxpayer rate, which is lower than the rate charged to corporations.
<P>
The drawbacks to sole proprietorship include being personally responsible for debts and liabilities of the business. For example, if a business owner has debts that are not being paid, the creditors can reach the personal assets of the business owner, such as a personal checking account. A business owner may obtain insurance to minimize this drawback. Other drawbacks include lack of continuity--when the business owner dies, the business ceases to exist--and the fact that a sole proprietor is not able to deduct benefits like health, dental, and life insurance on his or her income tax return as business expenses. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Partnership </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A partnership is a business owned by two or more parties. In Illinois it is possible to form three types of partnerships: general, limited, and limited liability.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>General Partnership </STRONG></H3></A>
A general partnership occurs when two or more persons own, manage, and control a business. Persons in a general partnership share the rights, duties, and responsibilities. Partnerships may also have employees; however, only the partners have control of the business activities. 
<P>
A partnership has more issues to address than the sole proprietorship. Besides obtaining the appropriate licenses and tax numbers and registering the business name, partners must agree on the treatment of business profits, expenses, losses, and other business concerns. 
<P>
Typically, there is a written agreement between the partners to address these issues. A general partnership in Illinois need not be registered with the state, and there are no formal requirements for its formation. However, state law governs the conduct, liabilities, and dissolution of a partnership, as well as the relationship between and liabilities of the partners.
The benefits of a general partnership include the owners' control of the business. However, unlike the sole proprietor who has exclusive control, partners share control and responsibilities. Partners have the advantage of more than one resource for finances, ideas, and sharing the work load. The formation of a general partnership can be less complicated than other business formats, such as limited partnerships and corporations. Finally, profits from the partnership are included on the partners' individual tax returns and taxed at the individual taxpayer rate, which is lower than the rate charged to corporations.
<P>
The drawbacks to a general partnership include the partners' personal responsibility for the debts and liabilities of the partnership. A partner can be liable for debts incurred by other partners in furtherance of the business. As in a sole proprietorship, a partnership may obtain insurance to minimize this drawback. Business partners are treated like sole proprietors with regard to deducting benefits provided to themselves. Benefits like health, dental, and life insurance may generally not be deducted on partners' income tax returns as business expenses.
<P>
In a general partnership, the business generally dissolves upon the death, retirement or withdrawal of a partner, unless there is an express agreement to continue the business under such circumstances. If the business is continued, the former partner, or the former partner's legal representative, is entitled to the value of the former partner's interest, or the profits attributable to the use of the former partner's right in the property. By law, if a partnership interest is assigned to another person, that person is only entitled to the partner's profits from the business. That person may not participate in the management or operation of the partnership unless all the partners agree. These legal requirements may be modified by a partnership agreement. A partnership agreement may detail how a partnership interest may be sold, transferred, or handled upon the death of a partner. Addressing potential issues in an agreement may be one way to prevent disputes from occurring.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Limited Partnership </STRONG></H3></A>
A limited partnership is similar in many respects to a general partnership. However, in a limited partnership, there are two types of partners--general and limited. Illinois law requires that a limited partnership have one or more general partners and one or more limited partners. The principal difference between a general and limited partner is that the limited partner can limit his or her personal liability for partnership debts to the amount he or she invests in the partnership. The limited partner, in exchange for the reduction in liability, does not control or manage the business. The general partner controls and manages the business and is personally liable for partnership debts.
<P>
Because limited partnerships must meet specific Illinois statutory requirements, they can be more complicated to establish. A limited partnership must apply for a certificate of limited partnership from the Secretary of State, and this certification must be renewed every two years. A limited partnership must maintain certain records, and must follow specific requirements for registering the business name. A limited partnership is not permitted to engage in the businesses of insurance, banking, or operating a railroad.
<P>
The benefits of a limited partnership depend on whether one is a general or limited partner. The general partner enjoys control and management responsibilities. The limited partner receives limited personal liability. Profits for both types of partners are included on the partners' individual tax returns and taxed at the individual taxpayer rate, which is lower than the rate charged to corporations.
<P>
The drawbacks of a limited partnership also depend on whether one is a general or limited partner. A general partner is personally responsible for the business debts while the limited partner is only liable for debts up to the amount he or she has invested in the partnership. The limited partner does not participate in the management or control of the business. Business partners are treated like sole proprietors with regard to deducting benefits provided to themselves. Benefits like health, dental, and life insurance may generally not be deducted on partners' income tax returns as business expenses.
<P>
Unlike a sole proprietorship or general partnership, when a limited partnership wishes to dissolve, it must file a certificate of cancellation with the Illinois Secretary of State in order to cancel its certificate of limited partnership. As mentioned previously, there are laws that apply to limited partnerships specifically that make this format more time-consuming and complex.
A limited partnership can continue after the death or departure of a partner. The departing partner (or his or her beneficiaries) may be entitled to the fair market value of the partnership interest. The beneficiaries also may have the option of becoming limited partners. A partner's interest in a limited partnership may be assigned. However, the party receiving the assignment is only entitled to the profits that the assigning partner would have received. The partners may agree that the person receiving the assignment becomes a limited partner. This legal requirement may be modified by a partnership agreement. A partnership agreement may detail the conditions of how a partnership interest may be sold, transferred, or handled upon the departure or death of a partner. 
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Limited Liability Partnership </STRONG></H3></A>
Since 1994, businesses in Illinois have had the option of filing as limited liability partnerships. A partner in a registered limited liability partnership is not liable for the debts or liabilities of the partnership arising from the negligence or wrongful acts of another partner, an employee, or agent of the partnership. However, each partner is always liable for that partner's own negligence or wrongful acts, and remains liable for the debts and liabilities of the partnership that arise from other causes, such as debts owed on business loans.
<P>
A limited liability partnership must register with the Illinois Secretary of State by filing an application and paying a fee. The registration must be renewed annually. There are also restrictions on the name such a partnership may use. In all other respects, the limited liability partnership is the same as a general partnership.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Corporation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The creation of a corporation is the creation of an artificial person. For legal and tax purposes, a corporation is a separate entity from its owners. A corporation can make purchases, enter into contracts, pay taxes, and sue and be sued.
<P>
Corporations must be established in compliance with the requirements set forth in Illinois law. Shareholders are the owners of a corporation. Management and control of the corporation are the responsibility of the board of directors, who may or may not be the shareholders. Income, expenses, and losses of the business are filed on the corporation's tax returns.
<P>
There are many requirements for a business to become incorporated. A discussion of the incorporation requirements may be found in the <STRONG>Law & Leading Attorneys: Illinois Business Guide.</STRONG>
The benefits of a corporation include protecting the shareholders from business debts and responsibilities in most cases. Unlike the business options previously discussed, a corporation's creditors may not seek to collect debts from the owners of the corporation. However, owners of a new corporation may be required by financial institutions to give personal financial assurances in order to receive funding. There is continuity of a corporate business regardless of individual shareholder status. Even if several shareholders sell their shares in a business or a principal stockholder dies, the existence of the corporation is not affected. Also, a corporation may sell stock or shares in its business to raise capital. Corporations may have several types of stocks or shares available, such as voting shares and nonvoting shares.
<P>
The drawbacks of a corporation include double taxation. The corporation files its own tax returns and pays taxes on its profits before paying dividends to the shareholders. When the shareholders receive the dividends, these profits are included on the individual shareholders' tax returns and taxed. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Subchapter S Corporation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A Subchapter S corporation derives its name from a section of the Internal Revenue Code. Under Subchapter S in the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that meets certain requirements may be treated as a corporation for liability purposes but treated as a partnership for taxation purposes. Shareholders of an S corporation receive limited liability protection, and their profits from the business are included on their individual income tax return. Illinois has similar tax treatment for such corporations. 
<P>
The requirements of an S corporation include:
<UL>
<LI>No more than 35 shareholders
<LI>Shareholders must be natural persons (not corporations or partnerships)
<LI>Shareholders cannot be nonresident aliens
<LI>One class of stock
</UL>
After a business has incorporated, all shareholders must consent to Subchapter S treatment. The election to be treated as an S corporation must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Nonprofit Corporation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In order to be considered nonprofit, a corporation must have been formed for a purpose other than the financial benefit of its shareholders. Also, a nonprofit corporation cannot pay any dividends or other financial rewards to its shareholders. There are specific Illinois laws for nonprofit corporations. To receive tax-exempt status, an organization must first incorporate as a nonprofit corporation. After incorporation, applications for tax-exempt status must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service and the Illinois Department of Revenue. In order for contributions to the organization to be tax deductible, other requirements must be met. Certain charitable organizations must register with the Division of Charitable Trust and Solicitations. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Franchise </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A franchise is a method of selling and distributing goods and services. Franchises are available for many types of ventures. A franchise, unlike the options previously discussed, is not a form of business organization. A franchise is an arrangement between at least two parties, in which one party pays the other a fee for the right to engage in a particular business venture. Franchises are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and the Franchise Division of the Illinois Attorney General. Franchises are discussed further in the <STRONG>Law & Leading Attorneys: Illinois Business Guide.</STRONG> 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>General Business Issues </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As previously mentioned, there are a number of issues that impact businesses, whether sole proprietorship or corporations. The following will summarize the most common of these issues.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Name Registration </STRONG></H3></A>
Illinois law states that any business doing business in Illinois under a name other than the full name of the business owner must register the assumed name in the office of the county clerk of each county in which the company conducts business. A business owner must complete an application for a certificate of assumed name, and submit the proper fee. Notice of filing the certificate must be published in a newspaper in the county where application is made once a week for three consecutive weeks. After the owner submits proof of publication to the county clerk, the name is registered and is valid indefinitely without renewal. In Illinois, more than one business owner is permitted to operate under the same assumed name. Requirements for corporations and limited partnerships are different and can be found in the <STRONG>Law & Leading Attorneys: Illinois Business Guide.</STRONG>
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Tax Identification Numbers </STRONG></H3></A>
A business in Illinois must obtain a federal employer identification number. This identification number is the equivalent of a social security number for individuals. While sole proprietors without employees generally use their social security numbers, other businesses file Form SS-4 with the Internal Revenue Service. 
<P>
A business with employees must also register with the Illinois Department of Labor for an unemployment compensation number.
<P>
A business that sells retail goods or services must obtain a retailer's occupation tax number. A business that sells at wholesale must obtain a resale certificate number. Both types of numbers are obtained through the Sales Tax Division of the Illinois Department of Revenue.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Licenses </STRONG></H3></A>
A businesses operating in Illinois may also have to obtain federal, state, or local licenses. A businessperson must determine which licenses and permits are required before beginning his or her venture. A good place to start is the First Stop Business Information Center in Springfield, a comprehensive referral service that compiles permitting, licensing, and other regulatory requirements applicable to businesses.

Millions of people in the United States rely on some form of financial assistance from the government. People with disabilities are eligible for such assistance, as are people in lower income brackets. As workers age, they begin to reap the benefits of years in the workforce, receiving the retirement assistance commonly referred to as "Social Security." This chapter describes the federal Social Security Act and the major programs created thereunder. Other issues of interest to senior citizens are addressed in the <A HREF="c14.html">Elder Law</A> Chapter.

<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Social Security Act </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Congress passed the Social Security Act in 1935 to create a very broad social safety net for all United States workers and their families. Originally intended to provide financial support for elderly workers who could no longer perform gainful labor, Social Security has expanded to include workers with disabilities, dependents of persons qualified to receive Social Security, and survivors (widows, widowers, or children) of someone who died but had become legally eligible to receive Social Security. Thus, depending on a person's circumstances, he or she may be eligible for Social Security benefits at any age.
<P>
The public benefit programs started by the Social Security Act and its amendments are financed generally by taxes levied on workers. Employers automatically deduct a portion of each worker's paycheck and match that amount with money from their business or organization. As of 1995, 7.65 percent of the employee's gross salary goes to Social Security. This deduction is usually labeled "FICA" for the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, which authorizes the payroll tax. A person's employer also is required to contribute 7.65 percent of the employee's gross salary to Social Security. Self-employed workers are responsible for paying the entire amount themselves. If a person is self-employed, he or she pays 15.3 percent of his or her taxable income to Social Security, but half of that is deductible from federal income tax as a business expense.
<P>
Of the money received from Social Security payroll taxes, the largest portion goes to pay retirement benefits; smaller portions pay disability benefits and Medicare. As of 1995, there were approximately 141 million people paying into Social Security.
<P>
The three largest programs within the Social Security Act are Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Health Insurance (RSDHI); Supplemental Security Income (SSI); and Medicaid. RSDHI is the name of the federal government's benefits program for workers and retirees, and itself contains three separate programs to cover retirement, disability, and health insurance (Medicare).
<P>
These three programs are extremely complex. Although detailed descriptions are beyond the space limitations of this chapter, a general familiarity with them is helpful for understanding one's entitlements.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Benefits for Retirees </STRONG></H3></A>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Retirement and Survivors Insurance </STRONG></H4></A>
Despite the fact that Retirement and Survivors Insurance (RSI) is only one branch of RSDHI, which in turn is only one branch of the Social Security Act, when most people refer to "Social Security" they actually mean RSI. Payments from RSI are the Social Security checks that millions of Americans receive each month. This was not intended to be a person's sole source of income, but to supplement other income sources such as pensions, insurance, savings, and investments. However, for many, RSI is their only source of income.
<P>
A worker gains RSI coverage by performing covered employment for a certain amount of time. The term "covered employment" means most types of work including full- or part-time wage or salaried work, self-employment, farm work, membership in the United States Armed Services, employment in private nonprofit organizations, most domestic work, and most federal, state, and local government employment. The only major exceptions are railroad employees separately covered by the Railroad Retirement System, federal workers hired before 1984, and certain religious workers. The rules of eligibility and benefit amount are quite complex and provide limited coverage for spouses, children, and survivors.
<P>
Generally, a person begins receiving RSI benefits at age 65; however, a worker has the option of initiating benefits at age 62. All benefits are based on what is called the primary insurance amount (PIA): the amount a worker is entitled to if he or she retires exactly at age 65. The amount of the monthly check varies depending on how much the worker made each year. The higher his or her pay, the higher the benefits, up to a maximum dollar amount. A person who initiates benefits at age 62 receives a reduced monthly amount equal to a percentage of his or her PIA. This is a permanent reduction that amounts to approximately seven percent of the PIA for each year a person receives benefits before age 65. Postponing the receipt of benefits until after age 65 can entitle a worker to receive higher monthly amounts. Cost-of-living increases are built into the system so that the monthly amount automatically increases each year as the national cost of living rises.
<P>
Family members receive benefits based on the worker's retirement benefits. The spouse of an eligible worker draws spousal benefits on the worker's account--usually one-half of the worker's PIA--if the spouse is at least 62 years old or cares for a child eligible for child's benefits on the worker's account. Other bases for family eligibility are
<UL>
<LI>Spousal benefits for a divorced spouse if he or she was married to the insured worker for at least ten continuous years and has not remarried
<LI>Full benefits for a surviving widow or widower of a fully insured worker from age 65
<LI>A one-time death benefit (currently $255) for surviving relatives of fully insured workers who apply within two years of the worker's death
<LI>Benefits for the child or grandchild of an insured worker if he or she was dependent on the worker when benefits began, is unmarried, and
	<LI>Is 18 years old or younger
	<LI>Is 19 years old or younger but enrolled as a full-time elementary or secondary school student, or
	<LI>Is older than 18 years but became disabled before reaching age 22
</UL>
As a general rule, an eligible individual must apply for RSI benefits in order to receive them. Failure to apply for benefits as soon as one is entitled to them can forfeit earned benefits. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Railroad Retirement System </STRONG></H4></A>
The Railroad Retirement System is a federal income insurance program specifically for workers in the railroad industry. Originally, this system was independent of the Social Security Administration, but in 1974 the two programs' provisions were integrated. The integration was not entirely smooth, however, which has led to complex and confusing rules that are often the source of errors in awarding benefits.
<P>
Most of the rules for Railroad Retirement closely parallel those for RSI. A retired railroad worker is eligible for monthly benefits if he or she worked for a railroad employer for at least ten years before reaching age 65. As with RSI, a worker can opt to retire earlier, at age 62, but will receive reduced benefits. Anyone with fewer than ten years employment in the railroad industry is ineligible for railroad benefits, but the years of railroad employment can be added to years of non-railroad employment for purposes of calculating RSI benefits.
<P>
Some railroad workers who retired before January 1, 1975, are entitled to draw both full RSI benefits and full Railroad Retirement benefits. Most other workers, however, have their RSI benefits reduced by the amount of the Railroad benefits.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Disability Benefits </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal government has two disability benefit programs administered by the Social Security Administration for qualified applicants: RSDHI Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). These two programs are similar and are governed by many of the same rules. An individual who qualifies for one program occasionally can receive benefits from both programs simultaneously.
<P>
Both RSDHI and SSI programs define disability as "inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determined physical or mental impairment which can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months." The physical or mental disability must be "of such severity" that an applicant not only is unable to do the work he or she did previously, but is unable to engage in any kind of gainful work.
<P>
The applicant for either RSDHI disability or SSI has the burden of proving by medical evidence that he or she is disabled or blind. Most applicants must wait five full months before their benefits begin. Each applicant's case is reviewed periodically to determine whether his or her condition has improved to the point that he or she is able to resume working.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>RSDHI Disability Insurance </STRONG></H4></A>
RSDHI Disability Insurance provides benefits for workers with substantial work histories in covered employment who are unable to continue work because they became disabled before reaching age 25. The term "covered employment" includes most types of work. The disabled worker and his or her dependents usually are eligible for RSDHI disability benefits. In some cases, disabled survivors of an insured worker can receive benefits.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Supplemental Security Income </STRONG></H4></A>
SSI is a nationwide income maintenance program designed to help persons with limited income and assets who are elderly, blind, or disabled. Although SSI is administered by the Social Security Administration, it is not funded by Social Security taxes. Unlike Social Security, SSI is based on need. A person's work record is not relevant in determining eligibility for SSI. Thus, a disabled person under age 65 who has not worked a sufficient amount of time to qualify for RSDHI disability may be eligible to receive SSI disability benefits.
<P>
To receive SSI, a person must be 65 years of age or older, be blind or disabled, and have financial need. The formula for determining SSI eligibility and benefits takes into account both income level and assets. When calculating a person's income, the government includes earnings, Social Security benefits, payments from pensions, any non-cash items like food, clothing, or shelter, and items that the individual may own. Some things, however, are exempt from consideration, such as
<UL>
<LI>A person's home (regardless of its value)
<LI>Household goods and personal property (worth less than $2,000)
<LI>One car (worth less than $4,500)
<LI>Income tax refunds
<LI>The value of food stamps
<LI>A portion of monthly earnings
</UL>
A person qualifying on the basis of blindness or disability must be referred to vocational rehabilitation services. If the disability is related to alcohol or drug dependency, the applicant may be required to enroll in an appropriate treatment program or risk losing eligibility. Residence in a public institution, such as a prison or certain hospitals, disqualifies an applicant. If a person receives SSI, he or she also may be eligible for other benefits such as food stamps and Medicaid, discussed below.
<P>
When the federal government created SSI, it replaced many state-administered welfare programs for the elderly, blind, and disabled. The State of Illinois chose to continue its own program to supplement SSI benefits. This program is known as State Supplemental Payments (SSP). SSP provides additional assistance to qualified elderly, blind, and disabled persons, including those whose income levels are above the SSI standards. The purpose of SSP is to help very poor Illinois residents who are unable to work but whose needs are not met by other federal or state programs.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Medicare </STRONG></H3></A>
Medicare--also called Medical Assistance in Illinois--is a federal program administered by the Social Security Administration designed to cover some basic medical and health care costs of eligible individuals over age 65 as well as many people with disabilities. Medicare has become an enormous federal program, providing billions of dollars in coverage every year.
<P>
Medicare should not be confused with Medicaid. Medicaid is a program administered by the Social Security Administration to pay doctor and hospital bills of people with limited income and assets. Medicare benefits are available to qualified individuals regardless of financial need. Because Medicare is closely linked to RSI, Disability Insurance, and Railroad Disability benefits, a basic understanding of the eligibility requirements and application procedures for those programs is helpful for an understanding of Medicare.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Medicare Parts A and B </STRONG></H4></A>
Medicare has two basic divisions, called Part A and Part B. Medicare Part A, commonly known as Hospital Insurance, covers medically necessary hospital and related health care. Included in Part A are costs for such expenses as inpatient hospital care necessitated by acute illness, skilled nursing home care, certified hospice care for the terminally ill, inpatient psychiatric care, and care in the home by a certified home health care provider. People qualify for Hospital Insurance when they turn 65 or if they are covered by Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits.
<P>
Medicare Part B, commonly known as Medical Insurance, is a voluntary health insurance program designed to cover some of the costs not covered by Medicare Part A, such as outpatient hospital services, outpatient physical therapy, speech pathology services, necessary ambulance service, and medical equipment. Unlike Part A, which is paid for out of Social Security taxes and is free to anyone who qualifies, Part B is an optional program that carries a monthly premium of under $50.
<P>
The federal government contracts with private insurance companies to handle routine claims processing, payment, and other functions under Parts A and B. Medicare recipients have the right to choose how they will receive hospital, doctor, and other health care services covered by Medicare. One option is the traditional fee-for-service system. Under this system, the recipient visits a hospital or doctor of his or her choice and pays a fee for any services provided. Medicare will pay a percentage of that fee, but the recipient is responsible for certain deductible and coinsurance payments. Most people covered by a fee-for-service Medicare plan also have private insurance (commonly called Medigap) to supplement their Medicare coverage.
<P>
Another option is to use a health maintenance organization (HMO). HMOs offer a wide range of health care services in exchange for a fixed premium paid in advance. Medicare recipients enrolled in an HMO rarely require additional Medigap insurance because the HMO plan itself supplements Medicare. One drawback of an HMO, however, is that health care services can only be provided by a member of the HMO's health care network. Medicare recipients lose the freedom to consult any health care provider of their choice.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Costs Not Covered by Medicare </STRONG></H4></A>
Medicare never was intended to provide comprehensive coverage for all medical needs of America's elderly population, but rather was intended to supplement private resources. Many health services are not covered by Medicare. For example, Medicare does not pay for:
<UL>
<LI>Custodial care provided by someone without medical training and intended to help the patient with his or her daily living needs, such as help with bathing, walking, or exercising
<LI>Dentures or routine dental care
<LI>Eyeglasses, hearing aids, and examinations to prescribe or fit them
<LI>Nursing home care (except skilled nursing care)
<LI>Prescription drugs
<LI>Routine physical checkups and related tests (except for some screening procedures, such as Pap smears and mammograms)
<LI>Most immunization shots
<LI>Services outside the United States
<LI>Personal comfort items
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Medicaid </STRONG></H3></A>
Medicaid should not be confused with Medicare. Despite their similar names, the two programs are different. While Medicare is funded and administered entirely by the federal government to provide health care to elderly persons and people with disabilities, Medicaid is a cooperative program funded partly by the federal government and partly by the individual states. The federal government's role in Medicaid is quite limited. It pays a percentage of the cost of each state's health care program for indigent people and ensures that every state's program complies with various federal requirements. The amount of money a state receives from the federal government is called the Federal Financial Participation (FFP). Each state's FFP is determined by a formula based on the state's per capita income and the amount of medical services the state chooses to provide to needy people within the state. Many people qualify for Medicaid, Medicare, and other forms of assistance that often are administered in an overlapping or cooperative fashion.
<P>
Each state has wide latitude to decide how Medicaid operates within the state. In Illinois, Medicaid is administered by the Illinois Department of Public Aid. To receive Medicaid, a person must have assets with a low value and very low income as determined by a complex formula. In Illinois, a person generally cannot have more than $3,000 in assets or more than $591 income per month, although there is a complex formula applied that considers the applicant's unique situation. There are several assets the formula does not count. Assets not counted include
<UL>
<LI>Homestead
<LI>Automobile necessary for employment or otherwise to produce income, to receive health care, or essential for transporting a person with disabilities
<LI>Income-producing property
<LI>Household goods and personal effects
</UL>
Certain other unavailable assets are not counted, such as jointly held real estate if the other joint owner refuses to sell and property tied up in probate.
<P>
A person can reduce his or her assets to the point that he or she qualifies for Medicaid. As long as transfers are compensated, it is legal to restructure one's assets and income with the intent of qualifying for Medicaid. For example, it is permissible for a person to invest all of his or her available cash in a larger homestead or to expand a business in order to reduce his or her counted assets below $3,000. It is not permissible simply to give the available cash to family members or friends.
<P>
A person whose income is above Medicaid limits might be able to qualify for Medicaid under a spend-down provision. The spend-down is equal to the amount a person's income is over Medicaid limits. Medicaid occasionally agrees to cover the amount that a person's medical bills exceed a patient's spend-down.
<P>
Restructuring assets to qualify for Medicaid can be an especially attractive option for senior citizens, even if they already qualify for Medicare. Medicaid coverage is better for persons living in nursing homes because Medicaid pays for a wider variety of nursing care services and for a longer period of time than Medicare. Lawyers who specialize in Medicaid have experience in advising clients how to restructure their assets and income to qualify for Medicaid.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Other State Assistance </STRONG></H3></A>
In addition to SSP, described above, the Illinois Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan is a state program offering additional financial assistance to Illinois residents. This program was intended as an alternative to traditional health insurance. It benefits Illinois residents who are refused health insurance by private health insurance companies, or who can obtain insurance but only at an excessive rate. The Comprehensive Health Insurance Plan provides coverage for medically necessary treatment such as hospital services.
<P>
In Illinois, two additional programs help older people and people with disabilities pay for their Medicare coverage. In order to be eligible for these programs, an individual must have assets of no more than $4,000 and must live in Illinois. The Qualified Medicare Beneficiary Program (QMB) assists those who have Part A Hospital Insurance and whose income is at 100 percent or less than the federal poverty level. The Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary Program (SLMB) covers Part B Medical Insurance for individuals with incomes between 100 percent and 110 percent of the poverty level. These programs are run by the Illinois Department of Public Aid.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Applying for Benefits </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
To apply for Social Security benefits, a person should visit his or her local Social Security office and fill out an application. By calling the Social Security Administration's toll-free number, a person can obtain the address of the closest office and set up an appointment with a Social Security representative. For retirement benefits, it is advisable to begin the application process several months before a person wants to start receiving benefits. A person who becomes disabled should apply for benefits immediately; usually, benefits do not begin until the sixth month of the disability. Anyone applying for benefits should take the following to the office:
<UL>
<LI>Social Security card or number
<LI>Birth certificate
<LI>Tax information, such as his or her most recent W-2 form or tax return
<LI>Information about his or her home, such as real estate title
<LI>Income and ownership information, such as payroll slips, bank books, insurance policies, and vehicle registration
<LI>Marriage certificate, spouse's birth certificate and spouse's Social Security number (if spouse is applying for benefits)
<LI>Children's birth certificates and Social Security numbers (if applying for children's benefits)
<LI>Military discharge papers
</UL>
All documents must be originals or certified copies. If a person does not have all of the necessary documents, the Social Security Administration offers assistance in locating the missing information.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Right to Appeal </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Filling out an application does not automatically entitle a person to benefits. A person may be denied benefits because his or her application is incomplete, or because he or she does not qualify due to age, disability status, or for some other reason. The Social Security Administration notifies people that their benefits have been denied by sending notice by letter. If a person disagrees with a decision of the Social Security Administration regarding benefits, he or she has the right to appeal and to be represented by an attorney.
<P>
There are three steps to the administrative appeals process. The first step is reconsideration. An Administration representative (someone other than the person who made the original decision) reconsiders the matter and issues an opinion. If, on reconsideration, the decision is negative again, the second step is a hearing before an administrative law judge. At this stage, the claimant has the right to subpoena and cross-examine witnesses, present evidence, and read relevant files. After listening to both sides, the administrative law judge issues a decision. In most cases, this will end the matter, but if the decision is negative and the claimant wishes to press his or her claim, the third and final step is the Appeals Council. If the Appeals Council decides to review the case (its jurisdiction is discretionary), it conducts a "paper" review of the entire matter. This means it issues a decision based on the files accumulated in the two previous steps. There is no additional opportunity to testify, although the appellant may submit additional documentation if necessary.
<P>
It is important to know that there are time limits in which to make an appeal. If a person is interested in appealing a decision regarding benefits, he or she should not delay in contacting the nearest Social Security Administration office.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>Resources </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Social Security Administration operates a toll-free, 24-hour telephone service to provide information on Social Security and related government benefit programs, including estimates of retirement benefits. Most questions about Social Security should be addressed to the Social Security Administration. To reach a service representative, call (800) 772-1213 between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m. on business days.
<P>
The Social Security Administration also publishes a number of booklets, forms, and pamphlets designed to explain different types of government benefits, all of which are available free of charge. They include the following:
<P>

<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Understanding Tax Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There is a saying that the only two sure things in life are death and taxes. Tax laws affect all people and touch most areas of life, so it would be helpful if tax laws were simple, clear, and easy to understand. Unfortunately, the tax system that exists has none of these characteristics. Many tax laws are unclear from the time they are written. Often, writing tax legislation involves so much compromise and redrafting that by the time a tax bill becomes law, even its author and sponsors do not fully understand what they have created. Other tax laws might be perfectly clear as written, but it may be difficult to know how to apply the law to a particular taxpayer. Finally, different courts in different jurisdictions can apply the same law to similar fact situations and reach completely different interpretations, each interpretation valid in that particular jurisdiction. Tax collectors have an important task because they collect taxes and help ensure that everyone pays his or her fair share. One of the most effective ways to encourage people to pay their fair share of taxes is to give them the impression that cheating will be noticed and punished. Simply put, the system would not work if the threat of a possible audit did not hang over every tax return submitted
<P>
Given the complexity of tax law, this chapter cannot describe all aspects of tax law. Instead, this chapter explains how consumers can manage tax disputes with the federal or state government.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Avoidance Versus Evasion </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There simply are not enough resources for the government to calculate everyone's taxes or to audit every return filed. The tax collection system assumes that most taxpayers will be honest when reporting their income and calculating their tax obligations. The government has many ways of checking the accuracy of information the taxpayer provides. Employers provide the IRS with information on how much employees earn and financial institutions report the interest income their investors and depositors receive. Still, there is a tension built into the system. Taxpayers want to pay as little tax as legally possible but tax collectors want to ensure that taxpayers pay as much as they are legally obligated to pay. The terms "tax evasion" and "tax avoidance" are frequently used interchangeably to describe this tension, but the terms have different meanings. 
<P>
To avoid taxes is to use legal means to limit one's tax liability. It is perfectly acceptable for a taxpayer to try to avoid taxes. Federal and state tax codes describe many ways a taxpayer can lower his or her tax burden. There are many ways to structure income to pay a minimum of taxes. There is nothing illegal in taking advantage of loopholes or shelters to avoid paying taxes. Tax evasion is using illegal means to get around paying one's taxes. It is illegal to evade paying legitimately owed taxes. Most taxpayers are tax avoiders. It is the job of tax collectors to find the tax evaders.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Federal Tax Disputes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the arm of the federal government charged with collecting federal income taxes. For most consumers, the federal income tax is the largest federal tax paid. The federal government collects taxes on a variety of different items including telephone calls, airplane tickets, cigarettes, and imported goods, but most consumers never challenge these taxes. For this reason, this section focuses on disputes with the IRS over the federal income tax.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>IRS Audit </STRONG></H3></A>
Pity the poor IRS agent. It is a safe bet that no one looks forward to being audited. Even if a taxpayer does nothing wrong, an audit, also called an examination by the IRS, can be confusing, frustrating, disruptive, and time-consuming. IRS employees know their task is not a popular one, and they do not try to aggravate taxpayers on purpose. They, too, struggle with a huge bureaucracy and must make do with outdated computers and a complex tax code with many gray areas of law. 
<P>
The IRS audits approximately three million returns annually. About two million of those taxpayers end up paying more taxes to the IRS. Getting an audit letter from the IRS is not an indication that the IRS believes the taxpayer is a cheater; it usually means that there is some irregularity in the return or that the taxpayer has been selected for a random audit. The taxpayer usually winds up paying Uncle Sam more money.

<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Who is Audited </STRONG></H3></A>
The IRS has three primary methods of selecting which returns to audit. The first method is random selection. By choosing to audit some returns at random, the IRS promotes better voluntary compliance with the tax code. Because every return has a chance of being selected for an audit, taxpayers are more likely to be honest. Relatively few of the returns selected this way contain significant errors, but the IRS uses the results of the random audits to measure compliance with the law and to update and improve the overall tax collection system. 
<P>
The second method is a computerized process whereby the IRS separates out returns that it believes may contain errors or be fraudulent. The computer program is fine-tuned each year based on the experience IRS gains from applying the tax code. Most of the returns selected this way have some unusual characteristic that raises a red flag for auditors. For example, if the IRS determines that many taxpayers claiming very large deductions for entertainment expenses are trying to defraud the government, the computer can be programmed to separate out returns with unusually large entertainment deductions. If the IRS learns from its random audits that many people misunderstand a particular application of the tax code, the computer can be programmed to separate out all returns relying on that application. 
<P>
An important point to know about this second method of selecting returns is that it is completely impersonal -- any return raising a particular red flag is tagged by the computer. Thus, if a taxpayer has an unusual circumstance that gives him or her an unusually large, yet legitimate deduction, the computer will select the return for audit every year. IRS auditors try to avoid repeat examinations for the same issue. Thus, if the IRS examined a taxpayer's return for the same issue in either of the previous two years and found in favor of the taxpayer, the taxpayer should call this to the attention of the IRS. Often in these cases, the audit is terminated without further investigation. 
<P>
The third method for selecting returns for audit compares information provided by the taxpayer with information from other sources. For example, if someone reports less income on his or her return than is reported on the W2 form provided by the taxpayer's employer, the IRS can seek to clarify the discrepancy.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Audit Process </STRONG></H3></A>
The audit process begins as soon as the taxpayer receives a letter from the IRS stating that his or her return has been selected for further examination. The audit may be done entirely by mail if the IRS has only a few questions, or it may be at an IRS office or at the taxpayer's home or business if the IRS has more substantial questions. The taxpayer can request that the audit interview be transferred to another IRS district if a different location is more convenient for the taxpayer.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Time Limits </STRONG></H4></A>
Under normal circumstances, the IRS cannot audit tax returns filed more than three years ago. For example, the deadline for the IRS to audit a 1995 tax return, filed at the latest on April 15, 1996, is April 15, 1999. Under certain circumstances, the three-year limit is extended. The IRS can demand records as far back as six years if an audit reveals that the amount of income the taxpayer failed to report on his or her latest return exceeds by 25 percent or more the income reported. Also, the IRS has no time limit if the taxpayer fails to file a return or if it determines that the taxpayer deliberately filed a false or fraudulent return.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Records </STRONG></H4></A>
IRS auditors almost always want to see financial records that relate to the return they are examining. This raises a commonly asked question: How long does a taxpayer need to keep records relating to income tax filings? The answer is generally three-and-a-half years because after that time, the IRS typically cannot audit the taxpayer. A taxpayer should keep financial documents longer than three-and-a-half years if they might affect any future returns. Thus, a person should keep records of any stocks purchased until they are sold, because only then can profit or loss be determined and reported on the next income tax return.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Taxpayer Rights in an IRS Audit </STRONG></H4></A>
Some taxpayers claim they are made to feel like criminals in IRS audits. In fact, the audit procedure differs significantly from a criminal proceeding and may provide fewer procedural safeguards for the taxpayer. Unlike a criminal trial in which a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty, in an IRS audit the taxpayer must prove to the IRS's satisfaction that the information on a return is correct and legal. For example, if the IRS questions a deduction for business-related travel expenses, the IRS does not have to show that the travel was entirely for pleasure or that the taxpayer never traveled during the year of the return. The burden is on the taxpayer to show that he or she really did incur the amount of travel expenses claimed. If he or she cannot document the expenses, the IRS can disallow the deduction without offering any evidence at all. 
<P>
A person has the right to ask the IRS to cancel a penalty if he or she can show his or her actions were the result of bad advice from the IRS. Thus, if someone pays less tax than owed, and the IRS discovers and penalizes the taxpayer for it, the taxpayer might have the fine canceled if he or she reasonably followed IRS advice in calculating taxes. 
<P>
The first step in proving that bad advice from the IRS caused a mistake is to document what an IRS employee said in person, over the telephone, or by letter. It is important to write down any tax advice received over the telephone or in person, and to note the time, the date and the name of the IRS employee giving the advice. The second step is to show that reliance on that advice was reasonable. Just because someone says what the taxpayer wants to hear is not sufficient reason for the taxpayer to rely on that information; reliance must be reasonable. Determining reasonableness is tricky, but the taxpayer should be aware that if a piece of advice seems too good to be true, it may not be true. If a reasonable person would seek a second opinion, then the taxpayer should also seek another opinion. Although the IRS may cancel a penalty for relying on bad advice, it is not obligated to cancel the interest accumulated on any additional tax the taxpayer may owe. 
<P>
The taxpayer need answer only the questions that the auditor asks. The taxpayer should not commit perjury, but he or she need not make the auditor's job easier by volunteering damaging information. If the taxpayer is instructed by the IRS to make documents available during an audit, it is best to have all these documents available for inspection in an organized and logical manner. In an audit conducted at home or at a place of business, called a field audit by the IRS, the taxpayer need not give the auditor access to a copying machine or allow the auditor to take original documents back to IRS offices. The taxpayer should, however, make copies of the documents that the auditor specifically requests and make a note of which documents the auditor gets copies of. If an audit is by mail, the taxpayer should send to the IRS only copies of those items specifically requested. Documentation should always be sent to the IRS via certified mail with a return receipt requested. 
<P>
Many taxpayers are concerned about the privacy of information they provide on a tax return or in an audit. The government is obligated to respect the confidentiality of information a taxpayer provides in the tax collection process, and anyone who prepares a return or represents the taxpayer is also obligated to respect the client's privacy. In limited circumstances, the IRS is allowed to share some taxpayer information with state tax agencies, the Department of Justice, or other federal agencies. During an audit or at any time the IRS asks for information, the taxpayer has the right to know why the agency wants the information, how the information will be used, and what may happen if the taxpayer chooses not to give the information. 
<P>
The taxpayer has the right to take someone along to an IRS audit interview. This could be an attorney, a certified public accountant, the person who filled out the tax forms, or an enrolled agent. Another person may represent the taxpayer in his or her absence during an audit interview, as long as the taxpayer files with the IRS a power of attorney form or a similar document. 
<P>
The taxpayer has the right to tape record the audit interview. To do so, the taxpayer must inform the IRS in writing of the intention to tape the interview at least ten days in advance, and must supply the tape recorder. If the IRS decides to tape record an interview, it must inform the taxpayer at least ten days in advance. The taxpayer has a right to a copy of the IRS tape, but must pay for the copying expenses. 
<P>
If at any point in the audit process the taxpayer feels that the proceeding is not going well, he or she always has three options. First, the taxpayer can agree with the IRS, pay additional taxes, and vow to be more careful when filing future tax returns. Second, the taxpayer can ask the IRS for a notice of deficiency and take the case to a federal tax court. Third, the taxpayer can pay the disputed amount, file a claim for a refund, and then take the case to the federal district court, the federal tax court, or the federal claims court. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Result of an Audit </STRONG></H4></A>
A minority of taxpayers who are audited receive from the IRS a no-change report, a letter stating that the IRS accepts an audited return without changes. Only about 30 percent of the people audited get a no-change letter. In even rarer situations, the IRS owes the taxpayer money after an audit. However, in most cases, the IRS determines that the taxpayer owes more money. 
<P>
If the taxpayer owes more money, the IRS sends the taxpayer a 30-day letter and a copy of the audit report outlining the additional taxes owed. If the taxpayer agrees to the changes detailed in the audit report, he or she can sign the enclosed form and send it back within 30 days to the IRS with a check. If the taxpayer sends a signed form back without a check, the IRS sends the taxpayer a bill, which must be paid within ten days. Either way, the taxpayer pays interest on the extra tax, calculated from the due date of the audited return to the billing date. 
<P>
Another option outlined in the 30-day letter is the IRS's internal appeals process, which can be initiated by submitting, within 30 days, a written protest to the IRS requesting a conference with an appeals officer. If the amount of the additional tax is less than $2,500, the protest does not need to be in written form. 
<P>
If the taxpayer ignores the 30-day letter, the IRS sends a notice of deficiency, sometimes called a 90-day letter, because it notifies the taxpayer that he or she has 90 days to either settle the matter with the IRS or to file suit in one of three federal courts. 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Appealing an Audit </STRONG></H3></A>
If a taxpayer disputes the results of an audit, he or she can appeal the auditor's decision to a regional IRS appeals office or directly to a federal court. Appealing within the IRS is relatively straightforward and generally less expensive and time-consuming than going to court. If taxpayers go to federal court and win there, they can sometimes recover from the IRS some or all of their administrative and litigation costs, but only if they first use the IRS appeals process.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Appealing Within the IRS </STRONG></H4></A>
A taxpayer can start the IRS appeals process by requesting a conference through the IRS's local district director. The district director then arranges a meeting with one of the IRS's appeals officers, located in most major cities. The request for an appeals conference should state the exact elements in the auditor's report with which the taxpayer disagrees, the elements of tax law that support the taxpayer's case, and any facts that support the taxpayer's position. 
<P>
As in any dealings with the IRS, the taxpayer can be represented or advised by an attorney during the appeals conference and can bring along witnesses to support statements of facts. These conferences are informal, and they represent a last chance to resolve a dispute before going to court. There is no guarantee what will happen, but quite often the IRS officers make some concessions at this point in order to avoid going to court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Going to Court </STRONG></H4></A>
If a taxpayer decides that the IRS's decision is unfair, unjust, or unreasonable, he or she can take the dispute to one of three federal courts, all of which operate independently of the IRS. Deciding whether to file suit in tax court, claims court, or district court depends on a number of legal and personal factors. Each court is guided by the previous cases that it has decided. As a result, a taxpayer's odds of success may be better in one court than in another. Most cases, no matter which court first hears them, can ultimately be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The only exception to this rule is for cases heard under the small tax case procedure in tax court. 
<P>
A taxpayer may go to any one of three courts without first going through the IRS appeals process, but quite often a tax court judge will not hear a case unless it has been considered for settlement by a regional IRS appeals office. If a taxpayer goes to tax court without first going through the IRS appeals process and loses his or her court case, the tax court judge may fine the taxpayer up to $5,000 if he or she determines that the lawsuit was a tactic to delay paying the IRS or that the suit was otherwise frivolous. In all three courts, the taxpayer has the burden of proving that the IRS is wrong. In other words, the court assumes that the IRS correctly interpreted the tax laws as they apply to a case, and the taxpayer does not win unless he or she convinces the court otherwise.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG><EM>U.S. Tax Court </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Tax court hears only tax cases. In order to go to tax court, a taxpayer need not pay the disputed tax amount first, unlike the other two courts where he or she must pay the disputed amount before filing suit. In tax court, the taxpayer does not have a right to trial by jury, so cases are heard by a judge who is experienced in tax law, rather than by a group of peers who might be swayed by emotion. If a taxpayer wants to take a case to tax court, he or she must file suit within 90 days after the IRS mails a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer's last known address. In general, tax court rules are less strict than those used in the other two courts. 
<P>
If a dispute with the IRS is for an amount under $10,000, the taxpayer can go through the tax court's small tax case procedure, which is generally quicker and even less formal than the court's standard procedure. However, the decision of a judge who hears cases under the small tax case procedure is final, so if a taxpayer chooses this procedure, he or she loses the right to appeal the court's decision. Because the taxpayer does not need to be represented by an attorney in this procedure, it may be a good option in a dispute regarding smaller dollar amounts in which any money won would be wiped out to pay attorney's fees. 
<P>
Finally, a taxpayer should be aware of what is often called the "tax court trap," which describes the ability of the IRS to impose even more fines based on any new information that it discovers about the taxpayer during a tax court proceeding. 
<P>
Tax court is the most popular route for taxpayers, in large part because it does not require that the disputed tax be paid first. But tax court can also be a very unsuccessful route. IRS statistics show that only about five percent of the taxpayers who bring their cases in tax court win. The taxpayer success rate in the other two courts, however, is only marginally better at about 11 percent.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG><EM>U.S. District Court </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Of the three courts that hear taxpayer disputes with the IRS, only in federal district court is there a right to a trial by jury. To bring suit in district court, the taxpayer must first pay the disputed tax to the IRS and then claim a refund for that amount by filing the proper form with the IRS. If the IRS denies the refund request, the taxpayer can sue the IRS in district court. The taxpayer can sue for any amount of refund in district court, no matter how small. However, because the taxpayer is usually represented by an attorney in district court, going to district court may make sense only for larger monetary disputes. 
<P>
If the IRS does not make a decision on a refund claim in six months, the taxpayer can file suit in district court. The taxpayer has up to two years after the IRS rejects a refund claim in which to file suit in district court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG><EM>U.S. Claims Court </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The federal claims court follows the same rules as the district court regarding filing lawsuits for refunds from the IRS. A taxpayer must first pay the disputed amount and then file a lawsuit in claims court for a refund of that amount. There is no minimum limit to the amount of a refund claim that can be litigated in claims court. However, the taxpayer cannot file suit in claims court if the claim is for a refund of a penalty relating to tax shelter abuse. Also, a taxpayer cannot file suit in claims court to recover a penalty assessed by the IRS for fraudulently preparing someone else's tax return.

The State of Illinois assesses taxes for income, sales, excise, motor fuel, property and gambling. Illinois offers free tax help during the tax season (January through April 15).

<P>
The state relies less on income taxes for revenue than does the federal government. Illinois' income tax is far less elaborate than the federal government's and there are fewer disputes over it. When the state does audit a taxpayer's state income tax return, the procedure is much like the procedure used in IRS income tax audits. An Illinois taxpayer who is audited may question the audit through an informal conference, followed by an administrative hearing and final review by the Illinois Board of Appeals. If you have questions regarding the specific process of an Illinois audit and appeal, contact the Board of Appeals, Illinois Department of Revenue, 100 West Randolph Street, Chicago, IL 60601-3274, phone: (312) 814-3004. 
<P>
Property taxes, which are levied, collected and spent locally, are discussed in the <A HREF="c22.html">Real Estate</A> Chapter. The Illinois Department of Revenue has no direct involvement in the appeal process of assessed value of property, upon which the property tax is based. 
<P>
The rights that Illinois taxpayers have against the Department of Revenue closely parallel the rights against the IRS. For example, the taxpayer has a right to have an attorney, accountant, or other person represent him or her at any meetings, and the taxpayer has a right to record meetings. The department must provide taxpayers with written information on their rights when they deal with the department. Illinois taxpayers have a right to sue the department. If a taxpayer wins, he or she may be able to collect damages if a court finds that the department knowingly or recklessly disregarded a state law or knowingly or recklessly failed to release a lien.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Workers' Compensation Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Each year thousands of Illinois employees suffer work-related injuries. Like many other states, Illinois has a workers' compensation system to compensate employees for accidental injuries occurring in the workplace. All employers subject to the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act must either carry workers' compensation insurance or demonstrate that they are self-insured and have the financial resources to cover any reasonably anticipated claims. Employees may obtain information about coverage from their employers or from the Illinois Industrial Commission. 
<P>
Workers' compensation law is complicated and its regulations and procedures frequently change. A worker with questions concerning workers' compensation should consult an attorney, particularly after suffering an injury. This chapter provides an outline of Illinois' workers' compensation program. Other employment issues, including discrimination against persons with disabilities, are discussed in the <A HREF="c15.html">Employment Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Workers' Compensation: The Basics </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Workers' compensation is a state program that requires employers to have insurance policies covering employees for work-related injuries. When an employee is accidentally injured on the job, the employer or the insurance company pays for medical care and lost wages due to the injury, regardless of fault. No part of the premium or benefits can be charged to employees. 
The notion of employers paying for employee work-related injuries originated in Germany during the latter half of the 19th century. Among the chief proponents of a German workers' compensation program was Bertha von Krupp of the famed German manufacturer, Krupp Works. Krupp had long believed that taking care of workers was in the best interest of business and in 1884, successfully persuaded Chancellor Otto von Bismark to support workers' compensation for all of Germany. 
<P>
Workers' compensation came to the United States in about 1910, when New York and Massachusetts adopted programs. Illinois adopted its workers' compensation program in 1911. This program is administered by the Illinois Industrial Commission. 
<P>
The advent of workers' compensation relieved injured employees from having to sue their employers to collect any sort of damages. Before workers' compensation, an employee had to prove that the employer had negligently failed to provide a safe work environment. This was often difficult and resulted in many injured workers going without compensation. Under workers' compensation, however, employees usually collect benefits regardless of fault. That is, even if an employee is responsible for his or her own accidental injury, the employee is covered by workers' compensation under most circumstances, as long as the injury occurred on the job. The main restriction to the program is that in most cases, workers' compensation benefits are the only form of remedy for workplace injuries. After receiving benefits, an injured employee may not sue his or her employer for further compensation.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Who Is Covered </STRONG></H3></A>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Employers </STRONG></H4></A>
Illinois has a two-tiered system for providing workers' compensation coverage. Certain employers are required to have coverage under the Workers' Compensation Act. This group includes all government and school agencies, as well as those who employ domestic workers in their homes at least 40 hours per week for 13 or more weeks per year. It also includes businesses that are declared to be extrahazardous. Under the law, the following businesses are extrahazardous: 
<UL>
<LI>Most manufacturing, construction and development companies 
<LI>Food and beverage providers
<LI>Beauty shops 
<LI>Mining industries 
</UL>
Certain small businesses may elect not to be covered, even if they fall generally into one of the statutory categories. 
<P>
Employers who are not automatically required to carry coverage under the Workers' Compensation Act may elect to do so voluntarily, or they may elect to be self-insured. In 1988, Illinois passed legislation that encourages businesses to apply for self-insurer status. Selection of one option does not, however, preclude an employer from changing to the other status at a later date. Regardless of the option selected, every employer must post notices in the workplace that provide employees with the name, business address, and telephone number of the person, service company, or insurance company to contact for information regarding the coverage. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Employees at Work </STRONG></H4></A>
Only employees are eligible for workers' compensation benefits. Broadly defined, an employee is anyone under oral or written appointment or contract for hire, working on a full- or part-time basis. This definition encompasses even aliens who are unlawfully employed, minors, and prisoners on work-release programs. Not included in this definition, however, are domestic workers in private homes (except those indicated above), volunteers in non-governmental entities, professional athletes, casual laborers, real estate brokers and sales representatives who work exclusively on commission, and independent contractors or anyone who is not subject to the control and direction of the employer. 
<P>
An employee's injury must arise "out of and in the course of employment" to be covered by workers' compensation. Basically, this means that the injury has to occur while the employee is involved in some activity directly related to his or her job. For example, an employee injured at the job site while performing tasks at the direction of the employer is covered. An employee who is injured on a business trip is covered as long as the employee is engaged in employment duties. Workers' compensation coverage even extends to an emergency situation in which an employee leaves work intending to save life or property. Under Illinois law, however, an employee is not covered during volunteer work-related or work-sponsored recreational events (such as sporting events, picnics, or parties) unless the employee was assigned or ordered by his or her supervisor to participate. An employee is not covered while traveling to or from the place of employment, unless the employer asks the employee to perform a special duty on the way. Employees injured during work breaks when no work is being performed also may not be covered, depending on the circumstances.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Nature of Injury </STRONG></H3></A>
Workers' compensation benefits primarily cover accidental injuries. Accidental injuries are those that happen unexpectedly, without design or plan. This includes many repetitive stress injuries such as carpal-tunnel syndrome, as well as heart attacks, strokes, or other physical problems caused by work. In addition to accidental injuries, an employee also may recover if a pre-existing physical condition is made worse by his or her work. Workers' compensation does not cover injuries caused by intentional acts of assault or aggression by an employer or a fellow employee. For those types of injuries, an employee would seek compensation in the civil courts. 
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Available Benefits </STRONG></H3></A>
Workers' compensation entitles an employee to all reasonable and necessary medical care related to the injury, to payments for lost wages, and to rehabilitation and training. Under the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act an injured employee may be eligible for some or all of the following benefits:
<UL>
<LI>Medical services, including all reasonable expenses for necessary care and treatment, which may include first aid, visits to an approved health care provider, surgery, hospital care, dental or orthodontic treatment, prescription drugs, and medical supplies ordered by an approved physician
<LI>Temporary total disability payments that provide the employee with up to two-thirds of his or her weekly wage for the time the worker is unable to work. (No compensation is payable, however, for loss of wages during the first three working days after the injury unless the employee is unable to work for 14 or more days after the date of the injury.)
<LI>Permanent total disability or disfigurement payments (up to two-thirds of the worker's salary at the time of the injury) for employees who are totally disabled, scarred, or otherwise disfigured, and unable to work again
<LI>Death benefits for burial expenses and benefits to dependents of the deceased employee in the case of fatal work-related injuries
</UL>
An employer usually cannot be made to pay for emotional distress, pain, suffering, or loss of companionship, affection, or sexual relations. Workers' compensation benefit payments are not considered income and are therefore not subject to state or federal tax.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>The Employer's Responsibilities </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
With the few exceptions described above, all Illinois employers must cover their employers with  workers' compensation insurance. The cost of premiums for compensation insurance is determined by factors such as the number of employees a business has, how safe the record of the workplace proves to be, and how much employees are paid. 
<P>
The trade-off for an employee's relatively simple route to compensation is a limit to the amount of money that can be awarded for a work-related injury. Employers who maintain workers' compensation insurance programs to cover on-the-job injuries are immune from liability unless they act intentionally to cause injury. Coverage under the act does not, however, limit a person from seeking compensation for injuries from a third party whose negligence may have contributed to the injury or death of the worker. 
<P>
Employers are prohibited from harassing, discharging, or threatening any employee for asserting a valid claim for workers' compensation benefits. It is illegal for an employer to refuse to hire or rehire an individual because he or she exercised his or her rights under the Workers' Compensation Act. It is also unlawful for an employer to refuse to hire or rehire an employee who has a disabling condition from a prior injury. However, if an employee suffers an injury that is made worse because of a condition existing prior to the time of hiring, the employer is protected from some liability under the Illinois Second Injury Law. The purpose of this law is to encourage employers to hire people who may have disabilities from a previous injury.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Reporting an Injury and Collecting Benefits </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
If an employee is injured on the job, he or she must notify the employer as soon as possible, but no later than 45 days after the date of the injury, the date when the effects of the injury first become apparent, or the date when a medical expert first discovers the injury. If the injury is from exposure to radiological material or equipment, the worker must give notice within 90 days of learning or suspecting that he or she has received an excessive dose. If the injury is related to an occupational disease, the employee must notify the employer as soon as practicable after he or she becomes aware of the disease. Failure to meet the notice requirements may threaten the employee's right to benefits. Notice may be verbal or written, and must include the approximate date and place of the accident, if known. It is recommended that, to avoid delay in processing claims, the notice also include the name, address, and telephone number of the injured employee, along with a brief description of the accident, injury, or illness. An employee gives notice by informing his or her supervisor of the injury. Notice to a fellow employee who is not a member of management is not sufficient. In cases in which the employer reasonably should have known that the injury occurred, the employer is said to have "constructive notice."  Because of the potential for overreaching by an employer, Illinois law has declared that any contract or agreement made between the employer and the employee within seven days of an injury, concerning compensation or liability for the injury, is presumed to be fraudulent. 
<P>
After receiving actual or constructive notice of the injury, an employer must promptly notify its insurance carrier or the administrator responsible for its workers' compensation program. If the injury or illness keeps the employee off work for more than three days, the employer must do one of the following: (1) start to pay the employee temporary total disability; (2) notify the employee in writing of the additional information needed to begin making payments; or (3) provide the employee with a written explanation of why benefits are being denied. The employer also must file an Employer's First Report of Injury or Illness Form with the Illinois Industrial Commission for all injuries resulting in loss of work of three days or more. These reports must be filed between the 15th and the 25th of each month. If a death has occurred, the employer must notify the Industrial Commission in writing within 48 hours of the death. The employer also must notify each injured employee of his or her right to rehabilitation services, of the locations of available public rehabilitation centers, and of any other services known to the employer. The Illinois Industrial Commission also provides employees with benefits information.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Payment of Benefits </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The employer or insurance carrier is obligated to provide necessary medical treatment. Treatment that is "medically necessary" is any medical treatment that assists the employee in recovering or helps to improve the employee's condition. Usually, this treatment ranges from diagnostic procedures to physical therapy, and may include psychiatric counseling, chiropractic care, plastic surgery, medicine, prostheses and other medical supplies, travel expenses (for travel to obtain medical treatment), and attendant or custodial care. 
<P>
An employee may select his or her own treating doctor or hospital, and should notify the employer of this selection. The employer is responsible for the costs of all first aid and emergency services, two treating physicians, surgeons or hospitals of the employee's choice, and additional care provided through referrals. After this initial treatment phase, the employee must obtain approval from the employer before seeking treatment from additional physicians or at other hospitals. If the employee is treated by non-approved providers, the employer is not required to pay. 
<P>
The employer may require a person receiving benefits under the Workers' Compensation Act to submit to a medical examination by a physician selected and paid by the employer. This exam may be required to determine the nature, extent, and possible duration of the injury and the disability compensation amounts. The employee may also be required to submit to examination by medical experts selected and paid by the employer. Refusal to submit to required examinations, or attempts to unnecessarily obstruct the exams, may result in the temporary suspension of benefit payments. Suspended payments cannot later be recovered.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>When an Employer or Carrier Refuses Benefits </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Under some circumstances, employers may refuse to pay workers' compensation benefits. An employer may refuse to pay a workers' compensation claim because he or she believes the injury was not work-related or the benefits demanded exceed those justified for the injury. Benefits also may be jeopardized if an employee fails to follow safety rules and consequently suffers injury.
When a dispute arises, two options exist to settle it. One option is to file a claim with the Illinois Industrial Commission. The Industrial Commission will appoint an arbitrator, who will conduct a hearing and issue a decision. Either party may appeal the decision to the Industrial Commission, which will review the case and may hear arguments. For employees of the State of Illinois, the decisions of the Industrial Commission are final. In all other cases, parties may appeal Industrial Commission decisions to the Illinois Circuit Court. Further appeals may be taken to the Industrial Division of the Illinois Appellate Court and, in some case, to the Illinois Supreme Court.
The second option for resolving disputes is through voluntary arbitration. This option is available when the only disputed issues involve total temporary disability, permanent partial disability, or medical expenses. Parties who submit their case to an arbitrator waive their right to review by the Industrial Commission. The arbitrator's decision is final as to the factual issues in dispute, but questions of law may be appealed to the Illinois Circuit Court. 
<P>

The Illinois Industrial Commission oversees administration of workers' compensation for the state. The Commission is located in the James R. Thompson Center, 100 Randolph Street West, Chicago, IL 60601, phone: (312) 814-6611. The commission publishes a free <STRONG>Handbook on Workers' Compensation and Occupational Diseases.</STRONG> Illinois established the Commissions Review Board to review complaints about Commissioners and Arbitrators. This board is chaired by the Chairperson of the Industrial Commission. Information about the board is available from the Illinois Industrial Commission.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H2><STRONG>Bar Associations </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER><P>
Bar associations are professional groups for attorneys. Bar associations view helping the public as an important part of their mission. The largest bar association in Illinois is the Illinois State Bar Association (ISBA). Each member of the ISBA may also belong to one of the 11 local bar associations. These associations serve their members by providing continuing legal education and a forum for discussing concerns of the legal profession. They also serve the public, providing lawyer referrals, informational booklets and pamphlets, telephone information services, and a variety of public education programs. Most of these services are available at little or no cost. <BR>
Members of the public should consider taking advantage of bar association services when they are seeking general information. Although they cannot provide legal advice, bar associations can help people decide whether to pursue a case, what actions to take, and what type of lawyer to contact. A list of bar associations and bar association referral services appear later in this appendix. <P>
The following pamphlets were prepared and published by the Illinois State Bar Association as a public service. Their purpose is to inform citizens of their legal rights and obligations. Consult your lawyer if you have questions about application of the law in a particular case.<P>
Single copies of each of the pamphlets are free to individuals. Spanish language translations are also available. For information on obtaining quantity copies, write or call the ISBA at the following:<P>

As lawyers have grown increasingly concerned about their public image, they have also expanded their efforts to reach out to the public and provide helpful services to consumers. Free information, referrals, and a variety of educational programs are only a telephone call away. Consumers seeking information would be wise to make that call as one of their first steps in pursuing a legal matter.<P>

</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

It is surprising how few businesses take an informed approach to selecting legal services. Many executives are intimidated, and do not use the same principles they use when making other major business decisions. As a result, they often make inappropriate choices and wind up unhappy. There is a right way to select and manage counsel and it does affect how satisfied a business will be with the representation it receives. Given the importance of the issues our society trusts lawyers to handle and the amount of money spent on their services, businesses have a right to be satisfied with the representation they receive.
<P>
No one should fall into the trap of believing the tired old saying that, "lawyers are all alike." Lawyers are not all alike. Every lawyer must have a four-year college degree before being admitted to law school. However, the degree can be in any area, so a particular lawyer might have a degree in English, accounting, biology, or any other academic subject. In law school, students study many required subjects but they also have the opportunity to study areas of special interest, such as environmental law, family law, or tax law. After law school, law students must pass a state bar exam to practice law in that state. The United States is broken down into many different systems of courts, known as bars. Each bar sets its own requirements for lawyers who practice there. A lawyer who is not a member of the Minnesota bar cannot practice law in Minnesota absent special permission. Bars may also have special categories of lawyers who are certified to practice in a particular area.
<P>
The businessperson who exercises care in choosing a lawyer intelligently can be satisfied because there is a right way to choose legal services and it does make a difference. The following three-step process can help businesses find the right attorney for their legal needs.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Step 1: Preparing a List </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The first step anyone faces in choosing a lawyer is to generate a list of potential prospects. This is usually an easy step. There are thousands of lawyers in Minnesota alone, and most people know of at least one lawyer to whom they could refer someone. The quality of these referrals varies greatly, however, depending on the source.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Advertising </STRONG></H3></A>
Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court lifted the ban on attorney advertising, there has been an explosion in the amount of print and broadcast advertising done by the thousands of Minnesota lawyers eager to reach new clients. However, not all forms of lawyer advertising are permitted. For example, a lawyer is never allowed to solicit business from an accident victim in the hospital unless specifically invited there by the victim. But while some forms of advertising are banned, the range of permissible forms of advertising is quite broad and can include some fairly outlandish forms of self-promotion.
<P>
Given the amount of advertising that some lawyers do, the average person could easily rattle off the names of at least a few lawyers who practice in his or her community. The trouble, of course, is that the best known attorneys are not necessarily the best practitioners of their profession. While it may be easiest to look up the section on attorneys in the phone book or call a telephone number broadcast on radio or television, it often pays to use other sources of information. A local bar association can be a source of names. Some industrial trade organizations have attorney referral networks. Of course, it is hoped that this book will be of great use in helping businesspersons find competent, peer-referred attorneys to handle their legal affairs. Consulting one or more of the lawyers listed at the end of the chapters is an excellent way to start the search for a good lawyer.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Personal Referrals </STRONG></H3></A>
Another good source of attorney names is personal referrals. Friends and relatives are often able to recommend a lawyer. Business associates may also be a good source of names. A trusted accountant, insurance agent, or employer might also be able to recommend a competent lawyer. The benefit of a recommendation from a business associate is that, unlike a recommendation from a friend or relative, accountants, insurance agents, and employers regularly consult with attorneys on a broad variety of issues and may be in a better position to steer a novice toward the best lawyer for his or her needs.
<P>
Regardless of who recommends a name, ask specific questions about the lawyer. How does the person know the lawyer? Has the person ever consulted the lawyer? If so, for what reason? What are the lawyer's strengths and weaknesses? Does he or she return phone calls promptly and keep the client informed of the process of the case? What outcome was the lawyer able to get? Is the lawyer a member of the Minnesota bar? A referral that seems promising at first may not help much if it turns out that the lawyer practices a different area of law, the lawyer is not a member of the Minnesota bar, or if the person recommending the lawyer knows very little about him or her.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Referral Services </STRONG></H3></A>
Anyone who would be more comfortable talking with someone who shares a similar background should not hesitate to seek out such an attorney. Some women may turn to other women to handle their legal affairs because they believe that another woman could empathize with the unique legal problems women face. A person of color might prefer to give business to another person of color, or someone in the gay and lesbian community might believe that a person from their community can best represent their interests. Law schools have made tremendous strides in recruiting more diverse student bodies in the past two decades and consequently, the ranks of lawyers today have swelled with competent practitioners of every race, gender, ethnicity, and lifestyle. In order to make the legal community more responsive to our changing society, several organizations have sprung up here in Minnesota that refer callers to lawyers sensitive to the needs of women, Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, gays, lesbians, and others. A person who would feel more comfortable hiring a lawyer from a particular background should not hesitate to seek out names from one of these special referral organizations. Most of these organizations have no fee associated with their services or their fees are paid by the lawyer, not the businessperson.
<P>
Once the businessperson has a list of a few potential lawyers it is time to think about the next step -- researching the attorneys on the list.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Step 2: Researching the Attorneys on the List </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once a person has gathered the names of a number of possible attorneys, there are many issues to consider. Some questions can be answered by a quick phone call to the lawyer's office but others can only be answered by talking to other people. Some of the more important issues to research about the lawyers on the list include:
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Reputation </STRONG></H3></A>
An attorney's reputation for technical skill is important, but only the individual can determine its relevance to a particular legal matter. Consider that a lawyer who has built a sterling reputation for his or her competent handling of complex litigated probate disputes may be overqualified to draft a simple will. Similarly, a lawyer whose head is full of knowledge gained from representing large corporations may need to start researching from scratch if asked to represent a small start-up company. Savvy individuals with a variety of legal concerns often employ different lawyers to work on different matters because they realize no lawyer can be all things to all people for every type of legal question. Certainly if the case involves a lot of money or the company's reputation is at stake, as is the case when a company is accused of white collar crime, then the business wants to find the very best attorney there is to handle the matter. For more routine matters, where smaller dollar amounts are at stake, a less experienced lawyer may actually be a better fit, as well as more affordable.
<P>
As important as a lawyer's technical reputation is, his or her ethical reputation may be even more important. It pays to ask around about a lawyer's ethical reputation, for a lawyer's reputation is well known among other professionals. To find out about an attorney's reputation, the individual should ask others with similar needs or problems for references -- perhaps someone who has gone through a similar situation. Lawyers should be willing to provide references or a list of past clients, and the potential client can then check with those past clients. Beware of lawyers with poor ethical reputations. The State of Minnesota maintains the Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board (520 Lafayette Road, Suite 100, St. Paul, MN 55155-4196, (612) 296-3952). The Board investigates charges of unethical conduct against attorneys and has authority to recommend disbarment. Potential clients may contact the Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board to learn if an attorney has ever been publicly disciplined. A lawyer who does not follow the rules of his or her own profession may not handle the case properly either.
<P>
Despite the considerable criticism they get in the media, lawyers are held to very high ethical standards. For every example of misconduct reported in the media, there are literally thousands of honest and reputable attorneys that will do the right and ethical thing. Putting effort into choosing a lawyer can go a long way towards eliminating the risks of retaining an unethical attorney.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Specialization </STRONG></H3></A>
Following trends in other professions, many lawyers today devote themselves to one area of law and present themselves as "experts" in that area. Because it is wise to get an attorney whose experience matches a company's particular need, many decision makers will be tempted to hire a lawyer described as an expert in his or her area of law. This may not always be the best course of action. The State of Minnesota only has certification standards for specialization in real estate and civil trials. Minnesota recognizes two national certifications for bankruptcy and criminal law. Outside these four areas, no lawyer should claim to be a specialist, specialized, or certified in any area of law, but some lawyers might use similar terminology. One attorney may call herself a tax expert because she has handled tax matters for over twenty years, while another attorney may call himself a tax expert because, although he only passed the bar last month and is still quite inexperienced, he plans to devote himself exclusively to tax matters. Clearly one expert is not equal to another. Buyer beware!
<P>
Another important point to keep in mind is that not all legal matters require the attention of a specialist. Just as one would not automatically turn to a medical specialist for a common cold, one need not turn to a legal specialist for every routine legal matter. Chances are good that if a local attorney engaged in the general practice of law has done a fine job on a variety of legal matters in the past, he or she can be counted on to handle routine legal matters in the future. Also, because most specialists will be clustered in larger cities, a business in a small community may choose to hire a generalist practicing locally for the ease and convenience of being able to work with a member of the community.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Firm Size </STRONG></H3></A>
Another important issue to consider is whether to go with a solo practitioner, a lawyer in a small firm, or a lawyer in a large firm. Recognize that in most cases it is an individual attorney who will work on a particular file and with whom the client will have the most interaction. An individual may not immediately notice a difference between a solo practitioner, a lawyer at a small firm, and a lawyer at a large firm. A solo practitioner or a lawyer practicing in a small group may be able to provide more personalized attention to a file but a larger firm can bring a depth of resources that most small firms cannot. Lawyers at large firms typically charge more for their services, however, so an individual may not want or need to pay extra for a relatively straightforward legal problem. Again, it all depends on the needs of the particular individual.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Location </STRONG></H3></A>
A lawyer's location is another obvious consideration. A lawyer in the client's hometown may not always be the best choice. If many meetings will take place in a city other than where the client lives, it may be advantageous to hire an attorney who lives in the other city. Most larger firms in Minnesota are centrally located in downtown office buildings in major cities. While these locations may provide the most convenient access to courthouses, banks, and corporate headquarters, they may not be the most convenient for the individual client. Most lawyers charge for transportation time and the time necessary for them to get to and from meetings and court appearances, so it may be wise to choose someone located near the courthouse or any other location where meetings will take place. If a particular matter will not require many meetings or trips to the courthouse, the convenience of a downtown office may be unnecessary. Of course, because nice office space downtown is usually more expensive than office space in a suburb or small town, downtown lawyers may have higher overhead expenses that they pass along to their clients.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Step 3: Interviewing the Attorneys </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once a businessperson has narrowed down his or her list to a few attorneys, he or she should then phone them individually and seek a personal consultation with each one. It is wise to ask on the phone whether the lawyer charges a fee for the initial consultation. As with any major purchase, a consumer of legal services is not obligated to hire the first attorney he or she sees.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Initial Consultation </STRONG></H3></A>
It is not reasonable for a business to expect free advice from a lawyer, but good attorneys will welcome opportunities to spend time with potential clients answering questions and being compared with their peers because they know their knowledge and experience will show through. The initial consultation is no time to be shy. Years ago, many lawyers liked to think that they were above the need to market their practice or to pursue clients. Some law firms reflexively recoiled from the suggestion that a potential client would ask them to show why their firm was the best to handle a matter. Times have changed and lawyers today are accustomed to sitting down with potential clients to discuss representation.
<P>
An initial consultation can be more productive if the individual takes contracts, photographs, other relevant documents, and a list of questions to the meeting. At the initial interview the individual should be open and honest with the attorney. It is best not to embellish or hide facts because they may dilute the strength of a case. Some facts, such as the events in dispute occurring some time ago, may make a case impossible to win because of the statute of limitations, and the lawyer can explain that any money spent pursuing the claim would be money wasted. Some facts are less damaging than the individual assumes, and the lawyer can minimize their effect by acting quickly. The attorney may feel that a conflict of interest prevents him or her from representing the client. For example, the lawyer may already represent the opposite party in a dispute. Most of what an individual tells a lawyer in an interview is confidential and protected by the attorney-client privilege.
<P>
Consulting a lawyer does not obligate the business to employ or to retain that lawyer. Most initial consultations are either free of charge or available for a nominal fee, especially if the businessperson decides not to employ the attorney consulted. Some attorneys will charge for the initial consultation if they are subsequently hired.
<P>
It is important to note an important distinction between consulting an attorney and retaining that attorney. Only retaining an attorney obligates him or her to act on behalf of the client. Many Minnesotans have learned this lesson the hard way. They thought that consulting a lawyer about their legal problem meant that their case was being handled so they stopped taking steps to pursue a claim. Meanwhile the lawyer they consulted allowed the statute of limitations to run out on the claim because the lawyer believed that he or she had not been retained to act on the client's behalf. Many legal malpractice suits have centered on whether an original office visit with a lawyer constituted a consultation or a hiring. The lesson to learn is that before leaving a lawyer's office, the individual and the lawyer should be absolutely clear whether the lawyer has or has not been hired.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Personal Chemistry </STRONG></H3></A>
So much of being a good attorney has to do with responsiveness, understanding of a client's particular situation, and the ability to communicate. The lawyer who has bad rapport with a client may not be an effective representative of the client's interests. Because each person is different, the chemistry between a client and an attorney is one of the most important elements of their relationship. Smart shoppers should ask many questions. Is the lawyer listening to the client's story or does he or she interrupt in the middle of sentences? Does she present a variety of options to pursue or does she insist there is only one right way to do everything? Does the lawyer try to dominate the conversation? Are the attorney's business philosophy and approach to risk-taking compatible with the client's attitude? Is the attorney open to working with in-house counsel to lower bills? Is this someone the client wants to spend time with? Gut feelings at this stage of the process can tell someone much about what it would be like to hire this person. After the decision is made to hire an attorney, the client has a right to expect that the attorney will spend time explaining the progress of matters he or she is working on and to involve the client at appropriate times. If the attorney is difficult to work with early on, it is a good bet the relationship will be tense later.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Malpractice Insurance </STRONG></H3></A>
It may be an uncomfortable subject to raise with an attorney whom one has just met for the first time, but it is important to determine whether he or she carries malpractice insurance. The financial losses stemming from a poorly handled case can be quite large. If the lawyer does not carry malpractice insurance, it may be impossible to recover any losses should the lawyer commit legal malpractice.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Experience </STRONG></H3></A>
Many individuals naively assume that the longer a lawyer has been in practice the more experience he or she has. This assumption is frequently unfounded. Relevant experience in a particular area of law is far more important than the total number of years that a person has practiced law. A young attorney whose practice has been narrowly focused on one area of law may have far more insight into how a problem should be handled than an attorney with more years of practice in a broad variety of legal matters. In addition, because laws change so quickly, in some cases a recent graduate may have greater knowledge of a particular area of law than a more senior attorney. The potential client should ask pointed questions about a lawyer's specific experience handling similar cases.
<P>
In some large firms, a senior partner may agree to handle a matter, then assign most of the work to less experienced associates. It pays to ask who is going to work on a file, and discuss that person's experience and his or her success in representing cases or doing similar work. Still other lawyers may be eager to take on a case in an area of law in which they have little experience, reasoning that they can simply learn the relevant law as they go along. Not having experience in the relevant area of law need not rule out a lawyer. A lawyer inexperienced in one area of law may still be a terrific choice to handle a case, but it is appropriate to ask how long it will take the lawyer to learn the relevant laws and whether the client is expected to pay for the educational time.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Estimate of Time </STRONG></H3></A>
The lawyer ought to be able to estimate a timetable for completing the case. This will depend on many variables, including the complexity of the matter, whether the lawyer expects to go to trial, how cooperative all parties are, and the lawyer's workload. Asking for a timetable is likely to bring a number of these issues out into the open. A relatively simple matter may take a long time to complete if a particular lawyer is too busy to devote his or her full attention to it. A lawyer with very little experience may reveal that inexperience if he or she cannot describe the steps necessary to complete a task and estimate how long each will take.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Cost </STRONG></H3></A>
Money should be discussed at the initial meeting with an attorney. It is important to know what will and what will not be charged and at what rates. Although a lawyer may not be able to give an exact cost, most lawyers with experience should be able to provide a ballpark estimate of their fees.
<P>
An individual should not feel uncomfortable comparison shopping for a lawyer. Hiring an attorney can be a major outlay of resources so, like any other expenditure, a businessperson should find out such details as how and how often bills are sent out, whether the firm requires a retainer, and whether the firm has minimum billing increments. Find out how often the lawyer sends out status reports about a case or matter. Finally, as with any business arrangement, get your agreement in writing. Lawyers have several different ways that a client may pay the fees for their services:
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Flat Fees </STRONG></H4></A>
The simplest fee payment option is the flat fee. A lawyer charging a flat fee simply quotes a fee for which he or she will do the work. Flat rates were traditionally quite rare. A lawyer often has no way of knowing for certain how complex a matter is until investigating it and can be understandably adverse to committing to a flat fee in advance. Recently the flat fee has been growing in popularity. Much of this growth is client-driven and stems from clients' desire to better predict and control the rising cost of legal representation. Today, lawyers are increasingly willing to discuss the possibility of a flat fee for relatively simple legal matters such as regulatory compliance filings or friendly acquisitions. The client should bear in mind, however, that some lawyers who advertise low flat fees for simple matters rarely ever find that a client has a simple matter. Sometimes the low advertised flat fees are merely a ploy to get a potential client in the door in hopes that, once in the office, the client can be convinced that his or her needs are actually far more complex and therefore justify much higher fees.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG>Hourly Rates </STRONG></H4></A>
For many matters a lawyer will charge an hourly rate for time spent on a file. The hourly rate is usually a reflection of the lawyer's competence, experience, and overhead expenses. The lowest hourly rate is not necessarily the best deal for the business. An experienced lawyer with higher rates will usually be able to complete a matter more quickly than a less experienced lawyer with lower rates. A common complaint about hourly rates is that they give the lawyer no incentive to handle a matter in a timely fashion. After all, who wants to work quickly and efficiently if it means making less money? Paying for legal services at hourly rates is a time-honored tradition at American law firms which is unlikely to disappear soon, and can unfortunately open the door to much disagreement over how long it should have taken a lawyer to complete a task. Because law firms are under increasing pressure from clients to hold down their bills, today many attorneys are willing to discuss "blended rates," an arrangement whereby a partner's billing rate is blended with an associate's lower billing rate. Before agreeing to hire a lawyer to work for an hourly rate, it is appropriate to request a written estimate of the hours that will be needed, as well as an estimate of how much money will be necessary for miscellaneous expenses.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="200"><H4><STRONG>Retainer Fees </STRONG></H4></A>
There are actually two kinds of retainer fees used in the legal community. The first is a variation of the flat fee. Rather than paying a lawyer a flat fee to handle a specific matter, some wealthy individuals or large corporations will simply pay an attorney a lump sum each year to retain that attorney for the year. In return for this kind of retainer fee, the lawyer agrees to be on call for any legal problems that arise or to manage routine day-to-day legal affairs. The average business does not have a sufficient volume of legal questions to require this type of set-up.
<P>
The more common retainer fee is actually just an advance on the hourly rate, described above. If it is the first time that a lawyer has represented a particular client or if there is any question about the client's ability to pay, the lawyer may insist upon the payment of a large retainer up front. This money is then placed in a special account and the costs of legal services provided are deducted from that account. A client who agrees to pay this type of retainer is still entitled to periodic written statements detailing how much has been deducted from the account for legal services and, of course, the client is entitled to any money remaining in the account when legal representation has been concluded.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="210"><H4><STRONG>Contingent Fees </STRONG></H4></A>
Another common legal fee arrangement is the contingent fee. Years ago, contingent fees were unheard of in the business context, but today more businesses are seeking these agreements from their legal counsel. The contingent fee is most common among personal injury attorneys who charge for their services by taking a percentage (the going rate is one-third) of whatever damages are recovered or the amount of money saved for the client, whether through an out-of-court settlement or a jury award. The percentage that a lawyer asks for depends on the difficulty of the issues, the amount of money at stake, and the skill and experience of the attorney. Essentially, when an individual asks a lawyer to take a case on a contingency basis, the lawyer is being asked to gamble on the outcome of the case. A case with only a very slight chance of success can consume a great deal of the lawyer's time and energy and yield no fee if the case is lost. In that case, an individual may need to offer a lawyer a larger percentage of the award in order to convince him or her to take that risk. Conversely, an individual with a case that is very likely to result in a large award and that presents few procedural difficulties may be able to bargain down the contingent fee to a smaller percentage of the award.
<P>
A person may be better off with a more experienced attorney because, although the fee will be higher, so will the award. If a less experienced attorney handles a lawsuit, and wins a $300,000 award, the client keeps $200,000 and the lawyer gets $100,000. But if an attorney whose superior legal talents result in an award of $600,000, the client keeps $400,000 and the attorney gets $200,000. Hiring the less experienced attorney would therefore cost the business the extra $200,000 it would have received if the more experienced lawyer had handled the case.
<P>
There are several reasons to be especially careful when hiring a lawyer to work on a contingent fee basis. Many law firms specializing in these kinds of cases make their money by handling a large number of cases and settling them quickly. Given the typical contingent fee arrangement, some lawyers are motivated to accept early settlement offers.
<P>
By settling early, these firms make a lot of money very quickly. This tactic is popular with some lawyers as they take a cut of the settlement at a time when they have few expenses and because they have not spent the time and money to fully prepare a case. Be wary of such firms. The client has the right to refuse any settlement offer made and should consider doing so, especially if the case is a strong one that may cause a jury to award a large sum of money. Remember that the law gives an individual only one chance to make a case before a jury. Only under very special circumstances can someone go back to court to ask a jury for more money just because the original award money ran out after a period of several years.
<P>
Although contingent fee agreements are quite popular with some attorneys, they are inappropriate in some types of cases, and ethics rules forbid lawyers from accepting contingent fee arrangements in criminal cases and some divorce cases.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="220"><H4><STRONG>Variable Contingent Fees </STRONG></H4></A>
A third payment option becoming fairly popular among some lawyers is the variable contingent fee arrangement. In this situation, the attorney's fees vary depending upon when the case is settled. Typical arrangements specify that the attorney collects 20 percent if the case settles before initiating a formal lawsuit, 25 percent if the case settles within a year after a lawsuit is filed, and 33 percent of any damage award received any time after a year. With this type of arrangement, the lawyer has an incentive not to settle too early because the fee will be greater if a larger settlement can be won by going to trial.
<P>
It is wise to clarify the exact terms of a variable contingent fee arrangement before signing it. Almost all contingent fee agreements stipulate that the attorney's expenses are first deducted from any award won, and the remainder of the money is then split on the one-third/two-thirds basis. Thus the statement common in the advertisements of many lawyers, "no fee unless we win your case," does not mean that a client pays nothing for legal representation. A lawyer's fee will be a percentage of any award and therefore may be nothing, but win or lose, a client is almost always responsible for the attorney's costs. A client must make sure, therefore, that he or she fully understands what kinds of costs he or she is expected to pay before signing a contingent fee agreement. In an attempt to eliminate any misunderstanding about this, in 1993 the Minnesota Supreme Court changed the Lawyers' Rules of Professional Conduct to require attorneys who intend to charge fees to cover their expenses to disclose that fact in their advertisements.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="230"><H4><STRONG>Miscellaneous Expenses </STRONG></H4></A>
Many disputes that clients have with lawyers over money stem from a misunderstanding of the difference between "fees" and "expenses." Regardless of which of the types of fee plans discussed above a client chooses, most lawyers will charge for their expenses in addition to their fees and regardless of the outcome of the case. Many a contingent fee client, lured by an attorney claiming, "no fees unless we recover for you," has been shocked to find out, after failing to recover any money on their claim, that they owe money to their lawyer. The client may indeed pay no fees unless the case is successful but may still be responsible for sizable expenses incurred handling the case, regardless of its outcome. For example, an attorney might charge for travel time, secretarial overtime, delivery services, court costs, filing fees, deposition fees, expert witness fees, investigation expenses, and the initial consultation. Many law firms bill incidentals such as photocopying and postage at rates far higher than what those services would cost at an independent copy center or post office, so it is important to discuss specific details. Also ask about referral fees. Some lawyers refer clients only to other lawyers who will split the fees with them. Thus the individual who employs a lawyer referred by another lawyer may be inadvertently paying for two attorneys but getting the services of only one.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="240"><H2><STRONG>Benefits of the Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The point of this three-step process is to educate businesses to become more sophisticated consumers of legal services, including referral services. The three-step process described above should begin with a list of names and, after diligent research and meetings, conclude with one name standing out among the others as the best choice. A decision maker should be able to cross some names off the list before actually meeting the lawyers, because after researching the names it will become apparent that some attorneys are inappropriate for the legal matter at hand. It is even possible that every name on the list will be crossed off for one reason or another, and the businessperson will have to return to step one and seek more names. For example, if it becomes apparent that a particular legal matter will require the services of a lawyer who litigates matters regularly in a courtroom and all of the attorneys on the list rarely see the inside of a courtroom, a businessperson should go back to a referral agency or to this book and specifically look for names of lawyers whose practices include litigation.
<P>
Unless the business is under extreme pressure to resolve a legal matter immediately, it is far better to spend time in choosing a good lawyer than to try and undo a poor decision later. If a businessperson chooses well, the job of working with counsel should be far easier. It is always the prerogative of the client to change lawyers before a legal matter has been concluded, but doing so can be costly and time consuming. If a client fires his or her attorney before a matter is settled, the attorney is owed for the reasonable value of the time that has been spent on the matter, even if a contingent fee agreement stated that the attorney would be paid only if the case were won. All of the files on the matter belong to the client and must be turned over to the client on termination of the lawyer's services.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Contract Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

A contract is a legally binding agreement between parties to do or not do something. Businesses need to enter into contracts for many reasons, so a businessperson should have a good understanding of contract law to succeed in business. There are several factors to look at to determine whether a contract has been made. Once a contract has been created, it must be determined if there are any issues that call into question its validity. Finally, if there has been a breach of the contract, there is a question of whether damages have occurred.
<P>
This chapter summarizes the elements of a contract, who can enter into contracts on behalf of a company, factors that may affect validity of a contract, and recovering damages if a contract is breached. One should always read and understand a document before agreeing to be held to its contents. Before a businessperson enters into a contract with major implications, he or she should consult an attorney experienced in the subject matter of the contract. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Contract Components </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There are three elements that must be present for a contract to exist: an offer, acceptance, and consideration.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Offer </STRONG></H3></A>
The first step to a contract is an offer. An offer is a statement, written or spoken, by a party of his or her intention to be held to a commitment upon acceptance of the offer. Many a business owner has gotten into a legal dispute because, during negotiations, a customer believed an offer had been made when the businessperson believed the parties were still only discussing possible options. A businessperson should carefully consider whether his or her statements or the statements of other parties constitute offers. There are a number of factors to look at to determine whether a statement constitutes an offer.
<UL>
<LI>Is the person making the offer serious? A business executive who jokingly states that he or she will sell a successful business in exchange for a good bottle of single malt scotch is not making an offer. On the other hand, a business executive who writes up an offer on a bar napkin may be perfectly serious. A court will look at the context in which the statement was made to determine whether it was a valid offer.
<LI>Does the statement show a willingness of the party to be held to its contents? A person requesting a price quote or opening negotiations is not making an offer. An advertisement is usually viewed as an invitation to an offer rather than an offer itself.
<LI>Does the statement contain definite terms with regard to the subject matter? Is the subject matter identified, are parties identified, is the price set, are quantities determined, and is time for performance stated? There should be enough information contained in the statement that, if needed, a court would be able to enforce the contract or determine the damages.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Acceptance </STRONG></H3></A>
The second requirement for a valid contract is acceptance of the offer. In order for an acceptance of an offer to be effective, it must be made while the offer is still open. In some situations, the company making the offer gives a definite time frame (My company will sell you this computer software for $2000 but you must decide whether to buy it within two days). Other ways an offer may end include: the person making the offer withdraws the offer, the person who receives the offer rejects it, or reasonable time passes after the offer is made. If the subject matter of the offer is destroyed before acceptance, the offer terminates.
<P>
Unless an offer specifies otherwise, an offer can be accepted though the mail. An important rule known as the "mailbox rule" says that an acceptance is effective once it is put in the mailbox. If the offeror attempts to withdraw the offer after the acceptance is mailed but before it is received, the person accepting the offer can hold the offeror to the contract. For this reason, anyone making an offer should be aware that it might be accepted, by means of the mailbox rule, before the offeror knows of the acceptance. This can cause problems for the original offeror if he or she assumed the offer was rejected and found another buyer. To avoid possible confusion, some businesses will specify in an offer that acceptance of the offer is only effective upon receipt of the acceptance.
<P>
If a person changes the conditions of an offer in responding to the offer, the offer is rejected and the changed conditions constitute a counteroffer (I want to buy the software, but I will pay only $1500 for it). In this scenario, the person who made the original offer can respond to the counteroffer by accepting or rejecting it, or proposing yet another offer.
<P>
There are two ways a person can accept an offer, either by promising to do something, or by performing the desired act. In the first type, a customer promises to pay $2000 for computer software. This is a bilateral contract. In the second type, a business owner offers a contractor $1000 to replace ceiling tiles and the contractor replaces the tiles; the contractor accepted the offer by performing the act requested. This is a unilateral contract.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Consideration </STRONG></H3></A>
Consideration is a legal concept which describes something of value that is given in exchange for a performance or a promise to perform. The presence of consideration distinguishes contracts from gifts. Consideration can be a promise to do something there is no legal obligation to do, or a promise to not do something there is a legal right to do. Promises to exchange money, goods, or services are forms of consideration. All parties in an agreement must give consideration in order to create a contract, but courts typically do not look at the adequacy of consideration unless there is evidence of some type of wrongdoing by the party benefiting most from the contract.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Defenses to Contract </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once it is determined that there is a contract, it must be determined whether there are any defenses that call into question the validity of the contract. There are some defenses that make the contract unenforceable (void) and other defenses that may give the parties the option to enforce the contract or not (voidable).
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Legality of the Contract </STRONG></H3></A>
Although two persons may exchange an offer, acceptance, and consideration, if the subject matter of the contract is illegal, an enforceable contract does not exist. For example, if a person offers to pay another person money for illegal drugs, this is a void contract.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Capacity of the Parties </STRONG></H3></A> 
In order to be bound to a contract, the parties must be competent to enter into the legal arrangement. Underage persons, persons who are mentally ill, and intoxicated persons are usually not bound by the contracts they enter. However, a minor may have the option of enforcing a contract.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Agency  </STRONG></H3></A>
A business may challenge the validity of a contract by alleging that the person who signed for the company was not an agent of the company and therefore had no authority to act on the company's behalf. Agency is the legal status in which one person, the agent, has authority to conduct business for another party, the principal. Unless their businesses are very small, most business owners must rely on other people to conduct business and enter into contracts on behalf of their businesses. Because principals are bound by contracts entered into by their agents, business operators should be familiar with the laws of agency.
<P>
An agent's authority to enter into contracts on behalf of the business can be actual, implied, or apparent. Actual authority is authority that the principal has intentionally given to an agent who has accepted it. The clearest example of creating actual authority is when a business owner hires someone to negotiate purchases for the company. Implied authority results because of the agent's relationship with the principal or the principal's business, from custom, or by acquiescence. For example, a principal might not have intentionally authorized an employee to make credit purchases for the business, but if the principal has repeatedly paid off debts incurred by the employee, he or she may inadvertently have created implied authority in that employee. Apparent authority can result when the principal acts in a way that would cause third parties reasonably to assume that the agent had authority. For example if a business owner is aware than an employee is claiming authority to act on behalf of the business, the principal may have an obligation to clarify that the employee is not authorized to enter into a contract on behalf of the business.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Mistake, Duress, and Fraud </STRONG></H3></A>
A mutual mistake by both parties to a contract on an important issue makes the contract unenforceable. However, a mistake by only one party does not necessarily make the contract void.
<P>
Duress is the use of force or pressure by one party to make the other party agree to the contract. The force does not have to be physical -- one could be put under mental duress. The use of duress makes the contract voidable by the party under duress.
<P>
Fraud is the intentional misrepresentation of an important issue of the contract. The presence of fraud in a contractual proceeding makes the contract voidable by the party upon whom the fraud was perpetrated.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Statute of Frauds </STRONG></H3></A>
Contracts, in many instances, do not have to be in writing to be legally binding. However, a rule known as the Statute of Frauds requires that some contracts must be written to be valid. Contracts involving the sale of real estate, contracts concerning the sale of goods worth more than $500, contracts that cannot be performed within one year, contracts to pay off someone else's debts, leases for more than one year, and contracts concerning a marriage must be in writing.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Parol Evidence Rule </STRONG></H3></A>
Although not a defense to a contract, the parol evidence rule may affect the contents of a contract and how a contract is enforced. The parol evidence rule applies once parties have come to a final, written contract. Once there is a final, written contract between the parties, the parol evidence rule forbids the introduction in a court proceeding of any previous agreements between the parties on the subject matter of the contract. The parol evidence rule permits the judge or jury in a contract dispute to look only at the written contract and not at any previous discussions between the parties. The impact of the parol evidence rule is that all factors that are important to the agreement and that have been decided by the parties should be stated in the final, written contract. The parol evidence rule does not forbid the introduction of subsequent agreements between the parties.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Contract Termination </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once there is a valid contract between parties, it can end in several ways. A contract may have a limited time span and finish at the end of the stated time. If a person is hired to work for two weeks, the contract concludes at the end of two weeks. In many instances in which there is a specific time frame stated in the contract, parties to the contract may have the option to extend the contract for a longer period of time. Contracts may also be project, not time, specific. Goods or services may be contracted for a project and upon the completion of the project, the contract for these goods or services ends. Parties to a contract may mutually agree to rescind the contract. In that case, the parties may agree on the duties and responsibilities of each party after the rescission. 
<P>
A contract also may end because of a breach. A breach occurs when a person does not fulfill his or her responsibilities as promised in the contract. A breach may be minor or major. A minor breach is one that affects small, minor details of the agreement and may not affect the outcome of the contract. However, a major breach is one that does affect the subject matter of the contract and may affect the outcome of the contract. This is also known as a breach of a material issue. When there has been a breach in a contract, the question of damages is raised.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Damages </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The damages due to a party when there is a contract breach depend on many factors, including: which party breaches, what damages were incurred, what the contract states with regard to damages, whether the breach is material or not, and the subject matter of the contract. When a person is harmed by a breach, courts usually award only foreseeable damages. Foreseeable damages are those damages that the parties anticipate or should anticipate at the time the contract is formed.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Money Damages </STRONG></H3></A>
In most cases when an injury results from a contract breach, the injured party receives money damages. The court places the person in the position he or she would have been in if the contract had been performed. For example, if a business owner contracts with a roofer to put a new roof on a warehouse for $50,000, the roofer might stop in the middle of the job and refuse to finish the new roof. If the business owner finds another roofer to finish the job at an additional cost of $15,000, the damages are $15,000.
<P>
Although a person is normally entitled to the money difference between what was promised and what it costs to complete the promise, the injured party must mitigate to collect damages. Mitigation means the injured party takes reasonable steps to limit the extent of the injury and finish the job. In the previous example, the business owner must make reasonable efforts to find another party to finish the roof and must take reasonable steps to protect inventory in the warehouse from exposure due to the lack of a roof. If the business owner refuses to look for another roofer and consequently inventory in the warehouse is ruined, the breaching roofer will probably be able to successfully defend against paying for the cost of the ruined goods.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Specific Performance </STRONG></H3></A>
There are some situations in which money damages are inadequate. Typically in a contract involving the sale of land, awarding money damages for a breach does not put the nonbreaching party in the same position he or she would have been if the contract had been fulfilled. Because real estate is unique, one cannot simply go out and buy property that is the same as originally contracted. In a case such as this, the court may order the breaching party to perform the duties required by the contract. This remedy is called specific performance. Specific performance courts only order in the rare cases in which the subject matter of the contract is unique, and it is difficult to put a monetary amount on the damage incurred as a result of the breach. Specific performance is not awarded in personal service contracts. In the previous example, the court would not order the original roofer to complete the job.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Liquidated Damages </STRONG></H3></A>
In an attempt to set a monetary damage amount in a case in which it may be difficult, the parties may include a provision that specifies the amount of damages in event of a breach. Such predetermined damages are called liquidated damages. An example is when a company puts down earnest money for space in a mall and later decides not to open a store at the mall. In a real estate contract with a liquidated damage provision, the business owner may forfeit the earnest money to the mall owners as a damage award.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Rescission </STRONG></H3></A>
In most contract disputes, a court puts the nonbreaching party in the position he or she would have been in if the contract had not been breached. However, there are times when the court may place the party in the position he or she was in before the contract was executed. This remedy is known as rescission. In cases in which there was a mutual mistake on the subject matter of the contract, the parties may be returned to their positions before the contract. If the parties have exchanged goods or money, those items are returned to the other party. This remedy may also be selected in cases in which one party intentionally misrepresents a material fact.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Mandatory Arbitration and Forum Selection </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Parties to a contract will often agree in advance to arbitrate any disputes arising from the contract rather than going to court. Arbitration agreements usually specify that each party chooses one arbitrator and a third arbitrator is chosen by the first two arbitrators. Mandatory arbitration can save time and money, but a business owner may want to have an attorney review the mandatory arbitration clause before signing a contract that includes one. Arbitration is discussed more fully in the <A HREF="b05.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter.
<P>
Parties may also choose to include a forum selection clause in a contract. A forum selection clause stipulates that any legal action stemming from the contract will be brought in a particular court and that a particular jurisdiction's laws will govern. With a forum selection clause, an Minnesota business might be able to insure that it could defend itself in an Minnesota court applying Minnesota laws against any lawsuit arising from the contract. Such a clause could save the Minnesota business time and money should any disputes arise.

<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Minnesota's Legal &amp; Judicial System
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

It may be useful for a person thinking about initiating a legal action to understand the legal and judicial system that exists in Minnesota. One of the most confusing aspects of the judicial system is that there are two separate systems: state and federal. The majority of cases are filed in state courts. This chapter discusses the state and federal systems and summarizes the jurisdictions of both. The <A HREF="b04.html">Process of a Lawsuit</A> Chapter outlines how a case goes through the state civil and criminal process. Claims that arise on Native American lands may be subject to tribal courts and not the state or federal courts.
<P>
As one may remember from civics class, there are three branches of government: legislative, executive, and judicial. The legislative branch creates the laws, the executive branch enforces the laws, and the judicial branch interprets the laws. Laws are also called statutes or codes. The executive branch can create rules or regulations to govern its administrative procedures and the judicial branch may also interpret these regulations.
<P>
When a case is brought before a court, the court applies the law to the facts of the case and a decision is made. There are many sources of law the court uses in making its decision: the Constitutions of both the United States and the State of Minnesota, statutes, regulations and prior decisions of its own or of other higher courts (case law). The way in which a higher court answers a legal question is binding on all other lower courts within that jurisdiction when faced with the same legal question. For example, if the Minnesota Supreme Court decides a legal question, all state courts in Minnesota must follow that decision. However, state courts in Wisconsin would not have to follow the Minnesota decision because they are in a different jurisdiction.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Representation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Perhaps the first question a businessperson may ask is, "Do I really need a lawyer to handle my legal affairs?" The best answer is almost always yes. Occasionally, a business is able to rely on non-lawyers to handle some legal matters. For example, some companies hire paralegals to draft routine contracts. For most legal matters, however, hiring a lawyer is essential. Obviously, when a business is sued or thinking of bringing a lawsuit, the business should have an attorney representing its interests. In rare instances, a businessperson may be permitted to represent himself or herself. For example, a landlord can appear in conciliation court without a lawyer. In the majority of cases, however, a company hires counsel to represent itself and in some cases, must be represented by counsel.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Jurisdiction </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
When a person decides to file a legal action, he or she must decide in which court system to file the case. The court in which a person files a case depends on which court has jurisdiction over such cases. Jurisdiction determines whether a particular court has the power and authority to decide a case. This is subject matter jurisdiction. If a court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, it may not decide a case. A court must also have personal jurisdiction over the defendant in a case. There are different ways to have personal jurisdiction, including if a defendant resides or has a business within the court's geographical region. For example, a Minnesota plaintiff cannot bring an action in Minnesota district court against a defendant who lives and works in another state, if that defendant has no contact with the state of Minnesota. Jurisdiction is set in law, constitutions, or case law. It is possible to have courts with overlapping jurisdiction and a person has a choice of in which court to file an action.
<P>
There are three types of subject matter jurisdiction: exclusive, general, and limited. Exclusive jurisdiction means that only a particular court can decide a case. An example of exclusive subject matter jurisdiction is bankruptcy court. Only in a federal bankruptcy court can a person file a bankruptcy action. State courts have no jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases. General jurisdiction means that a court has the ability to hear and decide a wide range of cases. Unless a law or constitutional provision denies it jurisdiction, a court of general jurisdiction can handle any kind of case. The Minnesota district courts are general jurisdiction courts. Limited jurisdiction means that a court has restrictions on the cases it can decide. Conciliation court is a court of limited jurisdiction because it can only hear and decide cases which claim damages of $7500 or less.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Venue </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Venue is frequently confused with jurisdiction. While jurisdiction asks whether a court system has authority to hear a case, venue asks which court within a jurisdiction should hear and decide a case. In Minnesota, a case is usually brought in the county in which the claim originates or where one or more defendants resides. For example, if a person is hit by a car in Duluth, and the car was driven by a person from St. Paul, an action against the driver could be filed in either St. Louis County (Duluth) or in Ramsey County (St. Paul). Change of venue can be requested by either of the parties. For example, a corporate defendant in Rochester might request a change of venue to Moorhead because adverse publicity in Rochester makes it impossible for the corporation to get a fair trial in Rochester or because most of its files are located in Moorhead. The defendant could not request that the trial be moved to Milwaukee because the Wisconsin court lacks jurisdiction.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>State and Federal Courts </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As previously mentioned, there are two separate court systems: state and federal. Which court system a person enters depends on a number of factors: whether a court has exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, the amount of damages involved, and the locations of the parties in the case.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>State Courts </STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota has three levels to its court system: district courts, the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court. There are two special courts which are not in the judicial system and were created by the executive branch to address specific areas -- Tax Court and Workers' Compensation Court.
<P>
Minnesota has divided its 87 counties into ten judicial districts. Each judicial district is composed of anywhere from one to 17 counties. Each district court hears cases in each county within its district at some time. As previously mentioned, the district court has general subject matter jurisdiction and handles a wide variety of cases, both civil and criminal. The district courts are courts of original jurisdiction, that is, cases start there. That is where trials are held, witnesses testify, evidence is presented, and judgments are rendered. Depending on the size of the district, some have created specific divisions to handle certain matters such as probate and family. Conciliation court is a division of district court and appeals from conciliation court are heard there. A person who loses a case in district court may appeal the decision. Appeals from district court are typically brought to the Minnesota Court of Appeals.
<P>
The Minnesota Court of Appeals was created in 1983 to assist the Minnesota Supreme Court with its workload. Unlike the district courts which hear trials with witnesses, jurors, and evidence, the Court of Appeals' primary function is to determine whether there has been an error at the district court level, and if so, to remedy it. The Court of Appeals reviews the transcript from the district court and may also consider written and oral arguments. The Court of Appeals can reverse or affirm a district court ruling or send it back to the district court for additional action. The Court of Appeals hears most appeals from the district courts unless the law specifically states that a particular appeal goes directly to the Minnesota Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals is made up of 16 judges who are divided into rotating three-judge panels. These panels travel throughout the state hearing appeals. Appeals from this court are sent to the Minnesota Supreme Court.
<P>
The Minnesota Supreme Court is the highest court in the state. Like the Court of Appeals, it does not hold trials but reviews transcripts, takes written and oral arguments, and determines whether there has been an error at the district court level. It may also reverse, affirm, or remand a case. The Supreme Court is the rule-making body for the state courts and has administrative responsibility for the operation of the state court system. The Minnesota Supreme Court is composed of seven justices who hear appeals in St. Paul. A Minnesota Supreme Court decision is a final decision in Minnesota and may be appealed to the United States Supreme Court only if there is a federal issue involved.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Federal Courts </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal court system hears both civil and criminal cases and is also broken down into three levels. There are generally three ways a case can be filed in federal court: the case involves a federal law, the case raises a question of United States Constitution interpretation, or the case involves parties from more than one state and the amount in question is more than $50,000.
<P>
The federal government has divided the United States into federal judicial districts. The state of Minnesota makes up one federal judicial district. The federal district court for Minnesota has offices in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Duluth. Like the state district courts, the federal district court holds trials in cases over which it has jurisdiction. Appeals from the federal district court go to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.
<P>
Included in the federal system is the bankruptcy court. Federal bankruptcy courts have exclusive jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters. There are four bankruptcy court offices in Minnesota -- Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth, and Fergus Falls.
<P>
The federal government groups the United States' federal judicial districts into circuits, and each circuit has a court of appeals. Minnesota is in the Eighth Circuit along with Arkansas, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals hears the appeals from federal district courts within the circuit. As in the Minnesota Court of Appeals, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals does not try cases, but only reviews cases from lower courts within the circuit. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has an office in St. Paul and its main office in St. Louis, Missouri. Appeals from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals are heard at the United States Supreme Court.
<P>
The United States Supreme Court hears appeals from the circuit courts of appeal and state supreme courts, and other cases in which it has jurisdiction -- cases between states, for example. The court is made up of nine justices and is based in Washington, D.C. The Supreme Court has very broad discretion to decide which cases it will review and only a small percentage of the cases appealed to the United States Supreme Court are actually heard. As with other appellate courts, the refusal to hear an appeal lets stand the lower court's ruling.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Process of a Lawsuit
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The American legal system uses an adversary model to settle disputes. This model allows opposing parties to present their cases to an impartial third party who renders a decision. The adversary process determines the facts of the case, determines the governing law, applies the law to the facts, and provides a judgment.
<P>
Our legal system makes several distinctions between civil and criminal cases. Civil cases resolve private conflicts between people, businesses, and the government. Criminal cases involve the enforcement of a law by the government. Most lawsuits, whether civil or criminal, are resolved before trial. Disputes may be resolved before any legal action is filed, after legal action is filed in court, or while a trial is in process but before the judge or jury renders a decision. Most cases have to be filed within the time limits set by law. These limits are known as the statutes of limitation. The time limitations vary depending on the type of legal claim filed. If a case is not filed within the time period set by law, one loses the right to file a lawsuit.
<P>
This chapter outlines the process of a case through the civil and criminal court system. It also outlines the trial process. Finally, it discusses the use of conciliation court.
<P>
The <A HREF="b03.html">Minnesota's Legal &amp; Judicial System</A> Chapter discusses the state and federal court systems in Minnesota. Also, see specific subject matter chapters for more information, including the <A HREF="b14.html">Criminal Law</A> Chapter and the <A HREF="b26.html">Personal Injury Defense Law</A> Chapter. The <A HREF="b05.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter discusses options for resolving disputes outside the courtroom.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Civil Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Civil cases make up the majority of cases filed. Examples of civil cases include personal injuries and contract disputes. In civil cases where damage is done to a party, that party can claim money damages. However, depending on the case, a party may ask for something other than money damages. For a discussion of damages in contract disputes, see the <A HREF="b02.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter. A person may ask the court to issue an injunction against another party. An injunction bars a person from doing a specific act. The court may issue a restraining order restricting the defendant's actions until the case is resolved. For example, if a person signs a contract to buy a house from the homeowner and the owner turns around and sells the house for a second time to another person, the first buyer may ask the court to restrain the seller from completing the sale to the second buyer until the case between the first buyer and the seller is resolved.
<P>
On rare occasions, civil cases may be filed as class actions. Class actions arise when there is a common question of law and fact for a large number of persons. There is a special process to go through to establish a class action. This certification process can be lengthy. Recent examples of class actions brought in Minnesota include breast implant cases and real estate dual agency cases.
<P>
The burden of proof in a civil case is on the party who initiates the case, the plaintiff. The plaintiff must prove his or her case by a preponderance of evidence. This means that the party in a case who presents the more convincing evidence wins the case. The plaintiff's evidence must be more convincing than the evidence presented by the opposing party, the defendant.
<P>
Civil juries may include only six jurors and are not required to reach a unanimous verdict. If five of the six jurors agree on a case resolution, it may be enough for a verdict. A person is limited to bringing one legal action for damages arising from the same circumstances.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Civil Pretrial Process </STRONG></H3></A>
As previously mentioned, a civil case is a private dispute between two or more parties. The following is an outline of the steps one may take if a civil action is filed in a Minnesota district court.
<P>
The plaintiff has his or her attorney prepare a document called a complaint. The complaint states what the dispute is about, why the defendant is responsible, and asks the court to take a stated action, such as awarding damages. The complaint, along with a summons, is delivered to the party against whom the action has been filed. A summons is a written order stating that a defendant must answer the plaintiff's complaint. There are several procedural requirements for serving a summons. The party served is the defendant. The defendant has a specific period of time to respond to the complaint. The defendant's written response is an answer. The answer admits or denies allegations in the complaint, states any defenses to the plaintiff's complaint, and asks the court to decide in favor of the defendant. The defendant may also state any claims he or she has against the plaintiff. These claims by the defendant against the plaintiff are called counterclaims. The plaintiff is given a specific period in which to respond to the defendant's counterclaims. If the defendant does not respond to the complaint, the plaintiff can win the case by default. The complaint, answer, and any counterclaims are called the pleadings. These documents are eventually filed in district court.
<P>
If it appears that based on all the information presented, one side clearly has the advantage, that side will often file a motion for summary judgment, which requests that the judge rule in favor of the moving party if the judge decides that there is no triable issue of fact. At this same time one party may file a motion to dismiss the case. There are a number of grounds on which a party may move to dismiss a case. For example, a party may claim the court does not have jurisdiction, or that the action was brought too late under the statute of limitations, which vary in length depending on the type of case in Minnesota.
<P>
There are several steps before a case goes to trial. To assist the parties in preparing their cases and learning about the other side's case, a process called discovery occurs. During discovery, each side may ask the other to answer written questions (interrogatories), provide copies of documents, or answer questions orally under oath (deposition). If the defendant is a corporation or partnership it must designate someone to speak on its behalf. A deposition is usually held in an attorney's office and recorded by a stenographer. A deposition can be used to impeach a witness during the trial if testimony at trial is different from the testimony given at the deposition. Each side may also make motions to the court asking it to settle legal questions that arise.
<P>
During this pretrial process, a settlement may be arranged. Over 90 percent of the civil cases filed in Minnesota state courts are settled without ever going to trial. Since July 1, 1994, civil litigants in Minnesota and their attorneys have been required to consider the possibility of settling a lawsuit through a process known as alternative dispute resolution (ADR). For more information regarding the ADR process, see the <A HREF="b05.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter. If a settlement is not arranged during the pretrial process, the parties proceed to trial. An outline of the trial process follows the Criminal Pretrial Process section. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Criminal Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Unlike a civil case, which is a private dispute, criminal cases involve persons who are charged by the government with a violation of the law. Examples of criminal cases are assault, burglary, embezzlement, rape, and murder. Crimes in Minnesota are divided into categories ranging from the most serious crimes to less serious crimes. The most serious crimes are called felonies. Murder and arson are felonies. A person convicted of a felony may be sent to prison for a year or more and may be fined. The next level of crime is called a gross misdemeanor. A person convicted of a gross misdemeanor may be sent to jail for up to a year and may have to pay a fine. The next level of crime is a misdemeanor. A person convicted of a misdemeanor may be sent to jail for up to 90 days and may have to pay a fine. Other violations, such as parking and moving violations, are called petty misdemeanors. A person guilty of one of these offenses cannot be sent to jail but can be fined.
<P>
The burden of proving a case against a defendant in a criminal proceeding is on the party bringing the charges, the prosecutor. A criminal defendant does not have to prove his or her innocence; the prosecutor must prove that the defendant is guilty. Decisions in a criminal proceeding are based upon a different standard than civil cases. In order for a person to be found guilty of a crime, the prosecution must prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. There are 12 jurors in a criminal case, and unlike a civil proceeding, all jurors must reach a guilty or not guilty verdict. If a jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict, it is called a hung jury and a mistrial is declared. If a mistrial is declared, a new trial may be held. 
<P>
Minnesota has sentencing guidelines that judges follow when sentencing convicted offenders. The guidelines are based on the seriousness of the crime committed and the offender's criminal history.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Criminal Pretrial Process </STRONG></H3></A>
The following is an outline of the pretrial procedures for a felony criminal case filed in Minnesota district court.
<P>
When a crime is committed, the police conduct an investigation. If a person has been identified as the probable perpetrator of the crime, the evidence linking that person to the crime is presented to either a prosecutor, in this case, the county attorney, or in some instances, a grand jury. The prosecutor can file a complaint against the defendant or the grand jury can indict a person. Based upon the complaint or indictment, a warrant for arrest or a summons to appear in court is issued to the suspect. Once a suspect is arrested, he or she is charged with the crime. If police wish to question a suspect, he or she must be given Miranda warnings, advising the suspect that he or she does not have to answer the questions and has the right to an attorney. If the defendant is held in jail, he or she makes a court appearance at which bail is set. The amount of bail set depends on several factors including the likelihood that the defendant will return for future proceedings, the seriousness of the crime, and the risk to others should the defendant be released.
<P>
Most defendants want to be represented by an attorney, although they have a right to represent themselves. If a defendant wants to be represented by an attorney but cannot afford one, the court appoints a public defender to represent the defendant. At the next court appearance, the judge reviews the evidence against the suspect to make sure there is probable cause to believe the defendant committed the offense. At the same hearing, the defendant is arraigned. The judge reads the charges to the defendant, and the defendant answers either guilty or not guilty. If the defendant pleads guilty, the next step is sentencing. If the defendant pleads not guilty, his or her next appearance in court is called an omnibus hearing. This hearing resolves constitutional issues raised by the defendant. Issues raised here may include legality of a search, coercion of a confession, or unconstitutional arrest. A judge rules on the issues raised. Charges may be dropped against a defendant based on the rulings of the judge at the omnibus hearing. At any stage in the proceeding, the defendant and prosecutor can engage in plea bargaining. During plea bargaining, a defendant may agree to plead guilty to a lesser criminal charge in exchange for dropping the more serious charge. If there is a guilty plea, there is a hearing to determine whether to accept the plea. Like a guilty plea at an earlier stage, the next step is sentencing. 
<P>
Before a defendant is sentenced, there is a pre-sentence investigation. As stated before, Minnesota judges have guidelines to follow when sentencing criminals. There are some instances when a judge may stray from the guidelines, but the judge must state his or her reasons for not following the guidelines.
If a defendant does not plead guilty during pre-trial process and charges are not dropped by the prosecutor, the next step is a trial.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Trial Process </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Whether a case is civil or criminal, the basic outline of a trial is similar. The decision maker in a trial can be either a judge or a jury. There are rights to a jury trial in many cases, but this right may be waived by the parties. If a jury trial is requested, the first step is selecting a jury. A group of persons selected for jury duty is brought into the courtroom and asked questions by the judge and attorneys for both sides. The questioning is to determine whether a person can be a fair and impartial juror. A person who cannot be fair may be removed for cause. Others may be eliminated from the jury by the attorneys without reason. This is known as a peremptory challenge. Each attorney has a limited number of peremptory challenges that he or she may make. When a jury is selected, the members are sworn in.
<P>
The next step is the opening statement. The opening statement allows each side to tell the jurors about the case, what to expect, and what each side intends to prove. The plaintiff in a civil case and the prosecutor in a criminal case give their opening statements first. 
<P>
After the opening statements, testimony begins. The plaintiff or prosecutor, whichever the case may be, calls witnesses to the stand and begins questioning them. The questioning of a witness by the party who asked him or her to testify is called direct examination. The opposing side also has the opportunity to question the witnesses; this questioning is called cross-examination. After cross-examination, the first party may question the witness again in rebuttal.
<P>
After the plaintiff or prosecution is done presenting its case, it is the defendant's turn. This time, the defense calls and questions witnesses, and the prosecution cross-examines them. 
<P>
Attorneys for either side may make objections to questions that the opposing side asks or evidence the opposing side wants to introduce. There are rules on what information is admissible in court, and the judge follows these rules when resolving any objections.
<P>
After both sides have presented their case, attorneys give closing arguments. In closing, each attorney summarizes the facts of the case and states why his or her side should prevail. Finally, the judge gives instructions to the jury on the law to be applied in the case. After receiving the judge's instructions, the jury retires to decide the issues in the case. As mentioned before, a unanimous decision is not required in a civil case, but it is required in a criminal case. If a party believes that there was an error at trial, he or she can appeal the decision to a higher court. However, a prosecutor cannot appeal a not guilty verdict. Discussion of courts of appeals is contained in the <A HREF="b03.html">Minnesota's Legal &amp; Judicial System</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Conciliation Court </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Conciliation court is generally thought of as being of interest primarily to consumers because conciliation court cases involve relatively small amounts of money. Businesses should be familiar with conciliation courts, however, because they are often defendants in actions brought in conciliation court. Any person age 18 or older, company, governmental agency, or organization can be a party to an action in conciliation court. Conciliation court has limited jurisdiction and only hears cases in which the amount of damages claimed is $7500 or less. A person does not need to be represented by an attorney in conciliation court and attorney participation is limited. The procedures have been simplified so that a plaintiff can represent himself or herself. Common issues resolved in conciliation court include damage to rental property, nonpayment of debts, and dishonored checks. 
<P>
A person who wishes to file a claim in conciliation court fills out a standard conciliation court form in the county where the defendant lives or where the claim arose. Upon filling out the form, he or she must sign it before a notary public or a court deputy. The person must also pay the filing fee. The amount of the fee depends on the amount claimed. If a plaintiff wins his case, the court can ask the defendant to reimburse the plaintiff for this fee.
<P>
After the form is filled out and the fee is paid, the court administrator's office mails notice of the hearing to the plaintiff and defendant. When a defendant receives a conciliation court notice, he or she has the option of filing a counterclaim against the plaintiff. The defendant pays a fee for any counterclaims. If the counterclaim is more than $7500, the case will be transferred to district court. If a defendant fails to appear at the hearing, the plaintiff may win the case by default.
<P>
At the hearing, the plaintiff and defendant appear before a judge. The judge asks the plaintiff to state his or her case, then the defendant. After the judge has heard both parties, he or she may ask the parties questions. The judge does not make a decision at the time of the hearing. When the judge makes a decision, notice of the decision is mailed to both parties. A party who is dissatisfied with the judge's decision may appeal the decision to the district court. At the district court, a new trial is held.
<P>
A party who wins a conciliation court case must collect the money himself or herself. The court cannot collect the judgment for the prevailing party. There is a separate procedure to follow for collection. A conciliation judgment is valid for ten years.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Recovering Fees </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In the American legal system, each side is generally responsible for its own legal costs. This means that in business litigation, the prevailing party generally pays its own legal fees. Exceptions to this rule are sometimes provided by statute or by agreement between the parties. For example, some civil rights laws award legal fees to a prevailing party who sues an employer for illegal discrimination.
<P>
Occasionally, business contracts will include provisions requiring the losing party to pay the prevailing party's legal fees in any dispute arising out of the contract. Such legal fee provisions generate a great deal of disagreement in the legal profession. Some lawyers insist upon them in every contract they draft, while other lawyers counsel their clients never to sign a contract that contains one. It is important to realize that legal fee provisions are a sword that can cut both ways. The loser winds up paying the winner's legal fees, but there is no way to know whether the side that drafts the provision will be the winner in any disagreement. However one feels about them, legal fee provisions are now included in most printed leases, promissory notes, and other business contracts. Because legal fees can be very expensive, it is worth considering carefully the possible effect of such a provision before signing an agreement that contains a legal fee provision.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Settling Out of Court </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A businessperson should never lose sight of one option that remains open throughout the dispute resolution process -- settlement. Often the client needs to keep settlement in mind because most lawyers are trained to solve problems in court rather than out of court. A lawyer who has invested time and energy into preparing for trial may be unlikely to recommend settlement. In addition, lengthy litigation usually means higher fees for the lawyer. Human nature being what it is, lawyers may not be quick to point out when their own services are no longer necessary. The client may need to remind his or her lawyer that the primary objective is a satisfactory resolution of the dispute as soon as possible, not necessarily total victory at any cost. 
<P>
As noted earlier, the Minnesota court system encourages early consideration of alternative dispute resolution, and numerous methods are widely available. It is a wise idea to include settlement strategies in early discussions with the attorney one hires to handle a matter. As time passes and legal fees mount, settlement may become an increasingly attractive option to proceeding to court. If clear goals are set from the start, and those goals are periodically reviewed, it will often be easier to settle later. If the parties do reach a settlement agreement, each side's attorney should be involved in drafting and reviewing the settlement papers before signing. It is possible for a party to agree to settle a matter without admitting fault and without compromising its position in any other disputes.

<P>
For hundreds of years clients, judges, and lawyers have complained about the cost, inefficiency, acrimony, and risk of litigation. Everyone involved with civil litigation professes to deplore its harmful side effects, but until recently, no one has done much about it. The judiciary is leading the call for change, even as clients are demanding it. Most lawyers agree that change would be positive. The time for that change is upon us.
<P>
The purpose of this chapter is to help business decision makers understand the current status of alternatives to litigation and deal with a litigation system that, like all established systems, will resist the change that seems to be coming. In the modern civil litigation environment, the knowledgeable decision maker can, and must, insist on using options that have the potential to reduce some of the present problems of litigation. Courts in many states, including Minnesota, are encouraging alternatives to traditional litigation and lawyers must either endorse the new approach or risk losing the business of increasingly knowledgeable and assertive clients.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>What Is Alternative Dispute Resolution? </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Simply stated, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is the process of resolving disputes without going to trial in front of a judge or jury. ADR is typically cheaper and more confidential than the public trial process. In recent years, caseloads in most courts have grown significantly, causing major delays and frustrations to clients, but to date, ADR has been used in only a minority of cases. The reason for this inconsistency is historical, institutional, and financial.
<P>
Before courts became overcrowded, law schools trained lawyers exclusively in the adversarial method. The adversarial system of jurisprudence is based on the concept that justice will emerge best if competing adversarial parties, represented by lawyers, present their admittedly biased version of a case to a judge or jury. The evidence is then subjected to the vital process of cross-examination in which each side has the opportunity to expose the flaws in an opponent's position. There is much more to modern litigation in its present advanced and complex state of evolution, but the fundamental adversarial concept is pretty straightforward. In fact, the system works quite well in some cases, particularly when cost and relationships between opponents is not a major concern. In many cases, however, the cost of litigation combat is prohibitive and the fighting and acrimony inherent in the process destroys relationships that could otherwise be preserved, be they personal, family or business. This long-standing litigation system is familiar to judges and litigators and has been in place for many years. Changing that established system is difficult.
<P>
Sophisticated parties, particularly corporations which are constantly in litigation, are now realizing the huge cost involved in that process and are looking for alternatives to the traditional combative approach. The training and traditions of lawyers and the courts is a powerful enough force against change but there is another one as well -- the financial pressure of legal fees and other costs. No matter how dependable and honest a lawyer may be, the fact of the matter is that the existing litigation system can be very profitable for lawyers. Litigation must, of necessity, finance the huge support system surrounding it. This support system includes transcribers of testimony, paralegals, printers, accountants, and expert witnesses who will testify about and support opposing views on virtually any subject known to civilization.
<P>
Change is coming, however, from the top. In states like Minnesota, the courts have adopted rules that require lawyers and judges to make sure that clients understand that there are alternatives to traditional litigation. In each civil case in Minnesota, the parties must file a plan of ADR with the court. This plan must be approved by the trial judge. The parties and their lawyers must then make a good faith effort to settle the case.
<P>
Clients now are going to have to decide how to proceed with ADR when their lawyers present it to them. This chapter provides an overview of ADR options and can help businesspersons make decisions in consultation with their lawyers. This chapter addresses how to choose the type of ADR that will be most effective in a particular matter and discusses the characteristics of an effective mediator, arbitrator, or other neutral party who can help in ADR. There will be many exceptions to the general statements of this chapter, however, and readers should always make ADR decisions only with the advice and counsel of their lawyers, whose enthusiastic participation is essential to the success of any alternative to traditional litigation.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>ADR and the Settlement Process </STRONG></H3></A>
The vast majority of lawsuits settle prior to trial, usually after a case has worked its way to near the head of the judge's docket and near to the trial date. That is the point at which judges, attorneys, and clients give settlement the most time and attention. It is also the point at which substantial fees have been paid, discovery is complete, and opposing arguments have been heard. In addition, sufficient time often has passed for emotional wounds to heal and for clients to have begun addressing new issues in their lives or businesses. ADR is one device to speed the settlement along.
<P>
Typically, ADR accelerates the point in the process at which settlement occurs. ADR may be used to avoid litigation entirely, but failing that, ADR is an effective way to decrease the time and money spent in litigation. This can result in large savings and better results than having a judge or jury make a decision for the parties.
<P>
The most frequently used methods of ADR are mediation, arbitration, and mediation-arbitration. Additional types of ADR include mini-trials, moderated settlement conferences, neutral fact findings, consensual special magistrates, and summary jury trials. All of these have their place in the ADR process, but this chapter focuses on the role of mediation and arbitration to highlight their advantages and disadvantages.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>The Role of Judges in ADR </STRONG></H3></A>
Judges properly want to devote their time to hearing arguments, reviewing briefs, and trying those cases which cannot settle. ADR can help them manage their caseloads by enabling them to devote their time to those cases which need input of a judicial nature, as contrasted with cases that simply need concentrated settlement efforts.
<P>
ADR clears cases through the system more rapidly, freeing judges to focus their expertise and energies on issues which are the most complex, significant or resistant to settlement. The faster cases move through the system due to settlement, the better the judicial system's reputation, because the parties resolve their own matters and reduce delays. ADR is a powerful tool for judges to use in managing their caseloads and ADR usually reduces the total costs for litigants.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>Arbitration </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Most clients and lawyers have some familiarity with arbitration, which is simply a private trial in which a third party decides the outcome of a case after lawyers present evidence. In many cases, a panel of arbitrators is chosen to hear evidence. The panel then issues an opinion which usually is binding on the parties. Appeal rights are typically limited unless some very onerous showings are made, such as a conflict of interest, fraud, or other dishonesty. A simple mistake of law or fact is typically not enough to qualify for appeal. Because an appeal is rarely available, the parties have the benefit of certainty after an arbitration, but they risk living with an errant decision.
Because of the absence of appeal, the choice of arbitrators is crucial. The General Mills Corporation, for example, has for many years required all its suppliers and contractors to submit disputes to arbitration. There is, however, a strict requirement that arbitrators have a background in and knowledge of the business. In other words, an arbitrator skilled only in securities law would not be used to resolve a dispute over the price of flour.
<P>
Experience confirms the wisdom of using arbitrators who are knowledgeable about the subject of the dispute. In one case, complex engineering and cost accounting issues were arbitrated by a panel which included a senior partner in a law firm and a retired agribusiness executive. The panel simply did not have the experience to make a ruling without a lengthy and expensive educational process. This lack of experience increased the costs dramatically and the prevailing party received an award only after two years of hearings and $250,000 in legal fees. Having several million dollars at risk without possibility of appeal is a harrowing experience which most clients and lawyers want to avoid.
<P>
Nevertheless, there are many cases in which arbitration is appropriate if speed is desired and the parties are willing to risk living with a third party's decision. The securities and construction industries, for example, have utilized arbitration very successfully for many years. 
<P>
It should be noted, however, that there has recently been significant criticism of companies which require the use of arbitration to settle internal disputes as a condition of employment. For example, plaintiffs in sexual harassment cases are claiming that the arbitrators chosen tend to be older men who are not sensitive to the concerns of women or sexual minorities. Many companies are reconsidering their approach to arbitration to resolve employment disputes. 
<P>
The decision to use arbitration often is determined by a careful assessment of risk and a mutual recognition that each party shares some of the responsibility for the dispute. It works well when the form of ADR is matched properly with the type of dispute, but litigants should be aware that ADR is not a panacea for litigation.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Mediation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Mediation is different from arbitration in that the parties craft their own settlement terms with the assistance of a neutral mediator. The mediation process is flexible and can be tailored to each individual situation. In a typical commercial dispute mediation, attorneys for the parties present a brief statement of the case. This is an excellent opportunity for the parties to listen to each other's positions and size up each other's lawyers. It usually occurs after enough time has passed for tempers to have cooled, enabling litigants to be practical about the future costs and risks of litigation. While all of the parties usually meet together at the outset, they will often meet privately with the mediator after the initial case statements. This encourages candor and helps the mediator identify factual discrepancies and substantive issues. 
<P>
A mediation is often the first chance for the parties to tell a disinterested party their version of the issues. Parties usually want to tell a neutral party their version of the facts and get a reaction before serious negotiating begins. Once they do so, pent-up anger and frustration is less likely to block settlement efforts.
<P>
Creativity in settlement discussions is typically best when the decision makers participate directly in the process rather than sending a proxy. They know and understand the elements of the dispute with an intimacy that only comes from living through the dispute. Lawyers are essential to this process because they can point out the legal risks of tentative settlement proposals and help the litigants focus their energy and creativity on solutions that meet both their substantive and legal needs.
<P>
In a typical commercial case, the mediator will shuttle between conference rooms, trying to identify the core issues, while obtaining agreement on tangential issues. In this way, a mediator can take the pulse of the parties and, after a few hours, begin to help the parties propose various settlement options. In addition, the mediator can take a variety of steps which may break an apparent impasse. For example, the parties can be called together as a group to talk through the problem or the attorneys can meet separately to thrash out legal issues and test the strength of their own convictions about the success of arguments to be made. The parties can meet in private or with the mediator to determine if breakthroughs are possible. Sometimes an apology or expression of willingness to understand an adversary's position can be the needed catalyst for a successful mediation.
<P>
Absent such emotional breakthroughs, the mediation process can be a hard-boiled dollars and cents risk/reward evaluation. In an informal mediation setting, this can be particularly productive because various options can be tried on for size and rejected for better alternatives. The mediation becomes a classic negotiation with the risks of litigation being balanced against the benefits of a thoughtful settlement agreement. Only the litigants can accomplish this but they do it best with the active participation of their lawyers.
<P>
The kind of person litigants should choose as a mediator will vary, of course, depending on the dispute at hand and the personalities involved. A mediator should be a good listener and creative in proposing solutions. It is essential also for a mediator to be able to listen well and be able to identify the issues which are truly important and fundamental. A good mediator will identify and articulate the fundamental underlying interests of the parties and help the parties shed themselves of the roadblocks created by emotion or misplaced assumptions.
<P>
A mediator should also be someone with sufficient experience to command the respect of the parties and their lawyers. A recommendation by a judge is often useful. The parties should consider several options and be willing to interview several mediators before making a decision with the advice and counsel of their lawyers.
<P>
A significant benefit of mediation is that the litigants maintain confidentiality and control over the terms of settlement as well as the settlement process itself. This can be very important if the parties want to avoid a public airing of their disputes. Mediation also gives the parties an opportunity to size up their cases and their lawyers in an informal and confidential setting. And, as important as anything, mediation is often the first time the parties really listen to each other in a meaningful way. Because mediation is not binding unless the parties reach agreement, the only risk is time spent and the unlikely possibility that some fact fatal to one party's position will be disclosed inadvertently.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Mediation-Arbitration </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Often referred to as "med-arb," mediation-arbitration is a hybrid combination of mediation and arbitration. Typically, the parties will agree to mediate to impasse or settlement. If they reach impasse, they then submit the dispute to binding arbitration of either the entire dispute or unresolved issues, using the mediator or a new person as the arbitrator.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>How to Hire an Attorney
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Perhaps the first question many readers of this book will have is, "Do I have a legal claim?" Our legal system provides a number of remedies for people who have been injured, but the legal system limits the kinds of cases it addresses. Not everyone who has been injured by someone has a legal case. Although one may be harmed by another, many factors must be present to assert a legal claim.
<P> 
The next question may be, "Do I need a lawyer to handle my legal claim?" The shortest answer is "no," an individual has the right to represent himself or herself in court in any type of case, but as an old saying goes, "He who represents himself has a fool for a client." Simply put, our legal system can be too complex and specialized for the average layperson to represent himself or herself effectively. Even a lawyer may be unable to handle a particular legal question as most lawyers specialize in a narrow area of practice rather than attempt to master all areas of law. In anything other than the simplest of matters, it is advisable for an individual to seek the consultation of and be represented by an attorney competent in the particular area of law in which the legal claim arises. Given that each year so many people need to employ lawyers, it is surprising how few consumers make informed choices when selecting legal services. Many consumers find lawyers intimidating, so they fail to use the same common sense in selecting a lawyer as they would use in making any other major consumer purchase. As a result, they often make inappropriate choices and end up confused and unhappy. Given the importance of the issues our society trusts lawyers to handle and the amount of money spent on their services, consumers have a right to be satisfied with the representation they receive.
<P> 
No one should fall into the trap of believing the tired old saying that, "lawyers are all alike." Lawyers are not all alike. Every lawyer must have a four-year college degree before being admitted to law school. However, the degree can be in any area, so a particular lawyer might have a degree in English, accounting, biology, or any other academic subject. In law school, students study many required subjects but they also have the opportunity to study areas of special interest, such as environmental law, family law, or tax law. After law school, law students must pass a state bar exam to practice law in that state. The United States is broken down into many different systems of courts, known as bars. Each bar sets its own requirements for lawyers who practice there. A lawyer who is not a member of the Minnesota bar cannot practice law in Minnesota absent special permission. Bars may also have special categories of lawyers who are certified to practice in a particular area. The consumer who exercises care in choosing a lawyer intelligently can be satisfied because there is a right way to choose legal services and it does make a difference. The following three-step process can help the consumer find the right attorney for his or her particular legal needs.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Step 1: Preparing a List</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The first step any consumer faces in choosing a lawyer is to generate a list of potential prospects. This is usually an easy step. There are thousands of lawyers in Minnesota alone, and most people know of at least one lawyer to whom they could refer someone. The quality of these referrals varies greatly, however, depending on the source. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Advertising</STRONG></H3></A>
Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court lifted the ban on attorney advertising, there has been an explosion in the amount of print and broadcast advertising done by the thousands of Minnesota lawyers eager to reach new clients. However, not all forms of lawyer advertising are permitted. For example, a lawyer is never allowed to solicit business from an accident victim in the hospital unless specifically invited there by the victim. But while some forms of advertising are banned, the range of permissible forms of advertising is quite broad and can include some fairly outlandish forms of self-promotion. Given the amount of advertising that is done by lawyers, the average consumer could easily rattle off the names of at least a few lawyers who practice in his or her community. The trouble, of course, is that the best known attorneys are not necessarily the best practitioners of their profession. While it may be easiest to look up the section on attorneys in the phone book or call a telephone number broadcasted on radio or television, it often pays to use other sources of information such as <STRONG>Martindale-Hubbell Law Directory,</STRONG> a list of many attorneys in the United States, or the book, <STRONG>The Best Lawyers in the America,</STRONG> which is published annually. A local bar association may be another source of names. And of course, it is hoped that this book will be of great use in helping consumers find competent, peer-referred attorneys to handle their legal affairs. Consulting one or more of the lawyers listed at the end of the chapters is an excellent way to start the search for a good lawyer.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Personal Referrals</STRONG></H3></A>
Another good source of attorney names is personal referrals. Friends and relatives are often able to recommend a lawyer. Business associates may also be a good source of names. A trusted accountant, insurance agent, or employer might also be able to recommend a competent lawyer. The benefit of a recommendation from a business associate is that, unlike most friends or relatives, accountants, insurance agents, and employers regularly consult with attorneys on a broad variety of issues and may be in a better position to steer the consumer toward the best lawyer for his or her needs.
<P>
Regardless of who recommends a name, ask specific questions about the lawyer. How does the person know the lawyer? Has the person ever consulted the lawyer? If so, for what reason? What are the lawyer's strengths and weaknesses? Does he or she return phone calls promptly and keep the client informed of the process of the case? What outcome was the lawyer able to get? Is the lawyer a member of the Minnesota bar? A referral that seems promising at first may not help much if it turns out that the lawyer practices a different area of law, the lawyer is not a member of the Minnesota bar, or if the person recommending the lawyer knows very little about him or her.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Referral Services</STRONG></H3></A>
A consumer who would be more comfortable talking with someone who shares a similar background should not hesitate to seek out such an attorney. Some women may turn to other women to handle their legal affairs because they believe that another woman could empathize with the unique legal problems women face. A person of color might prefer to give business to another person of color, or someone in the gay and lesbian community might believe that a person from his or her community can best represent his or her interests. Law schools have made tremendous strides in recruiting more diverse student bodies in the past two decades and consequently, the ranks of lawyers today have swelled with competent practitioners of every race, gender, ethnicity, and lifestyle. In order to make the legal community more responsive to our changing society, several organizations have sprung up here in Minnesota that refer consumers to lawyers sensitive to the needs of women, Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, gays, lesbians, and others. A consumer who would feel more comfortable hiring a lawyer from a particular background should not hesitate to seek out names from one of these special referral organizations. Most of these organizations have no fee associated with their services or their fees are paid by the lawyer, not the consumer. An appendix at the back of this volume contains information and telephone numbers for several of these organizations.
<P> 
Once the consumer has a list of a few potential lawyers it is time to think about the next step-researching the attorneys on the list. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Step 2: Researching the Attorneys on the List</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once a consumer has gathered the names of a number of possible attorneys, there are many issues to consider. Some questions can be answered by a quick phone call to the lawyer's office but others can only be answered by talking to other consumers. Some of the more important issues to research about the lawyers on the list include:
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Reputation</STRONG></H3></A>
An attorney's reputation for technical skill is important, but only the individual can determine its relevance to a particular legal matter. Consider that a lawyer who has built a sterling reputation for his or her competent handling of complex litigated probate disputes may be overqualified to draft a simple will. Similarly, a lawyer whose head is full of knowledge gained from representing large corporations may need to start researching from scratch if asked to represent an individual. Savvy individuals with a variety of legal concerns often employ different lawyers to work on different matters because they realize no lawyer can be all things to all people for every type of legal question. Certainly if the case involves a lot of money or personal freedom is at stake, as is the case when someone is accused of a felony and risks being sent to prison, then the consumer wants to find the very best attorney there is to handle the matter. For more routine matters, where smaller dollar amounts are at stake, a less experienced lawyer may actually be a better fit, not to mention, more affordable.
<P>
As important as a lawyer's technical reputation is, his or her ethical reputation may be even more important. It pays to ask around about a lawyer's ethical reputation, for a lawyer's reputation is well known among other professionals. To find out about an attorney's reputation, the individual should ask others with similar needs or problems for references-perhaps someone who has gone through a similar situation. Lawyers should be willing to provide references or a list of past clients, and the consumer can then check with those past clients. Beware of lawyers with poor ethical reputations. The state of Minnesota maintains the Office of Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board (520 Lafayette Road, Suite 100, St. Paul, MN 55155-4196, (612) 296-3952). The Board investigates charges of unethical conduct against attorneys and has authority to recommend disbarment. Potential clients may contact the Lawyers Professional Responsibility Board to learn if an attorney has ever been publicly disciplined. A lawyer who does not follow the rules of his or her own profession may not handle the case properly either.
Despite the considerable criticism they get in the media, lawyers are held to very high ethical standards. For every example of misconduct reported in the media, there are literally thousands of honest and reputable attorneys that will do the right and ethical thing. Putting effort into choosing a lawyer can go a long way to eliminate the risks of retaining an unethical attorney. 
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Specialization</STRONG></H3></A>
Following trends in other professions, many lawyers today devote themselves to one area of law and present themselves as "experts" in that area. Because it is wise to get an attorney whose experience matches a consumer's particular need, many consumers will be tempted to hire a lawyer described as an expert in his or her area of law. This may not always be the best course of action. The state of Minnesota only has certification standards for specialization in real estate and civil trials. Minnesota recognizes two national certifications for bankruptcy and criminal law. Outside these four areas, no lawyer should claim to be a specialist, specialized, or certified in any area of law, but some lawyers might use similar terminology. One attorney may call herself a tax expert because she has handled tax matters for over twenty years, while another attorney may call himself a tax expert because, although he only passed the bar last month and is still quite inexperienced, he plans to devote himself exclusively to tax matters. Clearly one expert is not equal to another. Buyer beware!
<P> 
Another important point to keep in mind is that not all legal matters require the attention of a specialist. Just as one would not automatically turn to a medical specialist for a common cold, one need not turn to a legal specialist for every routine legal matter. Chances are good that if a local attorney engaged in the general practice of law has done a fine job on a variety of legal matters in the past, he or she can be counted on to handle routine legal matters in the future. Also, because most specialists will be clustered in larger cities, a consumer in a small community may choose to hire a generalist practicing locally for the ease and convenience of being able to work with a member of the community.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Firm Size</STRONG></H3></A>
Another important issue to consider is whether to go with a solo practitioner, a lawyer in a small firm, or a lawyer in a large firm. Recognize that in most cases it is an individual attorney who will work on a particular file and with whom the client will have the most interaction. An individual may not immediately notice a difference between a solo practitioner, a lawyer at a small firm, and a lawyer at a large firm. A solo practitioner or a lawyer practicing in a small group may be able to provide more personalized attention to a file but a larger firm can bring a depth of resources that most small firms cannot. Lawyers at large firms typically charge more for their services, however, so an individual may not want or need to pay extra for a relatively straightforward legal problem. Again, it all depends on the needs of the particular individual.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Location</STRONG></H3></A>
A lawyer's location is another obvious consideration. A lawyer in the client's hometown may not always be the best choice. If many meetings will take place in a city other than where the client lives, it may be advantageous to hire an attorney who lives in the other city. Most larger firms in Minnesota are centrally located in downtown office buildings in major cities. While these locations may provide the most convenient access to courthouses, banks, and corporate headquarters, they may not be the most convenient for the individual client. Most lawyers charge for transportation time and the time necessary for them to get to and from meetings and court appearances, so it may be wise to choose someone located near the courthouse or any other location where meetings will take place. If a particular matter will not require many meetings or trips to the courthouse, the convenience of a downtown office may be unnecessary. Of course, because nice office space downtown is usually more expensive than office space in a suburb or small town, downtown lawyers may have higher overhead expenses that they pass along to their clients.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Step 3: Interviewing the Attorneys</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once an individual has narrowed down his or her list to a few attorneys, he or she should then phone them individually and seek a personal consultation with each one. It is wise to ask on the phone whether the lawyer charges a fee for the initial consultation. As with any major consumer purchase, a consumer of legal services is not obligated to hire the first attorney he or she sees.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Initial Consultation</STRONG></H3></A>
It is not reasonable for a consumer to expect free advice from a lawyer. Top-notch attorneys will welcome the opportunity to spend time with a potential client answering questions and being compared with their peers because they know their knowledge and experience will show through. An initial consultation can be more productive if the individual takes contracts, photographs, other relevant documents, and a list of questions to the meeting. At the initial interview the individual should be open and honest with the attorney. It is best not to embellish or hide facts because they may dilute the strength of a case. Some facts, such as the events in dispute occurring some time ago, may make a case impossible to win because of the statute of limitations, and the lawyer can explain that any money spent pursuing the claim would be money wasted. Some facts are less damaging than the individual assumes, and the lawyer can minimize their effect by acting quickly. The attorney may feel that a conflict of interest prevents him or her from representing the client. For example, the lawyer already represents the opposite party in a dispute. Most of what an individual tells a lawyer in an interview is confidential and protected by the attorney-client privilege. 
Consulting a lawyer does not obligate the consumer to employ or to retain that lawyer. Most initial consultations are either free of charge or available for a small nominal fee, especially should the consumer decide not to employ the attorney consulted. Some attorneys will charge for the initial consultation if they are subsequently hired.
<P> 
It is important to note an important distinction between consulting an attorney and retaining that attorney. Only retaining an attorney obligates him or her to act on behalf of the client. Many Minnesotans have learned this lesson the hard way. They thought that consulting a lawyer about their legal problem meant that their case was being handled so they stopped taking steps to pursue a claim. Meanwhile the lawyer they consulted allowed the statute of limitations to run out on the claim because the lawyer believed that he or she had not been retained to act on the client's behalf. Many legal malpractice suits have centered on whether an original office visit with a lawyer constituted a consultation or a hiring. The lesson to learn is that before leaving a lawyer's office, the individual and the lawyer should be absolutely clear whether the lawyer has or has not been hired.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Personal Chemistry</STRONG></H3></A>
So much of being a good attorney has to do with responsiveness, understanding of a client's particular situation, and the ability to communicate. The lawyer who has bad rapport with a client may not be an effective representative of the client's interests. Because each person is different, the chemistry between a client and an attorney is one of the most important elements of their relationship. Smart shoppers should ask many questions. Is the lawyer listening to the client's story or does he interrupt in the middle of sentences? Does she present a variety of options to pursue or does she insist there is only one right way to do everything? Does the lawyer try to dominate the conversation? Is this someone the client wants to spend time with? Gut feelings at this stage of the process can tell someone much about what it would be like to hire this person. 
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Malpractice Insurance</STRONG></H3></A>
It may be an uncomfortable subject to raise with an attorney whom one has just met for the first time, but it is important to determine whether he or she carries malpractice insurance. The financial losses stemming from a poorly handled case can be quite large. If the lawyer does not carry malpractice insurance, it may be impossible to recover any losses should the lawyer commit legal malpractice. 
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Experience</STRONG></H3></A>
Many individuals naively assume that the longer a lawyer has been in practice the more experience he or she has. This assumption is frequently unfounded. Relevant experience in a particular area of law is far more important than the total number of years that a person has practiced law. A young attorney whose practice has been narrowly focused on one area of law may have far more insight into how a problem should be handled than an attorney with more years of practice in a broad variety of legal matters. In addition, because laws change so quickly, in some cases a recent graduate may have greater knowledge of a particular area of law than a more senior attorney. The consumer should ask pointed questions about a lawyer's specific experience handling similar cases.
<P>
In some large firms, a senior partner may agree to handle a matter, then assign most of the work to less experienced associates. It pays to ask who is going to work on a file, and discuss that person's experience and his or her success in representing cases or doing similar work. Still other lawyers may be eager to take on a case in an area of law in which they have little experience, reasoning that they can simply learn the relevant law as they go along. Not having experience in the relevant area of law need not rule out a lawyer. A lawyer inexperienced in one area of law may still be a terrific choice to handle a case, but it is appropriate to ask how long it will take the lawyer to learn the relevant laws and whether the client is expected to pay for the educational time.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Estimate of Time</STRONG></H3></A>
The lawyer ought to be able to estimate a timetable for completing the case. This will depend on many variables, including the complexity of the matter, whether the lawyer expects to go to trial, how cooperative all parties are, and the lawyer's workload. Asking for a timetable is likely to bring all of these issues into the open. A relatively simple matter may take a long time to complete if a particular lawyer is too busy to devote his or her full attention to it. A lawyer with very little experience may reveal that inexperience if he or she cannot describe the steps necessary to complete a task and estimate how long each will take. 
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Cost</STRONG></H3></A>
Money should be discussed at the initial meeting with an attorney. It is important to know what will and what will not be charged and at what rates. Although a lawyer may not be able to give an exact cost, most lawyers with experience should be able to provide a ball-park estimate of their fees.
An individual should not feel uncomfortable comparison shopping for a lawyer. Hiring an attorney can be a major outlay of resources so, like any other expenditure, a consumer should find out such details as how and how often bills are sent out, whether the firm requires a retainer, and whether the firm has minimum billing increments. Find out how often the lawyer sends out status reports about a case or matter. Finally, as with any business arrangement, get your agreement in writing.
<P>
Lawyers have several different ways that a client may pay the fees for their services:
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Flat Fees</STRONG></H4></A>
The simplest fee payment option is the flat fee. A lawyer charging a flat fee simply quotes a fee for which he or she will do the work. Flat rates were traditionally quite rare. A lawyer often has no way of knowing for certain how complex a matter is until investigating it and can be understandably adverse to committing to a flat fee in advance. Recently the flat fee has been growing in popularity. Much of this growth is client-driven and stems from clients' desire to better predict and control the rising cost of legal representation. Today, lawyers are increasingly willing to discuss the possibility of a flat fee for relatively simple legal matters such as simple wills or uncontested divorces. The consumer should bear in mind, however, that some lawyers who advertise low flat fees for simple wills or uncontested divorces rarely ever find that a client has need of a simple will or uncontested divorce. Sometimes the low advertised flat fees are merely a ploy to get a potential client in the door in hopes that, once in the office, the client can be convinced that his or her needs are actually far more complex and therefore justify much higher fees.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG>Hourly Rates</STRONG></H4></A>
For many matters a lawyer will charge an hourly rate for time spent on a file. The hourly rate is usually a reflection of the lawyer's competence, experience, and overhead expenses. The lowest hourly rate is not necessarily the best deal for the consumer. An experienced lawyer with higher rates will usually be able to complete a matter more quickly than a less experienced lawyer with lower rates. A common complaint about hourly rates is that they give the lawyer no incentive to handle a matter in a timely fashion. After all, who wants to work quickly and efficiently if it means making less money? Paying for legal services at hourly rates is a time-honored tradition at American law firms which is unlikely to disappear soon, and can unfortunately open the door to much disagreement over how long it should have taken a lawyer to complete a task. Before agreeing to hire a lawyer to work for an hourly rate, it is appropriate to request a written estimate of the hours that will probably be needed, as well as an estimate of how much money will be necessary for miscellaneous expenses.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="200"><H4><STRONG>Retainer Fees</STRONG></H4></A>
There are actually two kinds of retainer fees used in the legal community. The first is a variation of the flat fee. Rather than paying a lawyer a flat fee to handle a specific matter, some wealthy individuals or large corporations will simply pay an attorney a lump sum each year to retain that attorney for the year. In return for this kind of retainer fee, the lawyer agrees to be on call for any legal problems that arise or to manage routine day-to-day legal affairs. The average consumer does not have a sufficient volume of legal questions to require this type of set-up.
<P>
The more common retainer fee is actually just an advance on the hourly rate, described above. If it is the first time that a lawyer has represented a particular client or if there is any question about the client's ability to pay, the lawyer may insist upon the payment of a large retainer up front. This money is then placed in a special account and cost of legal services provided are then deducted from that account. A client who agrees to pay this type of retainer is still entitled to periodic written statements detailing how much has been deducted from the account for legal services and, of course, the client is entitled to any money remaining in the account when legal representation has been concluded. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="210"><H4><STRONG>Contingent Fees</STRONG></H4></A>
Another common legal fee arrangement is the contingent fee. The contingent fee is most common among personal injury attorneys who charge for their services by taking a percentage (the going rate is one-third) of whatever damages are recovered or the amount of money saved for the client, whether through an out-of-court settlement or a jury award. The percentage that a lawyer asks for depends on the difficulty of the issues, the amount of money at stake, and the skill and experience of the attorney. Essentially, when an individual asks a lawyer to take a case on a contingency basis, the lawyer is being asked to gamble on the outcome of the case. A case with only a very slight chance of success can consume a great deal of the lawyer's time and energy and yield no fee if the case is lost. In that case, an individual may need to offer a lawyer a larger percentage of the award in order to convince him or her to take that risk. Conversely, an individual with a case that is very likely to result in a large award and that presents few procedural difficulties may be able to bargain down the contingent fee to a smaller percentage of the award.
<P>
A person may be better off with a more experienced attorney because, although the fee will be higher, so will the award. If a less experienced attorney handles a lawsuit, and wins a $300,000 award, using the usual contingency rate of one-third, the client keeps $200,000 and the lawyer gets $100,000. But if an attorney whose superior legal talents result in an award of $600,000, the client keeps $400,000 and the attorney gets $200,000. Hiring the less experienced attorney would therefore cost the consumer the extra $200,000 he or she would have received if the more experienced lawyer had handled the case.
<P>
There are several reasons to be especially careful when hiring a personal injury lawyer to work on a contingent fee basis. Many law firms specializing in these kinds of cases make their money by handling a large number of personal injury cases and settling them quickly. Because of the typical contingent fee arrangement, some lawyers are motivated to accept early settlement offers made by insurance companies, the usual defendants in personal injury lawsuits.
<P> 
By settling early, these firms make a lot of money very quickly. This tactic is popular with some lawyers as they take a cut of the settlement at a time when they have few expenses and because they have not spent the time and money to fully prepare a case. Be wary of such firms. The client has the right to refuse any settlement offer made and should consider doing so, especially if the case is a strong one that may cause a jury to award a large sum of money. Remember that the law gives an individual only one chance to make a case before a jury. Only under very special circumstances can someone go back to court to ask a jury for more money just because the original award money ran out after a period of several years. This is an especially important point to consider if someone has an injury that will require medical care and medical bills for the rest of his or her life.
<P>
Although contingent fee agreements are quite popular with some attorneys, they are inappropriate in some types of cases, and ethics rules forbid lawyers from accepting a contingent fee arrangement in criminal cases and some divorce cases. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="220"><H4><STRONG>Variable Contingent Fees</STRONG></H4></A>
A third payment option becoming fairly popular among some lawyers is the variable contingent fee arrangement. In this situation, the attorney's fees vary depending upon when the case is settled. Typical arrangements specify that the attorney collects 20 percent if the case settles before initiating a formal lawsuit, 25 percent if the case settles within a year after a lawsuit is filed, and 33 percent of any damage award received any time after a year. With this type of arrangement, the lawyer has an incentive not to settle too early because the fee will be greater if a larger settlement can be won by going to trial.
<P>
It is wise to clarify the exact terms of a contingent fee arrangement before signing it. Almost all contingent fee agreements stipulate that the attorney's expenses are first deducted from any award won, and the remainder of the money is then split on the one-third/two-thirds basis. Thus the statement common in the advertisements of many personal injury lawyers, "no fee unless we win your case," does not mean that a client pays nothing for legal representation. A personal injury lawyer's fee will be a percentage of any award and therefore may be nothing, but win or lose, a client is almost always responsible for the attorney's costs. A client must make sure, therefore, that he or she fully understands what kind of costs he or she is expected to pay before signing a contingent fee agreement. In an attempt to eliminate any misunderstanding about this, in 1993 the Minnesota Supreme Court changed the Lawyers' Rules of Professional Conduct to require attorneys who intend to charge fees to cover their expenses to disclose that fact in their advertisements.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="230"><H4><STRONG>Miscellaneous Expenses</STRONG></H4></A>
Many disputes that clients have with lawyers over money stem from a misunderstanding of the difference between "fees" and "expenses." Regardless of which type of fee plan discussed above a client chooses, most lawyers will charge for their expenses in addition to their fees, regardless of the outcome of the case. Many contingent fee clients, lured by an attorney claiming, "no fees unless we recover for you," has been shocked to find out, after failing to recover any money on their claim, that they owe money to their lawyer. The client may indeed pay no fees unless the case is successful but may still be responsible for sizable expenses incurred handling the case, regardless of its outcome. For example, an attorney might charge for travel time, secretarial overtime, delivery services, court costs, filing fees, deposition fees, expert witness fees, investigation expenses, and the initial consultation. Many law firms bill incidentals such as photocopying and postage at rates far higher than what those services would cost at an independent copy center or post office, so it is important to discuss specific details. Also ask about referral fees. Some lawyers refer clients only to other lawyers who will split the fees with them. Thus the individual who employs a lawyer referred by another lawyer may be inadvertently paying for two attorneys but getting the services of only one. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="240"><H4><STRONG>The Indigent Client</STRONG></H4></A>
Of course, if someone can not afford a lawyer at all, he or she should contact his or her local legal aid association or another organization dedicated to representing the needy. Many local legal aid societies have attorneys who volunteer their advice and help to the needy. Each organization has its own rules for who it will represent and which types of cases it will agree to take. More information about these organizations can be found in the Legal Resources Appendix. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="250"><H2><STRONG>Benefits of the Process</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The point of this three-step process is to educate the individual to become a more sophisticated consumer of legal services, including referral services. The three-step process described above should begin with a list of names and, after diligent research and meetings, conclude with one name standing out among the others as the best choice. The consumer should be able to cross some names off the list before actually meeting the lawyers, because after researching the names it will become apparent that some attorneys are inappropriate for the legal matter at hand. It is even possible that every name on the list will be crossed off for one reason or another, and the consumer will have to return to step one and seek more names. For example, if it becomes apparent that a particular legal matter will require the services of a lawyer who litigates matters regularly in a courtroom and all of the attorneys on the list rarely see the inside of a courtroom, a consumer should go back to a referral agency or to this book and specifically look for names of lawyers whose practices include litigation. Unless the consumer is under extreme pressure to resolve a legal matter immediately, it is far better to spend time in choosing a good lawyer than to try and undo a poor decision later. It is always the privilege of the client to change lawyers before a legal matter has been concluded, but doing so can be costly and time consuming. If a client fires his or her attorney before a matter is settled, the attorney is owed for the reasonable value of the time that has been spent on the matter, even if a contingent fee agreement stated that the attorney would be paid only if the case was won. All of the files on the matter belong to the client and must be turned over to the client on termination of the lawyer's services. A new attorney will have to spend time becoming newly acquainted with the facts in the file.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Minnesota Judicial Systems</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
It may be useful for a person thinking about initiating a legal action to understand the legal and 
judicial systems that exist in Minnesota. One of the most confusing aspects of the judicial 
system is that there are two separate systems: state and federal. The majority of cases are 
filed in state courts. This chapter discusses the state and federal systems and summarizes the 
jurisdictions of both. The <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Case: Civil &amp; Criminal Chapter</A> outlines how a case goes 
through the state civil and criminal process. Claims which arise on Native American land may 
be subject to tribal courts and not the state or federal courts.
<P>
As one may remember from Civics class, there are three branches of government: legislative, 
executive, and judicial. The legislative branch creates the laws, the executive branch enforces 
the laws, and the judicial branch interprets the laws. Laws are also called statutes or codes. 
The executive branch can create rules or regulations to govern its administrative procedures 
and the judicial branch may also interpret these regulations.
<P>
When a case is brought before a court, the court applies the law to the facts of the case and a 
decision is made. There are many sources of law the court uses in making its decision: the 
Constitutions of both the United States and Minnesota, statutes, regulations and prior decisions 
of its own or of other higher courts (case law). The way in which a higher state court answers 
a legal question is binding on all other lower courts within that jurisdiction when faced with the 
same legal question. For example, if the Minnesota Supreme Court decides a legal question, all 
state courts in Minnesota must follow that decision. However, state courts in Michigan would 
not have to follow the Minnesota decision because they are in a different jurisdiction. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Jurisdiction</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
When a person decides to file a legal action, he or she must decide where to file the case. Where 
a person files a case depends on which court has jurisdiction in such cases. Jurisdiction 
determines whether a particular court has the power and authority to decide a case. This is 
subject matter jurisdiction. If a court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, it may not 
decide a case. A court must also have personal jurisdiction over the defendant in a case. There 
are different ways to have personal jurisdiction, including if a defendant resides or has a 
business within the court's geographical region. For example, a Minnesota plaintiff cannot bring 
an action in Minnesota district court against a defendant who lives and works in another state, 
if that defendant has no contact with the state of Minnesota. Jurisdiction is set in law, 
constitutions, or case law. It is possible to have courts with overlapping jurisdiction and a 
person has a choice of in which court to file an action. There are three types of subject matter 
jurisdiction: exclusive, general, and limited. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Exclusive Jurisdiction</STRONG></H3></A>
Exclusive jurisdiction means that only a particular court can decide a case. An example of 
exclusive subject matter jurisdiction is bankruptcy court. Only in a federal bankruptcy court 
can a person file a bankruptcy action. State courts have no jurisdiction in bankruptcy cases.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>General Jurisdiction</STRONG></H3></A>
General jurisdiction means that a court has the ability to hear and decide a wide range of cases. 
Unless a law or constitutional provision denies them jurisdiction, courts of general jurisdiction 
can handle any kind of case. The Minnesota district courts are general jurisdiction courts.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Limited Jurisdiction</STRONG></H3></A>
Limited jurisdiction means that a court has restrictions on the cases it can decide. Conciliation 
court is a court of limited jurisdiction. It can only hear and decide cases which claim damages 
of $7500 or less.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Venue</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Venue deals with the location of a legal action and designates the particular county in which a 
court with jurisdiction may hear and decide a case. In Minnesota, a case is brought in the 
county in which the claim originates or where one or more defendants resides. For example, if 
a person is hit by a car in Duluth, and the car was driven by a person from St. Paul, an action 
against the driver could be filed in either St. Louis County (Duluth) or in Ramsey County (St. 
Paul).
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>State and Federal Courts</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As previously mentioned, there are two separate court systems: state and federal. Which court 
system a person enters depends on a number of factors: whether a court has exclusive 
jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, the amount of damages involved, and the 
locations of the parties in the case.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>State Courts</STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota has three levels to its court system: district courts, Court of Appeals, and the 
Supreme Court. There are two special courts which are not in the judicial system and were 
created by the executive branch to address specific areas -- Tax Court and Workers' 
Compensation Court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Minnesota District Courts</STRONG></H4></A>
Minnesota has divided its 87 counties into 10 judicial districts. Each judicial district is 
composed of anywhere from one to seventeen counties. Each district court hears cases in each 
county within its district at some time. As previously mentioned, the district court has general 
subject matter jurisdiction and handles a wide variety of cases, both civil and criminal. The 
district courts are courts of original jurisdiction, that is, cases start there. That is where 
trials are held, witnesses testify, evidence is presented, and judgments are rendered. 
Depending on the size of the district, some have created specific divisions to handle certain 
matters such as probate and family. Conciliation court is a division of district court and appeals 
from conciliation court are heard there. A person who loses a case in district court may appeal 
it. Appeals from district court are typically brought to the Minnesota Court of Appeals.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Minnesota Court of Appeals</STRONG></H4></A>
The Minnesota Court of Appeals was created in 1983 to assist the Minnesota Supreme Court 
with its workload. Unlike the district courts which hear trials with witnesses, jurors, and 
evidence, the Court of Appeals' primary function is to determine whether there has been an 
error at the district court level, and if so, to remedy it. The Court of Appeals reviews the 
transcript from the district court and may also consider written and oral arguments. The Court 
of Appeals can reverse or affirm a district court ruling or send it back to the district court for 
additional action. The Court of Appeals hears most appeals from the district courts unless the 
law specifically states that a particular appeal goes directly to the Minnesota Supreme Court. 
The Court of Appeals is made up of sixteen judges who are divided into rotating three-judge 
panels. These panels travel throughout the state hearing appeals. Appeals from this court are 
sent to the Minnesota Supreme Court. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Minnesota Supreme Court</STRONG></H4></A>
The Minnesota Supreme Court is the highest court in the state. Like the Court of Appeals, it 
does not hold trials but reviews transcripts, takes written and oral arguments, and determines 
whether there has been an error at the district court level. It may also reverse, affirm, or 
remand a case. The Supreme Court is the rule-making body for the state courts and has 
administrative responsibility for the operation of the state court system. The Minnesota 
Supreme Court is composed of seven justices who hear appeals in St. Paul. A Minnesota 
Supreme Court decision is a final decision in Minnesota and may be appealed to the U.S. Supreme 
Court only if there is a federal issue involved.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Federal Courts</STRONG></H3></A>
The federal court system hears both civil and criminal cases and is also broken down into three 
levels. There are generally three ways a case can be filed in federal court: the case involves 
federal law, the case raises a question of U.S. Constitution interpretation, or the case involves 
parties from more than one state and the amount in question is more than $50,000.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Federal District Court</STRONG></H4></A>
The federal government has divided the United States into federal judicial districts. The state 
of Minnesota makes up one federal judicial district. The federal district court for Minnesota has 
offices in Minneapolis, St. Paul, and Duluth. Like the state district courts, the federal district 
court holds trials on issues over which it has jurisdiction. Appeals from the federal district 
court go to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.
<P>
Also in the federal system is the bankruptcy court. This court has exclusive jurisdiction over 
bankruptcy matters. There are four bankruptcy court offices in Minnesota -- Minneapolis, St. 
Paul, Duluth, and Fergus Falls. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Federal Court of Appeals</STRONG></H4></A>
The federal government groups the United States' federal judicial districts into circuits, and 
each circuit has a court of appeals. Minnesota is in the Eighth Circuit along with Arkansas, 
Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals 
hears the appeals from federal district courts within its circuit. As in the Minnesota Court of 
Appeals, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals does not try cases, but only reviews cases from 
the federal district courts. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has an office in St. Paul and its 
main office in St. Louis, Missouri. Appeals from the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals are heard at 
the U. S. Supreme Court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>U.S. Supreme Court</STRONG></H4></A>
The U.S. Supreme Court is the only court created by the U.S. Constitution. It hears appeals from 
the circuit courts of appeal and states' Supreme Courts, and other cases in which it has 
jurisdiction -- cases between states, for example. The court is made up of nine justices and is 
based in Washington, D.C. Only a small percentage of the cases appealed to the U.S. Supreme 
Court are actually heard. As with other appellate courts, the refusal to hear an appeal lets 
stand the lower court's ruling.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Process of a Case: Civil &amp; Criminal
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Our legal system is based on the adversary system. This system allows opposing parties to present their case to an impartial third party who renders a decision. The adversary process determines the facts of the case, determines the governing law, applies the law to the facts, and provides a judgment.
<P>
There are two kinds of cases: civil and criminal. Civil cases resolve private conflicts between people, businesses, and the government. Criminal cases involve the enforcement of a law by the government. Most disputes are resolved before trial. Disputes may be resolved before any legal action is filed, after legal action is filed in court, or while a trial is in process but before the judge or jury renders a decision. Most cases have to be filed within the time limits set by law. These limits are known as the statutes of limitations. The time limitations vary depending on the type of legal claim filed. If a case is not filed within the time period set by law, one loses the right to file the legal claim.
<P>
This chapter will outline the process of a case through the civil and criminal district court system. It will also outline the trial process. Finally, it will discuss the use of conciliation court.
The <A HREF="c02.html">Minnesota Judicial Systems</A> Chapter discusses the state and federal court systems in Minnesota. Also see the specific subject matter chapters for more information, including the <A HREF="c13.html">Criminal Law Chapter</A> and the <A HREF="c10.html">Accidents &amp; Personal Injury Law Chapter</A> . The <A HREF="c04.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution Chapter</A> discusses options that exist outside the courtroom.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Civil Process</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Civil cases make up the majority of the cases filed. Examples of civil cases include: personal injuries, contract disputes, landlord-tenant disputes, adoptions, and marriage dissolutions (divorce). In civil cases where damage is done to a party, that party can claim money damages. However, depending on the case, a party may ask for something other than money damages. For a discussion of damages in contract disputes, see the <A HREF="c07.html">Contract Law Chapter</A>. A person may ask the court to issue an injunction against another party. An injunction bars a person from doing a specific act. The court may issue a restraining order restricting the defendant's actions until the case is resolved. For example, a person signs a contract to buy a house from the homeowner and the owner turns around and sells the house for a second time to another person. The first buyer may ask the court to restrain the seller from completing the sale to the second buyer until the case between the first buyer and the seller is resolved. 
<P>
On rare occasions, civil cases may be filed as class actions. Class actions arise when there is a common question of law and fact for a large number of persons. There is a special process to go through to establish a class action. This certification process can be lengthy. Recent examples of class actions include breast implant cases and real estate dual agency cases.
<P>
The burden of proof in a civil case is on the party who initiates the case (the plaintiff). The plaintiff must prove his or her case by a preponderance of evidence. This means that the party in a case who presents the more convincing evidence wins the case. The plaintiff's evidence must be more convincing than the evidence presented by the opposing party (the defendant).
Civil jury trials may include only six jurors and are not required to reach a unanimous verdict. If five of the six jurors agree on a case resolution, it may be enough for a verdict. A person is limited to bringing one legal action for damages arising from the same circumstances.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Civil Pretrial Process</STRONG></H3></A>
As previously mentioned, a civil case is a private dispute between two or more parties. The following is an outline of the steps one may take if a civil action is filed in a Minnesota district court.
<P>
The plaintiff has his or her attorney prepare a document called a complaint. The complaint states what the dispute is about, why the defendant is responsible, and asks the court to take a stated action, such as awarding damages. The complaint, along with a summons, is delivered to the party the action has been filed against. A summons is a written order stating that a defendant must answer the plaintiff's complaint. There are requirements for serving a summons. The party served is the defendant. The defendant has a specific period of time to respond to the complaint. This written response is an answer. The answer admits or denies allegations in the complaint, states any defenses to the plaintiff's complaint, and asks the court to decide in favor of the defendant. The defendant may also state claims she has against the plaintiff. These claims by the defendant against the plaintiff are counterclaims. The plaintiff must respond to the defendant's counterclaims. If the defendant does not respond to the complaint, the plaintiff can win the case by default. The complaint, answer, and any counterclaims are called the pleadings. These documents are eventually filed in district court. 
<P>
If it appears that based on all the information presented, one side clearly has the advantage, that side will often file a motion for summary judgment, which requests that the judge rule in favor of the moving party if the judge decides that there is no triable issue of fact. At this same time one party may file a motion to dismiss the case. There are a number of grounds on which a party may move to dismiss a case. For example, a party may claim the court does not have jurisdiction, or that the action was brought too late under the statute of limitations, which vary in length depending on the type of case in Minnesota.
<P>
There are several steps before a case goes to trial. To assist the parties in preparing their cases and learning about the other side's case, a process called discovery occurs. During discovery, each side may ask the other to answer written questions (interrogatories), provide copies of documents, or answer questions orally under oath (deposition). A deposition is usually held in an attorney's office and recorded by a stenographer. A deposition can be used to impeach a witness during the trial if testimony at trial is different from the testimony given at the deposition. Each side may also make motions to the court asking it to settle legal questions that arise. 
<P>
During this pretrial process, a settlement may be arranged. Over 90% of the civil cases filed in Minnesota state courts are settled without ever going to trial. Since July 1, 1994, civil litigants in Minnesota and their attorneys have been required to consider the possibility of settling a lawsuit through a process known as alternative dispute resolution (ADR). For more information regarding the ADR process, see the <A HREF="c04.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter. If a settlement is not arranged during the pretrial process, the parties proceed to trial. An outline of the trial process follows the Criminal Pretrial Process section. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Criminal Process</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Unlike a civil case, which is a private dispute, criminal cases involve persons who are charged by the government with a violation of the law. Examples of criminal cases are assault, burglary, embezzlement, rape, and murder. Crimes in Minnesota are divided into categories ranging from the most serious crimes to less serious crimes. The most serious crimes are called felonies. Murder and arson are felonies. A person convicted of a felony may be sent to prison for a year or more and may have to pay a fine. The next level of crime is called a gross misdemeanor. A person convicted of a gross misdemeanor may be sent to jail for up to a year and may have to pay a fine. The next level of crime is a misdemeanor. A person convicted of a misdemeanor may be sent to jail for up to 90 days and may be fined. Other violations, such as parking tickets and moving violations, are called petty misdemeanors. A person guilty of these offenses cannot be sent to jail but can be fined.
<P>
The burden of proving a case against a person in a criminal proceeding (defendant) is on the party bringing the charges (the prosecutor). A criminal defendant does not have to prove his or her innocence; the prosecutor must prove that the defendant is guilty. Decisions in a criminal proceeding are based upon a different standard than civil cases. In order for a person to be found guilty of a crime, the prosecution must prove the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
There are 12 jurors in a criminal case, and unlike a civil proceeding, all jurors must reach a guilty or not guilty verdict. If a jury fails to reach a unanimous verdict, it is a hung jury and a mistrial is declared. If a mistrial is declared, a new trial may be held. 
<P>
Minnesota has sentencing guidelines that judges follow when sentencing a convicted offender. The guidelines are based on the seriousness of the crime committed and the offender's criminal history.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Criminal Pretrial Process</STRONG></H3></A>
The following is an outline of the pretrial procedures for a felony criminal case filed in Minnesota district court.
<P>
When a crime is committed, the police conduct an investigation. If a person has been identified as the probable perpetrator of the crime, the evidence linking that person to the crime is presented to either a prosecutor (county attorney) or in some instances, a grand jury. The prosecutor can file a complaint against the defendant or the grand jury can indict a person. Based upon the complaint or indictment, a warrant for arrest or a summons to appear in court are issued to the suspect. Once a suspect is arrested, she is charged with the crime. If police wish to question her, she must be given Miranda warnings, advising her that she does not have to answer the questions and has the right to an attorney. If the defendant is held in jail, she will make a court appearance where bail is set. The amount of bail set depends on several factors including the likelihood that the defendant will return for future proceedings, the seriousness of the crime, and the risk to others should the defendant be released.
<P>
Most defendants want to be represented by an attorney, although they have a right to represent themselves. If a defendant wants to be represented by an attorney but cannot afford one, the court will appoint a public defender to represent the defendant. At the next court appearance, the judge reviews the evidence against the suspect to make sure there is probable cause to believe she committed the offense. At the same hearing, the defendant is arraigned. The judge reads the charges to the defendant, and she answers either guilty or not guilty. If she pleads guilty, the next step is sentencing. If she pleads not guilty, her next appearance in court is called an omnibus hearing. This hearing resolves constitutional issues raised by the defendant. Issues raised here include legality of a search, coercion of a confession, or unconstitutional arrest. A judge rules on the issues raised. Charges may be dropped against a defendant based on the rulings of the judge at the omnibus hearing. At any stage in the proceeding, the defendant and prosecutor can engage in plea bargaining. During plea bargaining, a defendant may agree to plead guilty to a lesser criminal charge in exchange for dropping the more serious charge. If there is a guilty plea, there is a hearing to determine whether to accept the plea. Like a guilty plea at an earlier stage, the next step is sentencing. 
<P>
Before a defendant is sentenced, there is a pre-sentence investigation. As stated before, Minnesota judges have guidelines to follow when sentencing criminals. There are some instances when a judge may stray from the guidelines, but the judge must state the reasons for not following the guidelines. 
<P>
If a defendant does not plead guilty along the way and charges are not dropped by the prosecutor, the next step is a trial. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Trial Process</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Whether a case is civil or criminal, the basic outline of a trial is similar. The decision maker in a trial can be either a judge or a jury. There are rights to a jury trial in many cases, but this right may be waived by the parties.
<P>
If a jury trial is requested, the first step is selecting a jury. A group of persons selected for jury duty is brought into the courtroom and asked questions by the judge and attorneys for both sides. The questioning is to determine whether a person can be a fair and impartial juror. A person who cannot be fair may be removed for cause. Others may be eliminated from the jury by the attorneys without reason. This is known as a peremptory challenge. Each attorney has a limited number of peremptory challenges that he or she may make. When a jury is selected, the members are sworn in.
<P>
The next step is the opening statement. The opening statement allows each side to tell the jurors about the case, what to expect, and what they intend to prove. The plaintiff in a civil case and the prosecutor in a criminal case give their opening statements first.
<P>
After the opening statements, testimony begins. The plaintiff or prosecutor, whichever the case may be, calls witnesses to the stand and begins questioning them. The questioning of a witness by the party who asked them to testify is called direct examination. The opposing side also has the opportunity to question the witnesses; this questioning is called cross-examination. After cross-examination, the first party may question the witness again in rebuttal. 
<P>
After the plaintiff or prosecution is done presenting its case, it is the defendant's turn. This time, the defense calls and questions witnesses, and the other side cross-examines them. Attorneys for either side may make objections to questions that the opposing side asks or evidence the opposing side wants to introduce. There are rules on what information is admissible in court, and the judge follows these rules when resolving any objections. 
<P>
After both sides have presented their case, attorneys give closing arguments. In closing, each attorney summarizes the facts of the case and states why his or her side should prevail. Finally, the judge gives instructions to the jury on the law to be applied in the case. After receiving the judge's instructions, the jury retires to decide the issues in the case. As mentioned before, a unanimous decision is not required in a civil case, but it is required in a criminal case. If a party believes that there was an error at trial, he or she can appeal the decision to a higher court. However, a prosecutor cannot appeal a not guilty verdict. Discussion of courts of appeals is contained in the <A HREF="c02.html">Minnesota Judicial Systems</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Conciliation Court</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An option for consumers thinking about pursuing a civil claim is conciliation court. Any person 18 years or older, company, governmental agency, or organization can be a party to an action in conciliation court. Conciliation court has limited jurisdiction and only hears cases where the amount of damages claimed is $7500 or less. A person does not need to be represented by an attorney in conciliation court and attorney participation is limited. The procedures have been simplified so one can represent herself. Common issues resolved in conciliation court include property damage, nonpayment of debts, and dishonored checks. 
<P>
A person who wishes to file a claim in conciliation court must fill out a standard conciliation court form in the county where the defendant lives or where the claim arose. Upon filling out the form, he or she must sign it before a notary public or a court deputy. The person must also pay the filing fee. The amount of the fee depends on the amount claimed. If a plaintiff wins his case, the court can ask the defendant to reimburse the plaintiff for this fee. 
<P>
After the form is filled out and the fee is paid, the court administrator's office will mail notice of the hearing to the plaintiff and defendant. When a defendant receives a conciliation court notice, she has the option of filing a counterclaim against the plaintiff. The defendant pays a fee for any counterclaims. If the counterclaim is more than $7500, the case will be transferred to district court. If a defendant fails to appear at the hearing, the plaintiff may win the case by default. 
<P>
At the hearing, the plaintiff and defendant appear before a judge. The judge will ask the plaintiff to state his case, then the defendant. After the judge has heard both parties, she may ask the parties questions. The judge does not make her decision at the time of the hearing. When the judge makes her decision, notice of the decision will be mailed to both parties. A party who is dissatisfied with the judge's decision may appeal the decision to the district court. At the district court, a new trial is held.
<P>
A party who wins a conciliation court case must collect the money himself. The court cannot collect the judgment for the prevailing party. There is a procedure to follow for collection. A conciliation judgment is valid for ten years.

<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Alternative Dispute Resolution
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is an increasingly popular trend that allows people to solve disputes outside court in a cooperative manner rather than through litigation. ADR techniques have been used successfully in disputes involving small and large businesses, the government, and the general public. ADR is becoming very popular in family law cases. It can be faster and cheaper than litigation, and because the parties settle out of court there is little or no waiting for trial dates; expenses for depositions and clerical costs can be substantially reduced. Consumers should contact an attorney for a referral to a qualified ADR provider.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>ADR Options</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
ADR may involve the use of mediation, arbitration, mediation-arbitration, neutral fact-finding, mini-trials, and summary jury trials in order to reduce or eliminate the time and cost of litigation and other formal, adversarial proceedings. The use of ADR can also improve client satisfaction with the way disputes are resolved. Dispute resolution processes can be voluntary, mandatory, binding, or nonbinding-advisory. These dispute resolution options can be used at any point during a dispute. Some parties might choose to use ADR from the very beginning of a dispute, while others will turn to ADR after more traditional dispute resolution options become too lengthy or costly. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Mediation</STRONG></H3></A>
Mediation is an informal method of ADR that involves a trained third party (mediator) helping disputing parties negotiate a settlement to their conflict. Instead of presenting cases in a courtroom, each side meets in private with the mediator and in a joint session with the mediator and the other side. Mediation is nonadversarial because the mediator does not have the power to impose a resolution upon the parties. Rather, the role of the mediator or mediation panel is to help the parties reach their own resolution. <P>
Mediation seeks solutions that satisfy all parties. The parties are empowered to control the outcome, and the potential exists for a solution that addresses the interests of all parties (a win-win result). While courts are limited by law to specific remedies, mediation is limited only by the nature of the problem and the parties' own creativity.<P>
Mediation gives the parties a sense of involvement in the dispute resolution process, making compliance with the result more likely than in the case of an imposed solution. Parties who use ADR successfully can learn valuable skills to help them address future conflicts more creatively.
Although participation in some mediation programs may be mandatory, reaching agreement is usually voluntary. Parties sometimes stipulate beforehand that any agreement reached will be enforceable as a contract. However, if the parties do not reach agreement between themselves, there is no agreement to enforce and the parties are free to use other methods to solve their dispute. Even in cases in which the parties cannot reach an agreement, the process of mediation may better define the dispute and help each party understand how a judge or jury might react to the case in court. Agreement can be reached on some issues while the parties agree to seek an advisory or binding judgment on the issues that remain in dispute.<P>
Mediated cases are usually settled in less time than litigated cases, and both parties can achieve considerable cost and time savings. Even if a party believes it would ultimately win a court case, it may prefer to mediate rather than incur court costs and lawyers' fees, which could swallow a large part of any award received. <P>
With the exception of some disputes involving public interest, mediation is considered to be private and confidential. Pursuant to the Minnesota Civil Mediation Act, all communications and documents, including work notes made and used during mediation, are confidential and cannot be used in a court of law should there be subsequent litigation.<P>
Mediation is currently used to resolve disputes in a wide variety of settings. Whether the dispute is between students, neighbors, businesses, or parties to an accident, whether it involves a claim, governmental agencies, or nations, the mediation process is an effective tool for achieving solutions by mutual agreement rather than by court order.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Mini-Trial</STRONG></H3></A>
In a mini-trial, each party presents its position in trial-like fashion before a panel that can include selected representatives for both parties (such as managers or executives), neutral third parties, or both. Every panel also has one neutral advisor. Mini-trials help to define the issues and develop a basis for realistic settlement negotiations. The representatives from the two sides provide an overview of their positions and arguments to the panel. As a result, each party becomes more knowledgeable about the other party's position. After hearing each side's presentation, the panel and the advisor can meet on their own to develop a compromise solution, as in the mediation process. The third-party neutral advisor may also issue an advisory opinion regarding the merits of the case. The advisory opinion is not binding unless the parties agree beforehand that it will be binding and enter into a written settlement agreement. The primary benefit of a mini-trial is that both parties have an opportunity to develop solutions, since each side has representation and access to detailed information. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Arbitration</STRONG></H3></A>
Like a mini-trial, arbitration allows both parties to present their cases to a neutral third party or a panel of third parties who are experts in a particular area. An arbitration panel differs from a mediation panel because it is chosen by both sides, much like attorneys choose members of a jury. The parties stipulate in advance as to whether the decision of the arbitrator will be binding or nonbinding. If binding, the decision is enforceable in court in the same manner as any other contractual obligation.<P>
Arbitration is best used in cases that involve factual conflicts that can be resolved by experts on a particular subject. For many this is a distinct advantage to arbitration. Many people feel more comfortable knowing their dispute is settled by an expert who is knowledgeable in a particular field, rather than by a judge who is accustomed to handling a wide variety of diverse cases.
Arbitration cases can be as complex and expensive as litigated cases; however, they are usually settled without much publicity. This can be a significant advantage if a dispute involves sensitive issues, such as trade secrets or future business plans, or if the parties prefer to remain out of the public eye. 
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Mediation-Arbitration</STRONG></H3></A>
Mediation-arbitration combines mediation and arbitration. The parties agree in advance that if they are unable to resolve their dispute using mediation, they will seek arbitration and receive an advisory or binding judgment on all or part of the issues which remain in dispute. In these instances, the mediator will typically switch roles and, as the arbitrator, provide the judgment. The mediation-arbitration process has advantages over using arbitration or mediation alone. There is greater incentive for parties to cooperate in the mediation stage of the process because they know that if they are unable to come to an agreement voluntarily, they may have a solution imposed upon them in the arbitration stage. Also, mediation-arbitration can be less expensive, because if the parties cannot agree in the mediation stage, the mediator typically assumes the role of arbitrator in the arbitration stage. Having the same person play both roles saves time and money that would otherwise be spent re-educating a new arbitrator or taking a dispute to court.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Neutral Fact-Finding</STRONG></H3></A>
Neutral fact-finding is an informal process in which an agreed-upon neutral third party is asked to investigate a dispute, usually one involving complex or technical issues. The third party analyzes the facts in the dispute and issues his or her findings in a nonbinding report or recommendation. This process can be especially useful in handling allegations of sexual or racial discrimination within a company. Often, such cases provoke strong emotions and internal division within a company. If both parties are employees of the same company, there may be conflicts of interest that would interfere with a supervisor's or manager's ability to conduct a fair and impartial investigation of an allegation. To avoid the appearance of unfairness, a company may turn to the outside neutral third party in hopes of reaching a settlement all employees will respect.<P>
A variation on the theme of neutral fact-finding is Early Neutral Evaluation (ENE). Parties using ENE have their attorneys present the core of the dispute to a neutral evaluator in the presence of the parties. This occurs after the case is filed in court but before discovery of facts is conducted. The neutral evaluator then gives a candid assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the case. If the parties cannot settle, the neutral evaluator helps narrow the dispute and suggests guidelines for managing discovery.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Summary Jury Trial</STRONG></H3></A>
Summary jury trial is a court-managed process which takes place after a case has been filed but before it reaches trial. In a summary jury trial, each party presents its arguments to a six-person jury. Abbreviated opening and closing arguments, as well as an overview of arguments, are presented. Counsel are usually given one hour each for their presentations, and are limited to presenting information which would be admissible at trial. No testimony is taken from sworn witnesses, and proceedings are generally not recorded. Because the proceedings are nonbinding, rules of evidence and procedure are more flexible than at a normal trial. <P>
The jury renders an advisory, nonbinding decision based on the information provided. The verdict in this setting serves to give counsel and their clients insight into their case, and may suggest a fair basis for settlement of the dispute. If the dispute is not resolved by counsel at or immediately following the summary jury trial proceeding, a pretrial is held before the court to discuss settlement. Cases not disposed of through summary jury trial will be called for trial on the merits within 30 to 60 days of the summary hearing.<P>
A summary jury trial proceeding is typically concluded in half a day, but will on rare occasion extend beyond a full day. The proceedings may be presided over by either a district court judge or a magistrate assigned by the judge.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>ADR Training and Education</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Minnesota's Rules of General Practice now require that to be listed in the State Court Administrator's Roster, all neutrals providing mediation, mediation-arbitration, or mini-trial services receive at least 30 hours of classroom training. This training must include conflict resolution and mediation theory, mediation skills and techniques, a thorough understanding of the mediation process, and standards of mediator conduct.<P>
Neutrals providing arbitration, summary jury trial, or early neutral evaluation services must have at least six hours of classroom training in components of the hearing process, effective management of parties to the process, and rules and statutes that govern the process. Neutral fact finders who are selected for their expertise need not undergo training.<P>
All neutrals providing dispute resolution services must provide the parties with a written statement of qualifications, including educational background and relevant training and experience in the field, before beginning the dispute resolution process.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Finding an ADR Provider</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Several steps should be taken when choosing a provider. Parties should ask potential mediators about their mediation training and substantive knowledge about the issues in dispute. If, after selecting a mediator, any of the parties to the dispute genuinely feels that the mediator has shown bias, has a conflict of interest, or lacks the skills or experience necessary to mediate the case, the concern should be voiced.<P>
There is a wide range of ADR providers with varying levels of specialization, expertise, ability, and quality. The ADR provider chosen will depend on the kind of dispute that exists, whom it is with, how much money is involved, the level of expertise necessary to handle a matter, and how far the parties are into the dispute.<P>
The range of disputes routinely mediated includes consumer complaints, landlord-tenant problems, citizens' complaints against local government, employer-employee disagreements, family matters, and conflicts involving large groups. Some community dispute resolution programs offer juvenile mediation, victim-offender mediation, and post-divorce visitation mediation. ADR providers offer dispute resolution services for these conflicts as well as for large, multi-party disputes. Some providers have special areas of expertise, such as corporate or environmental dispute resolution.<P>
Many ADR providers specialize in the area of divorce and family law. Because of the sensitive issues involved, family and divorce mediators must meet more stringent requirements to be recognized by the court. Court services throughout the state make custody resolution specialists available to mediate a range of issues related to dissolution.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Costs</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The costs of ADR vary depending on the type of dispute, the type of ADR process chosen, and the experience and expertise of the ADR provider. Because community dispute resolution programs use trained, volunteer mediators, there may be no charge for their ADR services. The costs of for-profit ADR providers vary depending upon the experience and expertise of the provider chosen. Some ADR providers charge an hourly rate while others charge a flat fee for handling an entire matter from initiation to resolution. Even where a given ADR provider charges a substantial hourly rate, using ADR can often resolve a dispute quickly, saving the client time and money.

<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Role of Constitutions </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Constitutions are important documents in this country's system of government. The United States Constitution establishes the three branches of the federal government: the legislative or Congress, the judicial or Supreme Court, and the executive or President. It also defines the powers that each of these branches has and the limitations placed on those powers. The Minnesota state constitution plays a similar role in state government. The federal Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and the Minnesota constitution must provide at least as much protection for civil rights as the federal Constitution. Accordingly, this chapter focuses primarily on the law of the federal Constitution.<P>
Constitutional law is very broad and very complex. It includes the actual constitutional text and amendments, and a huge number of cases which attempt to interpret the words of the state and federal constitutions. In constitutional law, more than in any other area of law, there has been a great deal of interpretation of the original documents. Often, reading the constitution itself is only the very beginning of understanding the law of the constitution on a particular subject. In constitutional law, it is essential to become acquainted with the way courts interpret the documents' provisions. The fact that constitutions are such important documents, and that the courts play such a key role in deciding what the documents say, leads to heated battles over the nomination of justices to sit on the federal and states' Supreme Courts. People care about constitutions and who interprets them because they know that constitutions matter.
Despite the importance of constitutional law in our legal system, many of the thorniest issues in constitutional law are of limited interest to the average consumer. Some areas of law that are affected by constitutional analysis are discussed in separate chapters: <A HREF="c15.html">Employment Law</A> , <A HREF="c14.html">Elder Law</A> , <A HREF="c13.html">Criminal Law</A> , and <A HREF="c11.html">Arts, Entertainment &amp; Media Law</A> . Of great interest to everyone, however, is the constitutional law of civil rights. Thus, this chapter focuses primarily on the civil rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution, and the limitations that government can place on those rights. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Civil Rights </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Civil rights include, but are not limited to, the right to freely practice a religion, the right to be free from discrimination, the right to privacy, the right to travel freely, the right to free speech, and the right to peacefully assemble and express opinions against the government. Most of the civil rights American citizens enjoy today were first granted more than 200 years ago when the original thirteen states ratified the Constitution and the first ten amendments to it, known as the Bill of Rights. Consequently, most civil rights law is constitutional law. In a few instances, civil rights are based on statutes rather than a constitution.<P>
One of the most important concepts in constitutional law is that the rights granted in the Constitution are not absolute. Many powers have limits placed upon them. Most of the rights granted in the Constitution must be exercised responsibly or else they conflict with other rights. Most constitutional law is about defining the limits of powers granted in the Constitution or balancing the rights of individuals whose rights are in conflict.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Equal Protection </STRONG></H3></A>
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution says that no state can deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law. While there is no identical provision applicable to the federal government, this right to equal protection is interpreted to apply to the federal government by virtue of the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that the federal government shall not deprive a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. 
Equal protection, in its simplest definition, simply means that laws are supposed to protect people equally. For obvious reasons, however, laws cannot always treat people equally. Government programs to benefit the poor, for example, obviously treat the poor differently from the wealthy. Programs to benefit children treat children differently than adults or they have no effect. Clearly, the government often needs to classify people in order for laws to be effective. Equal protection analysis by courts focuses on whether the classifications the government makes unfairly classify people.<P>
In reviewing a classification, a court applies one of three different standards to a law or action. Each of these standards asks what the goal of a law is and how well the government has chosen a method to reach that goal.<P>
Rational Basis Scrutiny: Rational basis scrutiny is the lowest level of scrutiny the court can apply. Applying this test, a government classification is acceptable so long as it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The government interest need not be a particularly good one, so long as it is a goal that the government may legitimately pursue. The classification chosen need not be an especially effective way of reaching that goal, so long as there is a rational connection between the classification and its goal. Because this standard is so low, courts applying this standard almost never overturn the government's classification.<P>
Intermediate Scrutiny: Intermediate scrutiny is a rarely used standard of review. Courts applying this standard overturn a government classification unless it is substantially related to an important government interest. Here, the government's interest must be more than legitimate as required by the rational basis test, and the classification chosen must be more carefully tailored to meet that goal. <P>
Strict Scrutiny: Strict scrutiny is the highest standard a court can apply in deciding whether a government classification violates a person's right to equal protection. To withstand strict scrutiny, a challenged classification must be necessary to a compelling government interest. Here the means chosen must be so carefully tailored that the action is absolutely necessary and no less restrictive means exist. Also, the government's interest must be compelling, not merely optional or important. Courts applying this standard rarely uphold the challenged classification.
Given these three very different standards, the most important question in most equal protection cases is which of these standards the court applies in reviewing a classification. Plaintiffs alleging that a classification violates equal protection almost always lose if the court applies a rational basis test and they almost always win if the court applies strict scrutiny. The standard that applies is determined by the kind of classification the court reviews. Most challenged classifications receive rational basis scrutiny. The following classifications receive special treatment.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Suspect Classifications </STRONG></H4></A>
Suspect classifications are subject to strict scrutiny. A classification is called suspect because it is likely to be based on an illegally discriminatory intent. The clearest example of a suspect classification is race. History shows that most laws that use race as a way to classify people are based on racial discrimination and have no legitimate purpose. Racial classifications are automatically suspect, so the court applies the highest level of scrutiny and almost always strikes down racial classifications. There is no fixed list of which classifications are suspect, but the Supreme Court typically treats as suspect any classification based on a trait
<UL>
<LI>That is immutable or that cannot be changed
<LI>That is highly visible
<LI>That has historically disadvantaged those with the trait
<LI>Whose holders have historically lacked effective political representation
</UL>
Racial and ethnic classifications are the two suspect classifications most often given strict scrutiny. For example, suppose the State of Minnesota creates a law that says African-Americans have to pay more for drivers' licenses than non-African-Americans. The state might claim it passed the law simply to raise more revenues, but a court reviewing the law under strict scrutiny would strike it down because the classification is not necessary to a compelling purpose. The need for more revenues might be a compelling interest, but a racial classification is not necessary to raise those revenues. The state has other ways it can raise revenues, perhaps by increasing the cost of drivers' licenses for everyone. Suppose, instead, the state passes a law that says people over age 40 have to pay more for driver's licenses than people under age 40. Age is not a suspect classification, so a court reviewing the law would not apply strict scrutiny. A court applying the rational basis test would likely find the law constitutional because it is rationally related to the legitimate government interest in raising more revenues.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Classifications That Infringe Fundamental Rights </STRONG></H4></A>
A number of rights considered fundamental interests also receive the protection of strict scrutiny when a government classification limits these rights. Fundamental interests include most voting rights, marriage, and procreation. For example, suppose a state decides to reduce the amount of money spent on public education by refusing to enroll children born to mixed-race couples. A court reviewing this law would strike it down. Limiting public spending might be a compelling government interest but discouraging mixed-race couples from having children is not necessary to achieve that goal because there are other ways to limit spending that do not infringe the fundamental right to marry and procreate.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Semi-Suspect Classifications </STRONG></H4></A>
Courts apply intermediate scrutiny to a limited number of classifications. Gender classifications, classifications that distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate children, and racial classifications intended to benefit a disadvantaged racial group are examples of semi-suspect classifications. For example, suppose a state decides to create an affirmative action program for Asian-American firefighters because it had discriminated against Asian-American firefighters in the past. A court reviewing this classification would likely apply intermediate scrutiny and ask whether the program is substantially related to the important government interest in remedying its past discrimination. The court's decision would likely turn on how well the state tailored the program and how fairly it implemented its provisions. 
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Due Process </STRONG></H3></A>
The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution says that no state shall deprive a person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. As mentioned earlier, the Fifth Amendment similarly requires the federal government to provide due process. The right to due process is actually two separate guarantees‹procedural due process and substantive due process.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Procedural Due Process </STRONG></H4></A>
Procedural due process is the guarantee that the government will not deprive a person of life, liberty, or property without first giving the person some amount of legal process. <P>
The court uses a two-step balancing analysis to decide procedural due process claims. First, it asks whether there is a property or liberty interest at stake. No process is due unless a person has a liberty or property interest at stake. If a court finds that there is a liberty or property interest at stake, it then asks what process the individual deserves, weighing the private interest, the public interest, and the risk of error from the method chosen by the government. The following examples can illustrate this analysis.<P>
Example 1:
A person applies for a job with the federal government and is turned down with no opportunity for appeal. The applicant claims he or she was denied procedural due process. A court would likely determine that the applicant was not denied procedural due process as he or she had no liberty or property interest in the job yet. Merely hoping for a job does not equal having a property interest in it so no procedural process is due from the government.<P>
Example 2:
A person working for a state agency is fired after receiving repeated warnings about inadequate job performance and given opportunities to improve. He or she claims a denial of procedural due process. Here a court would likely find that the employee has a legally protected interest in keeping his or her job. The court would then ask whether the employee received adequate process weighing the public interest in having competent employees, the employee's interest in keeping his or her job, and the risk of an unfair termination given the process provided. States are aware of their obligation to provide procedural due process, so they establish detailed procedures for employee evaluations. If the person actually received warnings and reviews were fairly done, the court is likely to find there was no denial of procedural due process.<P>
Example 3:
A person receiving food stamps is suddenly denied benefits without any right to appeal. He or she claims a denial of procedural due process. Here a court is likely to find the recipient has a legitimate property interest in continuing to receive assistance and that the risk of unfair termination was high because the recipient received no legal process at all.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Substantive Due Process </STRONG></H4></A> 
Substantive due process is the right to be free from arbitrary or unreasonable government actions. Modern Supreme Court decisions have used substantive due process analysis to decide challenges to government restrictions on personal rights.<P>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG><EM>Privacy </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
There is no right to privacy specifically mentioned in the Constitution. The words "privacy," "abortion," and "contraception" do not appear in the literal words of the Constitution. However, some court decisions have read a right of privacy into other explicit guarantees, such as freedom of association and freedom from unreasonable searches. The right of privacy includes a right to abortion and contraception. 
Decisions affecting the right of privacy are almost always controversial and recent cases have cast doubt on how future courts will analyze substantive due process challenges to these rights, but the following general points stand out.
<UL>
<LI>Laws that forbid exercise of a fundamental right are always struck down as a violation of substantive due process. For example, a law making all abortions illegal would be struck down.
<LI>Laws that make it more difficult to exercise a right without making it impossible are frequently upheld. For example, taxing contraceptives may make it more difficult for some people to exercise the right to contraception but those taxes are still permissible.
<LI>Minors have fewer protections on their fundamental rights than do adults. For example, sales of contraceptives to minors can be limited, and minors can sometimes be required to have parental permission before having an abortion. 
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG><EM>Sexual Orientation </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Courts do not interpret the right of privacy beyond abortion and contraception to include all forms of sexual activity and personal autonomy. For example, the Supreme Court upheld one state's law criminalizing homosexual activity. Thus, the right of privacy is not broad enough to protect homosexual activity. This is an area where state laws can provide greater protection for a person's civil rights than the federal Constitution provides. Minnesota has state laws that prohibit many forms of discrimination based on sexual orientation.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Refusing Medical Treatment </STRONG></H3></A>
Courts have found that the right to refuse medical treatment for one's self is a fundamental right. Thus, many states have passed legislation governing living wills. Living wills are discussed in the <A HREF="c14.html">Elder Law</A> Chapter. Refusing medical treatment is discussed further in this chapter under free exercise of religion.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Military </STRONG></H3></A>
Persons serving in the military have less protection of their civil rights. Courts use more lenient standards when reviewing actions taken by the United States military because several Supreme Court decisions say that the legal system must give the military broad deference for the military to function. Thus, many actions which would be unconstitutional if taken by private parties or a civilian branch of government are not unconstitutional when taken by the military. This explains why the military is allowed to exclude women from many combat positions, can seize and hold military personnel without extending many of the civil rights protections offered to suspects arrested by state police, and has broad authority to exclude homosexuals from serving their country. Because the courts are usually reluctant to overturn military decisions, civil rights advocates often have to turn to the President, who is commander-in-chief of the military, to change military policy.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>State Action </STRONG></H3></A>
The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution limit what states can do. As previously mentioned, the Fourteenth Amendment says that no state can deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the law. The Fifteenth Amendment says that states may not deny citizens the right to vote on account of race, color, or previous servitude. These amendments do not reach the actions of private parties. Thus, in order to strike down an action under these amendments, a plaintiff must show that the action is state action. Some examples of state action are clear. When the state, its counties, municipalities, or state-operated institutions act, those actions are clearly state action. Less clear are actions by private institutions receiving public funds. The lines are murky, but in some cases, the actions of such private institutions are considered state action. 
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Freedom of Speech </STRONG></H3></A>
The First Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to free speech. Like other rights already discussed, the right to free speech is not absolute but must be measured against other rights. Following are some examples of how the right of free speech may be limited:
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Obscenity </STRONG></H4></A> 
Obscenity is not a protected form of free speech, but most non-obscene speech is protected. The reason obscenity is such a controversial area of constitutional law is that people disagree on where the line is between obscene and non-obscene communications. Courts consider a communication obscene if it meets a three-part test:
<UL>
<LI>Prurient Interest. Would a person, applying contemporary community standards and taking the work as a whole, find that the work appeals to the prurient interest in sex?
<LI>Patently Offensive. Is sexual conduct depicted in a way that is patently offensive?
<LI>Lack of Serious Value. Does the work lack serious value?
</UL>
The definition permits different decisions in different parts of the country or state and at different times because it uses contemporary community standards to judge communications. An item might be obscene in Duluth but acceptable in Minneapolis. An item considered obscene a decade ago might be legally protected speech today.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Private Possession </STRONG></H4></A>
Private possession of obscene material is not punishable. Private possession of obscenity is protected by the right of privacy, so states cannot punish possession, although they are free to punish the distribution or display of obscene material. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG>Zoning </STRONG></H4></A>
Even though they cannot regulate the content of books, magazines, and entertainment, states and municipalities are given very wide latitude to regulate where bookstores, movie theaters, and places of live entertainment can operate. Here the right of free speech conflicts with the state interest in orderly planning, so the two interests must be accommodated.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="200"><H4><STRONG>Child Pornography </STRONG></H4></A>
The Supreme Court recognizes that individuals have a free speech interest in materials that portray children in a sexually explicit manner. The Court also recognizes that the state has an important interest in protecting children from sexual exploitation. Therefore, any depictions that use actual children in a sexually explicit manner can be prohibited. Depictions that use older actors pretending to be children or that use idealized drawings are protected speech. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="210"><H4><STRONG>Commercial Speech </STRONG></H4></A>
Commercial speech is speech that advertises a product or service for profit or for a business purpose. Commercial speech is entitled to much less protection than non-commercial speech. Specifically, misleading commercial speech or commercial speech which is a proposal for an unlawful transaction have no protection under the law. Otherwise, the courts give diminished protection to commercial speech weighing the government's interest in restricting a particular kind of speech, whether that interest is directly advanced by the challenged restriction, and whether a less restrictive option is available.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="220"><H2><STRONG>Freedom of Religion </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Many people mistakenly believe that the federal Constitution requires a wall of separation between church and state, and are surprised to learn that the phrase "wall of separation" is not found in the Constitution. The Constitution does not mandate a complete separation between church and state. Clergy persons can hold public office, religious colleges can receive public grants, and the government can require a church to install smoke detectors or other safety equipment. Religion and government play important roles in the lives of many people and the two often overlap, yet the Constitution guarantees religious freedom. <P>
The Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom has two thrusts. The federal government is forbidden to establish a state church and individuals are guaranteed the right to freely exercise their religion. Like the other rights discussed in this chapter, these rights are not absolute.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Establishment </STRONG></H3></A>
The Establishment Clause forbids the establishment of a state church. Cases arising in this area frequently involve whether the state can give aid to a religiously affiliated institution, such as a Christian grade school or a Jewish hospital. Courts usually ask three questions when hearing challenges to government support of religiously affiliated institutions:
<UL>
<LI>Does the aid have a secular purpose?
<LI>Does the aid have a primarily secular effect?
<LI>Does the aid require excessive government entanglement in the affairs of the religious body?
</UL>
Using this test, courts have upheld programs that only incidentally benefit religious schools, such as free busing, but struck down programs that directly benefit the schools, such as paying the salaries of private school teachers.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Free Exercise </STRONG></H3></A>
Cases that allege an infringement of the right to freely exercise one's religion are decided using a three-part balancing test that considers:
<UL>
<LI>Weight of the government interest
<LI>Degree of interference
<LI>Availability of alternate means to achieve the goal
</UL>
Cases decided in this area have produced a few general principles. First, strong government interests can completely override a religious belief. For example, a strong government interest in encouraging monogamy was enough to allow the government to forbid polygamy in the 19th century even though some Mormons believed their religion required polygamy. Second, free exercise claims are stronger when they involve one's own actions than when they involve one's children. For example, freedom of religion allows adults to refuse medical treatment, but a state can often intervene on behalf of children and force parents to seek medical treatment for their children, even where medical treatment violates the parent's religious beliefs.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Consumer Protection
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Consumers enter into transactions every day. From buying a car to contracting for lawn care services, it is important that consumers be smart shoppers to avoid being taken advantage of. Every year thousands of Minnesotans lose money to consumer frauds. Consumer complaints are as varied as the people who make them, but most consumer problems could be avoided if consumers made more informed decisions. This chapter covers the most common consumer complaints and laws designed to protect consumers.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Automobile Buyer Protection</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Automobiles are one of the most common consumer purchases. Purchasing an automobile is one of the most expensive transactions most consumers ever make aside from a house purchase. Yet, despite the frequency of car sales and the large amount of money spent on cars each year, most consumers know very little about the vehicles they buy. The average car today is too complex, with too many systems and parts, for the consumer to master. Add to this the wide variety of models available, and most consumers are forced to rely on the seller's representation that a car is in good working order. Recognizing that car buyers are often at the mercy of car sellers, the State of Minnesota has enacted two principal laws to protect car buyers. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Minnesota Lemon Law</STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota's Motor Vehicle Warranty Law, commonly known as the Minnesota Lemon Law, protects consumers who buy or lease new cars, pickup trucks, and vans in Minnesota. The law contains no warranties of its own. Instead, it puts teeth into the warranties manufacturers and dealers provide by giving consumers a remedy if a dealer or manufacturer fails to honor its written warranties.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Automobiles Covered</STRONG></H4></A>
The Minnesota Lemon Law covers new cars, pickup trucks, and vans purchased in Minnesota. A new vehicle is also covered if it is leased for at least four months. The vehicles must be used at least 40 percent of the time for personal, family, or household use.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Coverage</STRONG></H4></A>
The law applies to any written express warranty on the vehicle for the length of the warranty or for the first two years, whichever is shorter. If the warranty has already expired, the Lemon Law does not apply. The manufacturer or dealer must repair a vehicle in accordance with the warranty if the defect or problem is covered by the warranty and the owner reports it within the warranty period or two years after delivery of the vehicle, whichever comes first. As long as the problem is reported within the warranty period or two years after delivery, the manufacturer or dealer must make repairs, even if the warranty subsequently runs out.
<P>
The law has special provisions for vehicles with serious problems -- the real lemons. If the dealer or manufacturer is unable to repair a vehicle's problem after a reasonable number of attempts, the buyer or person leasing the vehicle has a right to go to the manufacturer's arbitration program or to court and seek a full refund of the purchase or lease price. What constitutes a reasonable number of attempts depends on the problem. A reasonable number is four or more unsuccessful attempts to correct the same problem, more than one unsuccessful attempt to correct a problem that causes a complete failure of the steering or braking system if the defect is likely to cause death or serious bodily harm, or any warranty repairs that cause the vehicle to be out of service for repairs for 30 or more business days.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Exceptions to Coverage</STRONG></H4></A>
The Minnesota Lemon Law does not apply to problems that do not substantially impair either the use or market value of the car. The law does not cover problems resulting from abuse, neglect, or unauthorized alterations to the car.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Minnesota Used Car Warranty Law</STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota has one of the strongest Used Car Warranty Laws in the country. The Minnesota Used Car Warranty Law requires that Minnesota used car dealers provide basic warranty coverage for most used cars and small trucks sold in Minnesota. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Automobiles Covered</STRONG></H4></A>
To be covered, a car or small truck must be purchased primarily for personal or household use. The terms and length of the warranty depend on the car's mileage when purchased. 
For cars with fewer than 36,000 miles, the warranty applies for 60 days or 2500 miles, whichever comes first. Parts covered under the warranty for these cars include:
<UL>
<LI>Engine
<LI>Transmission
<LI>Drive axle
<LI>Brakes
<LI>Steering
<LI>Water pump
<LI>Externally-mounted mechanical fuel pump
<LI>Radiator
<LI>Alternator, generator, and starter
</UL>
For cars with between 36,000 and 75,000 miles, the warranty applies for 30 days or 1000 miles, whichever comes first. For cars in this category all of the parts listed above are covered except:
<UL>
<LI>Steering rack
<LI>Radiator
<LI>Alternator, generator, and starter
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Automobiles Excluded</STRONG></H4></A>
The following vehicles are excluded from coverage:
<UL>
<LI>Cars with 75,000 miles or more
<LI>Cars sold for less than $3000
<LI>Custom-built or custom-modified cars
<LI>Cars eight years of age or older
<LI>Cars purchased primarily for use in a business or farm
<LI>Vehicles with gross vehicle weight above 9000 pounds
<LI>Vehicles manufactured in very small quantities
<LI>Vehicles not meeting federal emission standards 
<LI>Diesel engine cars
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Warranty</STRONG></H4></A>
If a part covered by the used car warranty malfunctions during the warranty period, the dealer must repair or replace the part at no charge to the buyer. The buyer must promptly notify the dealer and arrange for the automobile to be taken to the dealer for inspection and repair. The dealer has the choice to correct the defective part or to refund the purchase price of the vehicle minus a reasonable deduction for use of the vehicle. The buyer does not have the right to demand a refund. If a part is repaired under the warranty, the warranty for that part is extended for an additional warranty period. The warranty does not cover any problems if:
<UL>
<LI>Problem is the result of normal wear and tear.
<LI>Problems result from collision, abuse, negligence, or lack of adequate maintenance.
<LI>Part is covered by an original factory warranty.
<LI>Manufacturer agrees to repair the part at no charge.
</UL>
If the dealer refuses to fix a problem covered by the warranty, the buyer can bring a lawsuit against the dealer within one year after the warranty expires. The consumer may bring this action in Conciliation Court, where procedures are relatively informal and the consumer need not be represented by an attorney.
<P>
A consumer can waive the warranty for a specific part if the dealer discloses in writing that the part has a defect, malfunction, or repair problem and the buyer circles the statement and signs next to it.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Warranty Providers</STRONG></H4></A>
The warranty described above applies only if the consumer buys from a used car dealer. Anyone in the business of selling used cars who sells more than five used cars a year is considered a dealer and is required to get a license from the state. If someone sells more than five used cars a year but does not get a license from the state, they are still considered a dealer even though unlicensed. The warranty does not apply if the consumer buys a used car from: 
<UL>
<LI>His or her employer
<LI>A bank or other financial institution
<LI>A company that previously leased the car to the consumer
<LI>Any branch of the state, a county, or a city in Minnesota
<LI>An auctioneer selling the car in connection with the sale of other property or land 
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Telephone and Mail Fraud</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
While many reputable firms use the telephone and the postal service to do business, these tools may be used to defraud consumers. The following scams frequently cross many lines. For example, telephone frauds can use promises of prizes, or mail frauds can attempt to get consumers' credit card numbers. The important lesson is for consumers to be aware of attempts to defraud them.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Telemarketing Fraud</STRONG></H3></A>
It is wise to be skeptical about offers made over the telephone, because the telephone can be used for a variety of scams. Often, telemarketing scams are versions of other scams described in this section. Legitimate businesses using the telephone to reach customers should be willing to take the time to explain the product or service and to send information in the mail if a consumer is truly interested in an offer. Sure signs that an offer is not legitimate include pressuring a consumer to act quickly, offering to send someone to the consumer's home to pick up a check or cash immediately, insisting on a credit card number or checking account number, and offering prizes only after the consumer buys a product from the company.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Credit Card Scams</STRONG></H3></A>
Credit cards are popular with shoppers because they provide a convenient, easy way to make purchases without carrying money. Unfortunately, credit card holders are also an easy target for fraud. Anyone who obtains a credit card number can instantly use that number to defraud its owner and the credit card issuer, so it is wise to guard one's credit card numbers at all times. A common method used by crooks to get credit card numbers is to convince innocent cardholders to give the numbers over the telephone. To combat telephone credit card fraud, a person should never give out a credit card number over the telephone unless he or she initiates the call and is purchasing something. 
<P>
The office of the Minnesota Attorney General reports that a very common credit card scam is for con artists to phone a home telling the person who answers that he or she has won a prize and need only provide a credit card number to verify his or her identity. Another common scam is for a con artist to phone a consumer and claim to be an employee of a credit card company seeking cooperation from the cardholder to catch a con artist. In this scam, the caller claims to be investigating credit card scams and asks for the victim's credit card number in order to set a trap to catch the con artist. Of course, no credit card company actually does this, and no one should ever give his or her credit card number to anyone using this scam. 
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Prize Mailings</STRONG></H3></A>
Every year thousands of Minnesotans receive letters telling them they have won a prize in a contest. These letters often sound too good to be true and probably are. The letters usually seem quite believable since they are printed on good stationery, sound very convincing, and have senders with official-sounding names. What the victim does not realize is that, in order to claim a prize, he or she must pay inflated delivery costs or processing fees, give out a credit card number, or make an expensive long-distance telephone call. Often the prizes are either nonexistent or of very little value. A legitimate prize has no strings attached whatsoever. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>Home Solicitations</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
While legitimate businesses use home solicitations to reach new customers, this method of doing business may attract unscrupulous people. 
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Door-To-Door Sales</STRONG></H3></A>
The intent behind many door-to-door cons is to pressure the consumer into an impulse purchase. Anyone trying to con a consumer does not want the consumer to think about an offer or to compare prices. Most door-to-door salespeople can be politely refused. No one should feel obligated to let a stranger into their home simply because the stranger appears at the door claiming to be selling a product. If someone wants to do business with a door-to-door salesperson, it is best to get all the terms of the deal and any guarantees in writing. 
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Insurance Fraud</STRONG></H3></A>
Every year the State of Minnesota receives many complaints about fraudulent insurance agents who visit their victims' homes. To sell insurance legally, a person must have a license from the state and an appointment from a legitimate insurance company. Some of the worst scams occur when a person who was formerly a licensed and appointed agent attempts to swindle consumers and disappears before the fraud is discovered. These frauds are convincing because the seller has legitimate experience selling insurance policies legally. When such persons decide to operate outside the law, they seem virtually indistinguishable from a legitimate agent.
<P>
Anyone suspecting that they may not be dealing with a legitimate insurance agent should check with both the state and the insurance company about the agent's status. In Minnesota, questions about insurance fraud should be directed to the Enforcement and Licensing Division of the Department of Commerce at 133 East Seventh Street, St. Paul, MN 55101, (612) 296-2488.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Three-Day Cooling Off Law</STRONG></H3></A>
In response to the fraud so commonly associated with home solicitations, Minnesota has passed laws that protect consumers from home solicitation fraud. The most important of these is commonly called the three-day cooling off law. This law covers anyone offering consumer goods or services away from their traditional place of doing business. This includes traditional door-to-door solicitations and other sales made at temporary locations, such as county fairs or in hotel or motel rooms. Phone solicitations and person-to-person solicitations may also be covered. Sales persons covered by this law are required to tell the consumer, before they say anything else, their name, the name of the company they represent, and the product or service they are selling. It is against the law to misrepresent their identity as a salesperson. They cannot misrepresent the true purpose of the deal or the true identity of the company and they cannot misrepresent the true cost of the good or service by failing to mention additional hidden but required costs. The seller is required to provide a copy of any contract the consumer signs and must give notice of the buyer's right to cancel the contract (if for more than $25) within three business days. To cancel the contract, the buyer must give written notice to the seller within three days. The Minnesota Attorney General's Office recommends that any written notice of cancellation be sent by certified mail with return receipt requested so that the consumer has proof that the cancellation was sent and received. The three-day cooling off law does not apply to real estate, insurance, securities, or motor vehicle sales.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Get-Rich-Quick Schemes</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Many scams take advantage of the get-rich-quick dream with very little effort. 
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Work-at-Home Scams</STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesotans are frequently the victims of work-at-home schemes that promise to pay a lot of money in return for easy, no-experience-required work that can be done at home, such as light assembly or addressing labels. Senior citizens and the disabled are especially vulnerable to such scams because the scams appear to offer a way to supplement one's income without leaving home. Many work-at-home schemes are frauds requiring the victims to purchase expensive materials from the company with no guarantee that the finished product will be purchased. Often they are pyramid schemes as described below. Anyone interested in work at home should first contact the Minnesota Attorney General's Office or the Better Business Bureau.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Pyramid Schemes</STRONG></H3></A>
A pyramid scheme is an illegal plan in which a large number of people at the bottom of a pyramid pay money to relatively few people at the top. New participants are recruited with the promise that, if they pay now, they can move up the pyramid and profit from later recruits. Pyramid schemes are illegal and deceptive because they are mathematically doomed to failure. No matter how long the scheme continues, eventually the majority of participants are cheated. 
<P>
Most people are smart enough to stay away from pure pyramid schemes that ask new recruits to pay money to be included in a pyramid. To hide the true nature of the rip-off, pyramid creators often hide a pyramid scheme behind what looks like a legitimate business. Rather than simply ask a new recruit to pay money to join a pyramid, a recruiter might claim to be selling a product to the new recruit. In exchange for paying an inflated price for a product, the new recruit is given the chance to become a dealer or distributor of the product. In this way, the new recruit winds up paying money to the people at the top of the pyramid and recruiting others for the lower level of the pyramid. The distinguishing feature of these scams is that those at the top of the pyramid make more money from their own distributors than from the sale of products. The emphasis in such organizations is on maintaining a steady stream of new dealers and distributors rather than actually marketing a product. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="230"><H2><STRONG>Specific Businesses</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There are many different ways to make money legitimately in Minnesota. Unfortunately, certain businesses have been particularly plagued by unscrupulous business practices. While the majority of people involved in the following businesses are honest, the State of Minnesota has passed special legislation to curb abuses in these businesses.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Hearing Aid Sales</STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota has laws specifically designed to protect consumers of hearing aids against fraud. Anyone selling hearing aids must hold a permit from the Minnesota Department of Health. 
<P>
Prohibited practices include engaging in conduct likely to deceive or defraud, fee-splitting, abusive or fraudulent selling procedures, and high-pressure sales tactics. Buyers must have a recommendation or a prescription to purchase a hearing aid. The seller of hearing aids in Minnesota must provide a written 30-day money-back guarantee that permits the buyer to cancel the sale for any reason during that time. Anyone repairing a hearing aid must provide the consumer with an itemized bill. Penalties for violating hearing aid sales laws include criminal prosecution and civil penalties. 
<P>
<A NAME="250"><H3><STRONG>Funerals, Burial, and Cremation</STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesotans spend millions of dollars on funeral services each year, making the funeral business a very big industry. Yet for all the money spent each year on funeral goods and services, the average consumer knows very little about the goods and services offered or the laws regulating their sale. It is wise to shop around for burial and funeral services just like any other consumer purchase. Most funeral directors in Minnesota are hard-working professionals who strive to provide a needed service to their customers for a fair price. Unfortunately, the industry has attracted a few unscrupulous people who take advantage of people at a time when they are particularly vulnerable. 
The Federal Trade Commission's Funeral Practices Trade Regulation Rule, as well as a number of Minnesota state regulations, regulate this industry. These laws are designed to prevent fraud by making members of the general public better educated consumers of funeral goods and services. The federal rule is complicated, but there are some important points to know. Funeral directors must make their prices available over the phone and a general price list available at the start of any discussions with a consumer. At the conclusion of discussions, a funeral director must provide an itemized statement reflecting the goods and services chosen by the consumer. 
<P>
Embalming is not required under Minnesota law unless the deceased died of a communicable disease or if the body will take more than 18 hours to reach its final burial destination, will not be buried or cremated within 72 hours of death, or is to be publicly transported outside the state. Unless required by law, a funeral director must first obtain permission before embalming. A funeral director may not require a casket before a cremation, although a simple container is required. The federal rule forbids a funeral director from representing that state or local laws require embalming or a casket for cremation when they do not. It is an unfair or deceptive act for a provider of funeral goods and services to fail to furnish price information on each of the specific goods or services offered.
<P>
<A NAME="260"><H3><STRONG>Debt Collection Agencies</STRONG></H3></A>
State and federal laws limit the kinds of activities that a collection agency can engage in as it tries to collect a debt. These laws only apply to third-party collection agencies and not to in-house collections. That is, if the XYZ Dress Shop tries on its own to induce its delinquent customers to pay overdue bills, it is not required to obey the laws governing collection agencies. But if XYZ's owner turns collection matters over to ABC Collection Agency, ABC's employees must follow the rules outlined below. 
<P>
Collection agencies are usually paid on commission and only make money if they collect from debtors. Collection agencies typically keep between 30 and 50 percent of what they collect. There is a powerful incentive to be very aggressive in trying to induce someone to pay an overdue bill. Debt collection laws are designed to ensure that an agency's natural aggressiveness does not cross over the line into harassment or manipulation.
<P>
Anyone weary of a collection agency's efforts can stop future contact by writing the agency a letter stating that he or she no longer wishes to be contacted about the debt. The agency must stop contacting the debtor, except to tell the debtor that it is stopping its collection efforts or that it will sue to collect the debt. A major drawback to taking this route is that it might cause the agency to initiate legal action, in which case the debtor may have to pay court fees and attorney fees in order to defend himself or herself. If a debtor disputes the amount of money owed, he or she can write the collection agency requesting that it provide proof of the debt. The agency must then verify the debt before it can resume efforts to collect the debt.
<P>
Debt collectors must be discreet when contacting a debtor about a debt. The debtor can ask debt collectors not to call at work. If a collector calls someone at work, the collector cannot tell a boss or leave a message with a secretary that he or she is trying to collect a debt. A Minnesota law passed in 1993 prohibits collectors from contacting a debtor's neighbors and asking them to tell the debtor to call the collection agency. Finally, debt collectors cannot harass a debtor, for example, they cannot call in the middle of the night, use vulgar language, or threaten physical harm to someone.
<P>
Most collection agencies know these laws and obey them because the penalties for not doing so are rather severe. Anyone with good evidence that a collection agency has violated any of these laws can sue the agency. If the debtor wins, the court can make the collection agency pay the debtor the money lost as a result of the agency's illegal actions. In addition, the court can punish the agency by making it pay up to $1,000. The court may even make the agency reimburse the debtor for the money spent to hire an attorney.
<P>
<A NAME="270"><H3><STRONG>Consumer Reporting Agencies</STRONG></H3></A>
Many consumer reporting agencies collect and disseminate information on an individual's credit history, arrest record, and whether the person has ever filed for bankruptcy. The most common type of consumer report is the credit report. Consumer reports can be used by creditors, insurers, and employers in deciding whether to extend credit, underwrite insurance policies, or to employ a job applicant. The Minnesota Access to Reports Act and the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act give consumers rights in dealing with consumer reporting agencies. Both of these laws are designed to curb abuses in credit reporting and enable individuals to have mistakes in their credit reports corrected. The federal law is more extensive than the state law and provides greater protection for the consumer. The federal law limits who can receive copies of reports, limits what reports can be used for, and provides federal civil penalties for non-compliance. 
<P>
Under the federal law, if a consumer application for credit is denied, the creditor must tell the applicant if the application was denied because of information contained in a credit report. The creditor is required to tell the consumer which reporting agency issued the report. In many situations, the consumer can get a copy of the information in his or her report and the sources of that information. If employment, credit, or insurance is denied on the basis of information contained in a consumer report, the consumer has a right to receive a copy of the report free of charge. The consumer is given an opportunity to dispute items contained in a consumer report. 
Under the state law, the consumer has a right to request a copy of his or her report once every 12 months. The consumer can be required to pay for reasonable copying charges, not to exceed eight dollars, and has a right to dispute items in the report. The primary benefit of the state law is that it gives consumers a state cause of action for non-compliance.
<P>
<A NAME="280"><H3><STRONG>Truth in Repairs Act</STRONG></H3></A>
Shops in Minnesota doing repairs on automobiles, appliances, and dwellings which are used primarily for personal or household purposes are governed by the Truth in Repairs Act. To be governed by the law, a repair must cost more than $100 but less than $2000 and not be for a business or agricultural purpose. The law gives consumers a right to request a written estimate for repair work and prohibits shops from charging more than ten percent over their estimate unless the consumer expressly gives his or her authorization. Shops can fulfill their obligation to provide a written estimate if they provide an oral estimate before getting authorization to work and they provide a written estimate on completion of the repairs. 
<P>
The law prohibits unnecessary or unauthorized repairs and requires a shop to provide a customer with an invoice whenever work performed costs more than $50 or is performed under a manufacturer's warranty, a service contract, or pursuant to an insurance policy. If, after commencing an authorized repair, a shop discovers the need for additional repairs, the shop must notify the consumer of the additional repairs, give a written estimate, and receive authorization to make those repairs.
<P>
In many instances, a consumer can get his or her car or appliance back without paying an entire bill if that bill includes unauthorized repairs or charges that exceed the estimate by more than ten percent. If the shop refuses to return the item, a consumer or the Attorney General can file a lawsuit to recover the item, reasonable attorney fees, and consequential and punitive damages. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="290"><H2><STRONG>Minnesota Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Minnesota Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act prohibits a number of activities including: 
<UL>
<LI>Fraud 
<LI>False pretenses 
<LI>False promises
<LI>Misrepresentation
<LI>Misleading statements 
<LI>Referrals or chain selling 
</UL>
Remedies generally available include injunction against the fraudulent practice, but the law provides additional penalties if the violation is against a senior citizen or disabled person. An additional fine up to $10,000 per violation can be imposed at the discretion of the court, and private citizens victimized by the fraud are authorized to sue for damages, legal costs, attorneys fees, and other equitable relief.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Contract Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
A contract is simply a legally binding agreement between parties to do or not do something. Consumers enter into contracts for many reasons. An agreement to buy a car or buy a home typically involves a contract. If one hires a service to maintain her lawn, a contract is created. There are several factors to look at to determine whether a contract has been made. Once a contract has been created, it must be determined if there are any issues on the contract's validity. Finally, if there has been a breach of the contract, there is a question of whether damages have occurred.
<P>
This chapter summarizes the elements of a contract, factors that may affect the validity of a contract, and damages if a contract is breached. One should always read and understand a document before agreeing to be held to its contents. Before one enters into a contract with major implications, an attorney experienced in the subject matter of the contract should be consulted. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Contract Components</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There are three elements that must be present for a contract to exist: an offer, acceptance, and consideration. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Offer</STRONG></H3></A>
The first step to a contract is an offer. An offer is a statement, written or spoken, by a party of his or her intention to be held to a commitment upon the acceptance of the offer. There are a number of factors to look at to determine whether a statement constitutes an offer. 
<UL>
<LI>Is the person making the offer serious? A person who jokingly states that he will sell his new house for $100 is not making an offer. 
<LI>Does the statement show a willingness of the party to be held to its contents? A person requesting a price quote or opening negotiations is not making an offer. Advertisements are usually seen as invitations to offers. 
<LI>Does the statement contain definite terms with regard to the subject matter? Is the subject matter identified, are parties identified, is the price set, are quantities determined, and is time for performance stated? There should be enough information contained in the statement that, if needed, a court would be able to enforce the contract or determine the damages.  
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Acceptance</STRONG></H3></A>
In order for an acceptance of an offer to be valid, the acceptance must be made while the offer is still open. In some situations, the person making the offer gives a definite time frame (I will sell you my car for $200 but you must decide whether to buy it within two days). Other ways an offer may end include: the person making the offer withdraws the offer, the person who receives the offer rejects it, or reasonable time passes after the offer is made. Also, if the subject matter of the offer is destroyed before acceptance, the offer terminates.
<P>
If a person changes the conditions of the offer in responding, the offer is rejected and a counteroffer is made (I will buy your car, but I will pay only $150 for it). In this scenario, the person who made the original offer responds to the new offer by accepting or rejecting it, or proposing yet another offer. 
<P>
There are two ways a person can accept an offer, either by promising to do or not do something, or by performing the desired act. In the first type, a person promises to pay $150 for a car. This is a bilateral contract. In the second type, a homeowner offers a neighbor $10 to cut his grass and she cuts his grass; the neighbor accepts the offer by performing the act requested. This is a unilateral contract.  
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Consideration</STRONG></H3></A>
Consideration is a legal concept which describes something of value that is given in exchange for a performance or a promise to perform. Consideration can be a promise to do something there is no legal obligation to do, or a promise to not do something there is a legal right to do. Promises to exchange money, goods, or services are forms of consideration. All parties in an agreement must give consideration in order to create a contract. Courts typically do not look at the adequacy of consideration unless there is evidence of some type of wrongdoing by the party benefiting most from the contract. It is consideration that distinguishes contracts from gifts. Consideration gives value to the promises that are exchanged.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Defenses to Contract</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>  
Once it is determined that there is a contract, it must be determined whether there are any defenses which call into question the validity of the contract. There are some defenses which make the contract unenforceable (void) and other defenses which may give the parties the option to enforce the contract or not. 
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Legality of the Contract</STRONG></H3></A>
Although two persons may exchange an offer, acceptance, and consideration, if the subject matter of the contract is illegal, a valid, enforceable contract does not exist. For example, if a person offers to pay another person money for illegal drugs, this is a void contract. 
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Capacity of the Parties</STRONG></H3></A>
In order to be bound to a contract, the parties must be competent to enter into such a legal arrangement. Underage persons, persons who are mentally ill, and intoxicated persons are usually not held to the contracts they enter. However, a minor may have the option of enforcing the contract. 
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Mistake, Duress, and Fraud</STRONG></H3></A>
A mutual mistake by both parties to a contract on an important issue makes the contract unenforceable. However, a mistake by only one party does not necessarily make the contract void. 
Duress is the use of force or pressure by one party to make the other party agree to the contract. The force does not have to be physical -- one could be put under mental duress. The use of duress makes the contract voidable by the party under duress.
<P>
Fraud is the intentional misrepresentation of an important issue of the contract. The presence of fraud in a contractual proceeding makes the contract voidable by the party upon whom the fraud was perpetrated. 
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Unconscionability</STRONG></H3></A>
A contract may be unenforceable if it is found by a court to be flagrantly unfair. This defense is usually found in consumer cases, where a person buys an item under terms so grossly unfair to the customer that the court refuses to enforce the contract. 
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Statute of Frauds</STRONG></H3></A>
Contracts, in many instances, do not have to be in writing to be legally binding. However, a law known as the Statute of Frauds requires that some contracts must be written to be valid. Contracts involving the sale of real estate, contracts concerning the sale of goods worth more than $500, contracts that cannot be performed within one year, contracts to pay off someone else's debts, leases for more than one year, and contracts concerning a marriage must be in writing. 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Parol Evidence Rule</STRONG></H3></A>
Although not a defense to a contract, the parol evidence rule may affect the contents of a contract and how a contract is enforced. The parol evidence rule applies once parties have come to a final, written contract. Once there is a final, written contract between the parties, the parol evidence rule forbids the introduction in a court proceeding of any previous agreements between the parties on the subject matter of the contract. The parol evidence rule permits the judge or jury in a contract dispute to only look at the written contract and not any previous discussions between the parties. The impact of the parol evidence rule is that all factors which are important to the contract and have been decided by the parties should be stated in the final, written contract. The parol evidence rule does not forbid the introduction of subsequent agreements between the parties. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Contract Termination</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once there is a valid contract between parties, it can end in several ways. A contract may have a limited time span and finish at the end of the stated time. If a person is hired to work for two weeks, the contract concludes at the end of two weeks. In many instances where there is a specific time frame stated in the contract, parties to the contract may have the option to extend the contract for a longer period of time. Contracts may also be project, not time, specific. Goods or services may be contracted for a project and upon the completion of the project, the contract for these goods or services ends. Parties to a contract may mutually agree to rescind the contract. In that case, the parties may agree on the duties and responsibilities of each party after the rescission. 
<P>
A contract also may end because of a breach. A breach occurs when a person does not fulfill his or her responsibilities as promised in the contract. A breach may be minor or major. A minor breach is one that affects small, minor details of the agreement and may not affect the outcome of the contract. However, a major breach is one that does affect the subject matter of the contract and may affect the outcome of the contract. This is also known as a breach of a material issue. When there has been a breach in a contract, the question of damages is raised.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Damages</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The damages due to a party when there is a contract breach depend on many factors. Who is the breaching party, what damages are incurred, what does the contract state with regard to damages, is the breach material or not, and what is the subject matter of the contract? When a person is damaged by a contract breach, courts usually award only foreseeable damages. Foreseeable damages are those damages that the parties anticipate or should anticipate at the time the contract is formed.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Money Damages</STRONG></H3></A>
In most cases when an injury results from a contract breach, the injured party receives money damages. The court places the person in the position he would have been in if the contract had been performed. For example, if a homeowner contracts with a person to paint a house for $500, the painter might stop in the middle of the job and refuse to finish painting. If the homeowner finds another painter to finish the job at an additional cost of $150, the damages are $150. Although one is entitled to the money difference between what was promised and what it costs to complete the promise, the injured party must mitigate to collect damages. Mitigation means the injured party takes reasonable steps to limit the extent of the injury and finish the job. So in the previous example, the homeowner could not hire a famous painter from Italy to finish painting the house and expect the first painter to pay for the extra expense of plane fare and room and board.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Specific Performance</STRONG></H3></A>
There are some situations where money damages are inadequate. Typically in contracts involving the sale of land, awarding money damages for a breach does not put the non breaching party in the same position he or she would have been if the contract were fulfilled. Because real estate is unique, one cannot simply go out and buy property which is the same as originally contracted. In cases such as this, a remedy called specific performance may be awarded by the court. The court may order the breaching party to perform the duties required by the contract. The use of specific performance is rare. Only in cases where the subject matter of the contract is unique, and it is difficult to put a monetary amount on the damage incurred as a result of the breach, is specific performance ordered. Specific performance is not awarded in personal service contracts. So in the previous example, the court would not order the original painter to complete the job.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Liquidated Damages</STRONG></H3></A>
In an attempt to set monetary damage amounts in cases where it may be difficult, some contracts have provisions that specify the amount of damages in event of a breach. Such predetermined damages are called liquidated damages. An example is when a person puts down earnest money for a house and later changes his mind. In a real estate contract with a liquidated damage provision, he may forfeit the earnest money to the seller as a damage award.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Rescission</STRONG></H3></A>
In most contract disputes, a court puts the non breaching party in the position he would have been in if the contract had not been breached. However, there are times when the court may place the party in the position he was in before the contract was executed. In cases where there was a mutual mistake on the subject matter of the contract, the parties may be returned to their positions before the contract. In this case, if the parties have exchanged goods or money, those items are returned to the other party. This remedy may also be selected in cases where there was an intentional misrepresentation of a material fact by one party.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Intellectual Property
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Whether a person is an aspiring author writing the great American novel or a tinkerer who hopes to invent an indispensable product, the issue of intellectual property and its accompanying legal rights is raised. 
<P>
Intellectual property is the expression of ideas through the creation of an item. This creation could be a song, a poem, a company logo, or an invention. 
<P>
Intellectual property may have certain rights under the law. Although an author or inventor may be granted these rights, it is up to the person, not the court system, to protect his or her interests. If infringement -- the unauthorized use of subject matter -- occurs, the person who has the right may go to court to seek a remedy for the infringement.  
<P>
There are different categories of intellectual property. Which category is applicable depends on the particular subject matter in question. A copyright protects the interests in an original writing while a patent protects the interests in an invention.  
<P>
Intellectual property law can be very technical and complicated. An attorney with experience in the particular intellectual property area should be consulted to adequately protect one's intellectual property interests. This chapter summarizes three types of intellectual property protection: copyright, patents, and trademarks. 
<P>
The <A HREF="c11.html">Arts, Entertainment &amp; Media Law</A> Chapter discusses intellectual property issues which may concern persons in those fields. The <STRONG><A HREF="../../mnhome.html">Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Minnesota Business Guide</A></STRONG> has additional intellectual property information and a list of attorneys.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Copyright </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A copyright is the exclusive legal right given to a creator of original literary or artistic work. Copyright protection is provided by federal law. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Copyright Coverage </STRONG></H3></A>
Copyright protection is granted to original works of authorship fixed in a tangible form of expression. Authorship includes literary works, such as novels, poems, and short stories; musical works, including any accompanying words; dramatic works, including any accompanying music, dance works, paintings, photographs, sculptures, movies, and sound recordings; and architectural works. Copyright protection applies to a wide range of expression, from computer software to advertisements. What all of these items have in common is an original expression of an idea. Copyright applies to the expression of the idea, not the idea.  
<P>
Copyright is separate from the subject matter of the copyright. For example, if a person buys a painting from an artist, he buys the painting only and not the copyright. If the buyer makes copies of the painting and sells them, he is infringing on the artist's copyright.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Copyright Creation </STRONG></H3></A> 
Copyright protection originates from the time the work is created. A work does not have to be published in order to receive copyright protection. Copyright gives the creator of the work the exclusive right to reproduce the work, prepare other works based upon copyrighted work, distribute copies, perform the work, and display the work. An owner of a copyright can sell one, some, or all of these exclusive rights. For example, an author of a novel can sell the movie rights to one person and the paperback rights to another. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Copyright Owner </STRONG></H3></A>
The owner of a copyright is typically the creator of the work. However, when a person is employed by another and creates the work while doing her job, the copyright is owned by the employer, not the employee. This is known as work made for hire. If a person hires an independent contractor to create a work, he or she should address the copyright ownership up front. One does not necessarily own the copyright for an item that an independent contractor creates on the job. In this situation, the parties should decide who owns the copyright and whether the work is work made for hire.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Notice </STRONG></H3></A>
There are no applications to fill out in order to have copyright protection. As stated previously, copyright is created when a work is created. However, a person may give notice that the work is copyrighted and register a copyright.  
<P>
For works created after March 1, 1989, it is no longer required to place a copyright notice on the work. However, it is a good idea to place the copyright notice on all creative works to give notice of the copyright claim. If there is an infringement of a copyright, a court will not allow the party who infringed to claim that he did not know that the work was copyrighted if a notice was placed on the work.
A copyright notice contains three parts: 
<UL>
<LI>The word "Copyright," the abbreviation "Copr.," or the &copy; symbol
<LI>The year the work was first published
<LI>The name of the copyright owner
</UL>
The federal law states that the notice should be placed in a manner and location to give reasonable notice of the copyright claim. When one places a copyright notice on a work, it should be in a conspicuous location.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Registration </STRONG></H3></A>
Besides placing a copyright notice on an original work, a person may also register the copyright. Registering a copyright is not required, but it provides three benefits: first, a presumption that the copyright claim is valid; second, the award of attorney fees and statutory damages in an infringement case; and finally, copyright registration is a prerequisite to bring an action for copyright infringement.  
<P>
Registering a copyright is relatively straightforward. In general, the registration should be done within three months of publication. A person must complete an application supplied by the Library of Congress, Copyright Office, and return the form with a filing fee and copies of the work. The number of copies to be supplied depends on whether the work has been published, whether the work has been published outside the United States, or if the work is a contribution to a collective work.  
<P>
Copyright protection lasts a limited time. The time period depends on when the work was created and whether or not it was published. Generally, works created on or after January 1, 1978, have copyright protection from the time of creation throughout the creator's life, plus an additional 50 years. For works made during the course of employment, the duration of copyright is 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever is shorter.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Fair Use </STRONG></H3></A>
Although a copyright gives its owner exclusive rights, fair use of a copyrighted work is not considered an infringement of copyright. Fair use includes copying for purposes such as news reporting, teaching, research, and comments and criticisms. Factors to be considered in determining whether use is fair use include purpose of the use, whether the use is for profit or not, amount of the work used, and effect of the use upon the value of the work. There also are exceptions for libraries and teachers.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Patents </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A patent is a right granted by the federal government to an inventor to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention. The rationale behind patents is to reward an inventor for the time and efforts used in the creation of an invention. A patent is granted for a limited time period. After a patent expires, the inventor loses the exclusive rights to the invention. A patent protects an invention only in this country. If an inventor wishes to have protection in other countries, those countries' patent procedures must be followed.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Patent Categories </STRONG></H3></A> 
An invention must be new, useful (except for design patents, which must be ornamental), and not obvious in order to be granted a patent. There are three categories of patents.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Utility Patents </STRONG></H4></A> 
A utility patent is granted to anyone who invents or discovers any new or useful process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or any improvement thereof. "Process" means a process or method. A new industrial or technical process may be patented. "Manufacture" refers to the articles that are made. "Composition of matter" relates to chemical compositions and includes mixtures of ingredients as well as new compounds. A utility patent is granted for a term of 17 years. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Design Patents </STRONG></H4></A> 
A design patent is granted to anyone who invents a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture. The appearance of the article is protected under this patent. A design patent is granted for a term of 14 years.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Plant Patents </STRONG></H4></A>
A plant patent is granted to any person who invents or discovers and asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant. The plants may include any mutants, hybrids, and newly found seedlings, except a tuber-propagated plant or a plant found in an uncultivated state. A plant patent is granted for a term of 17 years.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Application </STRONG></H3></A>
In order for a patent to be granted to an inventor, an application for a patent must be filed. A patent application is made to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. A patent application is confidential; however, if a patent is granted, the application becomes public information. 
<P>
The application includes three components. First is a written document that describes the invention and states the claims of the inventor. The statement must be in such detail that a person knowledgeable in the subject matter area could build and use the invention based upon the information provided. The claims state the patented characteristics of the invention. This document must also contain a declaration by the inventor that he believes himself to be the original and first inventor of the application's subject matter. The declaration must be notarized. 
<P>
The second component of the application is drawings. Drawings of an invention should be furnished to illustrate an invention. An inventor should supply as many drawings as necessary to describe the invention.  
<P>
The third requirement is the filing fee. The fees may be reduced by 50 percent if the patent applicant is an individual, small business, or a nonprofit organization. 
<P>
After a patent application is filed, a Patent Examiner reviews the application. The Examiner can allow the patent, reject the application, or object to the application. A rejection means that the Examiner believes the invention should not be granted a patent, while an objection means that there is a problem with the application. A problem with the application can be fixed. An inventor can amend her patent application to address the concerns raised by the Examiner. An inventor may appeal a patent rejection.  
<P>
A patent will not be granted if the invention was in public use or on sale in the United States, or is the subject of a patent application in another county that has matured for more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application. An inventor's own use of the invention may bar her from receiving a patent if the invention was used for more than one year before a patent application was made.  
<P>
Patents are granted only to the inventor; however, an inventor may sell her rights to the patent or sell licenses whereby another can pay a fee to use the patent. The license may be exclusive or nonexclusive. If the rights to a patent are assigned, this assignment should be registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  
<P>
Before an inventor applies for a patent, a search should be done to determine whether a patent already has been granted for the invention. This search may be expensive. The Public Search Room of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is the primary source of information. Also, a Patent and Trademark Depository Library has been established at the Minneapolis Public Library and Information Center. 
<P>
When a patent is granted, an inventor must pay an issuance fee. Also, maintenance fees for the patent are paid three times during the patent period to keep the patent in force. 
<P>
Minnesota statutes require any invention development services in Minnesota to disclose the number of customers who have received additional money by virtue of the work done by  the invention developer service. 
<P>
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office maintains a register of attorneys and agents who meet the legal, scientific, and technical requirements to practice patent law, and who agree to uphold high standards of professional conduct. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Trademarks </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER> 
A trademark is either a word, phrase, symbol, or design, or a combination of those items that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods or services of one party from those of others. A service mark is the same except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product. This section will use the terms "trademark" and "mark" to refer to both trademarks and service marks. 
<P>
Rights to a trademark arise when a trademark is used or an application to register is made and the applicant intends to use the mark. A trademark gives the owner exclusive use of the trademark as long as it is used to identify goods or services.  
<P>
Registering a trademark is not required; however, registration provides benefits that may make it worthwhile. A trademark may be registered with either the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the Minnesota Secretary of State. Registration in one office does not register the trademark in the other office.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Federal Trademark Registration </STRONG></H3></A>
As previously mentioned, federal registration of a trademark is not required; however, there are two benefits of registering. First, the owner of a federal trademark registration is presumed to be the owner of the trademark. Second, the owner of a federal trademark registration is entitled to use the trademark nationwide.  
<P>
An application for federal trademark registration contains two parts. First, the application must be accepted, and second, once the application has been accepted, the process to determine trademark registration begins. An application to register a trademark must be filed in the name of the owner. The owner can be an individual, partnership, or a corporation. An owner who has already begun using a trademark may file an application based on that use. An owner who has not yet used the trademark may make an application based upon an intention to use the trademark. Use of a trademark in promotion or advertising before the trademark is used with the products or goods does not qualify as use. If an owner files an application based upon intent to use the trademark, she must use the trademark and submit proof of this use to the U.S. Trademark and Patent Office before the trademark will be registered.  
<P>
The application consists of a completed application form, a drawing of the mark, and a filing fee. There is a separate filing fee for each class of goods or services listed. The Patent and Trademark Office maintains a list of over 40 class categories, from furniture to clothing to chemicals. If the application is based on the use of the trademark, the application must include three examples per class showing actual use of the trademark. A separate application must be filed for each trademark a person wishes to register. The applicant must be careful when identifying goods and services, because an application may not be amended later to add goods or services not within the scope of the original identification.  
<P>
After an application is filed, it is reviewed to determine if it meets the minimum requirements. If it does, the application is given a serial number and the applicant is sent a receipt. If minimum requirements are not met, the application and the fee are returned to the applicant. If an application is accepted, an Examining Patent and Trademark attorney reviews the application to determine whether the trademark should be registered. If the attorney decides that the trademark may not be registered, a letter is sent to the applicant stating the grounds for refusal. The applicant must respond within six months or the application will be abandoned. If the applicant's response does not overcome the attorney's objections, a final refusal will be issued. A common reason for refusing to register a trademark is the likelihood of confusion between the applicant's trademark and a trademark that has already been registered.  
<P>
If there are no objections to the application or the objections have been overcome, the attorney will approve the trademark for publication in the Official/Gazette, a weekly publication of the Patent and Trademark Office. Any party who believes that it may be harmed by the registration of the published trademark has 30 days to file an opposition to the trademark. Oppositions to trademarks are heard before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.  
<P>
If no oppositions are raised, the application continues in the registration process. The next step depends on whether the application is based on actual use of the trademark or intent to use the trademark. If the application is based upon the actual use of the mark, the Patent and Trademark Office registers the mark and issues a registration certificate. 
<P>
If the application is based on the party's intent to use the trademark, the Patent and Trademark Office issues a Notice of Allowance. The applicant has six months from the date of the notice to either use the trademark and send to the Patent and Trademark Office a Statement of Use with three samples of use per class or request an extension of time. If the Statement of Use is filed and approved, the Patent and Trademark Office then issues a registration certificate. There is an additional fee per class for these filings.  
<P>
Before a person applies for federal registration of a trademark, a search should be done to determine whether there are any conflicting trademarks. The application fee is not refunded if a conflicting trademark is found. Also, one would not want to spend resources on a trademark that is not available. The Public Search Library of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is the primary source of available trademark information. Also, a Patent and Trademark Depository Library has been established at the Minneapolis Public Library and Information Center. 
<P>
The term of a federal trademark registration is ten years, with ten-year renewal terms. 
<P>
Besides registering a trademark claim, a person may also give notice to the public that trademark rights are claimed. The TM symbol or the SM symbol may be used by anyone to notify the public of the claim. Registration is not required; however, use of the registration symbol &amp;reg; is permitted only when the trademark has been registered with the Patent and Trademark Office. 
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>State Trademark Registration </STRONG></H3></A>
A trademark may also be registered with the Minnesota Secretary of State's Office. A state trademark registration is not equivalent to federal registration. A trademark that is federally registered does not need to be registered with a state because federal registration gives the owner the rights to that trademark nationally. However, a party who has not registered a trademark with the Federal Patent and Trademark Office may, in some instances, wish to file the trademark with Minnesota. For example, if a person is operating a small business in Minnesota and never has intentions of expanding the business, he may consider registering the trademark with the Secretary of State to protect his interests only in the state of Minnesota. 
<P>
A trademark registration in Minnesota takes less time and costs less. A party must submit an application to the state with the appropriate filing fee. State registration only provides protection in that state, so a person can have a trademark registered with Minnesota and another person could legally use the same trademark in Florida. Trademarks registered in Minnesota can also be protected as long as the trademark continues to be used. The initial term of a trademark registration is ten years with subsequent renewal periods. 
<P>
Registering an assumed name or a corporate name in Minnesota is not trademark registration and does not provide trademark protection. See the <A HREF="c09.html">Organizing a Business</A> Chapter for further information on assumed name registration.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Organizing a Business
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
There are several ways to organize a business, and the option selected depends on various factors. The option chosen by a small family-owned and operated venture may not be the same choice of a company with several owners and many employees. Each option has benefits and drawbacks. The option selected by a business may change over time as the business's needs, identity, size, budget, and liabilities change. A person may start out as a sole proprietor but decide years later to incorporate. Before a person or persons decide what option would best meet their needs, an attorney experienced in business matters should be consulted. 
<P>
The <STRONG>Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Minnesota Business Guidebook</STRONG> contains information on issues of concern to business persons as well as listings of business attorneys.
The following is a brief summary of the common forms of business organizations. At the end of the chapter, issues that may affect all forms of business will be outlined, including registering an assumed name and obtaining tax identification numbers and licenses.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Sole Proprietorship</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A sole proprietorship is the simplest form of business organization. One person owns, manages, and controls the business. A sole proprietorship may have employees, but only the owner is in charge of the business. The owner receives the business profits and losses. This person is also responsible for any debts the business may incur. Income, expenses, and losses are reported on the business owner's individual tax return. 
<P>
A sole proprietorship is relatively easy to organize. The business owner must acquire the appropriate licenses, if any, and tax identification numbers, and must register the business name. There are no specific state filing requirements for this business option.
<P>
The benefits of the sole proprietorship include having complete control over the business, ease of the initial set-up, and having business profits taxed at the individual taxpayer rate, which is lower than the rate charged to corporations.
<P>
The drawbacks to sole proprietorship include being personally responsible for debts and liabilities of the business. For example, if a business owner has debts that are not being paid, the creditors can reach the personal assets of the business owner, such as a personal checking account. A business owner may obtain insurance to minimize this drawback. Other drawbacks include lack of continuity -- when the business owner dies, the business ceases to exist -- and generally not being able to deduct benefits like health, dental, and life insurance on a sole proprietor's income tax return as business expenses. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Partnership</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A partnership is a business owned by two or more parties. There are two types of partnership: general and limited.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>General Partnership</STRONG></H3></A>
A general partnership occurs when two or more persons own, manage, and control a business. Persons in a general partnership share the rights, duties, and responsibilities. Partnerships may also have employees; however, only the partners have control of the business activities. 
<P>
A partnership has more issues to address than the sole proprietorship. Besides obtaining the appropriate licenses and tax numbers and registering the business name, partners must agree on the treatment of business profits, expenses, losses, and other business concerns. Typically, there is a written agreement between the partners to address these issues. Minnesota has statutes that specifically govern partnerships.
<P>
The benefits of a general partnership include the owners' control of a business. However, unlike the sole proprietor who has exclusive control, partners share control and responsibilities. Partners have the advantage of having more than one resource for finances, ideas, and sharing the work load. The formation of a general partnership can be less complicated than other business formats, such as limited partnerships and corporations. Finally, profits from the partnership are included on the partners' individual tax returns and taxed at the individual taxpayer rate, which is lower than the rate charged to corporations.
<P>
The drawbacks to a general partnership include being personally responsible for the debts and liabilities of the partnership. A partner can be liable for debts incurred by other partners in furtherance of the business. As in a sole proprietorship, a partnership may obtain insurance to minimize this drawback. Business partners are treated like sole proprietors with regard to deducting benefits provided to themselves. Benefits like health, dental, and life insurance may generally not be deducted on partners' income tax returns as business expenses. 
In a general partnership, a business can continue after the departure or death of a partner. Minnesota Statutes require the remaining partners to pay the departing partner (or her beneficiaries) fair market value of the partnership interest. Minnesota Statutes also provide that if a partnership interest is assigned, the person who receives the assignment is only entitled to the partner's profits from the business. The partners can agree, however, to entitle the person receiving the assignment participation in business management and administration. These legal requirements may be modified by a partnership agreement. A partnership agreement may detail how a partnership interest may be sold, transferred, or handled upon the death of a partner. Addressing potential issues in an agreement may be one way to prevent disputes from occurring.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Limited Partnership</STRONG></H3></A>
A limited partnership is similar in many respects to a general partnership. However, in a limited partnership, there are two types of partners -- general and limited. Minnesota Statutes require that a limited partnership have at least one general partner and one limited partner. The principal difference between a general and limited partner is the limited partner can limit his personal liability for partnership debts to the amount he invests in the partnership. The limited partner, in exchange for the reduction in liability, does not control or manage the business. The general partner controls and manages the business and is personally liable for partnership debts.
<P>
Because limited partnerships must meet specific Minnesota statutory requirements, they can be more complicated to establish. There are public filings required by statute. A limited partnership must also receive appropriate licenses and tax identification numbers and register the business name.
<P>
The benefits of a limited partnership depend on whether one is a general or limited partner. The general partner enjoys control and management responsibilities. The limited partner receives limited personal liability. Profits for both types of partners are included on the partners' individual tax returns and taxed at the individual taxpayer rate, which is lower than the rate charged to corporations.
<P>
The drawbacks for a limited partnership also depend on whether one is a general or limited partner. A general partner is personally responsible for the business debts while the limited partner is only liable for debts up to the amount she has invested in the partnership. The limited partner does not participate in the management or the control of the business. Business partners are treated like sole proprietors with regard to deducting benefits provided to themselves. Benefits like health, dental, and life insurance may generally not be deducted on partners' income tax returns as business expenses.
<P>
Unlike a sole proprietorship or general partnership, when a limited partnership wishes to dissolve, it must file such intent with the Minnesota Secretary of State. As mentioned previously, there are laws which apply to limited partnerships specifically which make this format more time consuming and complex.
<P>
A limited partnership can continue after the death or departure of a partner. The departing partner (or his beneficiaries) may be entitled to the fair market value of the partnership interest. The beneficiaries also may have the option of becoming a limited partner. A partner's interest in a limited partnership may be assigned. However, the party receiving the assignment is only entitled to the profits that the assigning partner would have received. The partners may agree that the person receiving the assignment becomes a limited partner. This legal requirement may be modified by a partnership agreement. A partnership agreement may detail the conditions of how a partnership interest may be sold, transferred, or handled upon the departure or death of a partner. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Corporation</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The creation of a corporation is the creation of an artificial person. For legal and tax purposes, a corporation is a separate entity from its owners. A corporation can make purchases, enter into contracts, pay taxes, and sue and be sued.
<P>
Corporations must be established in compliance with the requirements set forth in Minnesota Statutes. Shareholders are the owners of a corporation. Management, and control of the corporation, are the responsibility of the board of directors, who may or may not be the shareholders. Income, expenses, and losses of the business are filed on the corporation's tax returns.
<P>
There are many requirements for a business to become incorporated. A discussion of the incorporation requirements may be found in the <STRONG>Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Minnesota Business Guidebook</STRONG>
<P>
The benefits of a corporation include protecting the shareholders from business debts and responsibilities in most cases. Unlike the business options previously discussed, a corporation's creditors may not seek to collect debts from the owners of the corporation. However, owners of a new corporation may be required by financial institutions to give personal financial assurances in order to receive funding. There is continuity of a corporate business regardless of individual shareholder status. Even if several shareholders sell their shares in a business or a principal stockholder dies, the existence of the corporation is not affected. Also, a corporation may sell stock or shares in its business to raise capital. Corporations may have several types of stocks or shares available, such as voting shares and nonvoting shares.
<P>
The drawbacks of a corporation include double taxation. The corporation files its own tax returns and pays taxes on its profits before paying dividends to the shareholders. When the shareholders receive the dividends, these profits are included on the individual shareholders' tax returns and taxed. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Subchapter S Corporation</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A Subchapter S corporation derives its name from a section of the Internal Revenue Code. Under Subchapter S in the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that meets certain requirements may be treated as a corporation for liability purposes but treated as a partnership for taxation purposes. Shareholders of a Subchapter S corporation receive limited liability protection, and their profits from the business are included on their individual income tax return. Minnesota has similar tax treatment for such corporations. 
The requirements of a Subchapter S corporation include:
<UL>
<LI>No more than 35 shareholders
<LI>Shareholders must be natural persons (not corporations or partnerships)
<LI>Shareholders cannot be nonresident aliens
<LI>One class of stock
</UL>
After a business has incorporated, all shareholders must consent to Subchapter S treatment. The election to be treated as a Subchapter S corporation must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Nonprofit Corporation</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In order to be considered nonprofit, a corporation must have been formed for a purpose other than the financial benefit of its shareholders. Also, a nonprofit corporation cannot pay any dividends or other financial rewards to its shareholders. There are specific Minnesota laws for nonprofit corporations. To receive tax exempt status, an organization must first incorporate as a nonprofit corporation. After incorporation, applications for tax exempt status must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service and the Minnesota Department of Revenue. In order for contributions to the organization to be tax deductible, other requirements must be met.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Franchise</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A franchise is a method of selling and distributing goods and services. Franchises are available for many types of ventures. A franchise, unlike the options previously discussed, is not a form of business organization. A franchise is an arrangement between at least two parties, in which one party pays the other a fee for the right to engage in a particular business venture. Franchises are regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and the Minnesota Department of Commerce. 
<P>Franchises are discussed further in the <STRONG>Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Minnesota Business Guidebook</STRONG> 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>General Business Issues</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As previously mentioned, there are a number of issues that impact businesses, whether sole proprietorship or corporations. The following will summarize the most common of these issues.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Name Registration</STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota Statutes state that any business doing business in Minnesota under a name other than the full name of the business owner must register the assumed name with the Minnesota Secretary of State.
<P>
A certificate of assumed name form is available from the Minnesota Secretary of State's office. The business owner must fill out the form and submit it and the accompanying fee to the Secretary of State. After the Secretary of State notifies the owner that her filing has been accepted and the proposed name does not conflict with corporate or partnership names on file, the owner must publish notice of the assumed name in a newspaper. The newspaper must be in the county where the principal office of the business is located. The name is valid for ten years and can be renewed. Requirements for corporate names are different and can be found in the <STRONG>Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Minnesota Business Guidebook</STRONG>
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Tax Identification Numbers</STRONG></H3></A>
Businesses in Minnesota must obtain federal and state tax identification numbers. Sole proprietors without employees generally use their social security numbers. Other businesses file Form SS-4 with the Internal Revenue Service and an Application for Business Registration (Form ABR) with the Minnesota Department of Revenue. 
<P>
Businesses with employees must also register with the Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training for an unemployment compensation number.
<P>
Businesses that sell goods or services which are taxable must obtain a sales and use tax permit. This permit is obtained by filing Form ABR with the Minnesota Department of Revenue.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Licenses</STRONG></H3></A>
Businesses operating in Minnesota may also have to obtain federal, state, or local licenses. Business persons must determine which licenses and permits are required before beginning their venture.

</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The word "change" is most frequently heard in discussions involving American agriculture today. The agriculture industry in this country is going through a period of unprecedented change as producers and processors struggle to deal with rapidly evolving technologies, increased mechanization, changing corporate ownership rules, international trade agreements, and a host of other issues unique to agriculture. Long considered a quiet, calm subcategory of the American legal system, the practice of agricultural law is changing swiftly as its practitioners strive to adapt their practices to the changing nature of the industry. Producers and processors alike need to keep themselves informed of how changes in agricultural law will affect them and the role they might play in directing that change. This chapter addresses agricultural production contracts, corporate ownership of farms, international agricultural agreements, and farm bankruptcies. The <A HREF="b22.html">Intellectual Property Law</A> Chapter describes the process for obtaining a plant patent. The <A HREF="b02.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter discusses general contract issues, and the <A HREF="b17.html">Environmental Law</A> Chapter discusses general environmental laws that impact farmers.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Agricultural Production Contracts </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An agricultural production contract is an agreement between a producer and a processor, usually entered into before planting or the birth of an animal, that obligates the producer to sell his or her agricultural output to a particular processor. Agricultural production contracts are an increasingly important and popular way for agricultural producers and processors to do business in Minnesota. Drafting an agricultural production contract involves many of the same considerations discussed in the <A HREF="b02.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter. However, there are additional concerns unique to agricultural production contracts. When drafted well, an agricultural production contract can be a beneficial arrangement for both producer and processor. When drafted poorly, one or both risk tremendous financial losses and business disruption. Given their growing popularity, agricultural production contracts are rapidly changing the face of American agriculture and have received increased scrutiny from state legislatures.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>The Food Processors' Perspective </STRONG></H3></A>
The United States food processing industry has undergone tremendous change in the decades since the Second World War. Most small food processors have gone out of business while some other processors have grown enormously and spread nationally, and in some cases, internationally. The increasing size of food processors has been both the cause and effect of increased capital-intensive, fast-paced mechanization in the food processing industry. Increased economies of scale in the food processing industry require full capacity utilization of equipment. This need for full capacity utilization in turn creates a need to line up supplies of raw materials well in advance of harvest. Production contracts are a way that processors seek to ensure quantity, quality, and timeliness of food inputs into the production process.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>The Food Producers' Perspective </STRONG></H3></A>
Food producers are as interested in stability and reliability in their business as food processors are in theirs. The agriculture business is notoriously plagued by bad weather, crop failures, fluctuating commodity prices, and soaring production costs. Theoretically, food producers seek agricultural production contracts out of a desire for stability and predictability. Realistically, many producers feel they have no choice but to enter into agricultural production contracts. The purchasers of their products sometimes insist on agricultural production contracts and producers feel they have no choice but to agree. Producers need not have such a fatalistic outlook, however. While most food processors prefer to do business using agricultural production contracts, most are willing to bargain over the terms.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Categories of Agricultural Production Contracts </STRONG></H3></A>
An agricultural production contract will generally follow one of three different forms -- market specification contract, production management contract, or resource providing contract.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Market Specification Contract </STRONG></H4></A>
The simplest form of the agricultural production contract is the market specification contract that states price, quantity, and quality of a product that will be traded at some future time. A market specification contract reduces uncertainties both for producer and processor while leaving the producer relatively free to meet its obligations however it sees fit. The biggest drawback of market specification contracts is that they often ignore the possibility of bad weather or crop failure. Agriculture is a notoriously unpredictable business and a farmer who agrees to deliver a certain crop at a set time may be inviting liability if subsequent events make performance impossible.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Production Management Contract </STRONG></H4></A>
A more complicated form of the agricultural production contract is the production management contract. Like a market specification contract, a production management contract specifies price, quantity and quality, but also dictates how the producer will produce the goods. Production management contracts are becoming increasingly popular as processors try to produce unique, specialty products for niche markets. Production management contracts are especially popular with mass market processors, such as fast food companies, that demand uniform products for national markets. Drawbacks to production management contracts include all those mentioned above for market specification contracts and in addition the farmer sacrifices some independence in deciding how best to manage the affairs of his or her farm.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Resource Providing Contract </STRONG></H4></A>
The most complex form of the agricultural production contract is the resource providing contract. Under a resource providing contract, the processor provides all or part of the inputs to be used in producing the output to ensure that output will meet the processor's quality standards. Drawbacks to resource providing contracts include all those mentioned above for market specification contracts and production management contracts, and the farmer also is forced to do business with the processor in obtaining inputs for the production process. Producers must be very careful to understand their obligations under resource providing contracts. Even after a farmer has purchased products from the processor, for instance seed and fertilizer that went into producing the crop, the processor usually retains the right to buy or not to buy the final product if it fails to meet the processor's standards.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Minnesota Requirements for Agricultural Production Contracts </STRONG></H3></A>
Theoretically, agricultural production contracts ought to benefit both parties; a win-win proposition. Many experts feel that historically, agricultural production contracts have been drafted not to share the risk of crop failure, but merely to shift the risk of crop failure to producers. In response to past abuses, many states have enacted laws designed to protect the interests of farmers who sign agricultural production contracts. Agricultural production contracts for crops grown in Minnesota must comply with Minnesota's Agricultural Contracts Statute, one of the strictest laws in the country for protecting the interests of food producers. The Minnesota Agricultural Contracts Statute has five principal features:
<UL>
	<LI>Arbitration or mediation clauses must be included in agricultural contracts governed by the law.
	<LI>Termination rights are limited for any production contract that requires the producer to make a capital investment in buildings or equipment that cost $100,000 or more and have a useful life of five or more years.
	<LI>Parent company responsibility is imposed on companies that make contracts through subsidiaries.
	<LI>The Uniform Commercial Code's implied promise of good faith is imposed on all parties to the contract.
	<LI>Minnesota's Commissioner of Agriculture is authorized to adopt additional rules prohibiting unfair trade practices.
</UL>
The first of these requirements, an arbitration or mediation clause, is discussed more fully in the <A HREF="b05.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter. Parties to the contract can choose arbitration or mediation and can choose to designate the Minnesota commissioner of Agriculture to conduct arbitration or mediation, or refer the matter to an outside service provider. Regardless of who conducts it, the arbitration or mediation must conform to the Minnesota Uniform Arbitration Act or the Minnesota Civil Mediation Act, respectively.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>General Drafting Issues in Agricultural Production Contracts </STRONG></H3></A>
Four general issues should be treated carefully when drafting agricultural production contracts -- quality, acceptance, title, and nonperformance.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Quality </STRONG></H4></A>
To address the issue of quality, the parties determine standards that will decide whether the producer has met the quality target set forth in the contract. Third party grading standards, such as government grades, are most common, but a contract should anticipate the possibility of changes to those standards after formation of the contract but before delivery.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Acceptance </STRONG></H4></A>
Acceptance refers to acceptance or non-acceptance of a product. The agricultural production contract should state that the parties determine how, when, and where acceptance will occur. An agricultural production contract should clarify which party pays for any required testing, who owns any rejected product, if and how any rejected product can be sold to third parties, and how and when a rejected product must be removed from the processor's facility.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Title </STRONG></H4></A>
The issue of title refers to when title passes. A closely related issue is who bears the risk of loss before and after title passes. Some processors actually want risk of loss to remain with the producer for some period of time after title passes to the processor. Obviously, such a provision is almost never a good idea from the producer's standpoint.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Nonperformance </STRONG></H4></A>
The nonperformance provision should clearly state each party's responsibilities upon crop failure, animal loss, or other factors that prevent one party's performance. Most such clauses include a requirement that the party unable to fulfill its side of the bargain must give notice of the nonperformance within a specified period of time, in a specified manner, to a specified person or office.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>International Agricultural Agreements </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Two primary factors determine the financial well-being of most farmers -- the market prices they receive for their products and support payments received from the government. Both market prices and support payments are largely determined at the federal level by Congress and the President because agriculture is one of the most highly regulated sectors of the economy. In line with the increased internationalization of other sectors of the economy, the agricultural economy is being affected by increased international competition and pressure from foreign countries to open American domestic markets to more imported goods. American farmers are enjoying the benefits of increased access to many formerly closed foreign markets, yet, at the same time, more foreign agricultural products are finding their way into the domestic market, driving down domestic prices.
<P>
Many of this country's agriculture support programs are under increasing pressure at international negotiating sessions. Economists argue that price supports are a form of unfair subsidy and an inefficient way to help needy farmers. Political support for some agriculture support programs is waning under pressure to erase deficits and balance budgets. International agreements like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) are likely to lead to the demise or significant alteration of many existing government support programs for agriculture while they open new foreign markets to American farmers.
<P>
It is difficult to predict the future of international agriculture agreements, but agricultural organizations are mobilizing to ensure their voices are heard in debates over agricultural policy. All segments of the agriculture industry are sure to be involved in the political process as they struggle to deal with change and seek the best in an uncertain international political climate for agriculture. Agricultural lawyers can help businesses engaged in agriculture get involved in the process, influence negotiations, and prepare for changes that do come about.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>Corporate Farming </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
How farmers are permitted to own their land is an important issue in Minnesota agriculture. The Minnesota State Legislature has found that "it is in the interest of the state to encourage and protect the family farm as a basic economic unit, to ensure it as the most socially desirable mode of agricultural production and to enhance and promote the stability and well-being of rural society in Minnesota and the nuclear family." For these reasons, the state forbids most corporations, limited liability companies, pension funds, investment funds, or limited partnerships to directly or indirectly engage in farming, or to obtain an interest in any real estate used for farming or capable of being used for farming. The law allows some minor exceptions for corporate farms used for research, encumbrances taken for purposes of security, land acquired by gift, and land used to raise breeding stock. In addition, some corporate-owned land was "grandfathered" into the law. Significant exemptions from the law permit agricultural land to be owned by:
<UL>
	<LI>Family farm corporations
	<LI>Authorized farm corporations
	<LI>Family farm partnerships
	<LI>Authorized farm partnerships or general partnerships
</UL>
Each of these four forms of organization has detailed conditions attached to it. An agricultural law attorney with experience in these matters can help farmers set up their businesses so as to avoid running afoul of these laws.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="170"><H2><STRONG>Farm Bankruptcies </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The federal Bankruptcy Code contains several provisions available only to family farmers. These provisions are known as Chapter 12 and are designed to allow family farmers to remain in the business of farming while reorganizing and attempting to pay off their debts. Chapter 12 offers the family farmer several advantages over other bankruptcy reorganization chapters because it recognizes the seasonal nature of most agricultural income, the difficulty of predicting in advance how much a farmer will profit from a crop, and the fact that most farmers need much more credit than do most individuals. Chapter 12 was originally scheduled to be repealed on October 1, 1993, but the repeal date was extended to October 1, 1998. All cases commenced or pending under Chapter 12 by October 1, 1998 and all matters or proceedings relating to such cases will proceed and be determined as if Chapter 12 had not been repealed.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Farmers Eligible to File for Chapter 12</STRONG></H3></A>
Chapter 12 is only an option for farmers who receive at least half of their income from farming operations and have no more than $1.5 million in debt. At least 80 percent of that debt must be related to the farming operations, not including debt on the farmer's principal residence. The <A HREF="b09.html">Bankruptcy &amp; Workout Law</A> Chapter discusses basics of bankruptcy for businesses that do not qualify to proceed under the farm bankruptcy provisions of the federal Bankruptcy Code.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Mechanics of a Chapter 12 Bankruptcy </STRONG></H3></A>
A Chapter 12 bankruptcy filing is similar to a Chapter 11 corporate reorganization bankruptcy or a Chapter 13 personal reorganization bankruptcy. After a farmer files for Chapter 12, a "stay" is imposed and all actions of creditors to collect debt from the debtor must cease. If a creditor believes it deserves special protection, it can seek relief from the stay, requiring the debtor to give adequate protection to the creditor. Adequate protection under Chapter 12 is similar to adequate protection in other forms of bankruptcy but the terms are far more favorable to the farmer.
<P>
After filing for bankruptcy, the farmer has 90 days to file a plan of reorganization with the bankruptcy court. The reorganization plan must reveal all the farmer's debt and detail how he or she plans to repay the debt over three to five years. If the plan meets all of the requirements of Chapter 12, the bankruptcy court must approve it at a hearing held within 45 days after it is filed. Creditors are given an opportunity to file objections to the plan, but cannot veto it.
<P>
After filing for Chapter 12 the farmer almost always is allowed to continue operating the farm. An interested party can request that the farmer be removed from the farm, but a bankruptcy judge will only do so if the farmer is guilty of fraud, dishonesty, incompetence, or gross mismanagement of his or her affairs.
<P>
The reorganization plan is supervised by a court-appointed trustee. During the plan, the farmer makes periodic payments to the trustee who then pays creditors according to the terms of the plan. Should the farmer be removed for one of the above-mentioned reasons, the trustee steps in to manage the farm. At the end of the plan period, the court discharges any remaining debts, with certain limited exceptions, and the debtor is given a "fresh start."

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Arts, Entertainment, Advertising &amp; Media Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The primary concern of artists and entertainers is the creation of their art. But creating art should not be their only concern, because making a living as an artist or entertainer is also a business. Artists and entertainers must be sure to fully understand the legal aspects of the business relationships they enter into with agents, production companies, book publishers, managers, music clubs and record companies. They should also be concerned about the laws that regulate any relationships they form with other artists. An artist or entertainer who ignores these laws or fails to get important business relationships defined in writing may encounter problems as his or her career advances.
<P>
This chapter describes arts and entertainment law, along with media and advertising law, because in the real world they are often related. For example, because artists and entertainers express their ideas and works to the public, they often encounter free speech issues, a major component of media law. In addition, this chapter outlines some of the elements of copyright and trademark law as they apply to artists who want to protect their rights to the artistic messages they create.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Arts and Entertainment Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Arts and entertainment law is a broad area of legal specialization, so there is probably no such thing as a typical arts and entertainment lawyer. An attorney practicing in this area can concentrate his or her practice in just a few or in many of the legal issues that an artist or entertainer may encounter. An arts and entertainment lawyer's practice may include helping artists set up corporations or partnerships, settling copyright infringement cases, negotiating business deals, and drafting contracts between artists and record companies, production companies, book publishers or agents. This section outlines the areas of arts and entertainment law most likely to be encountered by an artist or performer.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Types of Contracts </STRONG></H3></A>
The following is a list of the most common contracts an artist or entertainer is likely to encounter in his or her career.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Shopping Agreement </STRONG></H4></A>
A Shopping Agreement is an agreement that an artist or a group of artists (such as a music group) makes with an agent or manager, who then shops around trying to get the individual or group a contract. The agreement should spell out how long the contract is in effect (i.e., how much time the person will search on the artist's behalf). The time period should be long enough to give the parties time to evaluate their ability to work together, but not so long that they are stuck with an unsuitable arrangement. This agreement should also spell out how the agent or manager is paid (usually a 10 to 20 percent commission), and who pays expenses. If the agreement stipulates that payment is on a commission basis, the document should clearly specify the terms.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Management or Booking Contract </STRONG></H4></A>
When an individual artist or group wants to be managed and/or promoted by another party, a written contract should be entered into to spell out each party's rights and responsibilities. The artist should carefully scrutinize all aspects of such a contract, especially if it is a long-term contract, to ensure that its terms are of value and that his or her rights are protected. Items to look for include: specific commitments the agency will make to protect and respect the artist's artistic freedom, specific commitments by the agency to promote the artist's career and/or provide with income or employment, how the agency will settle disputes over booking deals, and how the contract will be modified if the group changes its members, its name, or its artistic style.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Performance Agreement </STRONG></H4></A>
Minnesota law stipulates that if the terms of a contract last for more than a year, such as for a series of performances, the contract must be in writing. But to make sure that each party understands the full extent of its obligations and the rights of the other parties, all performance contracts should be in writing. If an artist has a good relationship with someone for whom he or she has performed often, then a written performance contract can probably just state the basics: who performs, where and when the performance will take place, manner of performance, hours of performance, agreed compensation, and manner and form of promotion and advertising. However, anyone agreeing to perform for the first time at a place or for a person or organization should sign a contract with a few more elements, including who pays attorney's fees if a dispute arises and whether disputes can be settled by arbitration or mediation. Performers should also make sure that the person signing the contract is an authorized representative of the person or organization shown in the contract as the party responsible for making payment after the performance.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Mutual Release Agreement </STRONG></H4></A>
Mutual release agreements outline how to manage the legal and financial aspects of a group's breakup. Having a mutual release agreement is especially important if the departure of a member is not voluntary. Elements that should be clearly specified include whether the departing member has any rights to use some the group's material, whether the departing member receives any future royalties and which party, if any, has the right to continue using the group's name.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Entertainment Agency Contract </STRONG></H4></A>
Minnesota Statutes require that any person involved in procuring, offering, or promising employment or engagements for three or more artists or groups of artists at any one time, or who has a written contract or a verbal agreement with an establishment or an individual to provide artists for one or more engagements, must be licensed as an entertainment agency by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry. Entertainment agencies are also required to submit to the Department of Labor and Industry the forms of contracts they will use and a schedule of fees to be charged and collected. Artists can contact the Department of Labor and Industry, (612) 296-2175, to verify that a prospective agent is duly licensed within the State of Minnesota.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Organizing the Business </STRONG></H3></A>
Probably the most important agreement that artists sign are documents outlining their relationships with each other as they perform or create together. Handling the legal and financial details of a departure is made easier when the relationships among the artists forming a group have been clearly outlined beforehand. Some of the legal options artists have when creating formal relationships with each other are the topic of this section.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>General Partnership </STRONG></H4></A>
For both artists and business people, a common arrangement is a general partnership in which all partners share in managing the partnership. A general partnership agreement should include the name of the partnership and whether it is protected or protectable by trademark, the members of the partnership, the partnership's location and duration, each partner's investment and participation in profits and loses, procedure for admitting new partners and liquidating the interests of departing members, amount of time to be contributed by each partner, and each partner's managerial and other responsibilities. Other elements of a general partnership agreement that may also be of special concern to artistic groups include naming a managing partner and setting a method for resolving disputes, setting conditions under which a partner can withdraw from the partnership, defining the grounds for expelling a partner, and specifying a period of time in which a departing partner cannot compete with the remaining partners.
<P>
A major drawback of a general partnership is that each partner can be held personably liable for the losses of the entire partnership. This means that if the partnership accumulates a large business debt, or if the partnership loses a large lawsuit, each partner may be forced to contribute some of his or her personal money to help pay off the debt. This drawback can be avoided by forming one of the different types of legal corporations described in the next section.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Corporation </STRONG></H4></A>
Although forming a general partnership agreement is a very common choice of a group of artists who perform or create together, artists also have the option of organizing as a corporation. To do this requires a little more organization and commitment by the group, because managing even a simple corporation requires a greater time commitment and closer attention to paperwork. Incorporating may be the best route to take, however, because of the possible advantages of lower taxes and reduced liability.
<P>
A corporation is a legal entity that operates separately from its owners, the shareholders. For most arts groups, all of the shareholders are also officers of the corporation. This is in contrast to the types of corporations most people are familiar with -- public corporations with shares that can be traded on a public stock market. Artists rarely form public corporations, so only those small corporations with privately held shares are discussed here. In such closely held corporations, the officers of the corporation (president, vice president, secretary and treasurer) hold all the stock issued by the corporation.
<P>
The corporation may be structured so as to qualify as an S corporation, which gives significant tax advantages to the owners of the corporation. Simply put, an S corporation is not taxed, although any profits distributed to owners are taxed as personal income. In some other types of corporations, the corporation's profits are taxed and the earnings passed along to shareholders are taxed again.
<P>
Unlike a general partnership, the owners of a corporation are not generally liable for the debts of the corporation because of the legal separation between a corporation and its owners. Thus, if a corporation goes heavily into debt, bill collectors can generally only go after the assets of the corporation and cannot try to collect from the personal accounts of the corporation's shareholders. This exemption from liability disappears, however, if it can be proved in court that the shareholders engaged in fraud or otherwise seriously mismanaged the corporation.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Trademark </STRONG></H3></A>
A trademark is a word, name, symbol or design used by a manufacturer or merchant to identify its products and distinguish them from other products. More to the point of this chapter, music groups, theater groups or individual artists or entertainers also have significant investments in their names as a way to distinguish their work from the works of other artists. A trademark protects the owner of a product from others who would make a similar product and try to sell it using someone else's good name or reputation.
<P>
For an artist or group of artists, this protection is very valuable; a fact perhaps best illustrated by recalling that the name "Picasso" has been held to be a trademark. To make sure that the value in a name -- value that an artist creates through hard work and talent -- is not appropriated by someone else, the artist can register the name with the state or the federal government. Filing with the federal government protects the mark beyond the state's BORDERs.
<P>
Although anyone can do an informal, preliminary search to determine whether a particular name is available to be registered as a trademark, it is best to hire a lawyer experienced in trademark law to do a comprehensive search and to properly register the mark. A search by an attorney affords financial and legal protection. Although it costs money to hire an attorney to conduct this search, it is much better to know beforehand if anyone else has the name rather than after having spent money promoting and using a mark that belongs to someone else.
<P>
A name does not have to be registered in order to claim it as a trademark. This is so because a trademark automatically arises from repeated, regular use of a name. However, if the owner ever wants to claim that someone else is infringing on the use of a name, he or she will have a harder time doing this if the name was not previously registered as a trademark.
<P>
Registering a name as a trademark is the first step in protecting exclusive rights to it. Whether a person registers a trademark with the state or with the federal government, he or she gets a certificate of registration that is valid for ten years. The registration can be renewed after ten years. Whenever the artist stops regular, repeated use of a trademark, he or she is open to the possibility that someone else can begin legally using it. Also, the holder of the trademark must police the mark to make sure that others who try to use it are notified of the holder's exclusive rights to the trademark. If the holder does not act to stop others from infringing on a trademark, he or she can lose the exclusive right to use the trademark.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Copyright </STRONG></H3></A>
A copyright is a federal protection that affords creators of original works of authorship the rights to exclusively reproduce, distribute, sell, perform or publicly display the copyrighted work. If someone writes a play or a book, drafts a song, paints a picture, sculpts artwork, makes a computer program, movie, or photograph, he or she already has the copyright to that work by virtue of having created it. Registering the work with the U.S. Copyright Office is mostly a legal formality, but there are reasons for doing so anyway. The most important reason is that if the creator of a work registers a copyright on a work within three months of its creation or at any time before an alleged infringement of the work, he or she may be able to collect statutory damages and attorney's fees in addition to actual damages in an infringement lawsuit.
<P>
While a lawyer likely would not be needed simply to register a copyright, an attorney should be consulted whenever engaging in any sort of copyright infringement case. However, a copyright holder may also want to engage an attorney if he or she is ever hired to create a work of art for someone else. An attorney in this case can ensure that an employment contract clearly states who has copyright for the work.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Media Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
As stated in the introduction to this chapter, media and advertising law and arts and entertainment law are related in the real world because many artists find themselves involved in free speech issues. Although free speech may sound like a straightforward issue, its practical applications have been the subject of much case law and are almost perpetually debated in the courts, which must try to balance individual and community rights. This section focuses on some of the significant concerns in media law including defamation, obscenity, libel, and slander.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Defamation </STRONG></H3></A>
Freedom of speech is not absolute. Defamatory speech, speech that negatively reflects on someone else's reputation, is one type of speech that is limited. The two kinds of defamation are libel and slander. Libel occurs when the defamation is done in writing; slander occurs when the defamation is spoken. In order to sue for defamation, a plaintiff must prove that the information was false. The courts treat private persons differently than public figures in deciding defamation. Public figures have to prove not only that the information is false, but that the speaker or publisher either knew the words were false, or spoke or published the words with a reckless disregard for whether they were false or not.
<P>
During the ninth century, at the time of Alfred the Great, the minimum penalty for defamation was loss of one's tongue. Modern laws offer somewhat lesser punishments. Minnesota law provides for both criminal and civil cases against libel, but the criminal statues have not been used for many years and it is likely that they are unconstitutional. In Minnesota, there is a somewhat different test when the defendant is a member of the media. The desire to provide for freedom of the press makes it more difficult to win a libel case against a media defendant.
<P>
There are usually two defenses against libel: truth and consent. In general, if a statement is true it is not actionable as libel or slander even though it may harm one's reputation. Any person who offers his or her consent to the transmission or publication of defaming information cannot then sue for libel or slander. Also, a statement of opinion cannot ordinarily be the basis of a libel suit. Furthermore, a person must be identified in order for defamation to have occurred. The identification occurs either when a person is directly named or when he or she is described so specifically as to be recognizable. In general, false statements that hurt the reputation of a business, accuse someone of a crime or impugn chastity are likely to be found to be defamatory. Clearly, the safest approach in publishing or broadcasting negative information about someone else is to make sure it is factually accurate, or to limit negative remarks to those regarding deceased persons, who under the law do not have reputations and therefore cannot be defamed. In addition, people who are not in the public spotlight, or whose livelihoods do not otherwise depend on a favorable public perception, cannot generally be greatly damaged by defamatory remarks. 
<P>
In determining damage awards, courts also take into account how many people heard the slander or read the libel. The more people who heard or read the defamation, the greater a damage award is likely to be. State and federal laws almost never allow for punishment that would prevent a libel or slander from occurring. That is, one cannot go to court and use libel law to prevent someone else from publishing a defamatory book. But because defamation law does allow for civil action after the libel or slander has occurred, many times the subject of the potentially defamatory material is successful in preventing the defamation by threatening to go to court if the material is published.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Obscenity </STRONG></H3></A>
Material that has been deemed to be obscene is illegal to distribute or produce in any way. It is also illegal to participate in an obscene performance if a person knew or should have known that the performance material was obscene. The fines for violating these laws can be as high as $10,000 for the first offense. It is also illegal to use minors in sexually explicit representations and to show sexually explicit materials to minors.
<P>
Ever since the U.S. Supreme Court's famous 1973 decision in an obscenity case, determining whether material is obscene depends on this test: (a) whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.
<P>
Many people find this test vague. Obscenity is particularly difficult to define, and whether a particular piece of material or performance is found obscene depends greatly on the particular judge or jury deciding the case. As a result, lawyers are justifiably reluctant to give specific advice on how to avoid crossing the line from acceptable sexual material into obscenity. At best, all they can do is recite the legal definition and discuss some of the details of a court's previous decisions. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="170"><H2><STRONG>Advertising </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Advertising issues can affect all business people, whether or not they think they are directly involved in the advertising, entertainment or media industries. Good communication with the public is one of the most important assets a business can have, whether it involves placing advertisements, dealing with the government or talking to the media.
<P>
Advertisements include a wide range of items -- from television spots to catalogs. Advertisements are invitations to the public for offers on products or services. Advertisements are not considered offers under contract law, but are announcements that goods are available and offers from the public are solicited. Although advertisements do not constitute offers, they can raise liability issues in several different ways. Both the state of Minnesota and the federal government have laws regulating advertisements.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Minnesota Law </STRONG></H3></A>
Under Minnesota's Deceptive Trade Practices Act, a person in the course of business engages in a deceptive trade practice when he or she:
<UL>
<LI>Passes off goods or services as those of another
<LI>Causes likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding as to the source, approval, or certification of goods or services
<LI>Causes likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding as to the affiliation, association, or connection with or certification by another
<LI>Uses deceptive representations or designations of geographical origin in connection with goods or services
<LI>Represents that goods or services have sponsorship approval, ingredients, uses, benefits that they do not have or that a person has sponsorship, approval, affiliation that the person does not have
<LI>Represents that goods are new if they are used, reconditioned, or altered
<LI>Represents goods or services are of a particular quality or standard of which they are not
<LI>Disparages goods, services, or the business of another by false or misleading representations of fact
<LI>Advertises goods or services with the intent not to sell them as advertised
<LI>Advertises goods or services with intent not to supply reasonably expected public demand unless the advertisement discloses the limited quantity
<LI>Makes false or misleading statements of fact concerning the reasons for, existence, or amounts of price reductions
<LI>Engages in any other conduct which creates confusion or misunderstanding
</UL>
Minnesota has a specific statute regarding false statements in advertising. This law states that any person, firm, corporation, or business, with the intent to sell or dispose of goods or services, who publishes or disseminates an advertisement that contains any material assertion, representation, or statement of fact that is untrue, deceptive, or misleading is guilty of a misdemeanor.
<P>
In addition, the Minnesota Prevention of Consumer Fraud Act states the use by any person of fraud, false pretense or promise, misrepresentation, misleading statement, or deceptive practice with the intent that others rely on it in connection with a sale is unlawful.
<P>
Minnesota law states that in addition to any civil penalties one may receive for violating these statutes, he or she may also receive a penalty if the conduct was perpetrated against a senior citizen or a disabled person.
<P>
Advertisements may also lead to product liability. Words, photographs, or a combination of the two may create liability if a product does not meet the claims stated or shown. An advertisement does not have to use the word "warranty" for a warranty to be created. For example, if an advertisement shows a photograph of a product being used in a particular fashion and the product fails when a consumer uses the product in that manner, the consumer may bring an action for failure of the product to meet its warranty.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Federal Law </STRONG></H3></A>
There are several federal statutes that regulate advertising. It is unlawful for a person, partnership, or corporation to disseminate any false advertisement. Unfair or deceptive acts or practices affecting commerce are also unlawful. Under the federal Lanham Act, any person, who in connection with any goods or services, uses any word, term, name, symbol, device, or any combination thereof or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description or representation of fact that is likely to cause confusion, mistakes, or deception shall be liable for civil damages. Also, a person can be liable for damages if his or her commercial advertising or promotion misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographical origin of goods, services, or commercial activities. Advertising agencies have been held liable under this statute when the advertising agency participates in the creation, development, and propagation of a false advertising campaign when it has knowledge of its falsity.
<P>
Advertisements may also cause copyright infringement claims. Advertisements may parody other advertisements or copyrighted works. A copyright owner has the exclusive right to control the reproduction, distribution, performance, display, and creation of derivative works. However, the Fair Use doctrine permits the limited use of a copyrighted work without the owner's permission. There are four factors to consider when determining whether use is fair use:
<UL>
<LI>Purpose and character of use, including whether the use is of a commercial nature or for nonprofit educational purposes
<LI>Nature of the copyrighted work
<LI>Amount of the work used in relation to the copyright work as a whole
<LI>Effect of the use upon the potential market or value of the copyrighted work
</UL>
Courts have used these four factors and reached various results. In some cases, courts have held that advertisements constituted fair use, and in other cases courts have held that copyright infringement occurred. Courts must decide whether the use constitutes a parody, which may constitute fair use, or if the use is using copyrighted material for purely commercial reasons. There is a presumption that a commercial use of copyrighted work is not fair use. However, the fact that the use is commercial is only one of the four factors to consider. When courts look at the nature of the copyrighted work, there is stronger protection for some works. Advertisements do not receive as much protection as literary works, so an advertisement parodying another advertisement may be acceptable, while an advertisement using a copyrighted song may be unacceptable.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Contests, Sweepstakes, and Game Promotions </STRONG></H3></A>
In addition to the state and federal laws described above, a complex set of rules governs contests, sweepstakes, and game promotions. Such promotions are a popular way of promoting a product or service, but if done improperly, can plunge an advertiser into a morass of legal problems. One recent game promotion in England, sponsored by an American vacuum cleaner manufacturer, was so poorly planned it cost the company millions of dollars in legal fees and settlements with angry customers. Clearly, it pays to have game promotions carefully scrutinized before launching a new advertising campaign built upon prizes. Often, a properly worded disclaimer can prevent a lot of headaches.
<P>
One of the highest hurdles facing advertisers is that, while most states prohibit lotteries, each state has its own definition of what constitutes a lottery. If an advertiser is not careful, it can quickly run afoul of state laws against lotteries. Many states also have unique laws requiring posted rules, distribution of lists of winners, record retention, and postings of odds. In addition, the United States Postal Service, the Federal Communications Commission, and all major television networks have their own rules for contest advertisements, sweepstakes, and game promotions. Only an experienced advertising attorney can adequately advise on all these issues.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Banking Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Banks are financial intermediaries that link those who have money -- depositors -- with those who need money -- borrowers. Banks play an important role in modern, industrial economies by gathering deposits, repackaging them into a staggering variety of financial instruments and reselling them to borrowers. The important position that banks have in modern economies is also one of the easiest positions to abuse. Recognizing the potential for abuse and mismanagement inherent in the banking system and the negative effect that a weak banking system has upon the larger economy, state and federal authorities have created an extensive set of regulations that make the banking industry one of the most heavily regulated sectors of the economy. No other industry, through its day-to-day operations, affects as many other businesses as banking does. Many business managers feel frustrated when dealing with banks because they fail to understand the regulatory straight-jacket that banks are sometimes put in by federal or state regulators or they do not understand the fear that many bankers understandably now have of borrower lawsuits. The relationship that a company has with its bankers is important to its success in business. Understanding the laws that affect bankers and their relationships with borrowers can better one's chances of getting a business loan, receiving more favorable terms, and having satisfying business relations with banks.
<P>
This chapter discusses the strict regulatory environment in which banks operate and potential sources of lender liability. International Letters of Credit are discussed in the International Business Law Chapter. Several different types of bank loans primarily of interest to new companies are discussed in the Securities &amp; Venture Finance Law Chapter. Workouts for troubled loans are discussed in the Bankruptcy &amp; Workout Law Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>National versus State Banks </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Commercial banks can be chartered either as national banks or state banks. The individuals who start a bank are free to choose the type of bank charter that best fits their needs. National bank charters are granted by the Department of the Treasury's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in Washington, D.C. State bank charters are granted by the individual state's banking commission. Here in Minnesota, the State Commerce Department, located in St. Paul, processes applications for state bank charters. Whether applying for a state or federal charter, applicants are required to provide extensive information about their financial history, their proposed management structure, the banking needs of the community, and their intentions for serving the community wherein the bank will be located.
<P>
National bank charters are more expensive to procure although, for most purposes, state banks and national banks have identical rights and privileges once formed. One important difference between national and state banks is that membership in the Federal Reserve System (the "Central Bank" of the United States) and coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are automatic for national banks. State banks must make separate applications to join the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC. Applications for FDIC coverage and Federal Reserve System membership require much of the same information required in the original charter application.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Regulating Banks </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once a bank is chartered, state and federal regulators have a number of tools to use to control bank operations. The goal of most banking regulation is to prevent the widespread bank failures that plagued the country during the Great Depression. Much tighter supervision of commercial banks and federal guarantees of most bank deposits have promoted much greater business confidence in the banking system and prevented the widespread bank panics that gripped the U.S. economy periodically in its early history.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Regulatory Agencies</STRONG></H3></A>
The Comptroller of the Currency has jurisdiction over the thousands of national banks in the country. The Office of the Comptroller issues national charters and has authority to examine and supervise national banks. The Office of the Comptroller's numerous functions are carried out through six regional administrative offices located throughout the country. The state of Minnesota is assigned to the Midwestern Region District, which has its principal offices in Kansas City, Missouri. The Minneapolis Field Office, 920 Second Avenue South, Minneapolis, MN 55402, is a good source of information about federal bank regulations. The Office of the Comptroller also maintains duty stations in Minneapolis (three stations), Alexandria, Duluth, and Fargo, North Dakota. Bank examinations can also be carried out by representatives of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve.
<P>
The Minnesota Commerce Department, Financial Examinations, Banks Division, 133 East Seventh Street, St. Paul, MN 55101, regulates branch banking in Minnesota, sets maximum interest rates in certain categories of loans and otherwise supervises state chartered banks.
<P>
Banks can also be subject to control by a host of other federal and state regulatory agencies. The Department of Justice has authority to prevent bank mergers that it believes may create a trend toward monopoly in a given area. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires banks that sell stock to the public to file periodic reports with the Commission. Banks that choose to participate in a variety of government loan programs are subject to scrutiny by the Veterans Administration, or the Departments of Labor, Interior, Housing and Urban Development, or Health and Human Services. In addition, banks, like other businesses, are affected by state and federal regulations regarding equal employment opportunity, discrimination in lending, fair credit reporting, truth in lending, and collection practices for delinquent loans.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Periodic Reports </STRONG></H3></A>
Periodically, all banks are required to submit detailed financial condition reports to bank regulators. These reports must be submitted quarterly by larger banks and at lest semi-annually by some smaller banks. Special reporting requirements are imposed on troubled banks and near continuous reporting is required for banks thought likely to fail.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Bank Examinations </STRONG></H3></A>
In addition to having to file periodic reports, banks are subject to periodic visits by teams of inspectors to ensure the banks are being run in compliance with all applicable laws, that sound banking principles are being observed, and that the bank is not discriminating unfairly against any class of people. Often, these inspections are unannounced. Inspectors check all bank records, physically inspect documents, test computer systems, review loan procedures and policies, and count cash. Two areas of particular interest to bank examiners are the status of outstanding loans and the balance of the bank's loan portfolio.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Status of Outstanding Loans </STRONG></H4></A>
Bank examiners evaluate the strength of loans that a bank has made and make predictions of the likelihood that the loans will be repaid. Each bank receives a grade on the strength of its overall loan portfolio. To evaluate loans, examiners check the collateral pledged for each loan and the cash flow of the borrower repaying the loan. Accurate loan documentation is essential to this stage of the examination and, as a result, a bank can be quite strict in insisting upon proper documentation from even its best customers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Portfolio Balance </STRONG></H4></A>
A bank's loan portfolio is also evaluated for balance. Theoretically, a bank's loan portfolio is stronger if loans are spread out over a wide variety of loan categories such as real estate, manufacturers, service providers, and automobile fleets. A balanced loan portfolio is better able to withstand periodic economic fluctuations in any given industry than a loan portfolio heavily weighted toward one particular industry.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>The Uniform Interagency Bank Rating System </STRONG></H4></A>
More than one regulatory agency may have authority to examine a given bank, but because multiple examinations would be costly for the government and overly burdensome for banks, examiners use the Uniform Interagency Bank Rating System, a uniform set of standards, to grade banks. The Uniform Interagency Bank Rating System grades banks in five different areas -- capital adequacy, asset quality, management ability, earnings performance, and liquidity. These five elements are commonly referred to by their acronym, CAMEL. Every bank is rated on a scale of 1 to 5 for each element of CAMEL, with 1 being the highest rating and 5 being the lowest. A rating of 1 is excellent. A rating of 2 is good, with minor problems. A rating of 3 signifies a bank has trouble in that particular area and will usually cause authorities to take corrective action against the bank to remedy the problem. A rating of 4 signifies more trouble and usually triggers more serious corrective action. A rating of 5 is reserved for banks with a very high possibility of imminent failure and will usually trigger the search for candidates with which to merge the troubled bank.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Limits Placed upon Bank Loans </STRONG></H3></A>
Both federal and state laws control the interest rates that banks can charge to borrowers. Regulations provide a range of permissible interest rates. A bank is then free to charge different borrowers different rates within those ranges depending upon the bank's perception of each business' ability to pay back the loan, the cost of funds the bank pays its depositors, and the competitive pressures of the financial marketplace. Federal and state laws also set lending limits on the amount that can be lent to a particular individual or business. These lending limits are determined primarily by the bank's capital assets.

<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Limits Placed upon the Use of Bank Funds </STRONG></H3></A>
Both federal and state laws place a variety of restrictions on what a bank can do with its own funds. These rules are extremely complex and only an experienced professional can adequately advise bank management. A few general comments can be made:
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Real Estate </STRONG></H4></A>
National banks and many state banks are prohibited from investing in real estate except to the extent that the investment is used for the bank's own needs. The total investment in the bank's own real estate cannot exceed the amount of its capital stock.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Securities </STRONG></H4></A>
National Banks and many state banks are prohibited from investing in nearly all equity securities. Limited exceptions permit investment in subsidiaries performing bank functions, U.S. Treasury securities, and general obligations of state and municipal governments.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Investments in Other Industries </STRONG></H4></A>
Banks are generally prohibited from investing in nonfinancial sectors of the economy such as manufacturing and health care. Within the financial services sector, banks are prohibited from making some investments in insurance or securities underwriting. These limits are coming under increasing scrutiny, however, and Congress is currently considering whether to scrap some of these restrictions.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Lender Liability </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A big worry for lenders today is potential liability for the loans they make. There was a time when bank officers felt free to step in and tell a business how it ought to be run whenever that business failed to make timely loan payments. Then a wave of lawsuits brought by business owners convinced juries that bank interference with business decisions had been the cause of business failures. Failed businesses sometimes won very substantial verdicts or settlements from their banks. Early successes spawned a rash of copycat lawsuits challenging every conceivable action a bank might have taken before the business failed. Banks have lost lawsuits alleging bad faith for failing to loan enough money, for loaning too much money, for calling in a loan too early, and for failing to call a loan in early enough.
<P>
A bank always needs to resist the temptation to take control of a business too quickly because if the bank becomes so involved in the debtor's business that it "controls" the business, the creditor can become liable for any liabilities incurred by the business. This possibility is particularly serious because the definition of when a creditor "controls a debtor" is hazy and difficult to define. There is no simple formula to apply and courts look to all the creditor's actions in the broadest context in answering the question. Lenders need to be extremely careful about using their influence to get the borrower to take actions detrimental to the company but beneficial to the bank. Attorneys experienced in this area of law are frequently called upon to advise their bank clients on how to ensure better payment of loans without unnecessarily incurring liability. The advice of experienced counsel is strongly recommended.
<P>
If all this were not enough to cause the average banker to lose sleep, today's bankers also need to worry about lawsuits brought by the government for environmental cleanup costs at the sites of borrowers' operations. Financial management of a debtor's business can have especially high risks in the realm of environmental matters. In one notorious case, the <STRONG>Fleet Factors</STRONG> decision, the court held that a lender could be held liable for Superfund cleanup costs at the debtor's facility if the lender "had the ability to influence the hazardous waste decisions of its borrower," even though the lender had never actually participated in the decision-making process. The court's position that mere ability to influence a borrower's hazardous waste-handling decisions can trigger lender liability for cleanup sent shock waves through the banking community. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has tried to assuage the fears of many bankers by promulgating new rules it uses to determine when banks can become responsible for environmental cleanup costs. However, many people in the banking industry are not comfortable with the new rules and fear the potential for liability is still great. Banks and bank clients concerned with how their actions might be interpreted by a court assigning responsibility for environmental cleanup costs should consult counsel experienced in interpreting EPA lender liability rules.
<P>
Lender liability lawsuits are having a dramatic effect on the way lenders and borrowers interact with each other. Many long-standing relationships that once were consistently cordial are becoming increasingly adversarial. Even a borrower in excellent financial condition may find it increasingly difficult to secure loans if it has a history of business litigation. Banks now feel threatened by possible lawsuits from regulators and borrowers. Understandably, they may be reluctant to offer business advice or to introduce business managers to new business contacts.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Bankruptcy &amp; Workout Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Every year, for many businesses in America, the answer to financial problems is to declare bankruptcy, a legal proceeding in federal court that allows a business to be released from the obligation of paying some or all of its debts. It is often said that bankruptcy gives a debtor a fresh start, but filing bankruptcy is not a panacea for all financial problems because it is not painless. Declaring bankruptcy can seriously damage a company's credit rating, making it difficult to establish credit or take out loans. Without good credit, some companies simply cannot operate. Many companies can work themselves out of even very serious debt without ever going near a bankruptcy court, so declaring bankruptcy should not be an automatic first step for a business experiencing financial problems. This chapter discusses bankruptcy options available for businesses. For more information on personal bankruptcy, see the <STRONG><A HREF="../../mnhome.html">Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Minnesota Consumer Guide</A>,</STRONG> <A HREF="../../consumer/chapters/c12.html">Bankruptcy Law Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Background </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Bankruptcy law is almost entirely federal law. The United States Constitution grants to the federal government the exclusive right to make bankruptcy laws. Pursuant to this authority, the federal government created the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure, and a system of bankruptcy courts to handle bankruptcies throughout the country. This is not to say that bankruptcy law is uniform throughout the nation, however. Although the federal government has final authority to make all bankruptcy laws, in some instances the Bankruptcy Code grants to individual states the power to deviate from or to supplement federal rules in very limited circumstances. For instance, the Bankruptcy Code allows a debtor to keep certain assets, known as exempt assets, that creditors cannot reach to satisfy a debt. The Bankruptcy Code gives individual states the authority to expand the categories of exempt assets if they choose. Thus, although bankruptcy law is federal law rather than state law, the amount and type of assets that are beyond the reach of creditors differ depending upon the state in which the debtor files for bankruptcy. Attorneys experienced in handling business bankruptcies can advise a business on where best to file for bankruptcy to receive the most favorable treatment from the local bankruptcy court.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>The Most Common Business Bankruptcies </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Bankruptcy Code creates different categories of bankruptcy, known as chapters, appropriate for different debtors. The most common forms of business bankruptcy are Chapter 7 and Chapter 11.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 7 </STRONG></H3></A>
The vast majority of bankruptcy cases filed are Chapter 7 cases. Chapter 7, often called "liquidation bankruptcy," is commonly used by individuals who simply want to walk away from their debt, but it may also be used by businesses that want to terminate their operations and liquidate their assets. When a debtor files Chapter 7, the bankruptcy court appoints a person to administer the case. This person, called the trustee, is a private citizen, not an employee of the court. The debtor turns over some or all of his or her debts and assets to the trustee, and the trustee then liquidates the property by selling it off and dividing the resulting cash among the creditors. The trustee can sue and be sued on behalf of the estate.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Petition and Schedules </STRONG></H4></A>
A Chapter 7 case begins when the debtor files a petition with the bankruptcy court. Any individual, partnership, or corporation can file Chapter 7 regardless of the amount of debt or whether the debtor is solvent or insolvent. The petition should be filed with the court serving the area where the debtor lives or where his or her principal place of business or assets are located.
<P>
Along with the petition, or shortly thereafter, the debtor files with the court several schedules listing current income and expenditures, a statement of financial affairs, all executory contracts, existing or potential lawsuits by or against the debtor, and any recent transfers of assets. If a debtor does not reveal a debt in these schedules, the bankruptcy court cannot discharge or cancel that debt. Any debt omitted from these schedules is called a non-scheduled debt and is not affected by the bankruptcy.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Stay </STRONG></H4></A>
Filing the petition automatically stops (stays) all of the listed creditors from trying to collect the money owed them. The stay arises automatically, without any judicial action, although the court usually notifies creditors of the filing of the petition. The stay is effective from the time of filing, even if the creditors do not receive notice until much later. As long as the stay is in effect, creditors generally cannot start or continue actions against the debtor to collect on the debt. Lawsuits, garnishment actions, and even telephone calls to the debtor must cease. See the <A HREF="#110">Stay</A> section, below.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Creditors Meeting </STRONG></H4></A>
After the debtor files a Chapter 7 petition, the court appointed trustee administers the case and liquidates assets. The trustee usually calls a meeting of the debtor, the debtor's attorney, and the creditors. The debtor must attend this meeting. Creditors may attend in order to ask questions and examine documents concerning the debtor's financial affairs and property. In most Chapter 7 bankruptcies, all of the debtor's assets are either exempt or subject to valid liens, so there are no assets for creditors to pursue. In these cases, known as "no asset" cases, it is likely that no creditors will attend the creditors meeting. If it appears that a case will have assets to pursue, usually creditors do attend this meeting to gather information about the case because they plan to ask the bankruptcy judge to declare some of the debts non-dischargeable, they plan to challenge the exempt status of some asset, or they plan to file claims. After the creditors meeting, the creditors can file a claim against the debtor with the court. If the debtor has non-exempt assets free of security interests, these are used to satisfy valid claims.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Liquidation, Discharge, and Reaffirmation </STRONG></H4></A>
A Chapter 7 bankruptcy concludes when the trustee sells the debtor's property, distributes the cash to the creditors, and discharges the remaining debt. The trustee's primary role is to sell off the debtor's non-exempt assets in a way that maximizes the amount the creditors receive for their claims. Revenues from assets subject to security interests, such as property subject to a mortgage, are used to satisfy the debt on the particular asset. The discharge extinguishes the debtor's remaining liability on the debt. Certain items are non-dischargeable and thus unaffected by the bankruptcy. Non-dischargeable assets include most tax obligations, liability for damages resulting from willful or malicious acts, debts incurred by giving false financial information, or debts incurred for luxury goods or services just before bankruptcy.
<P>
Creditors can ask the court to deny an individual debtor a discharge. The grounds for denial of discharge are extremely narrow and requests for denial are rarely granted. Grounds for denial include failing to adequately explain the loss of assets, perjury or failing to obey lawful orders of the court, and fraudulently transferring, concealing, or destroying property that should be in the estate.
<P>
Because a secured creditor has rights that permit him or her to seize pledged property, a debtor may want to reaffirm a debt even after it has been discharged if the debtor wants to keep the property. A reaffirmation is an agreement between the debtor and the secured creditor that the creditor will not exercise his or her right to take back the asset so long as the debtor makes payments. A debtor must wait six years before filing for Chapter 7 again.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 11 </STRONG></H3></A>
Chapter 11 is frequently referred to as "reorganization bankruptcy." Individuals are permitted to file for Chapter 11, but it is generally used for business reorganizations. Under this chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor is given time to satisfy its debts while still continuing to operate its business. The major justification for Chapter 11 is that the value of a business as an operating entity is almost always greater than it would be were the business forced to cease operations and its assets sold off. In a Chapter 11 reorganization the debtor is given "breathing room" in which to restructure its debt while continuing to provide jobs for its employees, pay creditors, and produce a return for investors. During the repayment period, the company is usually allowed to continue operating under the current owner unless the creditors can show that the management is unfit to run the company.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Petition </STRONG></H4></A>
Chapter 11 usually commences when the debtor business voluntarily files a bankruptcy petition. Involuntary petitions are discussed below. The voluntary petition should follow official forms available from legal stationery stores. In the petition, the business includes information concerning its name, place of operation, location of principal assets, a debtor's plan or notice of intent to file a plan, and a request for relief. By filing for Chapter 11, the business automatically becomes a "debtor in possession," a debtor that possesses and controls its assets even though undergoing reorganization under Chapter 11. Unlike Chapter 7 bankruptcy cases, a trustee is not automatically appointed in Chapter 11 cases. Instead, in Chapter 11 cases, the bankruptcy judge has discretion to decide whether it is necessary to appoint a trustee. Generally, trustees are not appointed in Chapter 11 cases. If appointed, the trustee assumes control of the business that filed for Chapter 11.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Stay </STRONG></H4></A>
Filing the petition automatically stops (stays) all of the listed creditors from trying to collect the money owed them. The stay arises automatically, without any judicial action, although the court usually does notify creditors of the filing of the petition. The stay is effective from the time of filing, even if the creditors do not receive notice until much later. As long as the stay is in effect, creditors generally cannot start or continue actions against the debtor to collect on the debt. Lawsuits, garnishment actions, and even telephone calls to the debtor must cease. In some situations, such as when a creditor has clear title to a particular property and the property is not necessary to the reorganization, a secured creditor can petition the court for relief from the automatic stay to recover the property.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Plan </STRONG></H4></A>
The debtor also files a written disclosure statement and plan of reorganization with the court. For 120 days after the filing, the debtor has an exclusive right to file a plan. After the exclusive right expires, a creditor or the case trustee can file a competing plan. Chapter 11 cases can drag on in court for years, but the creditors' right to file a competing plan acts as an incentive for the debtor to file a plan within the exclusive period. The disclosure statement contains detailed information about the debtor's assets and liabilities and is meant to be used by the creditors to evaluate the debtor's plan of reorganization. The plan must classify outstanding claims and detail how each class of claims will be treated. The plan also must show that the creditors will receive more money if the business is allowed to continue operation than they would if the assets of the company were liquidated. All creditors whose contractual rights will be modified or who will be paid less than they are owed are given a right to vote on the plan. In order for it to be accepted by the creditors, each class must approve the plan with a majority vote. The plan must also be approved by the court. If the court approves the plan, but some of the creditors do not, the court can force the reluctant creditors to accept it. If a plan is not approved, the company can be liquidated
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Common Bankruptcy Issues </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A number of issues are common in both Chapter 7 and Chapter 11 bankruptcies.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Involuntary Bankruptcy </STRONG></H3></A>
Unlike the situations described above where the debtor decides whether to file bankruptcy, in an involuntary bankruptcy, creditors force the debtor into bankruptcy. Under certain conditions, creditors can petition the Bankruptcy Court to initiate a Chapter 7 or 11 bankruptcy against a debtor. The court will only accept such a petition if it is signed by at least three creditors who are owed a total of at least $5000 in unsecured debt. If a debtor has fewer than 12 unsecured creditors, however, just one unsecured creditor owed at least $5000 can file an involuntary bankruptcy petition.
<P>
Involuntary bankruptcy is rare, but if someone does file a petition against a debtor in Bankruptcy Court, the debtor has an opportunity to file an answer to the petition and refute any charges made against it by creditors in the petition. If the judge sides with the debtor, the court dismisses the petition and can make the creditors pay reasonable attorney's fees and any money the debtor loses in defending the case. In addition, if the judge decides that the petition was filed in bad faith, the court may also order the creditors to pay punitive damages to the debtor.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Conversion, Dismissal, and Suspension </STRONG></H3></A>
The petitioner's original choice of bankruptcy chapter is not permanent. Once begun, a case may be voluntarily or involuntarily converted to a new chapter. Requirements for conversion vary from chapter to chapter, but once converted from a chapter, a case may not be converted back to the previous chapter. 
<P>
The bankruptcy court has authority to suspend or dismiss a case. The court can suspend or dismiss a case "for cause," for failure to pay filing fees, or "if the interests of creditors and the debtor would be better served by such dismissal or suspension."
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Transfers to Avoid Losing an Asset in Bankruptcy </STRONG></H3></A>
Some transfers that are valid in regular business relationships are invalid when one party is in or approaching bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Code empowers a bankruptcy trustee to invalidate a number of transfers made prior to a bankruptcy filing.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Fraudulent Conveyances </STRONG></H4></A>
The Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act is designed to remove any temptation a debtor may have to hide property, for example, by giving it to a relative before declaring bankruptcy. Any transfer of the debtor's assets made within 90 days of filing for bankruptcy or within one year if a relative or business associate is involved is carefully scrutinized by the Bankruptcy Court. If the court determines that the debtor was attempting to defraud creditors by selling property at a below-market price, the court can order the property or other assets be given over to the trustee. Anything that was sold at a reasonable market value before a bankruptcy filing cannot be recovered by the court under the rules of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Preferences </STRONG></H4></A>
A preference occurs when a debtor unfairly treats one creditor more favorably than another creditor similarly situated. For instance, if a debtor with only $100 owes $100 each to creditors A and B and pays A completely, leaving nothing for B, then A has received a preference and B has been harmed by the preference given to A. Bankruptcy condemns preferences if the following conditions exist:
<UL>
<LI>Transfer is for the benefit of a creditor
<LI>Transfer is made for debt owed prior to the initiation of bankruptcy
<LI>The debtor is insolvent at the time of transfer
<LI>Transfer is made either 90 days before filing of the bankruptcy or one year before filing if made to an insider such as a relative or director of a corporate debtor
<LI>Transfer lets a creditor receive more than it would have in a hypothetical Chapter 7 liquidation of the debtor's estate
</UL>
Creditors receiving preferences can be forced to "disgorge" them by returning the assets to the debtor's estate so that other creditors can share them equally.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Effects of Declaring Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The old adage that it is better to know how to swim before jumping into deep water applies to any business considering filing bankruptcy. One of the most obvious effects of declaring bankruptcy can be serious damage to one's business credit rating. Because a bad credit rating can follow a business for a long time, even relatively simple bankruptcies are not painless.
<P>
Another drawback to bankruptcy is public exposure. One of the first events in many bankruptcies is a meeting between the debtor and all its creditors. At this meeting, the creditors and a court-appointed trustee are allowed to examine all the debtor's financial records, such as bank statements and loan documents, and ask questions about how money has been spent. For a business with anything unsavory to hide, a bankruptcy proceeding can be incriminating. For some businesses, the public exposure of bankruptcy may permit competitors to get an unfair inside look at how the business is run.
<P>
Finally, bankruptcy can be expensive. Understandably, bankruptcy attorneys are very careful about a client's ability to pay legal bills. Most bankruptcy attorneys usually collect enough money in advance from their near-bankrupt clients to handle a typical bankruptcy filing. Any contest with creditors will push fees higher, to a level that many businesses may be unable to pay. In addition, the trustee in charge of a bankruptcy case is paid by commission, a percentage of the money that he or she distributes to pay creditors.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Alternatives to Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Any business in financial trouble has undoubtedly received many letters from creditors demanding payment on debts owed. Even a very demanding creditor may have a change of heart once a debtor mentions the possibility of filing bankruptcy, because creditors know that bankruptcy means that they may only get a fraction of what is owed them.
<P>
If a business is confident that its financial problems are only temporary, it may want to consider asking major creditors to accept reduced payments for a short period or asking for a short delay in making payments. Provided that the debtor has not already given creditors reason to doubt its sincerity, e.g., by completely ignoring their letters or by consistently breaking promises, chances are good that creditors will agree on one of these plans.
<P>
As mentioned above, creditors know that bankruptcy means they will probably get just a small fraction of the total sum owed them. Creditors also know that if they sue to collect their money, they will undergo the hassle of going to a judge to get a court order to force the debtor to pay. This is time consuming and costly. All these factors make it more likely that a creditor will agree to a repayment plan.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Workouts </STRONG></H3></A>
The term "workout" is used to describe a somewhat nebulous process whereby a business and its creditors get together to realign their financial expectations of each other. Workouts can be traumatizing and all parties involved typically come away with less than they had going into the process, but a successful workout can be better for all involved than bankruptcy. If a business's financial prospects dramatically worsen, creditors may need to accept a lower rate of interest or payments drawn out over a longer period of time, or they may see the business collapse entirely. Creditors, shareholders, labor unions, management, and suppliers need to realize that diminished returns from a financially troubled company may be preferable to the returns from a defunct company. The primary advantages of workout over bankruptcy are that workout gives the parties greater control over the process (no interference from bankruptcy court) and it can dramatically cut legal fees.
<P>
Workout sometimes commences voluntarily when far-sighted management, realizing that commitments will not be met, approaches creditors to obtain more favorable terms. Dramatic events, such as litigation losses, environmental catastrophes, and changes in business or economic conditions can also trigger the need for workout.
<P>
Workout and bankruptcy proceedings are often interrelated. For example, the threat of filing for bankruptcy may provide needed impetus for recalcitrant parties to agree to a workout plan. Similarly, if a business is able to agree to a plan of workout with most, but not all, of its creditors and investors, then a Chapter 11 petition may be used as a tool to force the remaining creditors to go along with the terms of the workout.
<P>
To the uninitiated, workout may seem like a game with no rules or a trip without a map. In part, this is true; the parties have a great deal of flexibility to come to new terms between themselves. Theoretically, they can do whatever they want. Realistically, however, the possibility of filing for Chapter 11 creates a set of "pseudo-rules" for workouts that establish parameters for negotiations. Parties know that if they refuse to go along with a plan similar to what would be approved in a hypothetical Chapter 11 case, bankruptcy proceedings can be initiated, and a plan enforced against their will. Similarly, if a debtor and one creditor come to a workout agreement that unfairly disadvantages other creditors, the remaining creditors might initiate involuntary bankruptcy proceedings and have the workout plan invalidated as a preference.
<P>
The biggest concern for lenders going into workout negotiations is potential lender liability. A creditor always needs to resist the temptation to take control of the business because if a creditor becomes so involved in the debtor's business that it controls the business, the creditor may become liable for any damages incurred. This possibility is particularly serious because the definition of when a creditor "controls a debtor" is hazy and difficult to define. There is no simple formula to apply and courts look to all the creditor's actions in the broadest context. Financial management of a debtor's business can have especially high risks in environmental matters. In one notorious case (the <STRONG>Fleet Factors</STRONG> decision), a court held that a lender could be held liable for Superfund cleanup costs of the debtor's facility if the lender "had the ability to influence the hazardous waste decisions of its borrower" even though the lender had never actually participated in the decision-making process. Mere ability to influence can equal lender liability.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Business Tax Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Businesses are responsible for paying a variety of local, state and federal taxes, depending in part on how the business is organized, the services the business provides, and the products it sells. In general, businesses are liable for federal and state income taxes, state sales tax, Social Security and Medicare tax (FICA), federal unemployment tax (FUTA), and state unemployment tax. Businesses involved in the sale of alcohol, tobacco, or fuel and those that generate hazardous waste are liable for additional taxes. Businesses that have employees are responsible for withholding taxes from the pay of employees. This chapter discusses some of these liabilities and responsibilities.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Taxes and the Form of Organization </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Minnesota businesses are responsible for different types of taxes depending on the way they are organized. The three common forms of business organization -- sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations -- are discussed here. Limited liability companies that are recognized as partnerships in Minnesota are treated as partnerships for tax purposes. For more information on the forms of business organization, see the <A HREF="b11.html">Closely Held Business Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Sole Proprietorship </STRONG></H3></A>
Under a sole proprietorship, the owner is the taxpayer. Thus, the individual tax rate applies, rather than the higher corporate rate. The owner reports income and expenses from the business on his or her individual federal income tax return, using federal Schedule C with Form 1040. Generally, a sole proprietor cannot claim personal insurance, such as health, dental, and life insurance, as a business expense. Most sole proprietors are liable for self-employment tax, discussed in this chapter in the Employment Taxes section, which is filed with federal Form SE. Usually, sole proprietors make estimated tax payments in quarterly installments during the year, using federal Form 1040-ES and Minnesota Form M-14. There is no special form for reporting sole proprietorship income to the state. Instead, copies of the federal forms and schedules are attached to Minnesota's individual return, Form M-1. 
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Partnership </STRONG></H3></A>
A partnership itself does not pay taxes; each partner reports his or her income and deductions individually on federal Form 1040, Schedule E, and Minnesota Form M-1. Thus, the individual tax rate rather than the higher corporate rate applies. Generally, benefits such as health, dental, and life insurance are not deductible by individual partners. Partners are usually liable for self-employment tax, and they generally make quarterly estimated tax payments toward their year-end tax liability, using federal Form 1040-ES and Minnesota Form M-14. Even though it does not pay taxes directly, a partnership is required to file a federal "information return" (Form 1065) which reports partnership income and distributions to the partners. Other forms and schedules may be required. A partnership is also required to file an information return (Form M-3) with the Minnesota Department of Revenue (MDOR). Partnerships with combined Minnesota payroll, property, and sales of $500,000 or greater are subject to a graduated minimum fee to the state.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Corporation </STRONG></H3></A>
A corporation is an association of shareholders created under law and regarded by the courts as an "artificial person" with its own legal identity. There are two kinds of corporations, C corporations and S corporations, and each is subject to different tax laws. At the federal level, a C corporation is taxed under the provisions of Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code, and it is subject to a tax rate that is higher than the individual rate. For 1993, the corporate tax rate ranged from 15 percent for corporations with incomes of $50,000 or less to 35 for those with incomes over $10 million. Corporations use federal Form 1120 or Form 1120-A to report income, deductions, and credits, and to compute tax. Other forms may also be required.
<P>
A C corporation's taxable income is determined prior to distribution of shareholder dividends. A shareholder reports dividend income from a C corporation on his or her individual Form 1040. Thus, profits that are distributed as dividends are taxed twice -- once on the C corporation's tax return and again on an individual shareholder's tax return. Shareholders are not able to use a corporation's losses for their individual tax purposes. However, dividends may be accumulated to certain limits by a corporation to postpone the double taxation. For state taxes, a C corporation uses Minnesota Form M-4 and is liable for a minimum fee based on property, payroll, and sales attributable to Minnesota.
<P>
For purposes of the state income tax, C corporations are permitted to deduct:
<UL>
<LI>Contributions to the state or its political subdivisions for exclusively public purposes
<LI>Contributions to Minnesota charities
<LI>Contributions to a non-Minnesota charity, in proportion to the charity's activity in Minnesota, provided the charity conducts a large portion of its activities in Minnesota
<LI>Gifts to the federal government of Minnesota real property
</UL>
Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code applies to an S corporation, which generally is not directly liable for federal income tax. Instead, each shareholder pays tax on his or her share of the S corporation's income and deductions by including it on federal Form 1040. However, an S corporation is required to file federal Form 1120-S with supporting schedules. Also, an S corporation files Minnesota Form M-3S-4, and it must pay a minimum fee to the state based on property, payroll, and a proportion of its sales attributable to Minnesota. Corporations that do business in Minnesota or own property in Minnesota may be subject to Minnesota taxes if they are determined to have a sufficient connection or nexus with the state. Some activities that justify imposition of Minnesota tax laws are:
<UL>
<LI>Having a place of business in Minnesota
<LI>Having employees or independent contractors conducting business in Minnesota
<LI>Owning or leasing tangible personal property in Minnesota
<LI>Obtaining or regularly soliciting business from within Minnesota
</UL>
A C corporation that expects to be liable for $500 or more in taxes must make estimated tax payments. Federal estimated tax payments are made quarterly to an authorized financial institution or Federal Reserve Bank, using Form 1120-W. Minnesota estimated tax payments are also due quarterly. They are made with Form M-18 to the MDOR. Penalties may be assessed for failure to pay estimated taxes promptly. S corporations are required to pay estimated tax on any income that is not passed to shareholders. For purposes of state income tax, a corporation may carry forward a net operating loss for 15 years, and may use the loss to offset future years' income. However, a net operating loss cannot be used to offset tax paid on personal income in previous years.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Businesses that Operate Inside and Outside of Minnesota </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Firms that do business both inside and outside of Minnesota are assessed state income tax based on a weighted formula that takes into account the percentage of property, payroll, and total sales that is attributable to the business' Minnesota operations. A sale is considered subject to Minnesota taxes if its destination was Minnesota. Minnesota does not follow a "throwback rule," which means that sales made to states that do not assess tax are not subject to Minnesota taxes.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Tax Credits </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Various federal tax credits are available to certain businesses. Some examples that were effective for 1995 include:
<UL>
<LI>Businesses that had 30 or fewer full-time employees or $1 million or less in gross receipts were eligible for credit for expenses related to complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
<LI>Employers of persons from targeted groups with particularly high unemployment rates or special employment needs were eligible for credits for wages paid to members of the targeted groups.
<LI>Some businesses that increased their research activities over a base amount were eligible for a credit of about 20 percent of the amount of increase.
</UL>
The state of Minnesota also provides a number of tax credits to businesses to encourage them to engage in socially beneficial endeavors. An enterprise zone credit is available to partnerships and corporations, and this credit may be passed through to partners and S corporation shareholders. Enterprise zones are areas that have been designated for encouragement of business growth. Enterprise zone businesses may qualify for certain sales tax exemptions, as well as income and property tax credits. Other credits currently available are alternative minimum tax carryover credit, alternative minimum credit for individuals, and research and experimental expenditures credit. The MDOR is the contact office for more information on these credits.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Taxpayer Identification Numbers </STRONG></H3></A>
There are three types of taxpayer identification numbers that apply to Minnesota businesses: the Federal Employer Identification Number (EIN), the Minnesota Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN), and the Unemployment Compensation Employer Identification Number. An EIN is required for all businesses. A sole proprietor generally uses his or her personal Social Security number as the EIN. However, certain sole proprietors, and all partnerships and corporations must apply for an EIN from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) using Form SS-4. Sole proprietors must apply if they have employees or have a retirement plan, or if they are liable for federal excise taxes, such as for alcohol, tobacco, or firearms. A TIN is required for all Minnesota businesses. Sole proprietors who do not have employees, who are not required to file information returns, and who do not make retail sales that are subject to Minnesota sales and use tax generally may use their Social Security number. Other businesses must submit an Application for Business Registration (Form ABR) to the MDOR. There is a $100 penalty for failure to obtain the number. Businesses with employees are required to get an Unemployment Compensation Employer Identification Number by registering with the Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Selecting the Tax Year </STRONG></H3></A>
A tax return is based on an accounting period called a tax year. A tax year may be either a calendar year or a fiscal year. A calendar year is 12 consecutive months from January 1st through December 31st. A fiscal year is generally composed of any other 12 consecutive months. Once a tax year is established, a business needs IRS approval to change it. Businesses use the same tax year for federal and state tax returns. Sole proprietorships usually use a calendar tax year. A partnership generally must use the same tax year as the partners who own a majority interest. If the majority partners' years differ, the business must use the same tax year as the principal partners -- those with a 5 percent or greater interest in partnership profits or capital. If the principal partners' years conflict, a partnership generally uses a calendar tax year. A fiscal tax year can be used if either of the following is true:
<UL>
<LI>The IRS agrees that there is a business purpose for using a fiscal year.
<LI>The partnership files IRS Form 8716, Election to Have a Tax Year Other than a Required Tax Year, also known as a "Section 444 election." In this case, a business may have to pay a fee that represents the amount of tax deferral benefit that results from using a fiscal, rather than calendar, year.
</UL>
A C corporation's first income tax return establishes its tax year. The first tax year must not be greater than 12 months from the date of incorporation. A C corporation that provides personal services must use a calendar tax year unless it has IRS approval to use a fiscal year or it makes a Section-444 election. An S corporation must use a calendar tax year unless it gets IRS approval. In some cases, S corporations may make a Section-444 election. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Employment Taxes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A number of taxes are of interest to businesses with employees.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Payroll Taxes </STRONG></H3></A>
The taxes discussed here are often called payroll taxes because employers are responsible for deducting an employee's share from his or her earnings before the employee is paid.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>FICA Taxes </STRONG></H4></A>
Taxes under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) help pay for Social Security and Medicare benefits. Businesses without employees do not pay FICA tax. Instead, most sole proprietors and partners in partnerships without employees pay a self-employment tax, which is discussed later in this chapter. Businesses that have employees contribute half of the total FICA tax, and are responsible for collecting the other half from employees through payroll deductions. For 1995, the tax rate for the Social Security portion of FICA tax was 6.2 percent each for employers and employees (a total of 12.4 percent). The maximum wage subject to the tax changes annually. The 1995 tax rate for the Medicare portion of FICA tax was 1.45 percent each for employers and employees (2.9 percent total).  Special rules apply to employees who receive tips, to persons who receive both wages and self-employment income, and to non-wage payments to employees for items such as meals, lodging, clothing, and some services. The employer's share of FICA taxes is deductible as a business expense.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Income Tax Withholding </STRONG></H4></A>
Along with the employee's share of FICA tax, employers must withhold federal and state income tax from the employee's pay. The amount to withhold is determined by the employee's pay and by the number of withholding allowances that the employee claims on federal Form W-4, Withholding Allowance Certificate. Employees are required to complete Form W-4 when hired, and generally, the employer retains the form. However, the form must be filed with the IRS if the employee claims more than ten withholding allowances, or the employee claims exemption from withholding and his or her wages normally exceed $200 per week. A monetary penalty may be assessed against the employer for any form that is not filed when required. 
<P>
Employees who reside in North Dakota, Wisconsin, or Michigan may claim exemption from withholding Minnesota state tax. To do so, the employee must complete Form MW-R, Reciprocity Exemption from Minnesota Withholding each year. Employers of truck drivers, bus drivers, and railroad workers who cross state BORDERs while working must withhold taxes for the employee's state of residence. Payments to entertainers who are not residents of Minnesota for performances in Minnesota are subject to a two percent compensation tax. This tax must be withheld from the entertainer's pay and remitted to the state by the end of the month following the performance.
<P>
Employers must furnish a statement of wages and taxes (federal Form W-2) to employees by January 31st of each year, or, if requested by the employee, within 30 days of termination. The federal copy of Form W-2 must be submitted to the IRS, accompanied by federal Form M-3, Transmittal of Income and Tax Statements. The state copy must be sent to the MDOR by February 28th, accompanied by either Minnesota Form MW-3, Annual Reconciliation of Income Tax Withheld, or Form MW-1A, Annual Return/Reconciliation.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Payroll Tax Return </STRONG></H4></A>
Generally, employers report FICA taxes and withheld federal income tax together on federal Form 941, Employer's Quarterly Federal Tax Return, which, as the name implies, is filed at the end of each calendar quarter. There are different forms to be used for agricultural and household workers and for employees who are not subject to FICA taxes. Most employers are required to make deposits for payroll taxes before returns are actually due. How often deposits must be made is determined in part by how much tax liability a business has accrued in the past. For example, a business that owed $50,000 or less in payroll taxes during a specific previous 12-month period may be designated a monthly depositor; a business that owed $50,000 to $100,000 during the specific period may be designated a semi-weekly depositor. The depositor designation is reevaluated annually. A business' actual tax liability at the end of each deposit period determines whether it must actually make a deposit. If the amount of accumulated undeposited liability reaches $100,000 in any period, taxes must be deposited the day after that volume is reached, and if the business' deposit status was monthly, it is immediately changed to semi-weekly.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Self-Employment Tax </STRONG></H3></A>
Self-employment tax is a Social Security and Medicare tax for individuals who work for themselves. This includes sole proprietors and most partners in partnerships without employees. Net earnings of $400 or more are subject to self-employment tax. For 1995, there were ceilings on the amount of earnings subject to the tax: $61,200 for the Social Security portion of the tax; but no ceiling for the Medicare portion. The Social Security portion was assessed at 12.4 percent of earnings, and Medicare at 2.9 percent, for a total self-employment tax of 15.3 percent. Federal Schedule SE is used to calculate self-employment tax, which is then added to one's total tax liability on Form 1040. One-half of the self-employment tax is deductible as an adjustment to gross income on Form 1040.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Unemployment Tax </STRONG></H3></A>
Both the federal and state governments have programs to help support able workers who lose their jobs. Tax under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) is reported by eligible employers once per year on federal Form 940 or 940-EZ. The form is usually due one month after the end of a calendar year. However, deposits toward the annual payment are required at the end of any quarter in which the employer accrues $100 or more in FUTA tax liability. Penalties may be imposed for late filing and late deposits. Most employers, even those with part-time employees, are responsible for paying FUTA tax. The general rule is that a business is subject to FUTA tax if the business pays wages of $1500 or more in any calendar quarter, or the business had at least one part-time employee in each of 20 different (not necessarily consecutive) calendar weeks. In addition, FUTA tax is due on cash wages of $1000 or more paid in any calendar quarter to domestic workers who work in a private home, local college club, or local fraternity or sorority house.
<P>
A business that employs farm workers is subject to FUTA tax on their wages if the wages total $20,000 or more in any calendar quarter, or if there was at least one day in each of 20 different calendar weeks when the business had ten or more at least part-time farm workers. The tax is figured at a rate of 6.2 percent of the wages paid to the employee up to $7000. Tip income reported by an employee to an employer for FICA tax purposes is considered wages for calculating FUTA tax. However, the tax does not apply to some payments, such as Workers' Compensation payments, nor does it apply to certain types of employment, such as earnings paid to cooperative education students. A business is credited for up to 5.4 percent of the amount it pays for state unemployment tax, which can reduce the actual tax liability to 0.8 percent. The IRS administers the FUTA tax.
<P>
The state has its own unemployment program and corresponding taxes. Any employer that conducts business in Minnesota is required to submit Form DJT-13, Report to Determine Liability, to the Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training (MDJT) within a month of initiating business in the state. The MDJT then informs the business whether it is liable for the tax. Liability is based on the number and type of employees, the amount of wages paid, and other factors. The tax rate for new employers is generally the state's benefit cost rate, which is 1.9 percent. Construction businesses are assigned a separate rate, which cannot be less than 1.0 percent or more than 9.0 percent. The maximum benefit cost rate for all other businesses is 5.4 percent. Once a business has paid unemployment tax for a period of time, the tax rate will be based on the business's experience. Minimum experience rates range from 0.1 percent to 0.6 percent. The maximum experience rate is 9.0 percent. An employer's experience rate is redetermined annually, just after June 30th. 
<P>
If the state unemployment fund falls below a certain amount as of June 30th of any year, a business becomes liable for a "solvency assessment" of 10 to 15 percent of its regular annual contributions. The assessment is payable with the following year's contributions. All employers that pay unemployment tax are also liable for a special assessment for the Dislocated Worker Fund, calculated as 0.1 percent of taxable payroll. The tax is due on the first $15,100 of each covered employee's earnings (base wages). Wages include cash wages, salary, commissions, S corporation dividends when credited to shareholders as services, and the reasonable value of meals and housing provided to an employee. Wages contributed to deferred income plans, such as a "401(k)" plan, and "cafeteria" or flexible benefit plans are also taxable. Certain payments are not taxable, such as Workers' Compensation and retirement payments. Minnesota requires that businesses pay unemployment taxes quarterly. The quarterly tax return has two parts: the Contribution Report contains summarized information; the Wage Detail Report shows information for each employee. There are penalties and fines that can be imposed on businesses that fail to file on time, do not pay the necessary employment taxes, or fail to keep accurate employment records. MDJT audits employer records periodically. The business can deduct unemployment taxes as business expenses.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Acquired Businesses </STRONG></H3></A>
A firm that acquires an existing business that has been subject to unemployment tax is required to file Form DJT-13S, Report to Determine Succession. The new business may be eligible to have an experience rate computed based on all or part of the predecessor's experience; in some cases, an acquired business may be required to use the predecessor's experience rating. By statute, an individual or business that acquires all or part of an existing Minnesota employer's business or assets is jointly and severally liable for the predecessor's unpaid tax, interest, and liabilities.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Sales and Use Taxes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Minnesota sales tax is due on the gross receipts from selling, leasing, or renting tangible personal property at the retail level. Some services, such as building cleaning, lawn and garden maintenance, and tailoring, are also subject to state sales tax. Generally, retail sales do not include transactions where the customer buys items either to resell them or to incorporate them into something new for sale at retail. A general sales tax rate of 6.5 percent applies to most retail sales. Some exceptions to this are alcohol sales, which are taxed at a rate of 9 percent, and sales of some farm machinery, logging equipment, and agriculture production equipment, which are taxed at a 2.5 percent rate. The use tax applies to purchases of goods that are not subject to Minnesota sales tax but will be stored, used, or consumed in the state. This includes items that are purchased outside of Minnesota, items that were originally purchased for resale but then used directly, and items that are purchased in Minnesota where sales tax is not collected. Items become subject to the use tax when they enter Minnesota, are taken from inventory for use, or are purchased from a Minnesota seller. The use tax rate is the same as the sales tax rate, 6.5 percent.
<P>
Anyone who makes retail sales or who provides taxable services in Minnesota must have a sales and use tax permit. This includes any seller located outside of Minnesota who: 
<UL>
<LI>Is a corporation authorized to do business in Minnesota
<LI>Has a place of business in Minnesota, either directly or by a subsidiary
<LI>Has any type of temporary or permanent agent in Minnesota for any purpose, including repair, delivery, or installation of taxable items
<LI>Solicits sales of tangible personal property in Minnesota
</UL>
Businesses obtain the sales and use tax permit from the MDOR using Form ABR, Application for Business Registration. Generally, sales and use tax returns are due monthly. A business may file annually if it averages less than $25 per month in taxes, or quarterly, if less than $250 per month. However, it must file Form ST-12, Application to File Quarterly or Annual Returns, to obtain authorization. MDOR provides preprinted sales-tax returns to permit holders. The return, Form ST-1, must be postmarked by the 20th day of the month following the end of a reporting period to be considered timely. A business is required to collect sales tax even if it has not yet received its permit.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Exemptions </STRONG></H3></A>
Certain customers are not required to pay Minnesota sales tax at the time of purchase. The MDOR requires that these customers present a properly completed exemption certificate to the seller. Certificates are subject to inspection by MDOR, and thus, the seller should keep them on file to substantiate sales where tax was not collected. Customers who frequently make exempt purchases can obtain a blanket exemption certificate that applies to future purchases.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Local Sales Tax </STRONG></H3></A>
In addition to the sales tax imposed by the state, a number of cities have been granted authority to impose local sales taxes as well. Also, all towns or cities in Minnesota have the right to impose a "lodging tax" on hotels and motels for the purpose of funding a convention or tourism bureau to promote tourism to the city. Bloomington, Duluth, Minneapolis, Rochester, St. Cloud, and St. Paul impose a lodging tax. Duluth, Minneapolis, Rochester, St. Cloud, and St. Paul also impose general sales taxes. Minneapolis also taxes restaurants and liquor in its downtown area. Permits and filing forms for the sales taxes imposed by Minneapolis, Rochester, and St. Cloud are obtained from the MDOR, Business Tax Unit; information on sales taxes in the other cities is available directly from the cities.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Other Taxes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Business owners also need to be aware of a variety of miscellaneous taxes.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Other State Taxes </STRONG></H3></A>
An excise tax of 6.5 percent is assessed on the sale of most motor vehicles. A lower or special rate may apply to passenger vehicles ten years old or older, collector vehicles, and certain other vehicles. This tax is administered by the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, Driver and Vehicle Services Division. Any business that generates more than 100 pounds of hazardous waste per year is subject to a hazardous waste tax based on the quantity of waste and the disposal method used. For a discussion of hazardous waste, see the <A HREF="b17.html">Environmental Law</A> Chapter. The rate for very small quantity generators is a flat $50; the tax for other generators begins at $200 for small quantities and at $500 for large quantities. The tax is payable annually to the MDOR, using Form HZ-1, Minnesota Hazardous Waste Tax Generator Annual Tax Return. Tax revenues are used to clean up hazardous waste in the state. Businesses that sell gasoline, propane, or diesel fuel and wholesalers and distributors of cigarettes and alcohol are responsible for collecting appropriate taxes for those items from customers and remitting the taxes to the state.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Other Federal Taxes </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal government assesses various excise taxes. For example, excise taxes are imposed on the sale, use, or lease of the following articles by the manufacturer, producer, or importer: sport fishing equipment, electric outboard motors and certain sonar devices, bows and arrows, highway-type tires, gas guzzling automobiles, certain vaccines, coal, and alcohol sold as fuel but not used as fuel. There are environmental excise taxes, such as taxes on the sale or manufacturing use of certain ozone-depleting chemicals, and there are luxury taxes, such as a tax on the sale of passenger vehicles that cost over $30,000.
<P>
Many of these taxes are reported with federal Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return. Although the return is filed quarterly, the taxes generally must be deposited before the return is due. There are additional excise taxes that are reported separately from those described above. For example, certain heavy vehicles are subject to a federal highway use tax. This includes buses, truck tractors, and trucks with gross vehicle weights of 55,000 pounds or more. Pickup and panel trucks are not subject to the tax. Generally, the vehicles must be used on public roads more than 5,000 miles per year. This tax is reported on IRS Form 2290, Heavy Vehicle Use Tax Return. There are also taxes on alcohol, tobacco, and firearms that are filed with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Closely Held Business Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

A business that is closely held is one that is owned by a single individual or small number of persons. It is a business whose stocks are not traded or easily available for purchase on a stock exchange or, under Minnesota law, one that does not have more than 35 shareholders. Attorneys who specialize in helping small and closely held businesses can help companies decide how best to organize. They also can help owners understand the consequences of the various organizational structures for governmental regulation, day-to-day operation, and tax purposes. This chapter discusses the legal aspects of starting, operating, and selling small and closely held businesses.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Organization </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
One of the first, and possibly most important, decisions a person starting a small business will make is how to organize the business. This decision is an important one because it can have important tax consequences and can affect the way the business operates. There are many ways to organize a closely held business, including sole proprietorships, partnerships, franchises, corporations, and limited liability companies.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Sole Proprietorship </STRONG></H3></A>
The simplest way to own a closely held business is the sole proprietorship, in which the business is owned and controlled by one person who reports the debts and profits of the business on his or her personal income tax return. One person owns, manages, and controls the business. A sole proprietorship may have employees, but only the owner is in charge of the business. The owner receives the business profits and losses. The owner is also personally responsible for any debts the business may incur. Income, expenses, and losses are reported on the business owner's individual tax return.
<P>
A sole proprietorship is relatively easy to organize. The business owner is responsible for getting appropriate licenses, if any, and tax identification numbers, and must register the business name. There are no specific state filing requirements for this business option.
<P>
The benefits of the sole proprietorship include having complete control over the business, ease of the initial set-up, and having business profits taxed at the individual taxpayer rate, which is lower than the rate charged to corporations. The drawbacks to sole proprietorship include being personally responsible for debts and liabilities of the business. For example, if a business owner has debts that are not being paid, the creditors can reach the personal assets of the business owner, such as a personal checking account, house, or car. A business owner may obtain insurance to minimize this drawback. Other drawbacks include lack of continuity -- when the business owner dies, the business ceases to exist -- and generally not being able to deduct benefits like health, dental, and life insurance on a sole proprietor's income tax return as business expenses.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Partnership </STRONG></H3></A>
A partnership is formed anytime two or more people who have not filed for incorporation agree to carry on a business together and to share profits and liability. A partnership is relatively easy to form and can be valid even without a written agreement setting forth its terms.
<P>
There are two types of partnerships, general and limited. In a general partnership each partner has an equal voice in how the business is run. Minnesota courts have ruled that a partnership can be formed merely by the act of two people running a business together, whether or not they ever had a formal agreement to do so. Usually, however, the partners draw up an agreement that specifies how the partnership will make decisions, when and how the partners can withdraw profits, and how each will be required to make contributions to the business. A chief advantage to forming a general partnership is that it is relatively inexpensive to start, as the agreement need not be filed with any governmental entity. In a general partnership, each partner is equally liable for the agreements and debts of the business.
<P>
A limited partnership sets limits on the power of partners to conduct business and affords limited liability to each partner. A limited partner is prohibited from managing or making day-to-day-decisions concerning the business but is shielded from most debts incurred by the company. More legal formalities must be met under this type of arrangement than in a general partnership. In Minnesota, a limited partnership can only be formed in accordance with the Uniform Limited Partnership Act. State and federal tax codes make a number of distinctions between limited and general partnerships. In general, neither kind of partnership has to pay federal income tax, instead, each partner pays tax at the individual tax rates on his or her share of the profits.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Corporation </STRONG></H3></A>
A corporation differs from a partnership in that it is treated as a separate legal entity in and of itself rather than as a collection of individuals. A corporation is owned by one or more shareholders and must meet certain legal requirements spelled out in its articles of incorporation. The corporation is managed by a board of directors, who are elected from the shareholders of the corporation.
<P>
The corporation is taxed as a separate entity, and shareholders are not liable for the corporation's losses nor for any claims against the company. Under both state and federal tax laws, the corporation reports its income, losses, and expenses on a corporate income tax return.
<P>
One of the biggest drawbacks to incorporating a business is double taxation. Double taxation occurs because a corporation's income is taxed before dividends are paid to shareholders, but shareholders also have to report the gains as taxable income on their own individual tax returns.
<P>
All corporations, whether small or large, are expected to adhere to certain formalities, such as holding regular meetings of the board of directors and of shareholders. However, the small size of most closely held corporations and the tendency for shareholders to take active roles in the operation and management of the corporation often mean that many small and closely held corporations ignore such formalities. The failure to observe corporate formalities can be very unwise.
<P>
Sometimes, individuals use the corporate entity to insulate themselves from personal liability and the consequences of their actions. In such cases, when creditors find themselves unable to pursue their claims against closely held corporations, creditors may ask a court to ignore the organization's corporate status and impose liability upon the shareholders. Courts are more likely to take this action, called "piercing the corporate veil," in cases in which shareholders have not regularly conducted the business like a corporation or when the business has a seriously inadequate financial base for operation.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Professional Corporation </STRONG></H3></A>
Professional corporations are formed by professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and accountants for the purpose of saving money on their taxes through pension plans and deferred-income programs. 
<P>
A professional corporation is much like any other corporation except that it can be formed by only one person and can engage in only one category of professional service. Also, only other individuals licensed to practice in that particular profession can own shares in such a corporation. The shares cannot be easily transferred. Although forming a professional corporation does not shield the individual from liability for professional malpractice, it can shield an individual from liability for malpractice committed by other persons with whom he or she associates.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Limited Liability Company </STRONG></H3></A>
As of January 1, 1993, companies in Minnesota have another option for organization. They can organize as a limited liability company, which allows them to take advantage of the favorable tax treatment of a partnership while preserving the limited liability of a corporation. A limited liability company must have at least two members and a limited lifetime, and ownership of the company cannot be transferred freely. This type of company limits the amount an investor in the corporation can lose, either from a lawsuit against the corporation or from other losses. Generally, the amount the investor can lose is limited to the amount he or she invests in the limited liability corporation. In addition, the liability of the corporation itself is limited to the value of its assets. Instead of being taxed as a single organization, the limited liability company is taxed through the income of its owners. All stockholders are allowed to participate in the decision-making process of the company, unlike members of a limited partnership.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Franchise </STRONG></H3></A>
A franchise is an agreement, sometimes in the form of a contract, that allows the franchisee (the person buying the franchise) to use a marketing system that has been designed by the franchisor (the seller). The business is closely associated with the trademark or commercial identity of the franchisor and the franchisee must pay a fee for the use of the marketing system.
<P>
Some prognosticators have predicted that by the year 2000 more than one-half of all retail stores in America will be franchises. There is generally less of a financial risk associated with the purchase of a franchise because the marketing strategy has proven successful in the past. It is often easier for a franchise to obtain financing than it is for another independent business, even if both want financing for the same reason.
<P>
While a franchise fee does not guarantee success in business, the purchaser of a franchise can usually expect some help, services, and support from the franchisor. Among other things, the purchaser might receive help choosing a site for the business in the form of feasibility studies of the location and the demographics of the area where he or she hopes to locate the business. A franchisee might also expect to receive help in negotiating a lease for the business and financial assistance with the start-up and initial operating costs. Finally, a franchisor often provides a franchisee with training, support, advertising, product discounts, and further assistance.
<P>
In Minnesota, there are three specific elements that must be present with a franchise: a fee, a name, and a community of interest. Any offer that meets this definition may be subject to regulations found in the Minnesota Franchise Act. A franchise must be registered with the Minnesota Department of Commerce before any sales are made. In addition, certain fees are owed, such as a $400 application fee and several additional filing fees.
<P>
There are some exemptions to registration and a wide variety of state regulations with which franchises must comply. Copies of the Minnesota Franchise Act, the rules of the Department of Commerce, and the Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (a form of franchise guidelines accepted in almost every state) are all available from the State of Minnesota Bookstore.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Buying or Selling a Closely Held Business </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Buying or selling a business is like buying or selling anything else, only much more complicated. In many closely held businesses, family concerns can influence, even dominate, business decision making. The decision to buy or sell a business can be motivated by a divorce, death, or personal animosities between business associates so emotions may override prudent business judgment. The advice of professionals can be invaluable before buying or selling any business, especially a closely held business.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Transferability </STRONG></H3></A>
The ease of transferability of ownership varies depending on the way a business is organized. The assets of a sole proprietorship are easy to transfer. A sole proprietorship can be sold by selling all the assets of the business to another person, who then becomes the new sole proprietor of the business. A partnership is not easily transferable. Unless otherwise specified, no person can become a partner unless all of the other partners agree. Thus, if a partner sells his or her share in the business to someone who is not already a partner, the purchaser does not then become a partner but merely earns the profits that the seller otherwise would have received. To avoid this situation, most partnership agreements specify the conditions under which partnership status can be transferred. Sometimes partners have buy-sell agreements between themselves that obligate remaining partners to buy out the interest of a partner who wants to sell his or her interest. Buy-sell agreements can be mandatory, that is, requiring remaining partners to buy out a departing partner, or optional, giving the remaining partner or partners the right of first refusal should one partner want to sell his or her interest.
<P>
Shares in a corporation are usually the easiest to transfer because, by definition, a corporation is made up of shareholders who may transfer ownership of their shares to others. However, in the case of small and closely held corporations, there may not be much of a market for shares that are not publicly traded. Other shareholders may want to prevent the frequent sale of shares by strictly limiting such sales in their articles of incorporation. Members of limited liability companies can sell their rights to share in the profits and losses of the company unless there is an agreement to the contrary. As with a partnership, the rights to participate in the decision making of the company cannot be sold unless all of the members agree.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Non-Compete Agreements </STRONG></H3></A>
Usually when a business is sold, the buyer wants the seller to agree not to compete with the business being sold. Non-compete agreements are enforceable in Minnesota so long as they are reasonable in geographic scope and duration. Non-compete agreements are especially important in the context of small and closely held companies because often goodwill and name recognition are the most significant items the buyer is paying for. Without an effective non-compete agreement, the seller might set up a new business in direct competition with the old one and transfer the loyalty of longtime customers to the new enterprise. A buyer may want to get non-compete agreements from the seller's spouse and children or anyone else who worked closely with the seller in operating the business and who might go into competition with the buyer.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Consulting Agreements </STRONG></H3></A>
Another common component of an agreement to sell a closely held business is a consulting agreement. Often, the advice of the former business owner is a valuable asset for a new owner during a transitional period. The former owner can give advice on how business has been conducted, where supplies are kept, how to operate machinery, working effectively with suppliers, and generally keeping customers happy. Both parties to the agreement need to be clear on the extent and duration of the consulting arrangement. The advice of an attorney can be especially helpful when drafting a consulting agreement because the seller may be able to realize certain tax advantages by re-characterizing a portion of the purchase price as a consulting fee.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Business Succession </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Succession can actually be more complicated for closely held companies than for large publicly held companies. The ways a business is transferred following the death or withdrawal of an owner depends on how the business is organized.
<P>
In a sole proprietorship, the business ceases to exist when the proprietor dies. In a general partnership, the business can be continued after one of the partners dies, but the remaining partners have to pay the beneficiary of the deceased partner the fair market value of his or her partnership. If a partner in a limited partnership dies, his or her ownership in the corporation may be inherited and all attendant rights exercised by the new owner.
<P>
Because a corporation is a freestanding legal entity, the death of an owner technically has no effect on the operation of the business. Many smaller corporations, however, take out life insurance policies on certain key employees, such as the founder or CEO of the business. The shares held by those persons may be transferred to descendants or, by previous agreement, to remaining key individuals. 
<P>
In a limited liability company, the company dissolves unless there was prior agreement to continue in the event of a death. Also, if the remaining members of a company with more than one remaining member unanimously consent to continue operations, the company may do so.
<P>
Because interests in a small and closely held business often lack liquidity and can be difficult to evaluate, they can be difficult to transfer before or after the death of the owner. Estate planning concerns for owners of small and closely held businesses are addressed in the <A HREF="b27.html">Probate, Estate Planning &amp; Trusts Law</A> Chapter.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Commercial Litigation
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The phrase "commercial litigation" covers a broad spectrum of cases stemming from business conduct. The other chapters in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> that have nominated attorney listings focus on particular areas of substantive law. For instance, a business leader with a dispute involving securities laws might turn to the <A HREF="b30.html">Securities &amp; Venture Finance Law</A> Chapter to better understand those laws, or a CEO whose company is being sued for products liability might read the <A HREF="b26.html">Personal Injury Defense Law</A> Chapter for a discussion of the basic principles of personal injury defense. This chapter is different because it focuses on style of practice rather than a particular area of substantive law. This chapter covers issues common to many different kinds of commercial disputes and ways that businesses might use the adversarial system more effectively or avoid it altogether.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>What Is a Commercial Litigator? </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
 A majority of the attorneys listed in this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> could be considered commercial litigators -- at least part-time commercial litigators -- because most of the nominated attorneys will litigate a commercial matter at least occasionally. But most of the attorneys nominated for this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> do not bill themselves as commercial litigators either because they concentrate on transactional work more than litigated matters, or because they normally litigate only a limited range of issues. For example, a wills and trusts attorney may litigate an occasional dispute arising out of a will, or an attorney whose primary specialty is litigating disputes over commercial agricultural contracts may call his or her practice area "agricultural law" rather than "commercial litigation," especially if he or she also does a significant amount of transactional work. Most of these attorneys (for whom litigation makes up only a small part of their practice) were nominated in practice areas covered by other chapters of this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> For example, an attorney who handles commercial real estate disputes may be profiled in the <A HREF="b13.html">Commercial Real Estate Law</A> Chapter; an attorney who only litigates commercial employment disputes may be profiled in the <A HREF="b16.html">Employment Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
The attorneys nominated in Commercial Litigation differ from those in other chapters either because they handle a broad variety of commercial disputes (and thus do not wish to be described by a narrow practice group title) or because they focus on honing the craft of effective courtroom representation and are rarely involved in transactional work. This is not to say that commercial litigators spend the majority of their time in the courtroom. The idea that litigators spend most of their day arguing before a judge or making impassioned appeals to juries is a creation of Hollywood. Effective courtroom representation requires extensive behind-the-scenes preparation. Commercial litigators spend the majority of their time outside the courtroom reviewing documents, taking depositions, writing briefs, interviewing potential witnesses, visiting sights of disputes, and counseling clients.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Qualities of a Good Commercial Litigator </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
 A good commercial litigator will be able to play two roles -- advocate and advisor. Many businesspersons fail to see how important it is that the attorney they hire be able to play both of these roles. Some commercial litigators who are very good in the courtroom are poor advisors outside the courtroom and thus fail to suggest alternatives to costly court battles. If a businessperson feels offended by a lawsuit and sees an attorney while still feeling indignant, he or she may wind up hiring an attorney who feels as indignant over the case as he or she does. Too often that attorney is simply arguing the case to the client and telling the client everything he or she wants to hear. The problem with this is that what a client needs to hear is not always what he or she wants to hear.
<P>
Today many commercial disputes can be time-consuming and costly. No party should initiate one or continue to fight one solely because he or she is offended or indignant at the other party's actions. Often, there is too much money at stake to allow emotions to rule over rational judgment. It is the responsibility of a good commercial litigator to tell his or her client the benefits and risks of taking a case to trial, and to act as an advisor in the office. The advocacy role should be saved for trial or for settlement negotiations. This distinction between the two roles of good commercial litigators may seem obvious, but many decision makers do not really understand it. An attorney who never sees any way out of a problem other than fighting in court is an attorney who learned the advocacy role but failed to learn the advisor role. If that attorney is going to represent a client, it is important that the client also have other counsel who can recognize the risks and occasionally suggest alternate courses of action.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>When to Sue </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Eventually it may be necessary to sue another party. Litigation has become a routine cost of doing business for many companies in this country. Of course, litigation is not painless, even for the party that eventually wins the lawsuit. It is a skill to know when to turn to the courts to settle commercial disputes.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Seek Legal Advice Early </STRONG></H3></A>
As discussed below, the best way to use a lawyer is to involve him or her in the early stages of a deal. Often, if legal advice is sought early enough in putting together a deal, it will be unnecessary later to ask lawyers to "fix" something that has gone wrong. If legal advice has not been sought early, or a deal looks like it will sour despite earlier legal advice, it is wise to seek legal counsel again. Most importantly, our legal system is full of statutes of limitation that require a plaintiff to bring a lawsuit within a set time or lose forever the right to do so. Different statutes of limitation have different time periods and different events can start the clock ticking. Even if a dispute is later settled peacefully to the satisfaction of all sides, it may be necessary to file a commercial lawsuit early in order to preserve the right to go to court if other forms of dispute resolution are not effective.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>What to Do when Sued </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
At first glance it may seem that getting sued is worlds away from suing someone else, thus it may come as a surprise that responding to a lawsuit is similar to initiating one.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Seek Legal Advice Early </STRONG></H3></A>
It is no coincidence that the first heading under this category is identical to the first heading under the category "When to Sue." Lawyers are essential to protecting business interests in litigation. The first chapter of this <STRONG>Guide,</STRONG> <A HREF="b01.html">Selecting &amp; Managing Counsel</A> , describes an intelligent process for finding the right legal counsel for business's needs. Individuals are always permitted to represent themselves in court, but representing oneself is only appropriate in a case in which there is very little money involved or in which the factual disputes are very plain. In all other disputes it is wise to hire counsel. In a number of situations, a corporation is required to hire an attorney to represent itself in court.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Appoint Someone to Be in Charge </STRONG></H3></A>
For larger companies, finding someone to be in charge is rarely a problem. Most large companies have in-house legal counsel that handles routine legal matters. In-house attorneys often are able to handle litigated matters. If there is no in-house legal counsel, someone in the company should be delegated to work closely with outside lawyers in coordinating company strategy and responses.
<P>
If a business turns to independent counsel to handle a commercial dispute, the in-house legal department can often supervise the outside lawyers and be involved in preparation of the lawsuit. Not only can the in-house lawyers offer insight into the company and suggest the best sources of information about company policy, but they can handle some parts of the litigation in order to keep costs down. A good strategy when selecting counsel is to ask how outside lawyers will cooperate with a business' in-house attorney and/or staff to control costs and effectively represent the business.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>The Best Defense Is a Good Offense </STRONG></H3></A>
Many commercial disputes involve counterclaims, cross claims, and joinder of third parties. "Counterclaims" are claims brought against the original plaintiff, "joinder" is a way to bring third parties into a dispute, and "cross claims" are claims between an original defendant and third parties joined to the dispute. Good legal counsel may be able to suggest claims that company may have against the party bringing a lawsuit or against third parties. Assuming a more offensive posture can help convince another side to settle a dispute or drop one altogether.
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Move the Fight to Your Backyard and Play by Your Rules </STRONG></H3></A>
One of the worst facts about commercial disputes is that a company can be forced to defend itself far from home in a court applying unfamiliar rules. If a business is sued in a faraway court, it may be possible to force the plaintiff to transfer its complaint to a court closer to the company's home base. The rules about when this is possible are complex, but attorneys experienced in handling commercial disputes will know these rules well. Forcing a plaintiff to travel to another jurisdiction to bring a claim is sometimes enough to convince him or her to drop the claim altogether. For this reason, many businesses include forum selection clauses in routine business contracts.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Ways to Avoid Litigation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
It is the nature of most commercial disputes that attorneys are brought into a matter only after something has gone wrong: a deal has fallen through, an account is overdue, or a disgruntled customer has filed lawsuit. While these are certainly appropriate times to call upon a lawyer, most commercial litigators could, if asked, offer plenty of advice on how to avoid these problems in the first place. As a result of years of litigating commercial disputes, commercial litigators are keenly aware of relatively simple steps that, if taken early, can prevent much larger headaches later. The trouble is that most businesses do not ask their lawyers the right questions in advance. The point of this section is to help the reader use legal resources more efficiently and cost-effectively.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Use Common Sense </STRONG></H3></A>
Many businesses discover too late that they could have avoided the expense and trouble of commercial litigation had they exercised even a little common sense in the beginning of a business relationship. A wise business does credit checks on new customers unless payment is made in full at the time of delivery or receipt of service. Business partners can often be liable for each other's debts, so the prudent businessperson avoids partners about whom he or she knows very little. A business should learn about a potential business partners' litigation history before jumping into a joint venture. A company that has been quick to litigate in the past may be a company with which to avoid entanglements. At the very least, if a potential customer or business partner has a history of taking disputes to court, it may be wise to insist upon mandatory arbitration for any disputes that arise out of the relationship. The <A HREF="b05.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> Chapter describes many forms of alternative dispute resolution available to businesses.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Prove It </STRONG></H3></A>
It is amazing how many business leaders fail to understand how often a right or privilege can be lost for lack of a way to prove the contents of a business agreement. Many executives have learned the rule that most oral contracts are as enforceable as written contracts. What they have not learned is the corollary to this rule that, without a way to prove what was orally agreed upon, there is no mechanism for enforcing one's rights under the oral agreement. In the real world, it makes no difference at all what a vendor promised if there is no record of the promise and the vendor denies his or her earlier statements. In the American legal system, facts that cannot be proven are not facts at all, they are mere allegations. In every business transaction, it is wise to spend some time imagining how one's actions might look in the future in the courtroom. Would there be evidence of an offer? Of acceptance? Of delivery? What about changes to an earlier written agreement? An agreement may have been in writing originally but the parties to it may have made numerous oral modifications that substantially affect its terms. How much of the altered agreement could be proven in court? Probably very little could be proven if neither side makes an effort to record changes in writing.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Use Language Clearly </STRONG></H3></A>
It should be clear to most business managers that the law at times takes words very literally. A decision maker may feel awkward being blunt with clients, employees, or vendors, but a little clear language at the start of a business relationship can prevent a lot of headaches later. Courts can sometimes interpret unclear language in a way the parties never intended. Is it necessary to fire an employee? If so, that employee should know that he or she is being terminated and should be told the legally permissible reason for doing so. An employee told he or she is being terminated because "things are not working out" may infer sinister reason for the termination. Is a vendor's offer unacceptable? The reply to the offer should be clear -- "No, those terms are unacceptable to this company, what about the following terms. . . ."
<P>
When people deal with each other in person, facial expressions and nuances of language communicate a significant portion of their intentions. In phone conversations or written documents, the literal words alone have to carry all the intent. Thus, it is important for businesspeople to develop habits of using language precisely.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Develop a Healthy Dose of Skepticism </STRONG></H3></A>
Many commercial disputes can be avoided if business managers develop a more realistic sense of reading people and the promises they make. Just because a person learns to use precise language himself or herself does not mean that other parties will do the same. A salesperson eager to close a sale may promise "100% satisfaction," but is the salesperson actually giving a warranty that if any part of a deal is not perfect, the deal is off? -- probably not. More than likely, the salesperson is just puffing. One way to tell the difference between a warranty and mere puffing is to ask if the person making the claim is willing to put it into writing. Often, being asked to commit to a promise in writing is enough to make the other side back away from its original rosy estimates. A vendor may make an unrealistic "guesstimate" of how soon he or she can deliver a product, but a little persistent probing may show that he or she is unlikely to be able to deliver on the promise. If someone cannot guarantee an estimate it may be best to do business with a vendor who makes a more realistic estimate and stands by it.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Be Careful about Making Promises </STRONG></H3></A>
Think carefully about making promises that will be difficult to keep. The business world is full of uncertainties and no one can ever be perfectly positive that he or she can fulfill his or her end of a bargain. When the unexpected happens, a key employee leaves, the computer system goes down, a supplier is hit by a labor strike, weather fouls up the best laid plans and a company is unable to deliver what it promised, is there a way out? There will not be a way out if the person making the promise gave an ironclad promise. The point of this discussion is to help businesspersons understand that their promises are like little insurance policies given to the other side in a deal. When a company promises to produce a product or provide a service by a given date and does not leave itself a way out, it is effectively assuming responsibility for any unanticipated occurrences that may prevent performance. It is a wise policy to have experienced counsel review agreements to determine whether a business is assuming more risk than it is aware of. After all, if a business is going to give out little insurance policies with every contract, then the price of the good or service ought to reflect the additional insurance.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Have an Attorney Draft Preventive Forms and Procedures </STRONG></H3></A>
It is unreasonable to expect employees to know all the intricacies of the law and how they might apply to every business transaction, but litigators experienced in unraveling commercial disputes are often an excellent source of advice for avoiding disputes in the first place. Often they can recommend simple language and phrases to add to routine forms used by a business. These simple additions can save countless headaches and costly litigation. In addition, many law firms are happy to help businesses conduct in-house training seminars for employees to help them understand the important role they play in enforcing company policies and properly documenting all transactions.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Do not Let Emotions Interfere with Sound Business Judgment </STRONG></H3></A>
Too many business managers feel uncomfortable when lawyers describe acts that can prevent legal trouble from developing. The attitude of many managers is that if they are too cautious they will lose sales or scare away suppliers. It would be wrong to say that emotions have no role to play in business. Good relations with a customer are important to create and preserve. A good attorney should be able to offer suggestions on how preventive legal practices can be implemented without offending customers, business partners, or suppliers. In his or her advisor role, a good litigator should be able to help a business see when emotions may interfere with sound business judgment.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Respect and Educate Employees </STRONG></H3></A>
It does a company little, if any, good to have a board of directors following every letter of the law if its employees do not know or care enough to do so. Employees are the front line dealing with customers and handling complaints. Satisfied employees who have an interest in their company's future work to keep customers happy and avoid disputes. On the other hand, disgruntled employees are an excellent source of liability for any company. A clientele that feels poorly treated by a business's employees is fertile ground for lawsuits. If employees are respected and educated about the business's legal concerns they are more likely to follow company policies and provide better customer service. Furthermore, employees who are educated about the reasons behind company policies will make better witnesses if called upon to testify in court about the company's operations.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Commercial Real Estate Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Corporate real estate transactions invariably have far-reaching business and economic repercussions. This chapter explains frequently used real estate terminology and considers some of the issues common to commercial real estate transactions in Minnesota. Landlord liability for personal injuries occurring on business property is discussed in the <A HREF="b26.html">Personal Injury Defense Law</A> Chapter. The <A HREF="../../consumer/chapters/c20.html">Real Estate Law</A> Chapter of the <STRONG><A HREF="../../mnhome.html">Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Minnesota Consumer Guide</A></STRONG> covers residential real estate, dealing with real estate agents, and landlord/tenant issues.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Terminology </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A stumbling block for many persons entering the real estate market is the unfamiliar terminology frequently used by real estate professionals. Real estate law uses many old terms and concepts because many real estate laws have ancient roots. However, many rights and responsibilities regarding real estate have evolved and been updated over time as societal and business needs have changed. The following are some of the most frequently encountered real estate terms:
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Assessment </STRONG></H3></A>
An assessment is a value placed on real property by a local taxing authority for purposes of levying taxes. Real estate taxes are calculated by multiplying the assessed value of a piece of property by the tax rate. Most properties are reassessed periodically, but a property's assessed value may not be the same as its actual market value.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Co-Ownership </STRONG></H3></A>
Co-ownership is ownership of property by more than one person. The two common ways in which two or more parties can co-own a piece of property are joint tenancy and tenancy in common, both discussed below. Although there are advantages to co-owning property, there are drawbacks as well. If co-owners cannot agree on use, sale, or possession of a piece of property, they may have to go to court to resolve the matter in a partition action. In a partition action a joint tenant or tenant in common asks the court to split the property in a fair and just manner. Because real property may be difficult to divide and partial interests may be difficult to sell, a court will usually order that the property be sold and proceeds from the sale distributed to the co-owners in relation to their interests.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Deed </STRONG></H3></A>
A deed is a written instrument that transfers the title of property from one person to another. The two most common types of deeds are general warranty deeds and quitclaim deeds.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Deed Restriction </STRONG></H3></A>
Deed restrictions are usually imposed on a buyer of land when the property is sold and the restrictions are included in the seller's deed to the buyer. Restrictions are generally imposed by a property developer to maintain certain standards. Restrictions may include limits on the color an owner may paint a building, what trees one may plant, or the size of structures to be built on the property. Deed restrictions may also be known as covenants or conditions.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Easement </STRONG></H3></A>
An easement is the right to use another person's land for a particular purpose. There are many forms of easements. Public utility companies frequently have utility easements that permit them to run gas, water, or electrical lines through particular property they do not own. The owner of property on a lake shore might sell to the owner of an adjacent lot without lake access an easement to cross over to the shore. A person who owns property that is landlocked may receive an easement from an adjacent land owner to have access in and out of the property. This kind of easement is also called a right of way.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Encumbrance </STRONG></H3></A>
An encumbrance is an obligation attached to a piece of real property. It is a right or interest held by a party who is not the owner of the property. An encumbrance is not an ownership interest in real property, and the property may be bought and sold even though there are encumbrances attached to the property. Because encumbrances attach to property, not the property owners, a person who buys property with an encumbrance is bound by the encumbrance. Easements and deed restrictions are examples of encumbrances.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>General Warranty Deed </STRONG></H3></A>
Generally, in Minnesota, title is transferred by a general warranty deed. A general warranty deed provides the greatest protection to the purchaser because the seller pledges or warrants that he or she legally owns the property and that there are no outstanding liens, mortgages, or other encumbrances against it. A warranty deed is also a guaranty of title, which means that the seller may be held liable for damages if the buyer discovers that the title is defective. A warranty deed is no substitute for title insurance, however, as a warranty from a seller who later dies or goes bankrupt may have little, if any, value.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Joint Tenancy </STRONG></H3></A>
Joint tenancy is a form of co-ownership. Although usually thought of as a way for a husband and wife to own property, there is no requirement that joint tenants be married to one another or that there be only two joint tenants. Each individual owner in joint tenancy has a right to sell, encumber, and possess the entire property. Regardless of the number of joint tenants, when one joint tenant dies, the remaining joint tenants automatically take the deceased joint tenant's share of the property by right of survivorship. In such cases, the surviving joint tenants are required to file a death certificate and an affidavit with the county recorder without having to pay transfer taxes. A principal advantage of joint tenancy is that it allows the surviving joint tenant to avoid probate and death taxes.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Lien </STRONG></H3></A>
A lien is a charge against property that provides security for a debt or obligation of the property owner. The lien holder does not own the property. The owner of property may voluntarily agree to a lien, perhaps by taking out a mortgage, or a lien can be imposed, perhaps for nonpayment of taxes. One of the most common liens is the mechanics lien. A mechanics lien arises when someone furnishes labor or materials to improve a piece of property. If the worker or supplier is not paid by the property owner, he or she can file a notice of lien with the county recorder and the property owner and collect the amount owed from a subsequent sale of the property. If a property owner has paid the general contractor in full but the general contractor has not paid the subcontractors, the owner will not have to pay for the services a second time.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Quitclaim Deed </STRONG></H3></A>
A quitclaim deed is a deed that relinquishes to the buyer whatever interest, if any, the seller may have in the property. A quitclaim deed gives the buyer the least protection of any deed. If the seller is the sole owner of the property, the quitclaim deed is enough to transfer title, but the buyer takes a risk by accepting a quitclaim deed because it offers the buyer no guarantee that the title is valid. Quitclaim deeds are used frequently during the property settlement phase of a marriage dissolution.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Recording </STRONG></H3></A>
In Minnesota, real estate records are kept in each county. Owners and parties with real estate interests are required to file, in the county, all documents affecting their interest in property in order to give public notice of the interest. Titles in Minnesota may be registered under the abstract system or the Torrens system. Abstract records go back hundreds of years and an abstract of title is a record of all the entries for that property. Torrens or registered property is much simpler, more modern, and more efficient. Instead of a thick abstract of title, Torrens property has a simple certificate of title.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Special Assessment </STRONG></H3></A>
A special assessment is a tax levied on a piece of property to pay for improvements that benefit the particular property. These taxes are frequently used to pay for improvements such as streets, sidewalks, and street lighting. Special assessments are liens on the property until they are paid.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Sublease </STRONG></H3></A>
Subleasing is having someone else take over a tenant's rights and obligations under a lease before the original lease expires. The tenant has a right to sublet a unit if the lease does not prohibit doing so. If the new tenant does not pay rent, damages the unit, leaves before the lease expires, or breaches another condition of the lease, the landlord can hold the original tenant responsible. The original tenant can then sue the new tenant for those costs.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Tenancy in Common </STRONG></H3></A>
Tenancy in common is a form of co-ownership. Tenants in common, like joint tenants, share the right to possess, sell, and encumber the property. Unlike joint tenants, tenants in common do not have a right of survivorship. Upon the death of one tenant in common, his or her ownership interest passes to his or her heirs as part of the estate.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Title </STRONG></H3></A>
Title to real estate is the right to, or ownership of, the property. Title may refer to the actual ownership or to the documentary evidence of that ownership. In order to sell a piece of property, all title matters must be cleared. Usually, this is accomplished through a title search, in which a diligent search is made of all records relating to the property to determine whether the owner can sell the property and whether there are any claims against it. If any defects in title are discovered during the title search, the seller is usually given time to cure the defect. Title insurance is often taken out to protect against any hidden defects in the title. There are two types of title insurance. One type protects the lender's interest in the property and the second protects the owner's interest.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Purchasing Real Estate </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Most real estate purchases are fairly complex transactions. Because a purchaser may later be held liable for such things as environmental hazards and injuries caused due to the condition of the structure, it is imperative that a prospective buyer make a thorough investigation of the property before buying. A good purchase agreement should provide the buyer with ample opportunity to assess such risks and verify all terms of the lease. If the purchaser is acquiring rental property, it is his or her responsibility to verify the terms of the tenant leases and to explore any claims tenants may have against the seller, as these claims may later become the legal responsibility of the purchaser. Only an experienced real estate attorney can adequately advise on the many issues of concern to parties buying and selling real estate.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Environmental Liability </STRONG></H3></A>
Of increasing concern to businesses are environmental hazards associated with acquiring real estate. Whether in the form of leaking underground oil storage tanks or hazardous emissions, such concerns may, under state and federal environmental laws, become the cleanup responsibility of a new owner, even a new owner who neither contributed to or knew of the contamination. The new owner may be required to pay for the cost of cleanup of contamination that occurred even under a former owner.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Leasing Real Estate </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
By Minnesota law, a rental agreement does not have to be in writing but it usually is in the form of a lease. If the lease is an agreement to rent the property for an unspecified length of time, it is considered a periodic tenancy, or month-to-month lease. Either the tenant or the landlord may end this type of lease with a one-month notice. A lease that specifically states the amount of time for which the lease is good is called a definite term lease. By law, if the duration of this type of lease is for more than a year, it must be in writing. Often, a tenant will be required to provide a written notice to end the tenancy.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Negotiating a Lease </STRONG></H3></A>
Some novices in real estate negotiations assume that the terms of a lease are non-negotiable. It is in a property owner's best interest to give potential renters printed forms presented in a "take it or leave it" manner. Contrary to the impression many rental property owners give tenants, most leases are negotiable, especially in today's overbuilt commercial real estate market. Many businesses will have specific needs that cannot be satisfied by a standardized lease agreement, so it is important that a prospective tenant identify its needs and negotiate a lease agreement that meets them. Of particular and increasing concern in commercial lease agreements are the operating expenses provisions of the lease. It is not unheard-of for a landlord to negotiate a lucrative cut in rent, only to compensate for the price break by loading costs onto operating expenses.
<P>
The following items should be addressed in negotiations:
<UL>
<LI>	Amount of and conditions for recovering the security deposit
<LI>	Maintenance of fixtures, appliances, and common areas of the property; who is responsible for maintenance and what standards apply
<LI>	Renewal rights at the end of the lease
<LI>	Cancellation rights
<LI>	Circumstances under which the owner can enter leased premises; who has access to keys
<LI>	Which party is obligated to insure the property and which party is named beneficiary under the policies
<LI>	Subleasing rights or prohibitions
<LI>	Whether the landlord will agree not to rent adjacent space to competing businesses
</UL>
It is wise to keep in mind that it is a rare business that will be able to negotiate a lease in which all of these items are decided in its favor, but the list can serve as a checklist for negotiations.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Security Deposit </STRONG></H3></A>
Landlords have a right to insist that renters pay a security deposit before moving in. The security deposit is used to pay for any damage beyond ordinary wear and tear that the tenant might cause to the rental property, to satisfy any debts between the tenant and landlord under an agreement or to cover any unpaid rent. There is no limit to how much the landlord can require for a security deposit. The landlord can increase the security deposit at any time during a periodic lease if the tenant is given proper notice -- generally, one rental period plus one day. If the lease is a term lease, no changes can be made to the deposit until the lease comes up for renewal or the parties agree otherwise. At the end of the tenancy, the landlord must return the deposit to the renter with interest (4 percent non-compounded per year). The landlord is allowed to keep the amount of deposit necessary to repair damages, or to pay off debts owed to the landlord as part of the lease.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="230"><H2><STRONG>Real Estate Development </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Until 1916, there were no controls over how a property owner could use his or her land. But as the population grew and cities became more crowded, the number of controls on land use became more and more extensive. Today, almost every city and town has some type of land use plan. In Minnesota, regional commissions oversee development according to the plans drafted by their respective cities.
<P>
A property owner has many land ownership rights, but these rights are also restricted by controls from the local, state and federal government. It is important to understand exactly what regulations apply to certain properties and to the rights of the property owners. In any transaction, it is important for a developer to understand what government regulations are in force and how they affect the property.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Construction Contracts </STRONG></H3></A>
Construction contracts are a highly specialized subcategory of contract law. Most construction projects involve many parties, each with unique expectations, deadlines, and responsibilities. Architects, engineers, contractors, subcontractors, and lenders all have to understand their rights and responsibilities. Failure to have an experienced real estate attorney negotiate and draft documents can lead to numerous headaches and unplanned expenses. Good planning includes discussion of mechanics liens, periodic inspections, bonding, timetables and appropriate rewards or punishments for early or late completion.
<P>
<A NAME="250"><H3><STRONG>Mortgage Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
Many attorneys practicing real estate law spend a substantial portion of their practices negotiating mortgages secured by real property. These negotiations are often quite complex. Mortgage financing for new real estate can be as difficult to obtain for an established business as for one that is starting up. To help move the process along, a business often has to give up a degree of control over business decisions that affect the property. A lender may want to impose liabilities for the property onto the borrower, while at the same time retaining a say in how the property is managed.
<P>
It is important for a borrower to try and retain as much flexibility and control as is possible. For example, a borrower may want to retain control of insurance proceeds in the event of damage to the property so that the property can be restored, while a lender may want to require that such proceeds go toward debt owed.
<P>
<A NAME="260"><H3><STRONG>Foreclosure </STRONG></H3></A>
Foreclosure is a legal action in which property that has been used as security for a debt is sold in order to pay off that debt. It must be initiated by the grantor of the mortgage, must occur in the county in which the property is located, and must follow a default by the debtor on the terms of the mortgage. Mortgages provide for foreclosure in order to give lenders the right to recover the money they previously lent. In Minnesota, most mortgages include a power-of-sale clause that gives the lender authority to conduct the foreclosure without taking the matter to court. Although there are various forms of foreclosure available, the most common method in Minnesota is foreclosure by advertisement, in which a notice that the property is up for sale is posted in advance of the sale and the property owner is served a notice. Foreclosure by advertisement must precisely follow a detailed set of laws and rules. A foreclosure is determined legal and may not be disputed three years after the sale of the property.
<P>
<A NAME="270"><H3><STRONG>Zoning </STRONG></H3></A>
Zoning regulations are a particular type of land use control. Their purpose is to control and regulate development and growth of a community in a way that is best for the general public. They attempt to accomplish this task by dividing a community into areas (zones) that can be used only for certain purposes.
<P>
Zoning laws are generally divided into four basic categories -- residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural. Most cities further divide property into much more intricate specifications, such as single-family houses within a residential area, or zones that allow for the building of condominiums or apartments. Furthermore, an industrial section of a city might be split between areas zoned for light-industrial and heavy-industrial operations.
<P>
It is important to find out exactly how a property is zoned, for this could have serious consequences on how the property can be used both at the present time and in the future. Zoning ordinances can be changed through amendments. Such changes can be sought by an individual property owner or by local governments. The changes must be determined to be in the best interest of the community, and the opinions of those persons affected must be sought through public hearings.
<P>
Another way to seek relief from zoning laws is through a variance permit. Such permits make exceptions for uses of property that are not otherwise allowed under the zoning laws. Other ways around zoning laws include conditional use promises that allow special permission for an inconsistent use that benefits the community, and spot zoning, which re-zones a small area or even one plot of land. Again, this is only allowed if it benefits the community.
<P>
<A NAME="280"><H3><STRONG>Land Use Law </STRONG></H3></A>
In addition to zoning laws, there are other laws that mandate how a building can be built, how big or small it can be, and where it may be placed on the property. These specifications may be laid out in local regulations or in building codes. Building codes are developed to protect public health and safety. To ensure compliance with building codes, many municipalities require that property owners get building permits before they begin any type of construction or development. Another way communities enforce codes is by issuing a certificate of occupancy (without which a building cannot legally be occupied) to buildings that pass code requirements.
<P>
As stated before, communities often regulate the size and shape of buildings as well as their locations on lots. On shoreline areas, the state adds other rules to these local regulations. The additional regulations are intended to avoid adverse environmental consequences resulting from building construction.
<P>
Other kinds of land-use regulations serve to protect the environment. Any development that may have an effect on the environment must conform to local, state, and federal regulations. For example, the National Environmental Policy Act is a federal law that requires federal agencies to create environmental impact statements and secure approval before proceeding with projects that could adversely affect the environment. Such statements detail the effects of projects on areas such as air and water quality, safety, and wildlife. More information about these rules is provided in the <A HREF="b17.html">Environmental Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="290"><H3><STRONG>Water Law </STRONG></H3></A>
With the purchase or sale of real estate comes certain rights. These include air rights, mineral rights and water rights. In the land of 10,000 lakes, water issues are not as serious as in arid states. Nonetheless, there are some issues to be aware of. Water rights include the use of underground water as well as water that touches the owner's property. Landowners whose property touches flowing water are "riparian owners," which means they have the right to use the BORDERing water for reasonable and beneficial use. This use includes boating, swimming and other recreational purposes. Riparian owners may not, however, legally divert the water to land that does not adjoin the stream or lake. An owner may not use the adjoining water in a way that affects the quality or availability of the water further upstream, downstream, or down the coast, by polluting the water or changing its flow.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Criminal Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Business owners increasingly need to be aware of how they can run afoul of criminal laws in the operation of their businesses. Newspapers today are so full of reports of corporate criminal investigations and prosecutions that most business owners do not even realize that there was once a time when business entities were thought to be incapable of committing crimes. During the last two decades, both the federal and state governments have dramatically increased the number of criminal investigations of businesses and the people who run them.
<P>
A myriad of regulatory laws can trip up even a conscientious business owner or manager. This chapter is designed to acquaint the reader with criminal statutes that most affect businesses and the steps that businesses can take to avoid criminal liability.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Criminal Liability of a Corporation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Minnesota Supreme Court typically uses a three-part test to determine whether a corporation is guilty of a crime committed by one of its agents. First, the corporation's employee must have had authority to act for the corporation and must have been acting within the scope of that authority when the allegedly criminal activity took place. Second, the employee must have been acting to further the corporation's business interests. Third, for crimes not requiring specific intent, the employee's actions must have been authorized, tolerated, or ratified by the corporation's management.
<P>
Additionally, the Minnesota Supreme Court has held that for a corporation to be vicariously liable for the actions of one of its employees, the employee's actions must not have been a personal aberration on the part of the employee acting alone, but must, in some way, reflect a corporate policy. It is possible, however, that the corporation can be held criminally liable even if the employee was acting contrary to corporate policies at the time of the infraction. This corporate responsibility applies in cases in which the employee was acting to benefit the corporation and the corporation was not the victim of the crime.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Criminal Liability of a Corporate Officer or Agent </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In addition to the corporation's liability, corporate officers and agents can be personally liable for their criminal conduct. Some businesspersons mistakenly believe that criminal liability is an either/or proposition -- that if their actions subject the business to criminal liability, they personally will be free of liability. This belief is incorrect, as many criminal statutes allow prosecutors to go after the business and the individuals who run it. Individual and corporate liability are cumulative, not exclusive.
<P>
Participation in business criminal activity does not, by itself, make a person criminally liable. Usually the prosecution must show that the participating officer or agent consciously promoted the illicit scheme. Ordering a subordinate to commit a crime or silently acquiescing to another's commission of a crime can make almost any officer or agent personally liable for the crime. In addition, some officers within a corporation have been held responsible for criminal activity of which they were unaware because they had an obligation to ensure compliance with the law or to detect and prevent violations of criminal regulations. The law does not look kindly on corporate officers who claim to have been asleep at the helm while their subordinates were engaging in criminal activity. Especially in the context of environmental regulations, with their substantial penalties, the defenses "I did not know" and "I was not aware" fall on deaf ears if the court or jury believes the officer should have known or had an obligation to be aware of what was happening in the company.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>White Collar Crime </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
White collar crime is the most common type of business crime. The term "white collar crime" is generally used to describe crimes that have cheating and dishonesty as their common basis. These crimes are typically committed by professionals or entrepreneurs under cover of legitimate business activity. Such crimes can be difficult to prosecute because of their complexity, and they can carry lesser penalties because they are not associated with violence.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Specific White Collar Criminal Laws </STRONG></H3></A>
Some criminal actions are prohibited by specific laws narrowly drawn to outlaw a particular activity.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Antitrust </STRONG></H4></A>
Persons found in violation of certain aspects of the Sherman Antitrust Act -- the primary antitrust law -- can be fined or jailed. Violations of this Act include making contracts that unreasonably restrain trade and attempts to form and maintain a monopoly in an industry. In practice, however, these violations are generally handled with civil, rather than criminal, lawsuits.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Securities Fraud and Insider Trading </STRONG></H4></A>
A broad range of illegal behavior is prosecuted under securities fraud statutes. Persons who violate securities laws can be subject to criminal penalties, civil penalties, or both; criminal prosecutions require the prosecutor to show that the accused acted willfully. The securities fraud statutes recognize that deception can take many forms and thus are broadly worded as to prohibit "any device, scheme or artifice to defraud" in securities sales. There are two general categories of securities fraud. The first involves the sale of securities to investors for far more than their actual value. The second involves the sale of legitimate securities for illegal purposes. An example of the first type of fraud is selling shares in dry oil wells. An example of the second type of fraud is a brokerage house selling a legitimate stock but concealing information about its own involvement with the company, thus acting in violation of rules established by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<P>
Insider trading prosecutions have been some of the most publicized white collar prosecutions of the 1980s and 1990s. Surprisingly, "insider trading" is not defined in any specific statute; it is a colloquial term used to describe a category of wrong-doings whereby insiders take unfair advantage of information to make money or avoid losing money in securities. Generally, insider trading means that an insider (such as an officer of a corporation) with material, non-public information engages in trading without first disclosing that information to the public. Insider trading cases are typically prosecuted under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Further information about that act can be found in the <A HREF="b30.html">Securities &amp; Venture Finance Law</A> chapter.
<P>
Prosecutors are not confined to using specific securities fraud statutes to prosecute securities fraud. General anti-fraud statutes are frequently used instead of, or in addition to, specific securities fraud laws. For example, parties engaged in securities fraud can be charged with violating mail and wire fraud statutes, discussed below in this chapter.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Computer Crime </STRONG></H4></A>
Computer crime is an area of the law in which the government appears to be perpetually playing catch-up with the growth in new technologies. Some variations of computer crime are so new that laws drafted specifically to address them do not exist and more general laws without a computer emphasis fit the facts poorly.
Today, six types of conduct are specifically outlawed by federal statute:
<UL>
<LI>Knowingly accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorization, and thereby obtaining confidential national security information
<LI>Intentionally accessing a computer without authorization or exceeding authorization, and thereby obtaining the financial information of a financial institution or of a credit card issuer
<LI>Intentionally, without authorization, accessing a computer of a federal department or agency used exclusively by that department or agency or affecting the government's use thereof
<LI>Knowingly, and with intent to defraud, accessing a federal interest computer without authorization or exceeding authorization to further a fraud or obtain anything of value
<LI>Intentionally accessing a federal interest computer without authorization to alter, damage, or destroy information and thereby causing a loss of $1000 or, if medical information is affected, any amount
<LI>Knowingly, and with intent to defraud, trafficking in any password or similar information through which a computer is accessed without authorization if such computer affects interstate or foreign commerce or is used by or for the government.
</UL>
Certain computer-related crimes are addressed by Minnesota statutes, as well. For example, the intentional unauthorized use of a credit card is a misdemeanor, and a separate law makes financial transaction card fraud a crime. Computer damage and computer theft are also punishable in Minnesota. A person commits computer damage by: 
<UL>
<LI>Intentionally damaging a computer or computer system, network, software, or other property
<LI>Intentionally altering a computer or computer system, network, software, or other property, with the intent to injure or defraud
<LI>Intentionally distributing a destructive computer program
</UL>
A person commits computer theft by accessing a computer without authorization but with the intent of obtaining services, or by taking any part of a computer, including computer data.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Catch-All White Collar Criminal Laws </STRONG></H3></A>
Some actions are not covered by one of the above specific laws but instead are prosecuted under one or more "catch-all" laws criminalizing dishonest behavior generally. Most of these laws have parameters so broad that they can be made to fit a wide variety of dishonest actions.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Perjury </STRONG></H4></A>
Federal perjury laws penalize anyone who willfully or knowingly makes false statements under oath. The sworn statements may be written or oral and need not be made in court; a person can perjure himself or herself in depositions and written testimony. A related law against subornation of perjury makes it illegal for anyone to procure another person to commit perjury.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Travel Act </STRONG></H4></A>
Under the federal Travel Act, it is a criminal offense to use interstate travel or facilities in interstate commerce to distribute the proceeds from any unlawful activity, to commit a crime of violence to further any unlawful activity, or to otherwise promote or facilitate unlawful activity.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Hobbs Act </STRONG></H4></A>
Under the federal Hobbs Act, it is a crime for anyone to obstruct, delay, or affect commerce by extortion, robbery, or threats of physical violence. The terms "robbery" and "violence" are very broadly defined to cover a wide variety of violent actions against people or property.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act </STRONG></H4></A>
The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was established to counteract the influence of organized crime on legitimate businesses. Under federal criminal law, defendants can be found guilty of violating RICO if they are found to have engaged in "racketeering activity" under the auspices of an enterprise that affects interstate commerce, or if they are involved in the collection of an unlawful debt. There are nine state and 35 federal offenses specifically listed as racketeering activity. The nine listed state offenses are murder, kidnapping, gambling, robbery, arson, bribery, dealing in obscene materials, and dealing in narcotics or other dangerous drugs. RICO has a civil law dimension that accompanies its criminal provisions. While drug smuggling, murder, bribery, and extortion of "protection money" are examples of the activities to which RICO was originally applied, more recently it has been used to prosecute a bewildering variety of criminal actions.
<P>
In the first years after it was passed, RICO was a rarely used criminal law. Today, RICO charges are quite common, largely because its provisions have been interpreted expansively to cover many situations where there is no allegation whatsoever that the defendant has any connection to organized crime.
<P>
In addition to its criminal provisions, RICO gives private parties and the federal government civil causes of action against violators. Because RICO prosecutions have grown in recent years, calls are frequently heard to redraft the law more narrowly. Civil RICO provisions especially have received extensive criticism.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Embezzlement </STRONG></H4></A>
To embezzle means to take another's money and property through abuse of an official job or position of trust. Embezzlement can take many forms. An accountant might use sophisticated methods to falsify records and skim profits, while a bank teller might simply walk home with an extra $20 from his or her drawer.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Fraud </STRONG></H4></A>
Fraud is intentionally lying in order to induce someone into relying upon the lie to part with something of value. Like embezzlement, fraud can be complex or simple. The federal government has three general anti-fraud statutes for mail fraud, bank fraud, and wire fraud.
<P>
Mail fraud is a broad crime punished under the United States Code. Mail fraud has two elements: (a) a scheme devised or intending to defraud or for obtaining property or money by fraudulent means; and (b) using the mails in furtherance of that fraudulent scheme.
<P>
Because the mail fraud statute uses such broad language and because it is relatively easy to prove, mail fraud is one of the most common charges brought by federal prosecutors. Sometimes notorious criminals suspected of committing heinous crimes are charged with mere mail fraud, but procedurally, it is easier to get a conviction under the mail fraud statute than under more complex criminal statutes. Charges of mail fraud are frequently brought even in cases in which more specific charges are brought. The two can exist side by side. The "scheme to defraud" element of mail fraud is deliberately broad. It encompasses a wide variety of criminal activity, including credit card fraud, securities fraud, medical drug fraud, and frauds based on political malfeasance.
<P>
The federal wire fraud statute is similar to the mail fraud statute, but requires an interstate or foreign transmittal of a communication by wire, radio, or television. This interstate requirement sets wire fraud apart from mail fraud; an intrastate mailing is sufficient to trigger liability for mail fraud, while an intrastate wire, radio, or television communication is insufficient grounds for wire fraud liability.
<P>
The federal bank fraud statute criminalizes the conduct of any party who "knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises." The federal bank fraud statute is much newer than either the mail fraud or wire fraud statutes, so it has not received a great deal of interpretation in the courts. Because its language is so similar to that which is used in the mail and wire fraud statutes, it is expected to be similarly broadly applied and interpreted.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Conspiracy </STRONG></H4></A>
Conspiracy is the term for a broad category of crimes involving multiple actors coming together to engage in concerted criminal activity. A person or business is generally guilty of conspiracy to commit a crime if that person or business either (a) with the purpose of facilitating or promoting its commission, agrees with another person or business to engage in conduct that constitutes a crime or an attempt or solicitation of a crime; or (b) agrees to aid another person or business in planning, committing, or attempting to solicit a crime. Specific federal anti-conspiracy statutes can be found throughout the United States Code. Minnesota statutes also contain many anti-conspiracy laws. In recent years, a growing number of white collar criminal prosecutions have included allegations of conspiracy.
<P>
Bringing a conspiracy charge offers the prosecution several distinct advantages. Prosecutors usually learn of a conspiracy while it is in an early stage; thus, they can prosecute before the underlying crime takes place. In addition, prosecutors often are able to charge many defendants simultaneously and present evidence against the group. When several defendants stand trial together, juries often perceive individual defendants to be guilty by virtue of their association with the others. Several technical procedural rules also give prosecutors distinct advantages against defendants in conspiracy cases.
<P>
Often the key element in prosecuting a defendant for conspiracy is proving the agreement. The agreement that forms the basis for conspiracy need not be written, oral, or even explicit, but is often inferred from the facts of the specific case. If the parties meet and reach an understanding to work for a common purpose, there is an agreement. For example, if the producers of a particular product meet to exchange information on prices, and later they set identical prices, a prosecutor may be able to prove they conspired to set prices even though there was never an explicit agreement to do so. Most criminal conspiracy statutes also require that at least one of the parties has committed an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.
<P>
A procedural issue of great importance to parties accused of conspiracy is whether government prosecutors try to frame the conspiracy as a "hub-and-spoke conspiracy" or a "chain conspiracy." In a hub-and-spoke conspiracy, many parties (the spokes), conspire with one person (the hub) but not with other defendants. It is advantageous for a defendant to have its actions characterized as part of a hub-and-spoke conspiracy because that means that the conspiracies are separate and disconnected.
<P>
In contrast to a hub-and-spoke conspiracy, a chain conspiracy involves several parties as links in one long criminal chain. Defendants in chain conspiracies are responsible for the actions of all participants in the chain, even if they never met some of the other participants in the chain.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Obstruction of Justice </STRONG></H4></A>
Obstruction of justice is a category of offenses interfering with the three branches of government. Obstruction of justice can take many forms, including assaulting a process server, improperly influencing a juror, stealing or altering a record of process, obstructing a criminal investigation by officers of a financial institution, and picketing, parading, or using sound amplification devices in front of a courthouse, or a building or residence occupied by a judge, juror, witness, or court officer.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Bribery and Extortion </STRONG></H4></A>
A number of federal statutes prohibit bribery and extortion. A common goal of most bribery statutes is to prevent people from seeking preferential treatment improperly from public officials and to prevent public officers from using their office for personal gain. Under a statute prohibiting bribery of federal government officials, both the official and the person offering the bribe are subject to prosecution if the official is offered or seeks anything of value for himself or herself in exchange for being influenced to perform any official act; committing, aiding, conspiring, or allowing a fraud to be committed upon the United States; or being induced to do or omitting to do anything in violation of his or her official duty. Promises and offers are equally prohibited, so there is no requirement that the bribe actually occur. A separate federal statute, known as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, prohibits bribery of foreign officials.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Avoiding White Collar Criminal Liability </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Business owners and executives need to know how they can avoid white collar criminal liability.
<P>
In the area of white collar crimes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Attorneys experienced in handling white collar criminal matters can be a good source of information for helping businesses establish internal procedures to prevent wrongdoing by employees. An attorney experienced in the regulatory area can be an excellent source of information for helping managers understand their responsibilities for overseeing corporate employees' actions and reporting accidents and wrongdoing.
<P>
Internal investigations are an integral part of the defense of almost all businesses accused of criminal wrongdoing. Whenever a company learns that it may be the subject of a criminal prosecution, it is important to notify management quickly and to act to resolve the situation. Sometimes a business can avoid criminal liability altogether if it can show that it took proper action to correct a situation as soon as managers were made aware of a problem. Prosecutors often treat leniently companies that can show they acted responsibly after being informed of a problem in the organization.
<P>
The internal investigation carries risks of its own, however. It may be wisest to have the investigation conducted by outside legal counsel. Using an attorney from outside the company can prevent the ultimate report from being used at trial as evidence against the company. Attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine may ensure that the corporation's officers will not be required to reveal the contents of the final report to prosecutors.
<P>
No business should ever try to obstruct a government investigation into its affairs by using a tactic that could conceivably look like a cover-up or obstruction of justice. Being honest with all employees, if secrecy is necessary, and fully explaining the employees' responsibilities can be excellent preventive medicine against criminal liability. Any employee asked to keep anything secret for reasons he or she does not understand may assume his or her employer is involved in illegal activity and so testify later.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Employee Benefits Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

In addition to paying monetary compensation, many employers choose to provide a variety of employee benefits to their workers. Although not required to provide most employee benefits, once an employer decides to do so, he or she must comply with numerous state and federal laws regulating employee benefits programs. This chapter will consider some of the most basic areas of state and federal laws regulating voluntary employee benefits plans. Topics such as wage and hour regulations, Social Security, and termination rights are discussed in the <A HREF="b16.html">Employment Law</A> Chapter. Unemployment compensation is discussed in the <A HREF="b10.html">Business Tax Law</A> Chapter. Issues of concern to employers of labor union members are discussed in the <A HREF="b24.html">Labor Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Employee Benefit Packages </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Employee benefits packages can span a broad spectrum of possibilities. Some employee benefits packages are fully taxable, like paid vacations or cash bonuses for meeting sales goals. Others qualify for special tax treatment, like health insurance or free child care. Some benefits packages are more attractive for small businesses than large corporations. A business with mostly younger employees might choose to offer a different benefits package than would a business with mostly older employees. An employer with high employee turnover can structure a benefits package one way to minimize his or her contributions or another way in order to encourage employees to stay longer. Fortunately, employee benefits is an area of law in which business owners enjoy a great deal of flexibility to structure packages that meet the needs of employers and employees and comply with the law.
<P>
The growth in popularity of employee benefits packages has led to a concomitant growth in legislation regulating benefits packages. Familiarity with these regulations can be an important business tool because employee benefits laws frequently influence how businesses are run, and intelligently crafted benefits packages often give a business a competitive edge in attracting the most promising workers.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>ERISA </STRONG></H3></A>
The Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is a federal law that attempts to standardize pension plans and medical, surgical, sickness, disability, and death benefits plans and to ensure that the plans are financially sound and equitable. To comply with ERISA, plans must provide for broad employee participation. ERISA further requires that businesses provide employees with detailed information regarding benefits plans and sets minimum standards governing eligibility for participation, benefits rights and accrual, vesting, employer and employee contributions, payment of benefits, plan termination, mergers, and survivors' benefits.
<P>
A number of benefits plans are specifically exempt from ERISA requirements, including:
<UL>
<LI>Government plans
<LI>Church plans
<LI>Plans administered outside the United States for non-resident aliens
<LI>Many severance pay plans
</UL>
Several federal agencies play a role in enforcing ERISA's provisions. These regulations are expansive and complex and failure to follow them can expose an employer to civil liability. ERISA imposes strict fiduciary duties upon employers to oversee their plans. Compliance with ERISA is often a prerequisite for the employer to claim a tax deduction for amounts contributed to a benefits plan. Therefore, employers who wish to establish benefits plans should consult an attorney who is experienced in ERISA compliance issues.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>COBRA </STRONG></H3></A>
Under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), employers who sponsor group health plans must give covered employees the option to continue group coverage after they leave employment under a number of circumstances. Under COBRA, employers who offer group health plans must provide an employee and that employee's spouse or dependents (if covered) with notice of their right to continue coverage if the employee's job is terminated, the marriage is terminated, or a dependent child ceases to be a dependent under the terms of the plan. A covered employee terminated for gross misconduct cannot elect COBRA continuation coverage, although the terminated employees' spouse and dependents may still elect to continue coverage. The covered individual can elect to continue, for a limited period, the coverage that he or she had before the termination. The employer can require that the covered individual pay up to 102 percent of the cost of coverage.
<P>
Generally, an employer with 20 or more employees on a typical business day during the preceding calendar year must comply with COBRA's requirements. All employees of employers under common control (such as subsidiaries of a common parent) are added together to reach this number. Full-time and part-time employees are counted, as are independent contractors, if they are eligible for the group health plan. Churches and government agencies are exempt from COBRA, although government agencies must comply with similar rules under the Public Health Services Act.
<P>
As with other employee benefits discussed in this chapter, COBRA requirements are quite technical. Even the definition of what constitutes gross misconduct sufficient to deny a terminated employee continuation coverage is murky. A terminated employee improperly denied COBRA rights can seek substantial penalties from the employer. An attorney experienced in this area can advise an employer on how to comply with COBRA's notice requirements.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Minnesota Laws Regulating Group Health Plans </STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota employers who want to offer group health insurance, health maintenance coverage, or group life insurance must comply with a number of state statutes and regulations. This area is a complex thicket of regulations because often the employer is covered both by Minnesota laws and federal ERISA laws. The two sources of law can overlap, even contradict each other, although in some cases the federal law preempts state regulation. Nonetheless, the state regulation is still on the law books. The Minnesota laws regulating group health plans are similar to ERISA in that they establish minimum standards for coverage, limitations on cancellation and conversion, and procedures to follow upon termination of employment.
<P>
Any Minnesota employer with two or more employees can participate in a group health insurance purchasing program by the state. Under the program, employers can offer a wide variety of plans for lower cost than if they were to negotiate their plans alone because the state is able to negotiate on behalf of a large pool of employers. Employers are required to pay at least 50 percent and not more than 100 percent of the lowest cost plan available.
<P>
Under Minnesota law employers who provide group life insurance coverage issued within the state must permit a covered employee to elect to continue coverage for himself or herself and any dependents if the employee is voluntarily or involuntarily terminated, has his or her hours reduced to the point that he or she is no longer eligible for coverage, or is laid off.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>401(k) Plan </STRONG></H3></A>
A 401(k) plan is a salary-reduction plan that is often used alone or to complement other profit-sharing or stock bonus plans. This type of plan takes its name from a section of the Internal Revenue Code and is often referred to as a CODA, which stands for "cash or deferred arrangement." Workers are allowed to choose whether to receive their entire pay in cash or to have a portion of their pay set aside for retirement and taxed only when they retire or withdraw the money. Employers may, but are not required to, match a percentage of the employee contribution. Deferred amounts are invested in a plan and can grow tax free until distribution. A worker can access the funds in a 401(k) account before retiring but must pay taxes upon distribution at his or her current tax rate.
<P>
In order to take advantage of Section 401(k) treatment, a plan must meet specific nondiscrimination tests which compare the treatment of "highly compensated employees" and "non-highly compensated employees." Employers may not discriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Employee Stock Ownership Plan </STRONG></H3></A>
An Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) is a stock-bonus plan designed to provide employees with benefits that invest in the stock of the employer. There are advantages to the employer, such as the ability to conserve cash for other uses, and for the employee, who can take advantage of tax breaks. ESOPs allow employees to share in the ownership and growth of the companies they work for, while giving the company tax deductions for the value of the stock it contributes.
<P>
An important advantage to ESOPs is that the shares are voted by the ESOP's trustee. Because the company picks the trustee, management retains control, with two exceptions. Corporate decisions requiring a super-majority vote must be voted on directly by the participants in the ESOP, and participants who choose to take shares at distribution (rather than money) can then vote their own shares. ESOPs are not available to subchapter S corporations.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Individual Retirement Account </STRONG></H3></A>
An individual retirement account (IRA) is a retirement plan that permits employees to pay a specified amount of their compensation into an account, which is not taxed until the individual withdraws the money. There is generally a penalty of 10 percent of the account in addition to the tax if the funds are withdrawn from the account before the individual is age 60.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Keogh Plan </STRONG></H3></A>
A Keogh plan is a retirement plan established for the use of unincorporated small business owners, or professionals such as writers, lawyers, doctors, and other self-employed persons. A Keogh offers a tax shelter, up to a ceiling, for amounts contributed toward retirement. An employee covered by another retirement plan at work can set up a Keogh if he or she earns income from a sideline business. If retirement plans are set up correctly by an employer they may allow the employer to use the money as a tax deduction. Qualified pension plans allow the employer to pay into a trust fund a set amount or percentage each pay period.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Qualified versus Non-Qualified Plans </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There are two categories of employee benefits plans that permit employees to defer taxation of income until retirement or termination of employment. These two categories are referred to as "qualified plans" and "non-qualified plans." A qualified plan is one that meets several requirements in the Internal Revenue Code and ERISA, described above. A non-qualified plan is one that does not meet these requirements and usually refers to a deferred compensation plan for key executives.
<P>
Qualified plans enjoy several advantages. Subject to limited exceptions, employers contributing to qualified plans are entitled to a tax deduction when the contribution is made. In contrast, employer contributions to non-qualified plans are non-deductible until the employer is taxed on the benefit. Contributions made to qualified plans can accumulate earnings on a tax-deferred basis while amounts contributed to a non-qualified plan are taxed along with the employer's other income for the year. A qualified plan can protect assets from creditors. Finally, employees who participate in a qualified plan are not taxed on their employer's contribution until they actually receive their benefits from the plan. Participants in a non-qualified plan generally pay tax on employer contributions unless the employee can show that the non-qualified plan includes a substantial risk of forfeiture.
<P>
 The primary advantage of non-qualified plans is that they need not comply with many of the government regulations governing qualified plans. "Discrimination rules" that require qualified plans to provide benefits to all employees on a generally equivalent basis do not apply to non-qualified plans. A small business owner can concentrate benefits on himself or herself or on key employees.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>When to See an Employee Benefits Attorney </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Lawyers who practice employee benefits law usually operate in a proactive mode, helping businesses avoid problems rather than reacting after they arise. Experienced employee benefits attorneys can provide a business with an employee benefits review that can help spot problems before they become significant workplace and financial strains. Such reviews can help ensure that businesses maintain up-to-date required files, that they comply with all new IRS rules, that they are communicating effectively with employees about their benefits, and that none of their plans or practices are illegally discriminatory.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Employment Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Business owners today must be more aware than ever of issues surrounding employment law. Decisions on whom to hire and fire are subject to numerous state and federal laws and can open an employer to liability. Even the seemingly simple determination of who is legally an employee can be tricky, and mistakes can have serious and costly consequences. This chapter offers a brief introduction to legal issues concerning employers and workers.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Employment Relationship </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Many of the rights and responsibilities of both employers and workers turn on the legal relationship that exists between the worker and his or her employer. The distinction between employee and independent contractor status and the concept of "employment at will" are important to defining an employment relationship.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Employee versus Independent Contractor </STRONG></H3></A>
When a worker gets paid to do a task or provide a service for another person, the worker is either an independent contractor or an employee. The distinction is not always clear, but it is important for both the business and the worker. The classification determines whether a business must withhold taxes and what records it must keep, the benefits a worker is entitled to, whether an injured worker can file a workers' compensation claim, and whether a worker is protected by federal and state wage and hour regulations. 
<P>
Whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee is based on the work performed, not the worker's title. The more control an employer has over a worker, the more likely it is the worker is an employee. The more a worker acts like an independent business enterprise, the more likely the worker is an independent contractor. In some cases, the status is clear: a worker who arrives at a set time every day, is trained by the employer, uses the boss's tools or equipment, and is paid by the hour, week, or month, is most likely an employee. Someone who works for more than one company at a time, can set his or her own hours, and realizes a profit or risks a loss is most likely an independent contractor. 
<P>
An employer could be subject to fines if the Internal Revenue Service, Minnesota Department of Revenue, or Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training finds a worker has been an employee when the employer treated him or her as an independent contractor. An employer who is unsure about a worker's status can ask a federal or state agency for an opinion based on the agency's guidelines. Guidelines vary from agency to agency, and one agency may classify someone as an employee even though another considers the same worker an independent contractor.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Employment at Will </STRONG></H3></A>
The state of Minnesota recognizes the traditional rule of employment at will. This means that, in the absence of an agreement to the contrary, an employer can discharge an employee at any time for any reason other than an illegal reason, such as racial or gender discrimination. It also means that an employee can resign at any time, for any reason, with or without giving notice. 
<P>
Most workers in Minnesota are at will employees. Generally, an employee is hired at will unless an employer specifically does something to change the status of the relationship. There are several ways an employer can alter the relationship. An employer may enter into an oral or written contract guaranteeing to employ someone for a specific period of time or promising to terminate the employee only for specified reasons. An employee handbook or collective bargaining agreement can limit the employer's right to terminate employees. An employer can inadvertently limit his or her right to fire an employee if the employer, by his or her own actions, gives the employee reason to believe the job will continue. For example, if an employer promises a job to someone from out of state and that person moves to Minnesota specifically to take the job, the employment relationship is probably not at will because the employee has gone to the trouble and expense of moving after reasonably relying on the promise of new employment.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>Government Administered Benefits </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Three programs administered by the state and federal government are of interest to employers: Unemployment Compensation Insurance, Workers' Compensation Insurance, and Social Security. Each of these programs provides benefits to a worker based on the terms and conditions of his or her employment, and the cost of the benefits is paid, at least in part, by the employer.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Unemployment Insurance </STRONG></H3></A>
Unemployment insurance provides benefits to employees who are laid off, fired, or otherwise forced to leave their jobs. Most employees are covered by unemployment insurance, a program administered by the state and funded by employer contributions. The <A HREF="b10.html">Business Tax Law</A> Chapter discusses the unemployment tax more fully. 
<P>
Unemployment benefits are not automatic; the worker must apply for them through the Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training. After gathering information about an applicant, the Department makes an initial determination about the person's eligibility for benefits. If the Department's decision is that the individual is eligible, the Department informs the former employer. Because the former employer contributes to the benefits, the employer has the right to know what the former employee told the Department and has an opportunity to present the employer's side of the story. 
<P>
An applicant cannot receive benefits if any one of the following conditions applies:
<UL>
<LI>The applicant is fired for misconduct
<LI>The applicant fails to apply for or accept suitable work
<LI>The applicant is a commission-only salesperson
<LI>The applicant participates in a labor strike
<LI>The applicant refuses an offer to work again for the former employer
<LI>The applicant quits for any reason other than an illegal or otherwise intolerable work environment
<LI>The applicant is a student hired by the educational institution in which he or she was enrolled
</UL>
Because employers and employees often have different ideas of what constitutes a reasonable work environment, the issue in most disputes over unemployment claims is whether the employer created an intolerable workplace environment. Only certain kinds of employer actions give someone a legitimate reason to quit a job and still collect unemployment benefits. Some valid reasons are: sexual harassment by an employer or inaction by an employer who was informed of instances of sexual harassment, a substantial cut in pay or benefits, drastic changes in working conditions or hours without an employee's consent, and requiring an employee to break the law or work under obviously unsafe conditions.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Workers' Compensation </STRONG></H3></A>
Workers' Compensation provides benefits to employees injured in the workplace. With a few limited exceptions, all Minnesota employers must abide by the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Law. Under the law, all employers in Minnesota are required to purchase insurance against compensation claims from a company authorized by the state. With state permission, some employers can qualify for self-insurance. Any insurance broker should be able to help a business obtain workers' compensation insurance. An employer can also seek help by contacting the State of Minnesota Workers' Compensation Division. 
<P>
The cost of premiums for compensation insurance is determined by factors such as the number of employees a business has, how safe the record of the workplace proves to be, and how much employees are paid. Generally, the greater the payroll or the higher the risk, the higher the premium. However, an employer may be able to lower premiums by establishing programs to provide for a safer workplace and by working with injured employees to minimize lost work time. 
<P>
Employers are required to post a notice in the workplace informing workers of their rights to workers' compensation. If an employee is injured, the employer must report the injury immediately to the insurance carrier. A "First Report of Injury" form must be sent out as soon as possible, but it does not mean that the employer is admitting that the injury is covered by workers' compensation or that the injury even occurred. 
<P>
It is illegal for an employer to refuse to hire an individual because he or she has a disabling condition from a prior injury. However, employers who hire workers with pre-existing conditions are protected from some liability. If an employee suffers an injury that is made greater because of a pre-existing condition at the time of hiring, the employer's liability is limited under the Minnesota Second Injury Law. The purpose of this law is to encourage employers to hire people who may have disabilities resulting from a previous injury.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Social Security </STRONG></H3></A>
Social Security provides workers and their dependents with retirement and other benefits. Social Security benefits are financed through taxes on wages paid by both employers and workers. Under the Federal Insurance Contribution Act (FICA), an employer is responsible for withholding the appropriate taxes from an employee's pay, in addition to submitting its own share of FICA taxes. Withholding requirements are discussed in more detail in the <A HREF="b10.html">Business Tax Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Civil Rights in the Workplace </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Four major federal laws -- the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 -- protect the rights of American workers to be free from workplace discrimination. Minnesota workers also have additional protection under the Minnesota Human Rights Act. 
<P>
Many federal civil rights laws only apply to employers with a minimum number of employees. The federal Americans with Disabilities Act, for example, only applies to employers with 15 or more employees after July 26, 1994. The Minnesota Human Rights Act, however, applies to all Minnesota employers who have one or more employees who are not close relatives. In addition, the Minnesota act covers more types of discrimination than do the federal laws.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>In General </STRONG></H3></A>
Most employment discrimination is outlawed by two major civil rights acts passed by Congress in 1964 and 1991 and by the Minnesota Human Rights Act. Through a combination of these laws, Minnesota workers are protected against discrimination based on race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, membership or activity in a local commission, age, or disability. People frequently refer to "Title VII" rights when they are talking about a particular section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII prohibits discrimination in a wide number of employment areas including hiring, firing, recruitment, transfers, promotions, testing, layoffs, recalls, fringe benefits, training, apprenticeship programs, and job advertisements. Title VII specifically prohibits retaliation against a person who files a charge of discrimination, participates in an investigation of discrimination, or opposes an unlawful employment practice. 
<P>
Under certain extremely limited circumstances these civil rights acts allow employers to base their employment decisions or practices on a person's race, marital status, sex, etc., if the employer can demonstrate a truly legitimate need. For example, it is not impermissible sex discrimination to refuse to hire a man to be an attendant in a women's locker room. Religious institutions can refuse to hire individuals based on their religious beliefs, but only for positions that are directly related to the performance of religious duties. Religious institutions are generally not allowed to discriminate when hiring individuals for secular tasks such as secretarial or janitorial work. 
<P>
Certain employers, such as police departments, can base employment decisions on an applicant's physical abilities. Some pre-employment exams are allowed under Minnesota law if they measure skills that are truly essential for an applicant to have in order to perform a particular job and are not applied in a selective or discriminatory way.
Both state and federal agencies handle discrimination complaints.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Age Discrimination </STRONG></H3></A>
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) expands Title VII prohibitions against age discrimination. Most employers cannot enforce mandatory retirement policies, except under a few very specific circumstances where age is truly a qualification for doing a particular job, such as firefighting, police work, or flying airplanes. Anyone age 40 or over who works for an employer with 20 or more employees is protected by the ADEA and cannot be retired against his or her will, regardless of age, as long as he or she can do the job. Any Minnesota employer employing fewer than 20 employees is prohibited by Title VII and other federal and state laws from discrimination based on age, but such an employer can force an employee aged 70 or older to retire.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities </STRONG></H3></A>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on physical and mental ability. The ADA requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for physically or mentally disabled employees, including modifying facilities and work schedules and providing special training. Using pre-employment tests that identify and exclude disabled applicants is permissible only when the tests are unequivocally job-related. 
<P>
The ADA does not change in any way an employer's right to hire people who have the skills to perform the "essential duties" of a job. The ADA makes it illegal to refuse to hire an applicant or to fire a current employee who lacks physical or mental abilities that are not essential to the job. 
<P>
The "reasonable accommodations" for disabled applicants or employees required of an employer may not place an undue burden on the employer. Reasonable accommodations include modifying work schedules, changing the work environment, buying or modifying special equipment, and reassigning to another position an employee who can no longer do the "essential duties" of a job. The ADA protects from discrimination only those people with permanent conditions that limit a major life activity. Thus, an employee who has a sprained ankle that is expected to heal fully is not protected under the ADA, even though that employee is disabled for a period of time. However, a person with a permanent disabling condition that is controlled by drugs, physical therapy, or by some other treatment is covered by the ADA. People with AIDS or HIV are also covered by the ADA. 
<P>
The ADA prohibits discriminating against individuals who have completed or are still participating in drug rehabilitation programs. However, an applicant or employee currently using illegal drugs is not protected by the ADA.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Sexual Harassment </STRONG></H3></A>
Everyone, male or female, has the right to be free from sexual harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment can take many forms:
<UL>
<LI>Someone says something sexual about a coworker's appearance
<LI>An employer enforces a mandatory dress code that provokes others to make sexually explicit comments
<LI>Someone makes unwanted sexual contact
<LI>Someone connects a condition of the job, such as a raise, with sexual contact
<LI>Someone makes sexual jokes or explicit sexual comments that embarrass a coworker
<LI>Someone displays or passes around pornographic pictures
</UL>
Although there is no federal or state act that specifically outlaws sexual harassment, sexual harassment is punishable as an illegal form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and under the Minnesota Human Rights Act. Sexual harassment is illegal if participation in any of the above activities is required to get or keep a job, to be promoted, or to qualify for benefits, or if the activities make it harder for a worker to do his or her job by creating a hostile environment. 
<P>
The law requires that unwelcome behavior be both undesirable and offensive to be considered sexual harassment. Of these two criteria, the most problematic is determining what kind of behavior is offensive. Because of the diversity of sexual attitudes in this country, what is sexually offensive to one person may be just harmless sexual banter to another. The law uses the "reasonable person" standard to determine what is offensive: if a reasonable person would find an action offensive, then it is offensive. 
<P>
In addition to laws designed to give victims a civil remedy against sexual harassment, criminal laws provide remedies against the most serious forms of unwanted sexual contact. If a harasser's behavior crosses the line into assault, battery, or rape, the victim can file criminal charges against the perpetrator. Anyone fired or forced to leave a job because of sexual harassment may be entitled to receive unemployment insurance benefits while searching for a new job.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Pregnancy Discrimination </STRONG></H3></A>
Title VII protects pregnant workers and pregnant job applicants from discrimination. Employers cannot refuse to hire a woman because she is pregnant, fire a woman because she is pregnant, take away benefits or accrued seniority because a woman takes maternity leave, or fire or refuse to hire a woman who has an abortion. 
<P>
Generally, an employer must treat pregnant women the same as other workers who cannot perform their jobs for short periods of time. Thus, if an employer allows employees to take a leave for a broken leg or short-term illness, he or she must allow pregnant women to take a leave under the same terms and conditions. Pregnancy leave is also protected under the <A HREF="#170">Family and Medical Leave Act</A> discussed below.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Other Workplace Rights and Responsibilities </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER> 
The workplace is also governed by a number of other laws.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Workplace Safety and Health </STRONG></H3></A>
Workplace issues in Minnesota are governed by federal standards under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in combination with Minnesota Occupational Safety and Health Codes. Under these laws, an employer is responsible for making sure working conditions are safe and healthful. More specifically, an employer is responsible for creating working conditions free from recognized hazards that are causing, or are likely to cause, death or serious injury. All places of employment are subject to inspection for compliance with Minnesota safety and health standards, and monetary and criminal penalties can be assessed for noncompliance. 
<P>
Employers must alert employees to their OSHA rights by displaying an "Occupational Safety and Health Protection on the Job" poster. In addition, employers cannot charge employees for protective equipment required under OSHA standards. 
<P>
Employers also have certain rights under OSHA. For example, employers may request a variance from an OSHA standard in some situations, may participate in the process of developing or revising standards, or may go before the Occupational Safety and Health Review Board to request that a citation or penalty be reviewed and changed. In addition, under the Act trade secrets or privileged communications are protected.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Parenting, Family, and Medical Leave </STRONG></H3></A>
Both the state of Minnesota and the federal government require certain employers to provide parenting, family, and medical leave to qualified employees. The federal law in this area preempts state law only when the federal law provides greater benefits. In areas for which Minnesota provides greater benefits, Minnesota law is controlling. Accordingly, it pays to be familiar with both laws. 
<P>
The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) is a federal law that allows qualified employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to attend to family matters, including health emergencies. Under the Act, a qualified employee may take an unpaid leave following the birth or adoption of a child, after acquiring a foster child, to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition, or to care for his or her own serious health condition. Men and women are equally entitled to take these leaves. 
<P>
Not every worker is qualified to take these leaves of absence. A person must be a full-time employee of a company with 50 or more employees and have worked for the company at least 12 months. In addition, an employee must have worked at the company for at least 1250 hours during the 12 months immediately prior to taking a leave under the FMLA. 
<P>
Under the Act, during periods of unpaid FMLA leave, an employer must maintain the employee's health benefits at the same level and in the same manner as they would have been if the employee had continued to work. The employee is not entitled to accrue benefits such as vacation time or sick leave during a leave under the FMLA. Under most circumstances, an employee may elect or the employer may require the use of any accrued paid leave for periods of unpaid leave under the FMLA. 
<P>
When the leave is foreseeable, an employee must provide the employer with at least 30 days notice of the need for the leave. If the leave is not foreseeable, then the notice must be given as soon as it is practical. An employer may require the employee to provide medical certification of a serious health condition and may require periodic reports during the leave of the employee's status and intent to return to work. In addition, an employer may require a fitness-for-duty certification upon return to work in appropriate situations. 
<P>
When an employee returns from a leave under the FMLA, the employee is entitled to be restored to the same job the employee left when the leave began. If the same job is not available, the employer must place the employee in an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, duties, and responsibilities. Any benefits accrued by the employee at the time the leave begins must stay with the employee. Under the Act, employers are prohibited from discriminating against or interfering with employees who take FMLA leaves. 
<P>
Under the Minnesota Family Leave Act, employers with 20 or more employees are required to provide qualified employees with up to six weeks unpaid leave for the birth or adoption of a child. During the employee's absence, the employer must make insurance benefits available to the employee, although the employee can be required to pay the premiums for that insurance. Upon return, the employee is entitled to his or her previous job or a comparable position. A worker choosing not to return to work at the end of a leave period may be considered to have voluntarily quit and be denied unemployment benefits. Employers with 20 or more employees must allow employees to use their own accrued sick, disability, or medical leave to care for a sick or injured child for a reasonable period.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Privacy </STRONG></H3></A>
Employees' right to privacy while at work is a hotly debated issue today as increasing numbers of employers turn to searches, surveillance, and eavesdropping in an attempt to better monitor their employees' activities. The law in this area is evolving and still largely unsettled, but it is fair to say that an employee surrenders some of his or her right to privacy at the workplace door. However, the number of employees who are challenging employer practices is growing. 
<P>
The controlling factor courts look to in deciding if an employee has a right of privacy is whether an employee's expectation of privacy in a particular situation is reasonable. For example, the expectation of privacy is more reasonable for items in a locked desk drawer than for items left out on a desk. Similarly, the expectation is more reasonable for private phone calls made on a pay phone than for work-related calls made on the employer's phone. 
<P>
The reasonable expectation standard is not a very strong guarantor of employee privacy. An employer can dramatically expand his or her right to searches, monitoring, and surveillance simply by giving notice to employees. Once an employee receives notice that the employer reserves the right to monitor calls, search offices, read electronic mail, or film the workplace, there is very little reasonable expectation of privacy. In addition to the surveillance and search activities previously mentioned, areas in which the right to privacy is an issue include lie detector tests, drug and alcohol testing, AIDS testing, smoking in the workplace, rights of free speech, rules governing dress and personal appearance, and disclosure of employee records.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Substance Abuse in the Workplace </STRONG></H3></A>
The Minnesota Human Rights Act, under some conditions, protects alcoholics and drug addicts from discrimination. The protection is not absolute; an alcoholic or drug addict can be disciplined or fired if the drug or alcohol addiction prevents the addict from performing essential job duties or if the addiction endangers the safety of others. 
<P>
Under certain circumstances, employers in Minnesota can compel employees to pass drug and alcohol tests as a condition of employment. These tests must not be given in a discriminatory way, and if passing a drug or alcohol test is a job requirement, then all employees performing that job must submit to the testing requirement. 
<P>
An employer may test an employee for drugs and alcohol only under the following conditions:
<UL>
<LI>Reasonable suspicion: when an employer notices obvious signs (slurred speech, glazed eyes, etc.) that an employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol; when an employee injures himself or herself or another worker while on the job, or has an accident while operating a vehicle to perform a work-related task; when an employee has unmistakably violated workplace rules on drugs or alcohol while operating an employer's machinery, equipment, or vehicle.
<LI>Safety-sensitive positions: when an employee performs a task in which impairment by drugs or alcohol directly affects the safety of other workers or the general public.
<LI>Routine physical exams: when conducting a routine physical exam, provided that giving such an exam is directly related to job performance. In addition, such a test cannot be required more than once a year, and employees must be given at least two weeks' written notice of the exam.
<LI>Treatment program follow-up: at any time in the two years after an employee completes a drug or alcohol treatment program, provided the treatment was covered by an employee benefits plan or if the employer directed the employee to complete the treatment. Any such testing must be done in accordance with a written policy, and the policy must be made available in advance to all employees. Also, under the law, an individual who fails a substance test must be given a chance to go through rehabilitation before being fired.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Whistleblower Statutes </STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota and the federal government both forbid an employer to retaliate against an employee for reporting a violation of a law or for refusing to participate in activity the employee believes to be illegal. If an employee acts in good faith and reports suspected illegal activities to the employer, a governmental agency, or law enforcement officer, the employee cannot be fired or be treated adversely. The employee need not go through internal employer-sponsored channels to report suspected illegal activity. The law does not permit an employee to make statements or disclosures knowing they are false or in reckless disregard of the truth. Employers must notify employees of their whistleblower rights by posting a summary of the law.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Veterans' Reemployment Rights </STRONG></H3></A>
Certain veterans returning from active duty are entitled to be re-employed by their pre-service employer. A veteran must meet the following five requirements to be covered by the Veterans' Reemployment Rights Act:
<UL>
<LI>The veteran held an "other than temporary" (not necessarily "permanent") civilian job
<LI>The veteran left the civilian job for the purpose of going on active duty
<LI>The veteran did not remain on active duty longer than four years, unless the period beyond four years (up to an additional year) was "at the request and for the convenience of the Federal Government"
<LI>The veteran was discharged or released from active duty "under honorable conditions"
<LI>The veteran applied for reemployment with the pre-service employer or successor in interest within 90 days after separation from active duty
</UL>
Reinstatement must be within a reasonable period of time to a position of like seniority, status, and pay. In addition, the seniority level must be set at the point it would have been had the veteran kept the position continuously during military service.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Employee Access to Personnel Records </STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota statutes give employees of most private organizations the right to review personnel records kept on that employee by the employer. An employer must have at least 20 employees to be subject to the law. An employee is anyone currently working for the company or who has been separated from the company for less than one year. Independent contractors are not covered. The personnel record includes an application; a wage or salary history; commendations, warnings, discharge or termination letters; employment history and job titles; and a performance evaluation. In most situations, the personnel record does not include written references; information regarding allegations of criminal misconduct; results of employer administered tests; or statements or portions of statements by coworkers concerning job performance that would disclose the identity of the coworker by name, inference, or otherwise.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Non-Compete Agreements and Trade Secrets </STRONG></H3></A>
A non-compete agreement is a type of restrictive covenant that limits an employee's right to work in a particular industry after he or she leaves a company. The former employee may be prevented from doing one or all of the following:
<UL>
<LI>Working for a competitor of the former employer
<LI>Starting a business that competes with the former employer
<LI>Contacting former or current customers or employees of the former employer
</UL>
A non-compete agreement is generally enforceable only if executed when the worker is initially hired or at a time when the employee receives a raise, broader sales territory, or new or expanded responsibilities. The chances of enforcement are enhanced if the agreement is limited to the geographic area in which the employee actually worked; at most it may cover the employer's trade area. The possibility of enforcement is also improved if the activities the former employee is prevented from doing are specified and if the agreement expires within six months to one year of termination. Non-compete agreements are assignable upon sale of a business. 
<P>
Another type of restrictive covenant prevents an employee from using trade secrets and other confidential or privileged information learned on the job after termination. Factors in the enforceability of confidentiality agreements include the ability of the former employer to prove that the information is indeed confidential, precautions that were taken to guard the information, and the reasonableness of the time and geographic limitations imposed.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="240"><H2><STRONG>Termination </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Firing a worker is usually an emotional situation for both the employer and employee, and employers need to recognize that an involuntarily terminated employee may seek legal action. When a company appears to have been fair to the worker, he or she will have less reason to be angry when fired and less likely to sue. 
<P>
Recognizing whether an employee was hired "at will" is critical to proceeding properly with termination. As stated earlier, if a worker has been employed at will, he or she may be discharged at any time for any reason other than an illegal one (some illegal reasons are discussed below). If the employment relationship is not at will, such as when an employer has promised to employ someone for a specific period of time, termination must be "for cause." Causes that justify job termination include habitual lateness or absence, theft of the company's or a co-worker's property, and falsifying records. 
<P>
When a written employment contract exists, it may include requirements that relate to termination. A common requirement is that an employee be notified at least 30 days in advance of the termination. If an employee belongs to a union, the negotiated contract governs the process for involuntary termination. In the case of independent sales agents who work on commission, Minnesota requires that any earnings due the employee be paid within three working days after the last day of work. The penalty for failure to do so is the commission amount plus one-fifteenth of the commission for each day of nonpayment. 
<P>
Rights and protections given to employees through an employee manual may be enforceable against employers in post-termination lawsuits as "implied contracts." For example, some courts have found that company retirement, sick leave, and fringe-benefits plans described in employee manuals were enforceable promises of compensation. Oral promises made at the hiring interview also may be recognized as implied contracts. 
<P>
As stated earlier, fired employees are usually eligible for unemployment benefits. Since unemployment tax for some businesses is based on their experience with unemployment claims, it can be important to know how and when to contest claims. Unemployment claims may have ramifications for any discharge-related lawsuits an ex-employee may file. For example, if a company chooses not to oppose a former employee's claim for unemployment benefits, the company could be found to have waived a legitimate reason for the firing or to be tacitly admitting wrongdoing. Thus, a former employee who wins an unemployment case may then find it easier to file a lawsuit for wrongful discharge.
<P>
<A NAME="250"><H3><STRONG>Prohibitions to Firing</STRONG></H3></A>
Dismissals are illegal when based on age, sex, race, national origin or religion, or disability (see earlier discussion under Civil Rights in the Workplace). In addition, statute or public policy prohibits firing an employee for reporting alleged violations of the law (see Whistleblower Statutes, above); participating in union activity, such as a strike; joining with others to protest unsafe working conditions; refusing to commit an unlawful act on the employer's behalf, such as committing perjury or fixing prices; reporting to jury duty; reporting railroad accidents; or engaging in legal activities off-premises and after working hours. It is also prohibited to fire an employee whose wages have been garnished or whose pension rights under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (discussed in the <A HREF="b15.html">Employee Benefits Law</A> Chapter) may be affected.
<P>
<A NAME="260"><H3><STRONG>Defamation Related to Termination </STRONG></H3></A>
Fired employees sometimes sue former employers for libel (defamation in written form) and slander (defamation in oral form). A defamatory statement is one that harms a person's reputation by lowering his or her standing in the community or deterring others from associating with him or her. Defamation occurs when the statement is false, communicated to a third party, and no special privilege exists. 
<P>
Discussing a decision to terminate or criticizing a fired employee in front of non-essential third parties are actions that can increase an employer's vulnerability to defamation charges. Successful lawsuits have been based on statements in discharge letters and negative references to prospective employers. Truth is an absolute defense in any defamation lawsuit, and thus, it is important that an employer always state truthful reasons for any termination. A Minnesota employee whose employment is involuntarily terminated has the right to request that the employer provide the truthful reason for termination in writing.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Environmental Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

State and federal environmental laws can touch many areas of business. Some business owners have become so concerned over potential liability that environmental concerns can make or break deals. These laws regulate not only obvious concerns such as the handling of dangerous chemicals and the disposal of toxic waste, but also many less noticeable areas such as the building of new facilities and the rights of workers to know which chemicals are present in the workplace. Awareness of laws and regulations in this area can help a savvy business owner avoid substantial future costs and liability. This chapter identifies and describes some of the main environmental issues of concern to business owners.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Regulatory Agencies </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Various governmental agencies are responsible for establishing and implementing environmental law in Minnesota. Central among these is the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA), which administers programs covering air and water quality, management of hazardous and solid waste, and noise pollution. By designation or agreement with the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the MPCA has responsibility for a number of federal environmental programs, including Superfund. The MPCA enforces state environmental laws and standards in addition to federal ones, monitors environmental conditions throughout the state, responds to pollution emergencies, and provides technical assistance with environmental problems and planning. The MPCA's Office of Planning and Review reviews the Environmental Assessment Worksheets that are required for projects that have known or potential significant environmental effects, as well as the Environmental Impact Statements that are required for major projects, such as paper mills and power plants. A nine-member Citizens Board, appointed by the Governor, directs the MPCA.
<P>
Other state agencies that administer environmental regulations include the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR), Department of Health (DOH), Department of Agriculture, Environmental Quality Board (EQB), Board of Water and Soil Resources, and Office of Waste Management. More state agencies are mentioned throughout this chapter. A regional body, the Metropolitan Council of the Twin Cities Area, establishes broad environmental policies for the Twin Cities area.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Broad Categories of Environmental Concern </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Four categories of environmental concern are lumped together and treated under the same broad regulatory structure. These categories include water quality, air pollution, hazardous waste, and solid waste.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Water Quality </STRONG></H3></A>
Businesses are responsible for the effect their operations may have on water quality. Water quality is governed by a number of different governmental entities and regulations. Business disposal of waste water is regulated by the MPCA, while other business practices are governed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers or the DNR. 
<P>
Minnesota pollution requirements prohibit anyone from discharging untreated sewage into state waters, which include all streams, lakes, and ponds, and any other bodies of water both above and below ground. Regulations also prohibit the discharge into state waters of any waste that would cause "nuisance conditions." In addition to these standard regulations, the state has set aside areas of "critical concern," which are subject to stricter water quality laws. This distinction currently applies to the Mississippi River Corridor, protecting it from development that could cause irreversible damage. Thus, administrative rules in addition to laws of the state and federal governments govern the treatment of an area. Another area of the state that is subject to special treatment is the Boundary Waters Canoe Area (BWCA). The BWCA comprises several hundreds of thousands of acres of land and water, and is protected against mining, peat harvesting, and leasing. The area is also subject to rules governing the use of vehicles, the treatment of campsites, the use of trails, and even beverage containers.
<P>
National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits are required for anyone who intends to emit any pollutant into state surface waters, including noncontact cooling water and air-conditioning or heat-pump water. If the discharge goes to a public sewer, NPDES permits are not required, except for certain types of industries. These "categorical" industries, such as companies producing leather, glass, asbestos, rubber, and timber products, are subject to EPA requirements. State disposal system (SDS) permits are required for non-surface-water disposal of wastewater, such as large septic tanks. NPDES and SDS permits can be obtained from the MPCA. Categorical permits for businesses in some cities can be obtained from the city or sanitary district; otherwise, the MPCA is the issuer.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Air Pollution </STRONG></H3></A>
Laws regulating air pollution are designed to limit industry emission of airborne pollutants that may be harmful to people, plants, and animals. In Minnesota, these air quality standards are enforced by the MPCA. The standards were established by the federal government through the Clean Air Act. 
<P>
As required by the EPA, the MPCA reports an air pollution standards index (PSI) for cities with 200,000 or more residents. The index is based on measured levels of major air pollutants, such as particulates, ozone, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide, and -- during summer -- mold and pollen counts. In other areas, levels may be estimated through computer modeling. The levels are a major factor in the State Implementation Plan (SIP) that the MPCA must file with the EPA to demonstrate attainment of federal air quality standards. Attainment or nonattainment in turn affects the issuance of permits to businesses that emit pollutants. 
<P>
Emission of pollutants can occur either directly or indirectly. Indirect sources include roads and the emissions of heavy traffic drawn to certain businesses locations, such as hotels and shopping centers. Direct emissions are those that come from buildings, machines, or processes that emit pollutants. A person who owns or operates a facility that emits pollutants must comply with all applicable air pollution controls, which often involves getting a permit. In most cases, at least 180 days are needed for processing a permit application. 
<P>
Some MPCA rules apply even though the business does not have direct air emissions that require permits. Businesses are liable for air pollutants such as odors, dust that may be carried by the winds as a result of business operations, and smoke caused by open burning. Businesses must notify the MPCA immediately of any releases to the air that might endanger human health, damage property, or create a public nuisance, and the business must take any steps necessary to prevent such releases. Businesses that should be particularly aware of air quality rules include those that use boilers, incinerators, generators, and solvent-borne coatings, as well as grain elevators, concrete plants, and sand and gravel and building demolition operations. 
<P>
Indoor air quality has received more emphasis in recent years. "Sick-building syndrome" is more likely to occur in buildings constructed between 1973 and 1990, due in part to inadequate ventilation. Contributors to indoor air pollution include formaldehyde in particle board, plywood, furniture, and carpets; benzene in synthetic fibers, plastics and cleaning supplies; mercury and lead in paint; asbestos; dust; pollen; mold; and tobacco smoke. Under the Minnesota Clean Indoor Air Act, the DOH has established rules governing smoking in the workplace. Generally, smoking is prohibited in the workplace except in designated areas. <A HREF="#140">Asbestos</A> is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Hazardous Waste </STRONG></H3></A>
Hazardous waste is waste in any form that may cause serious illness or death or is otherwise dangerous to human health. Under Minnesota Hazardous Waste Rules, each industry generating waste is required to determine whether or not that waste is hazardous, which is usually done either by checking a list in the Minnesota Hazardous Waste Rules or by conducting tests to determine if the waste exhibits one or more hazardous characteristics. A waste is said to exhibit a hazardous characteristic if it is flammable, oxidizable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic. 
<P>
The MPCA is the regulating authority for hazardous waste. It regularly updates its rules to incorporate changes in the EPA program, but there may be lag time in accomplishing this. Generators and transporters of hazardous waste, as well as operators of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSD facilities), must comply with all applicable rules, including any federal rules not yet incorporated into the state rules. 
<P>
TSD facilities must apply for an MPCA identification number, and comply with numerous rules that apply specifically to their operations. Transporters of hazardous waste must have an EPA identification number and be registered to haul hazardous waste in the destination state. An experienced environmental law attorney should be familiar with other very technical rules that apply. 
<P>
Generators are required to have an EPA identification number and a license (renewable annually), and they must submit an annual disclosure statement. Generators located in the seven-county Twin Cities metropolitan area submit license applications and disclosures to their county's hazardous waste staff; outstate businesses, to the MPCA. License fees are based on the amount of waste generated and the disposal method. Additional fees may be assessed if a permit is required for treatment, storage, or disposal activities. Businesses that generate more than 100 pounds of hazardous waste per year are subject to a hazardous waste tax. See the <A HREF="b10.html">Business Tax Law</A> Chapter for more information. 
<P>
All generators must name an emergency coordinator who is on-call for disasters; large quantity generators are subject to additional emergency requirements. All generators must post emergency notification information and locations of emergency control equipment and alarms. If a spill occurs, the emergency coordinator or person in control must contain it and clean up, and also call the National Response Center (800-424-8802), the MPCA emergency response line (612-296-8100), and the local fire department.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Superfund </STRONG></H4></A>
Superfund laws were enacted to identify and clean up sites that have been contaminated by hazardous substances. States, as well as the federal government, have enacted Superfund laws. Minnesota's version is the Minnesota Environmental Response and Liability Act (MERLA). Superfund laws impose liability on those responsible for release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. The liability is "strict," meaning that it does not matter if the company was negligent, merely that it was the cause of the contamination. Further, this liability can be enacted retroactively so that the persons responsible can be liable even though the contamination occurred before the law was enacted. Penalties for noncompliance with federal and state statutes in this area are severe. 
<P>
Generally, persons who owned or operated a facility when it was contaminated, or who transported or disposed of the contaminant, can be held responsible. However, under the "innocent landowner exclusion," an owner of contaminated property may not be liable if he or she did not know or had no reason to know of the contamination and was in no way associated with the contamination. In addition to the persons named by statute as "responsible" for the contamination, courts have extended liability to those who held an interest in any corporation responsible for the contamination and who had the power to prevent the damage from occurring. Therefore, corporate officers, directors, and even shareholders can be held personally liable for the cleanup. 
<P>
In addition, parent and successor corporations have also been held liable under Superfund. An employee may be liable only if he or she knew the substance was hazardous and acted negligently, but an employer is responsible regardless of the degree of care exercised by an employee. Responsible persons are also referred to as "potentially responsible parties" or PRPs. 
<P>
PRPs may have to pay the costs incurred by the state to clean up and remove the damage or contamination. In the case of release of hazardous substances, which MERLA distinguishes from contaminants, PRPs may be liable for economic loss and personal injury. The only defense to the Superfund laws recognized by the courts is that the release of contaminants was caused by an act of God, an act of vandalism or war, or an act of a third party. 
<P>
Once a contaminated site has been discovered, an extensive system of assessment, cleanup, and monitoring begins. Researchers must determine the total scope and effect of the contamination as well as the best way to conduct the cleanup. Also, monitoring of the site may go on for many years after the initial cleanup has been completed.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Environmental Improvement Pilot Program </STRONG></H4></A>
Under a three-year state pilot program beginning in August 1995, business are encouraged to operate environmentally friendly facilities by participating in a voluntary audit process. Participating businesses must conduct an environmental audit or self-evaluation. Any environmental violations found during the audit must be reported to the MPCA and corrected, generally within 90 days. In return, the MPCA will defer any enforcement action for at least 90 days, and will waive any administrative, civil, or criminal penalties for the identified violations, provided such violations are corrected within the allotted time. The program also protects the business' audit reports and self-evaluation forms from third-party discovery or access. The MPCA will not routinely request the audit records unless a criminal violation is suspected, or unless the MPCA determines that the audit was not conducted in good faith. The purpose of the program is to promote environmental auditing, increase environmental compliance, reduce concern over the risk of enforcement, and encourage pollution prevention. The program is scheduled to expire on July 1, 1999. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Employee Right-to-Know </STRONG></H4></A>
Under the Employee Right-To-Know Act, all Minnesota employers -- regardless of size -- are required to evaluate their workplaces for any hazardous substances, harmful physical agents, or infectious agents (applies only to hospitals and clinics), and to provide information and training to workers about the substances that they may encounter. Written information on the hazards must be readily available to staff, and the labeling of substances must conform to certain requirements. The standard established under the Act includes lists of hazardous substances and harmful physical agents to assist employers in evaluating their work sites. The Employee Right-To-Know Act is administered by the Minnesota Occupational Safety and Health Division.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Community Right-to-Know </STRONG></H4></A>
Under federal law, businesses that manufacture, store, or use hazardous substances must report their inventories to local emergency-planning agencies to help these agencies in the event of an unplanned release, fire, or similar disaster. In Minnesota, the agency that collects the information is the Emergency Response Commission in the Department of Public Safety. In addition to inventories, employers are required to report estimates of maximum combined quantities of hazardous substances and the name of a responsible person who is always on-call in case of emergency. Filing fees are determined by a formula based on the number of chemicals reported.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Solid Waste </STRONG></H3></A>
Solid waste is defined as garbage, refuse, sludge, and other waste materials resulting from industrial activities, including mining and agricultural operations. Certain wastes are specifically excluded from the definition because they are covered by different regulations. These include hazardous waste, earthen fill, and sewage sludge. 
<P>
Solid waste management in Minnesota is the subject of numerous legislative acts and the responsibility of a host of administrative agencies, but jurisdiction lies with each county, which sets local ordinances, zoning rules, and land-use controls. Counties may revoke the license of or pursue criminal actions against companies that fail to properly dispose of their solid waste. In addition, a new law enacted in 1995 also authorizes counties to issue fines against such companies. 
<P>
The Office of Waste Management, the Legislative Commission on Waste Management, and the EQB review various aspects of solid waste management and policy. Also, regional organizations, such as the Metropolitan Council of the Twin-Cities metropolitan area, have authority to make rules in their districts. The MPCA is responsible for issuing permits to solid waste management facilities. Facilities with state permits are allowed to operate subject to state operating requirements and environmental monitoring regulations. 
<P>
Minnesota law prohibits placing waste tires, lead-acid batteries, used motor oil, major appliances, yard waste, used fluorescent lightbulbs, and phone books in landfills. Often the rules regulating what can be placed in the trash are more strict for businesses than for households. Disposal of ash from solid waste incinerators is regulated, and rules governing the use of ash, such as in road paving, have been proposed.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Special Categories of Environmental Concern </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Some categories of pollutants or environmental nuisance that might fit into one of the above definitions of broad areas of environmental concern are treated separately under the law because of some special characteristic of the pollutant or the generator or simply because political pressures force the government to treat a type of pollutant or nuisance differently from other similar pollutants.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Infectious Waste </STRONG></H3></A>
Infectious waste includes laboratory waste, blood and blood products, certain body fluids, research animal waste, and sharp instruments, such as needles and scalpel blades. The DOH regulates infectious waste within a facility; the MPCA regulates the waste after it leaves the generating facility. The regulations governing infectious wastes are quite technical. Generators of this type of waste should seek expert advice in devising collection, storage, marking, transportation, and disposal of infectious wastes.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Asbestos </STRONG></H3></A>
Asbestos is listed as a hazardous substance covered by the Superfund Act. Different federal and state agencies regulate asbestos outside of the workplace. The EPA regulates the reporting of commercial and industrial uses of asbestos and the control and abatement of asbestos-containing materials in schools. Emissions of asbestos into the air are regulated under the federal Clean Air Act and by Minnesota air pollution control standards. Various federal and state laws regulate discharge of asbestos into waters. 
<P>
Asbestos exposure in the workplace is governed by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and is enforced by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry and the DOH. In most instances, state laws mirror federal laws, but they impose stricter penalties on violators and require greater employee access to information. 
<P>
The basic legal requirement for all areas of business except construction is to maintain a workplace that is free of asbestos hazards. If the concentration of airborne asbestos fibers rises above a certain level (the "threshold level"), a business must begin air monitoring and medical surveillance of employees. If the levels rise above specified maximum levels ("permissible exposure limits"), businesses must provide employees with protective clothing and equipment, such as respirators, and make sure that they are used. The protective gear must be removed only in designated changing rooms and stored in closed containers to prevent spreading asbestos in the air. The gear must be cleaned weekly, taking care not to release asbestos. 
<P>
Requirements for construction, including alteration, repair, painting, and decorating, are somewhat different from general industry standards. The strictest rules apply to asbestos abatement activities, while short-term, small-scale activities and construction operations where asbestos does not exceed a threshold level for more than 30 days per year are exempt from some requirements. Medical surveillance is required less often under the construction standard than under the general industry standard. Demolition of buildings, except for apartment buildings with fewer than four units, must be reported to the MPCA and the EPA at least ten days prior to the start of asbestos removal or, if there is no asbestos involved, at least ten days prior to demolition. 
<P>
Under both the general industry and construction standards, employers must institute a training program for employees who may be exposed to asbestos concentrations above a threshold level. Violations of asbestos standards may result in monetary and criminal penalties.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Storage Tanks </STRONG></H3></A>
Abandoned or leaking storage tanks are common sources of water and ground pollution. Many tanks that once held toxic substances such as petroleum were buried, poorly maintained, and eventually forgotten. Years after they were last used, they continue to pollute the soil surrounding them and can be a major liability for property owners. Federal and state storage tank regulations are intended to prevent the release of substances that may be hazardous to human health and the environment. The regulations also contain provisions for the cleanup of leaks and damage caused by these storage tanks. 
<P>
In Minnesota, water quality rules require that persons who own any stored liquid substance that may cause pollution obtain a storage permit from the MPCA. Storage tank owners are also subject to rules governing the operation of the tanks to prevent overfilling or spilling. Other regulations control the number of years that an underground tank can remain in the ground and the ways in which these tanks can be repaired. All new and existing underground tanks must possess a device to indicate if they are leaking, and they must be monitored every month to check for releases, which must immediately be reported and mitigated. In addition, the MPCA requires ten days' notice of installation or removal of an underground tank, and only MPCA-certified contractors can perform installation and removal. Certain information about new tanks must be reported after installation. Above-ground liquid storage tanks need a "general permit," which requires meeting several criteria covering spill containment and emergency response. Information and forms are available from the MPCA's Tanks and Spills Unit. 
<P>
In Minnesota, owners and operators of storage tanks are encouraged to clean up petroleum releases through a system of reimbursement for cleanup. The Petroleum Tank Release Cleanup Act established a fund called the "Petrofund," which owners can tap to help with cleanup costs. Under the same act, the person responsible for the tank is also responsible for any liability incurred from leaks. The Petrofund Act underwent modification in the 1995 legislature, making owners who have their property tested for soil or groundwater contamination from a leaking tank eligible for reimbursement of the cost of such a test. The amended act now requires all above-ground storage tanks to be labeled and equipped with volume gauges and alarms that indicate when the tank is within 100 gallons of capacity.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Electromagnetic Fields </STRONG></H3></A>
Electrical and magnetic fields surround all electrical conductors, such as radio, television, and microwave transmitters, transmission lines, and personal computers. Building materials shield electrical fields, but magnetic fields pass easily through almost anything, including buildings and the human body. Some research studies suggest that electromagnetic fields (EMFs) may play a role in diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease. Concern over possible deleterious health effects has resulted in job-related litigation involving claims of detrimental on-the-job exposures to EMFs. 
<P>
OSHA currently does not regulate EMF exposure in the workplace. In Minnesota, the EQB has authority to regulate electrical and magnetic fields, but currently regulates only electrical fields in certain projects. Minnesota is one of several states that have established electric field limits that apply in or at the edge of electric transmission lines. As more research on the topic is completed, it is expected that litigation and regulation related to EMFs will increase. 
<P>
Large commercial buildings often have transformer and switching rooms that can generate extremely strong electromagnetic fields, and office wiring can produce high fields. Computer monitors and copy machines are two common pieces of office equipment that produce intense magnetic fields. The fields projected by computer monitors are much stronger at the backs and sides of the monitor than at the front. Offices can be designed to minimize workers' exposure to the sides and backs of other workers' monitors, and thus, their exposure to EMFs.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Stray Voltage </STRONG></H3></A>
Stray voltage is a phenomenon that has become an issue in dairy farming. Under certain circumstances, electrical usage and distribution lines on a farm can result in low voltage electrical current that flows through cows, affecting the animals in various ways and often resulting in a decrease in milk production. Dairy farmers have successfully sued electrical utilities for their responsibility in the production loss. In many cases, the source of the problem is incorrect or improper wiring, faulty electrical equipment, improper grounding, dirt or moisture, or bad connections. The EQB has statutory authority to provide assistance in the identification or mitigation of stray voltage. The Public Utilities Commission has been involved in both the technical and regulatory considerations of the stray voltage issue. A Public Utilities Commission engineer is available to respond to public inquiries and conduct limited on-farm investigations.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Toxic Torts </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A "toxic tort" is personal injury or property damage caused by exposure to toxic substances. Various legal theories that may apply to toxic torts are discussed below. In Minnesota, a fund administered by the Harmful Substances Compensation Board (HSCB) exists to compensate certain toxic torts to a maximum of $250,000. Personal injuries that are compensable through the HSCB include diseases, disabilities, or death caused by hazardous substances. Three types of property damage are also compensable: the cost of replacing or decontaminating a primary source of drinking water, the depleted worth of a hardship-sale of a home on the open market, and losses resulting from the inability under hardship circumstances to sell a property damaged by toxics. Compensation for property damage is limited to $25,000 for each loss. 
<P>
The legal theory of "strict liability" often arises in toxic torts. In Minnesota, a person who keeps a potentially dangerous substance on his or her land is held strictly liable if the substance escapes and causes injury, regardless of whether the escape resulted from negligence. Negligence, trespass, and nuisance are other theories that may apply to environmentally caused injuries and damage. 
<P>
There are certain limits on the toxic tort claims that can be brought against municipalities in Minnesota. For example, the tort liability of municipalities is limited to $200,000 for wrongful death or other tort injuries, and limited to $600,000 for claims arising from any single occurrence, and awards for punitive damages are not permitted. Also limited is the time within which a tort action can be filed. The limitation generally ranges from three to six years, depending on the nature of claim.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Recycling </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Recycling in Minnesota is governed by numerous state, county and municipal regulations. Recently, municipalities have dramatically increased their involvement in recycling by directly entering the market as recyclers, by contracting out for recycling services, and by putting more regulations on recycling businesses. 
<P>
The Minnesota Legislature enacted extensive recycling regulations in 1989 which, in part, established goals for metropolitan counties to recycle at least 35 percent of their solid waste and for rural counties to recycle at least 25 percent of their solid waste. These regulations were based on the recommendations of the governor-appointed Select Committee On Recycling and the Environment (SCORE). Another regulation resulting from SCORE's recommendations holds each county responsible for its own recycling, including curbside collection for metropolitan areas and recycling facilities and information campaigns for all counties. The law also encourages state agencies to purchase recycled materials, and requires schools and local agencies to develop recycling programs. The Minnesota Office of Waste Management administers several grant and low interest loan programs designed to encourage recycling.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Real Estate Transactions </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Under Minnesota law, the owner of contaminated property or property that has been used for hazardous waste disposal must file -- prior to transfer of ownership -- an affidavit with the county where the property is located. State law does not require that the owner certify property to be clean prior to transfer. 
<P>
As stated earlier, "innocent landowners" have some protection from liability related to contamination of real property. However, to use this defense, an owner must have exercised "due diligence" in determining the condition of the property at the time of purchase. An environmental site assessment can apprise a purchaser of a site's condition and any potential liability. A review of MPCA and EPA records relating to the property and adjacent land is a mandatory part of a site investigation. At the request of the parties involved in a property transfer, the MPCA will conduct the review of its records. The MPCA will also assist with cleanup by commenting on investigation plans and reviewing cleanup plans. Participants are charged for the agency's costs. Businesses that participate in this MPCA program may be eligible for release from some liability connected with contaminated sites. 
<P>
In an effort to utilize contaminated urban property which to date has been avoided by potential buyers concerned about liability, the state of Minnesota and local governments are pursuing a revitalization initiative. In December 1994, the MPCA and the EPA entered into an agreement whereby the MPCA may release property buyers from liability for cleanup of contaminated sites if the buyers voluntarily undertake cleanup of the property. State and local funding for cleanup efforts is also becoming available through new and expanded financial incentives, from localities that see the potential for substantially increasing the property tax base or providing other public benefits. 
<P>
Often, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure when it comes to environmental problems stemming from real estate deals. It can be very wise to have a thorough site investigation performed before purchasing any property that may be contaminated or that might contain an underground storage tank. An experienced environmental law attorney can advise on how best to protect one's business in routine real estate transactions.

</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Some businesses deal exclusively with one or more branches of government, while others only have to deal with the government to get permission to embark on certain projects. This chapter focuses on areas in which businesses frequently come into contact with federal, state, and local governments, such as public financing, government contracts, lobbying, and dealing with administrative agencies. The <A HREF="b17.html">Environmental Law</A> Chapter examines issues relating to business interaction with agencies protecting the environment. The <A HREF="b22.html">Intellectual Property Law</A> Chapter discusses how a business registers a trademark with federal and state authorities. The <A HREF="b13.html">Commercial Real Estate Law</A> Chapter covers zoning and land use variances.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Public Financing </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
One of the government's primary interests is to expand the economy and increase opportunities for a wider cross-section of the population to participate in the economy. In a poor economy, businesses lay off employees, and people without jobs tend to vote against incumbent politicians. Therefore, politicians have created a variety of government programs that aim to promote the interests of businesses. One of the most important means by which the government seeks to help businesses is by making available various forms of public financing so that businesses can expand and grow. Public financing is available from state, local and federal sources.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Federal Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal government offers a number of assistance programs primarily through an organization called the Small Business Administration (SBA). Created by Congress in 1953 to help small businesses, the SBA provides financial, procurement, advocacy and management assistance. Every year, the SBA guarantees bank loans totaling over 3 billion dollars for small businesses. Small businesses that qualify for SBA loans can usually receive far more favorable terms than they would otherwise be able to get. Most SBA loans are for a lengthy period of time and qualify for a relatively low interest rate. Despite their advantages, SBA loans are not right for all businesses: the SBA loan process usually takes longer than the conventional loan process, the SBA can require more personal guarantees and collateral, and the SBA sometimes restricts a business's ability to get additional financing as a pre-condition to the SBA loan.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>State Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
In Minnesota there are various public sources of financing under the direction of the Minnesota Department of Trade and Economic Development. One such program is a private/public partnership called Opportunities Minnesota Incorporated (OMNI), whose goal is to help provide financing for businesses that purchase buildings or capital assets that they plan to use for more than 15 years.
<P>
OMNI is certified by the SBA as a development company charged with helping to package and process federal loans. The program can be used to finance such things as land, buildings, renovation and machinery purchases. OMNI can lend no more than 40 percent of the cost of a project or $750,000, whichever is less. The remaining money must be provided by the company seeking the financing (10 percent) and a local lending organization (50 percent).
<P>
Other sources of public financing from the state include the Economic Development Program, Rural Development Board, Minnesota Public Facilities Authority, Tourism Loan Program, Capital Access Program, Minnesota Technology, Inc., Technology Information Services, Indian Business Loan Program, and Solid Waste Management Financial Assistance Program. Each of these programs has its own standards for determining who qualifies for economic assistance and how much money is available for which ventures. Information on all of them is available from the Minnesota Department of Trade and Economic Development.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Local Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
Many local government units provide assistance in various forms to new businesses. Some offer technical assistance or financial services, while others offer tax credits or loan packaging assistance. The cities of Minneapolis, St. Paul, Bloomington, and Duluth have the most experience assembling financial packages to encourage businesses to locate within their boundaries, but many other municipalities are amenable to negotiating with potential businesses. A businessperson interested in programs offered in a given area should contact the business services or planning unit of the county or city in which the business is or will be located.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Government Contracts and Technical Assistance </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Of all the corporations in the United States, the single largest is the federal government. Likewise, of all the corporations in Minnesota, the single largest is the state government. Despite these figures, government entities are frequently overlooked by business managers as a source of business opportunities. There are a number of ways a business can secure government contracts at the federal, state, and local levels.
<P>
On the federal level, each individual federal agency receives requests for bids from small businesses. To receive copies of various federal agencies' requests for bids, a business files an application with each federal agency that the business wants to do business with. Many of these federal agencies have special programs specifically designed to assist small and minority-owned businesses because regulations require that a certain percentage of all government contracts be reserved for small or minority-owned businesses. The SBA provides assistance to small businesses in this regard by publishing a list called the Small Business Subcontracting Directory. The directory lists the major contractors to the federal government and which are most likely to be in need of subcontracting.
<P>
One of the missions the SBA takes most seriously is its goal of management assistance. To this end, the SBA offers a number of different programs that businesses can turn to for advice in such areas as marketing, buying, financial management and administration. Among these programs is the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), which puts small businesses in touch with retired executive volunteers who offer counseling and advice. There is also the Small Business Institute, a coalition of college business schools and small business people, which offers management training seminars and various other services. The SBA's Office of Procurement Assistance helps businesses get information and develop strategies concerning selling to the federal government. The SBA also lobbies Congress and other federal organizations on behalf of small businesses.
<P>
There are several other government agencies that a small business should be aware of. For example, the various branches of the armed services offer assistance to businesses in securing defense-related contracts. Also, the General Services Administration (GSA) helps businesses that want to sell their products directly to the government by providing information on which government agencies wish to purchase products. The U.S. Army maintains an office known as the Defense Logistics Agency to assist small businesses with contracts.

<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Lobbying </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Lobbying is the business of persuading politicians to pass laws that are favorable to a particular person or agency and to defeat potential laws that are unfavorable to lobbyists or their clients. Despite the negative image that some lobbyists have, lobbying government on behalf of business is a long respected tradition in this country. Not only have lobbyists been around for many years, but many government agencies and departments rely on lobbyists to provide them with information necessary to make decisions and set policy. The government is not the large faceless machine it sometimes appears to be. There are people behind every decision and every regulation, and many of these people are sincerely concerned about staying abreast of changes in the law and industry and in promoting the economic vitality of the area they oversee.
<P>
There are laws governing lobbying at both the state and federal level, including requirements for lobbyists to identify the clients on whose behalf they lobby. Lobbyists who lobby the United States Congress are governed by federal lobbyist registration statutes. These laws require lobbyists to maintain and periodically file with the Clerk of the House of Representatives detailed records of major contributors and all expenditures made by the lobbyist or lobbying organization. Lobbyists are also required to register with both the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the House of Representatives.
<P>
Lobbyists who lobby the Minnesota State Legislature must register with the Minnesota Ethical Practices Board. They must also inform the Board about themselves and about the party they intend to represent to the Legislature, and must provide the Board with quarterly reports thereafter. The initial registration form provides the Board with information about the lobbyists and the parties they intend to represent. Quarterly reports must be filed thereafter detailing how much money was spent in efforts to persuade elected officials, how that money was raised, and exactly how the money was spent. Supervision and enforcement of these regulations has become tighter in recent years.
<P>
Many law firms have attorneys who specialize in lobbying. In addition, there are non-legal political consulting firms available to perform lobbying services. Their employees are often experts at influencing government.

<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Dealing with Administrative Agencies </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
When the average person imagines how the government makes decisions, he or she envisions the House or the Senate deliberating in session or the Chief Executive sitting in his or her office poring over papers. While it might be nice to have direct input into these decisions, few business managers will ever be asked to testify before Congress or to personally advise the President. Instead, the decisions that most directly affect the average business are usually made by one of a variety of government administrative agencies set up to formulate rules and oversee their implementation. Because administrative agencies deal with a wide variety of substantive problems, it would be impossible to summarize, here, all the work they do. However, because administrative procedures are so similar from agency to agency, a business manager should have a basic grasp of how agencies make decisions and the role he or she can play in dealing with administrative agencies.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>The Limited Role of Administrative Agencies </STRONG></H3></A>
It is easier to understand the role of administrative agencies if one understands their constitutional limitations. Theoretically, it is Congress that makes all federal laws and the Minnesota State Legislature that makes state laws. Realistically, it would be impossible for either of these two legislative bodies to handle every detail of the laws they create. Legislatures are forced to rely heavily on the advice of numerous administrative agencies in suggesting new laws and implementing existing laws. Frequently, Congress or the state legislature establishes an agency, gives it broad outlines to follow in regulating an industry, then delegates to that agency the power to make rules that industry must follow.
<P>
There are limits on how much authority Congress or the state legislature can delegate to administrative agencies. Once they are created, federal agencies must follow the federal Administrative Procedure Act and state agencies must follow the Minnesota Administrative Procedure Act. The statutes creating the agency can sometimes be attacked as an overly broad delegation of legislative power or a particular agency action can be attacked as overstepping the proper bounds of the agency's authority. Thus, an important first step in challenging an agency action is to ask whether the agency has been properly delegated power and whether that power is being properly exercised. The next step in challenging an administrative action is to ask whether the agency has followed the procedures required by the federal or state Administrative Procedure Act.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>The Administrative Process </STRONG></H3></A>
Understanding how agencies work is easier if one understands that all agency actions must fit into one of three broad categories -- rulemaking, adjudication, or informal agency action. Each of these categories has unique rules that apply to it, and each offers affected parties a different degree of input into the agency's decision-making process. Thus, the first step for any business wanting input into a particular agency action is to determine which category the action fits into. The determination of what to call the agency action is rarely simple. The category that the particular action fits into determines how many procedural safeguards the agency must observe. An agency may try to avoid the cumbersome procedure required for one type of action by trying to fit it into another category of administrative action that requires less formal procedure. Many legal disputes over agency action have centered around how to characterize what the agency is doing, rather than the actions themselves.
<P>
Rulemaking is usually done quite informally after a period of notice and comment. An agency gives notice that it is considering adopting a proposed rule and gives notice to interested parties that may want to comment on the rule. The agency considers the comments and then can promulgate a final rule. Commenting on a proposed rule is one of the most direct ways in which businesses can have a voice in formulating new rules. Unfortunately, an agency is not required to heed comments received. Because the agency is not required to follow any of the comments received, an affected party will often try to argue that what the agency is doing is not rulemaking at all, but instead is adjudication. In a few instances, a new rule can only be made after the agency follows detailed procedures known as formal rulemaking.
<P>
Adjudication is a procedure very much like a civil court trial. Court rules and agency rules are not identical, but agency adjudication allows for direct examination of witnesses, testimony under oath before an administrative law judge and the development of a substantial written record upon which the agency's decision must be based.
<P>
Informal agency action is a very broad category in which the procedures vary considerably. Parties to informal agency action often have minimal procedural protection. For example, an agency might merely be required to give the reason for taking a particular action. It need not allow for public comments or other input into the process.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>The Role of Courts </STRONG></H3></A>
Although most administrative decisions are subject to judicial review, few are ever overturned on review. At the federal level, the Supreme Court has sent very strong signals to lower courts that they are not to overturn agency decisions absent very strong evidence that the agency acted erroneously. A business manager would be foolish to treat administrative agencies lightly because he or she assumes that a reviewing court will correct any mistakes the agency might make. The ability of reviewing courts to overturn agency action is so limited that the only sensible strategy is to assume that a case must be won at the agency level or not at all.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Freedom of Information Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal Administrative Procedure Act gives individuals, businesses, and organizations a very powerful tool to use in obtaining information from government agencies -- the Federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The FOIA gives unprecedented access to government information. Under FOIA, an agency must make available to the public:
<UL>
<LI>	Final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders made in the adjudication of cases
<LI>	Statements of policy and interpretation adopted by the agency but not published in the Federal Register
<LI>	Administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public
</UL>
This general list is only a starting point, however, as there are a number of specific exceptions to what agencies must provide to the public:
<UL>
<LI>	National security information
<LI>	Internal personnel rules and files
<LI>	Information specifically exempted by another statute
<LI>	Commercial information
<LI>	Financial information
<LI>	Trade secrets
<LI>	Inter- or intra-agency memoranda
<LI>	Personnel, medical, or other files, the disclosure of which would violate personal privacy
<LI>	Law enforcement and investigation files
<LI>	Data about financial institutions
<LI>	Geological and geophysical information on oil and natural gas wells
</UL>
The definition of agencies subject to the FOIA is quite broad and includes independent regulatory commissions, the executive office of the President, other executive departments, all government corporations, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
<P>
FOIA requests are usually made in writing to the agency. Most agencies process so many FOIA requests that they have designated an officer to process the requests. The Code of Federal Regulations publishes the names and addresses of FOIA contacts in many agencies. Procedures for seeing these documents are very informal and no written request is necessary. The party making the request is obligated to describe the records reasonably well and to pay photocopying and search fees. Frequently requested documents may be made available at established Information Reading Rooms.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Franchise &amp; Dealership Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Franchises have become a popular option for many prospective business owners. Especially for a person starting out in the business world, a franchise offers a relatively simple way to run a business without having to develop new marketing strategies, logos, products, services, or a corporate identity. The person or company that grants the right to a franchise (the franchisor) and the person or company that is granted a franchise (the franchisee) invest a great deal of time, money, and energy into the relationship. Franchises are not trouble-free, however, and even a sophisticated businessperson can seriously overestimate the earning potential of a new franchise or the amount of operational support he or she can expect from the franchisor. 
<P>
Two areas generate most disputes in franchise law -- the initial offer and the termination decision. Franchisors and franchisees who want to stay on the right side of the law and have mutually satisfactory business relations need to be aware of state and federal laws that require disclosure by the franchisor of the most significant terms of the franchise relationship and the penalties for not following these disclosure requirements. Franchisors and franchisees also need to be aware of the complex legal framework surrounding termination of franchises.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Why the Need for Disclosure? </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Failure to understand the risks involved in opening a franchise can be a costly mistake. A key to understanding American franchise regulations is that the law does not try to eliminate risk for investors. In keeping with our capitalist economic ideals, the law does not seek to prevent businesspersons from making poor business decisions, rather it seeks to ensure that businesspersons are able to make informed decisions regarding franchise opportunities. If, after learning all the facts about a franchise opportunity, an investor still wants to undertake the risks inherent in opening a franchise, that is his or her decision to make.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Federal Requirements </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces federal laws and rules regulating franchises. These rules only apply to franchises that are "in or affecting interstate commerce." It does not matter what the written agreement is called as long as the relationship meets the FTC's definition of a franchise. This means that if a business is entering into what it calls a limited partnership, it may also be entering into a franchise agreement for purposes of the FTC's franchise regulations. The FTC rules define a franchise as a "continuing commercial relationship" between two or more parties. 
<P>
There are three basic types of "continuing commercial relationships" covered by the FTC rules. They are:
<UL>
<LI>Package franchises, defined as prepackaged business programs developed and identified by the franchisor. McDonald's is an example of a package franchise, also called a "business format" franchise.
<LI>Product franchises, defined as arrangements in which the franchisor sells goods that bear his or her trade name to a franchisee, who in turn sells them to the public under that same name. The franchisor maintains some degree of control over the selling of the goods by the franchisee in this arrangement.
<LI>Business opportunity ventures, defined as arrangements in which the franchisee is required to buy and sell the goods or services of the franchisor or another business. Furthermore, the franchisor arranges the location of the business, seeks out business for the junior partner, and may even provide employees. An example of this type of arrangement is a vending machine route, where a company finds a place to put the machines and sells the candy to the franchisee, but the franchisee collects the money and restocks the machines.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Federal Trade Commission Rule </STRONG></H3></A>
The FTC requires franchisors and sellers of certain other business opportunities to disclose several material facts before a sale can be closed. These disclosure requirements officially are titled "Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Franchising and Business Opportunity Ventures" and are frequently referred to as the "FTC Rule." The FTC Rule's coverage is quite broad, but certain narrow exceptions are available. For example, certain presentations at business opportunity trade shows are specifically exempt from the FTC Rule and some franchises have been exempted from coverage by informal advisory opinions issued by the FTC staff. A lawyer familiar with this area of practice should be able to advise whether a particular venture would qualify for an exemption. 
<P>
There are two official forms that a franchisor can use to meet the disclosure requirements of the FTC Rule -- the FTC Disclosure Document (FTC document) and the newer Uniform Franchise Offering Circular (UFOC). Although either form is acceptable for compliance with the FTC Rule, the FTC document does not meet the requirements of most state disclosure laws. The UFOC is acceptable (with minor alterations) in all states with franchise disclosure laws. The two documents have some similar sections, but the franchisor may not pick and choose sections from each document; either the entire FTC document or the entire UFOC must be completed.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>The FTC Document </STRONG></H4></A>
The FTC document must contain information in four broad categories -- information about the franchisor, information about the franchisee, details of the franchise agreement, and supporting facts for any earnings claims made by the franchisor.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG><EM>Information about the Franchisor </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The FTC document must contain the following information about the franchisor:
<UL>
<LI>The business history of the Franchisor
<LI>The employment history of the officers and executives of the company
<LI>The litigation history of the officers and executives of the company
<LI>The history of the company and certain key individuals with regard to filing for bankruptcy
<LI>Financial statements
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG><EM>Information about the Franchisee </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The FTC document must contain the following information about the franchised business:
<UL>
<LI>A detailed description of the franchised business
<LI>The initial investment to be made by the franchisee
<LI>Any requirements that the franchisee make certain purchases or use specific suppliers
<LI>Details of any finances provided by the franchisor
<LI>Services that the franchisor is obligated to perform on behalf of the franchisee
<LI>The right to use trademarks, patents, and copyrights
<LI>Restrictions, if any, on sales
<LI>Details about both current and terminated franchisees
<LI>Site selection
<LI>Employee and management training
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG><EM>Details of the Franchise Agreement </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The disclosure statement must contain the following information about the franchise agreement:
<UL>
<LI>Required fees
<LI>Exclusive right to serve an area
<LI>Extent of the franchisee's personal participation in the business
<LI>Renewal, repurchase, and termination rights and responsibilities
<LI>Procedures for modifying the agreement
<LI>Covenants not to compete
<LI>Term of the agreement
<LI>Arrangements upon the death of the franchisee
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG><EM>Supporting Facts for Any Earnings Claims Made by the Franchisor </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Information to support earnings claims is only required if the franchisor has made such claims, typically in promotional materials to prospective franchisees. Some franchisors have been tripped up by this requirement because they have not understood how broadly the term "earnings claim" is interpreted by the FTC. Earnings claims include oral, written, or visual representations that can be used to calculate, state, or even suggest sales, income, or profit levels. Also included are claims of past or potential future earnings, or data presented in such a way that income or costs could be calculated by arbitrarily selecting a sales figure. An attorney experienced in this area of compliance can help a potential franchisor understand which of his or her statements might be considered earnings claims.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>The UFOC </STRONG></H4></A>
The UFOC (Uniform Franchise Offering Circular) was developed by the Midwest Securities Commissioner's Association with the goal of making franchise disclosure statements shorter and easier to read and understand, and to require disclosure of additional helpful information while eliminating information of little use but still required by the FTC document. The UFOC has 21 major items: 
<P>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG><EM>Item 1 -- Background Information </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
<P>
Item 1 of the offering circular must describe basic information about the franchisor and franchise offering, as well as define terms used in the circular and describe regulations specific to the industry in which the franchise will operate. 
<P>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG><EM>Item 2 -- Business Experience </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
<P>
Item 2 requires disclosure of the business experience of the franchisor's directors, officers and executives. 
<P>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG><EM>Item 3 -- Litigation History </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
<P>
Item 3 must detail the litigation history of the franchisor, predecessors, and affiliates selling franchises under the franchisor's principal trademark, including confidential settlement terms of concluded litigation.

<P>
Item 4 must describe whether the franchisor, any predecessor, or general partner has been involved in a bankruptcy or reorganization within the past 10 years. 
<P>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG><EM>Item 5 -- Initial Fee </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
<P>
Item 5 must describe the initial fees to be paid by the franchisee, including whether payable in a lump sum or in installments, and under what conditions, if any, the initial fee is refundable. 
<P>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG><EM>Item 6 -- Ongoing Fees </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
<P>
Item 6 must describe, in tabular form, all additional, ongoing fees to be paid by the franchisee including but not limited to royalties, service charges, lease payments, and advertising fees. 
<P>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG><EM>Item 7 -- Initial Investment </EM></STRONG></H4></A>

<CENTER><A NAME="320"><H2><STRONG>Minnesota Requirements </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Under the Minnesota Franchise Act, a franchise is either:
<UL>
<LI>A contract or agreement between two parties that gives the franchisee a right to do business using the franchisor's trade name, trademark, service mark, logotype, advertising, or other commercial symbol, for which the franchisee pays a franchise fee, or
<LI>Any business opportunity in which a seller sells or leases products or services to a purchaser and represents that the seller will assist in finding locations for the buyer or that the seller will purchase products made under the agreement, or guarantees that the buyer will make a profit.
</UL>
Most proposed offers or sales of a franchise are subject to registration and disclosure requirements (similar to those described above for the UFOC) set by the Minnesota Franchise Act and rules established by the Minnesota Department of Commerce. Under the Minnesota Franchise Act, a company can request an interpretive opinion from the Department of Commerce as to whether a particular business is a franchise for the purposes of Minnesota laws, whether registration is required, and whether any exemptions apply. An attorney who practices in this area of law should be familiar with these requirements.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="330"><H2><STRONG>Other States' Requirements </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Several other states have franchise or general business opportunity statutes that can require disclosure by the offeror. At this writing, the following states have disclosure requirements:
<UL>
<LI>California
<LI>Connecticut
<LI>Florida
<LI>Georgia
<LI>Hawaii
<LI>Illinois
<LI>Indiana
<LI>Iowa

</UL>
There is little uniformity among states' regulations, although several make a franchisor's failure to provide an offering circular or disclosure document an automatic violation of state law. Some state laws only apply to limited types of franchises, and some apply only to transactions within their BORDERs while others apply to franchisors located within their BORDERs even if the offer is made to someone in another state. It is wise to check the requirements in each jurisdiction in which one is planning to offer a franchise or general business opportunity. An attorney experienced in representing franchisors should be familiar with the complexities of multi-state offerings.
<P>
<A NAME="340"><H3><STRONG>Federal Penalties for Failure to Disclose </STRONG></H3></A>
The FTC has authority to impose fines of up to $10,000 per day, to order rescission, reformation, payment of refunds and damages, and to issue cease and desist orders against franchisors who fail to follow these disclosure requirements. Persons liable for failure to properly disclose can include directors, officers, brokers, subfranchisors, attorneys, accountants, and other individuals. Currently, there is no private cause of action provided under federal law, although Congress is considering legislation that would provide a private cause of action for injunctive relief and damages.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="350"><H2><STRONG>The Termination Decision </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Manufacturers and distributors or dealers, and their attorneys, too often wrongly assume that the respective rights and responsibilities of the parties are completely defined in the written agreement and by federal antitrust laws. In fact, both manufacturers and dealers or distributors have rights and responsibilities that may be different from or even contrary to the specific language of the written documents or federal antitrust laws. 
<P>
A proper evaluation of a dealer termination requires the following six-step analysis: (1) determine the reasons for the termination; (2) review the written agreement; (3) evaluate potential antitrust concerns; (4) analyze potentially applicable dealer protection statutes; (5) consider the potential for common law contract and tort claims; and (6) do a damages analysis. Manufacturers typically do a good job on steps 1 through 3, then skip steps 4 and 5 entirely and thus underestimate their damages exposure in step 6. Such oversights can be very costly.
<P>
<A NAME="360"><H3><STRONG>Step One: Determine the Reasons for the Termination </STRONG></H3></A>
The first step in analyzing the termination decision is to determine all actual and arguable reasons for the termination, because the ultimate decision as to whether the termination is lawful will depend on the fact-finder's conclusion as to the real reason or reasons for the termination. From the manufacturer's perspective, it is crucial that the manufacturer's attorney be involved in the termination planning process, so that the array of potential and arguable reasons for termination can be examined in light of the other factors listed below, and a course of action can be planned that will minimize the likelihood of litigation. Documents that could arguably support or refute any potential reason for the termination should also be reviewed as a part of this first step.
<P>
<A NAME="370"><H3><STRONG>Step Two: Review the Written Agreement </STRONG></H3></A>
The second step in analyzing the termination decision is to review the written agreement, if any, between the manufacturer and dealer. The primary focus in reviewing the written agreement should be on the provisions concerning termination. However, choice of law and forum selection provisions, arbitration clauses, and clauses limiting liability or damages also should be reviewed because these provisions may have a profound effect on the outcome of the dispute, particularly in light of the trend in recent years toward increased enforcement of these types of provisions.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="380"><H4><STRONG>Termination Provisions </STRONG></H4></A>
Termination clauses in written dealer agreements tend to fall into two broad categories: termination at will clauses and termination for good cause clauses.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="390"><H4><STRONG><EM>Common Termination at Will Language: </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
"The Dealer's appointment may be terminated at any time by written notice by either the Company or the Dealer to the other party given at least one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the effective date specified in such notice."
<P>
<DD><A NAME="400"><H4><STRONG><EM>Common Termination for Good Cause Language: </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
"Company may terminate this Agreement by giving Dealer not less than sixty (60) days prior written notice of termination in the event of any of the following: 
<P>
Dealer does not maintain a level of sales of products and parts to the satisfaction of Company as required by this Agreement. 
<P>
Dealer does not perform satisfactorily its obligations listed in this Agreement. 
<P>
Failure of Dealer to perform any of the promises given or obligations undertaken in this Agreement. 
<P>
Any dispute, disagreement or controversy between or among principals, partners, managers, officers or shareholders of Dealer, which in the opinion of Company may adversely affect the business of Dealer or Company." 
<P>
"Company may terminate this Agreement immediately by delivering to Dealer or its representative written notice of such termination in the event of any of the following: 
<P>
Any transfer or assignment, or attempted transfer or assignment of this Agreement or any right or obligation hereunder or any sale or transfer of any interest in the ownership or active management of Dealer without prior written approval of Company; or
<P>
the insolvency of Dealer; the filing of a petition for bankruptcy or for reorganization, whether voluntary or involuntary; if Dealer makes an assignment for the benefit of creditors; if a receiver is appointed for a Dealer or its property if Dealer defaults in the payment of any obligation owing to Company or its affiliates, successors or assigns; or, upon demand fails to account to Company, or its affiliates, successors or assigns for the proceeds from the sale of goods for which Dealer is indebted to Company or its affiliates, successors or assigns. 
<P>
Dealer makes any material written or oral statement or representation which is false or otherwise misleading."
<P>
<A NAME="410"><H3><STRONG>Forum Selection, Arbitration, Choice of Law, and Integration Clauses </STRONG></H3></A>
Increasingly within the last five years, manufacturers and franchisors have used, and courts have increasingly enforced, contractual provisions intended to modify or circumvent statutory requirements.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="420"><H4><STRONG><EM>Choice of Law Provisions </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
A choice of law provision in a contract is an agreement that any dispute arising out of the agreement will be determined applying the laws of a particular state. An enforceable choice of law provision can dramatically affect the rights of those on both sides of the distribution relationship, but there is a wide variety of state laws regulating the termination or substantial alteration of distribution relationships, and a great disparity in the nature and amount of regulation. 
<P>
Historically, state statutes regulating the conduct of parties to a franchise or dealership agreement have been viewed as the embodiment of the state's public policy and, as such, the statutes prevailed over conflicting language in agreements between the parties. Recent cases, however, have dramatically eroded this view and led to the development of a four-part test to determine whether conflicting contractual provisions, such as choice of law provisions designating the law of a different state to govern, should eliminate otherwise available statutory protection:
<UL>
<LI>Did the parties agree to the choice of law in advance? 
<LI>Are the parties evenly divided between the chosen state and the plaintiff's state? 
<LI>Are the parties of relatively equal bargaining strength?
<LI>Is the application of the law chosen repugnant to the public policy of the franchisor's state?
</UL>
Not all jurisdictions have followed this trend, however and some states' courts are resisting the trend toward enforcement of choice of law provisions that effectively take away franchisees' and dealers' statutory protections. The Minnesota state legislature actually strengthened the language of the Minnesota Franchise Act in reaction to this trend. The Act was amended expressly to state that choice of law provisions that have the effect of waiving compliance with the provisions of the Act are void.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="430"><H4><STRONG><EM>Forum Selection Clauses </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
As a practical matter, a terminated dealer may be much less willing or financially able to pursue litigation in a far-distant forum than in the dealer's home state. Also, the manufacturer's or dealer's home forum may have more sympathetic judges and juries. Forum selection clauses therefore may also have a profound effect on the ultimate consequences of termination. Like choice of law provisions, the courts seem increasingly willing to enforce forum selection clauses.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="440"><H4><STRONG><EM>Arbitration Clauses </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Arbitration clauses are proliferating in franchise and dealer agreements, and for the most part continue to be received warmly by federal courts, even where state laws designed to protect dealers and franchisees specify that arbitration cannot be required.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="450"><H4><STRONG><EM>Integration Clauses </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Manufacturers often assume that if a contract contains an "integration clause" -- a clause indicating that the written document is the "entire agreement" between the parties -- they need not consider other communications or practices that might otherwise affect the agreement. While integration clauses are often effective against some types of claims, it remains a dangerous and often erroneous assumption that an integration clause will erase the effect of promises and conduct not contained in the written document. Courts often take into account, under a variety of legal theories, what the parties' "real agreement" is. Courts frequently consider the parties' oral communications, course of dealing, custom and practice, and other conduct and statements outside of the written agreement -- even when it contains an integration clause or oral commitments to attempt to prove its promissory estoppel claim.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="460"><H4><STRONG><EM>Contractual Statutes of Limitation </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
A troubling development in recent decisions, from the franchisee's perspective, is judicial willingness to enforce contractual limitations on the time a franchisee or dealer has to bring a claim. Several recent cases have found provisions requiring claims to be asserted in periods of as little as one year enforceable.
<P>
<A NAME="470"><H3><STRONG>Step Three: Evaluate Potential Antitrust Concerns </STRONG></H3></A>
Even when federal antitrust laws pose no problem, state antitrust laws may differ, or may be interpreted differently, than their federal counterparts. The best antitrust insurance is to have a good reason for terminating a relationship or a bad reason may well be inferred.
<P>
<A NAME="480"><H3><STRONG>Step Four: Analyze Potentially Applicable Dealer Protection Statutes </STRONG></H3></A>
States have a number of ways that they can protect dealers from unfair termination decisions. An attorney experienced in representing dealers or manufacturers should be familiar with how a particular state regulates dealer terminations.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="490"><H4><STRONG>State Franchise Acts </STRONG></H4></A>
As mentioned above, many states have statutes that govern franchise relationships, often prohibiting termination of the relationship by the franchisor except for good cause. The definition of franchise varies from state to state. Most, but not all, of the states require the payment of consideration from the franchisee to the franchisor in order to qualify as a franchise relationship. 
<P>
The Minnesota Franchise Act defines prohibited "unfair and inequitable" practices, which may be enjoined, as follows: 
<P>
"It is an unfair and inequitable practice for a person to . . . : 
<P>
(b) terminate or cancel a franchise except for good cause. "Good cause" means failure by the franchisee to substantially comply with the material and reasonable franchise requirements imposed by the franchisor including, but not limited to: 
<P>
(1) the bankruptcy or insolvency of the franchisee; 
<P>
(2) assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of the assets of the franchise business; 
<P>
(3) voluntary abandonment of the franchise business; 
<P>
(4) conviction or a plea of guilty or no contest to a charge of violating any law relating to the franchise business; or
<P>
(5) any act by or conduct of the franchisee which materially impairs the good will associated with the franchisor's trademark, trade name, service mark, logotype or other commercial symbol. The Act also prohibits unfair and inequitable practices with respect to nonrenewal of a franchise." 
<P>
Minn. Stat. &amp;sect; 80C.14, subd. 4 provides as follows: 
<P>
"Failure to renew. Unless the failure to renew a franchise is for good cause as defined in subdivision 3, paragraph (b), and the franchisee has failed to correct reasons for termination as required by subdivision 3, no person may fail to renew a franchise unless (1) the franchisee has been given written notice of the intention not to renew at least 180 days in advance of the expiration of the franchise; and (2) the franchisee has been given an opportunity to operate the franchise over a sufficient period of time to enable the franchisee to recover the fair market value of the franchise as a going concern, as determined and measured from the date of the failure to renew. No franchisor may refuse to renew a franchise if the refusal is for the purpose of converting the franchisee's business premises to an operation that will be owned by the franchisor for its own account."
<P>
<DD><A NAME="500"><H4><STRONG>Industry Specific Legislation </STRONG></H4></A>
Several industries have industry-specific statutes that govern their particular manufacturer-dealer relationships. Among the industries with industry-specific dealer protections are petroleum (i.e., the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act plus approximately 8 states with petroleum franchise regulations), automobiles (i.e., Automotive Dealer Franchise Act, plus various states' statutes), farm implements (approximately 38 states have statutes), beer (approximately 30 states) and construction and industrial equipment. 
<P>
Typically these statutes have arisen out of prior terminations and litigation in those particular industries. Accordingly, if the particular industry has had a recent rash of terminations and litigation, the chances are good that an industry specific statute has been passed to regulate it. For example, the Minnesota Agricultural Equipment Dealership Act requiring good cause for cancellation, failure to renew or substantially changing the competitive circumstances of farm equipment dealerships all arose out of a rash of terminations in that industry in Minnesota.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="510"><H4><STRONG><EM>What Industry's Laws Apply? </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The definitions in industry-specific statutes are often broad, and the titles of those statutes can be misleading. For example, the Minnesota Agricultural Equipment Dealership Act is expressly applicable to "skid-steer" loader dealerships, although "skid-steer" loaders are wheeled loaders more commonly used in the construction and landscaping businesses, at least in metropolitan areas. "Wheel loaders," by contrast, are considered "heavy and utility equipment" and are governed by a different statute, as are "backhoes." If a dealer sells skid-steer loaders with backhoe attachments the dealer could conceivably be governed by both statutes. It is imperative, therefore, that all potentially applicable industry-specific statutes be consulted in order to determine whether they apply.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="520"><H4><STRONG><EM>What State's Laws Apply? </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The search for potentially applicable state dealer protection statutes must go beyond the state where the distributor or dealer has its principal place of business, and must also include (1) the other states in which the distributor or dealer is doing business; (2) the state where the manufacturer has its principal business location; and (3) any other state mentioned in any choice of law clause in the written dealer agreement.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="530"><H4><STRONG><EM>Does the Statute Apply to Preexisting Agreements? </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Many dealer and franchise statutes have been enacted relatively recently, and their applicability to existing contracts is often in dispute. These disputes frequently arise either under statutes that do not address retroactive application, or under statutes that provide that they apply to agreements with no expiration date that were in effect at the time the statute was enacted. Even if a statute purports to apply to a contract existing prior to its enactment, the court may decline to apply the statute because of concerns over the constitutionality of its retroactive application.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="540"><H4><STRONG>Is There Good Cause for Termination? </STRONG></H4></A>
Assuming that either an industry-specific or a general termination protection statute, such as a franchise statute, applies, the next question is whether there is a violation. Since the statutes generally require "good cause" for termination, cancellation, nonrenewal, or in some cases for the substantial change in competitive circumstances, the first question is what is "good cause"? The statute itself often spells out at least some of the acts, omissions, or circumstances that constitute good cause. If the statutory "laundry list" is not applicable to a particular situation, the following are common issues that arise in determining "good cause":
<UL>
<LI>Failure to meet performance criteria: To constitute good cause, the performance criteria must be reasonable. Additionally, there is a developing body of law to the effect that, in order for the failure to meet reasonable performance criteria to constitute good cause, the criteria must be both essential and applied in a non-discriminatory way.
<LI>System-wide changes: A non-discriminatory, reasonable change in all dealerships of a manufacturer compelled by business considerations may constitute good cause under certain circumstances.
<LI>Violations of contract or law.
<LI>Market withdrawal: There are conflicting decisions as to whether a manufacturer's withdrawal from a market constitutes good cause. However, a change in distribution allegedly made necessary by economic necessity is not good cause for termination of existing dealers absent withdrawal from the market.
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="550"><H4><STRONG>Who Is Liable? </STRONG></H4></A>
A question arising with increasing frequency in these days of mergers and acquisitions is the liability of successor manufacturers for their predecessors' obligations to their dealers. In the agricultural and construction equipment industries, a common phenomenon in recent years has been the acquisition of one manufacturer's business by another through an asset purchase transaction. In these transactions, the purchasing manufacturer typically disclaims any assumption of the selling manufacturer's agreements with its dealers. A dealer terminated by the selling manufacturer which ceases business because it has sold its assets to another manufacturer is faced with what appears to be a no-win scenario: the terminated dealer can pursue a judgment against an entity that no longer exists or no longer is solvent; or the terminated dealer can attempt to impose liability on the purchasing manufacturer, who undoubtedly will disclaim any obligation to the dealer. 
<P>
Generally, attempts to establish common law successor liability on manufacturers in asset purchase situations fare poorly. However, some courts have attempted to find, and some legislatures have attempted to impose, statutory successor liability under unforgiving circumstances.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="560"><H4><STRONG>"Little FTC" and Deceptive Trade Practices Acts </STRONG></H4></A>
In addition to statutes regulating certain types of distribution relationships or distribution relationships in certain industries, another potentially applicable source of statutory rights and duties is found in statutes regulating business conduct in general. These statutes commonly include deceptive trade practices acts and "Little FTC" acts.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="570"><H4><STRONG><EM>Deceptive Trade Practices Acts </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Most, if not all, states have consumer protection statutes, many of which are modeled after the Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act. These statutes generally prohibit "deceptive" trade practices and therefore may encompass conduct that might not be found fraudulent. However, they frequently provide only for injunctive relief, not damages. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="580"><H4><STRONG><EM>"Little FTC" Acts </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Many states have statutes patterned after Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibit unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or trade practices. Unlike most deceptive trade practices acts, these "Little FTC" acts prohibit "unfair" conduct as well as "deceptive" conduct, and often allow private actions for damages, attorney's fees, and sometimes multiple damages. These claims have been successfully advanced in some dealer termination cases. 
<P>
<A NAME="590"><H3><STRONG>Step Five: Common Law Considerations </STRONG></H3></A>
The fifth step concerns taking into account common law considerations. This is the step that very few manufacturers and dealers or their counsel complete, but it frequently is the most important. Even when a written agreement states that it is the entire agreement between the parties, and that it may be terminated without cause on short notice, when no protective state legislation applies, and when the termination takes place under circumstances that are unlikely, in today's regulatory environment, to be successfully challenged under antitrust laws, termination without good cause may still be unlawful.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="600"><H4><STRONG>What Is the Contract? </STRONG></H4></A>
The contract consists of all of the parties' various expressions of interest, and is not necessarily limited to the written agreement. For example, the standard jury instruction given in Minnesota on elements of a contract includes the following: 
<P>
"For a contract to exist the parties must agree with reasonable certainty about the same thing, and on the same terms. In other words, there must be an agreement between the parties as to all the essential terms and conditions of the contract. In determining whether or not there was an agreement you may consider the parties' words, written or oral, their actions and conduct, and all of the circumstances surrounding their dealings. A contract may be formed orally, in writing, by the actions of the parties, or by a combination of all three methods. The usual way in which a contract is formed is through the process of an offer by one party and an acceptance of that offer by the other party."
<P>
<DD><A NAME="610"><H4><STRONG>Unwritten Terms </STRONG></H4></A>
The enforceable agreement may be different than, or even contrary to, the written contract for several reasons. Often, there are oral communications between "field" or "territory" representatives of the manufacturers and dealers concerning the duration of the dealership or the circumstances under which it could be terminated. These communications, if enforced, may prevent termination even when the written agreement does not. 
<P>
Parol evidence is admissible to explain or clarify ambiguous writings in all jurisdictions. If the language used in a contract is "reasonably susceptible of more than one meaning," it is ambiguous and parol evidence may be introduced. Evidence of the custom and practice in the industry with respect to dealer terminations, and the course of dealing between the particular manufacturer and dealer, is commonly admissible to assist the jury in determining what the agreement was. Courts have interpreted these provisions to permit introduction of evidence of course of performance, dealing and usage of trade when that evidence does not completely negate the terms of a written contract. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="620"><H4><STRONG>Terms Implied by Operation of Law </STRONG></H4></A>
Additional, contrary terms may even be implied by operation of law. An obligation of good faith is implied by the common law of most states, and often provides rights not found in the written contracts. It continues to be the law, however, that the covenant of good faith and fair dealing cannot be extended to contradict specific contract terms.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="630"><H4><STRONG>Estoppel </STRONG></H4></A>
Promissory or equitable estoppel may also operate to prevent a manufacturer from invoking a clause in its written contract where it has, by its conduct, led the dealer to believe it would not rely on that clause against that dealer.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="640"><H4><STRONG>Recoupment </STRONG></H4></A>
Essentially, recoupment implies a minimum term in an at-will agreement defined as the length of time in which the dealer can reasonably be expected to recoup its investment, and holds that it is a breach of contract if the agreement is terminated before that. 
<P>
A few courts have interpreted the recoupment doctrine to apply only to exclusive dealers. In calculating unrecouped expenditures recoverable in recoupment, the court must "tak[e] into account, of course, the value of any benefits it may have derived from the arrangement during its existence or may derive thereafter."
<P>
<DD><A NAME="650"><H4><STRONG>Fraudulent Inducement </STRONG></H4></A>
Fraudulent inducement generally requires a misrepresentation of a material fact made with knowledge of its falsity (or without knowing whether it is true or false) with the intent that the other party rely on the misrepresentation, and on which the other party in fact relies. 
<P>
Principal issues for making a claim of fraudulent inducement include: did the person making the promise appear to have the authority to make it, was the promise or statement with respect to when termination would occur false when made, and was there a failure to disclose material facts that should have been made at the time to avoid misleading the dealer? 
<P>
Incredibly, franchisors are having increasing success in asserting that the integration clauses contained in the written agreements operate to bar, as a matter of law, fraudulent inducement claims. 
<P>
Another issue that is frequently overlooked is whether the conduct of the manufacturer satisfies the elements of tortious interference with contracts and prospective contractual relationships. By introducing a tort theory of liability into dealer termination litigation, the possibility of punitive damages follows. This often has a substantial effect on the manufacturer's potential exposure and the terminated dealer's potential recovery. Tortious interference theories may successfully be employed in dealer termination litigation, and may give rise to liability under circumstances in which no obligation can be found in the relevant agreements or statutes.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="660"><H4><STRONG>Contracts </STRONG></H4></A>
"One who intentionally and improperly interferes with the performance of a contract between another and a third person by inducing or otherwise causing the third person not to perform the contract is subject to liability to the other for the pecuniary loss resulting to the other from the failure of the third person to perform the contract." Restatement (2d) of Torts &amp;sect; 766. 
<P>
This section is generally construed to require (1) a contract; (2) the defendant's intentional interference with the performance of the contract; (3) no justification for the defendant's actions; and (4) resulting damage. The interference need not be directed at the person with whom the plaintiff has a contract, but may be directed at the plaintiff.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="670"><H4><STRONG>Prospective Contractual Relationships </STRONG></H4></A>
Many jurisdictions also recognize a cause of action for tortious interference with prospective business relationships. Elements of this tort are generally defined to include (1) the existence of a valid business relationship or expectancy; (2) knowledge of the relationship or expectancy on the part of the interferor; (3) an intentional interference causing a breach or termination of the relationship or expectancy; and (4) resulting damage to the party whose relationship or expectancy has been disrupted. There are three types of interference: (1) interference with the dealer/distributor contractual relationships with its customers and prospective customers; (2) interference with contractual relationship existing between individual owners or operators and the corporate entity itself; and (3) manufacturer refusal to provide customary and reasonable assistance to the dealer during the time between notice of termination and the effective date.
<P>
<A NAME="680"><H3><STRONG>Step Six: Do a Damage Analysis </STRONG></H3></A>
Manufacturers may be too quick to minimize potential liability problems because of an assumption that damages will be limited to a standard formula, such as a multiplier of the pro rata net profits of the dealership. There are at least two reasons why this common assumption is not valid. 
<P>
First, different liability theories justify different types of damages recoveries. Statutory violations typically permit the recovery of attorneys' fees. The recoupment theory permits the recovery of unrecouped (i.e., unrecovered) investments in the dealership (such that, for example, a dealership that has never made a profit, but instead has lost $500,000 over the years in an effort to build up a market for the manufacturer's product, may be able to recover that amount, plus interest). Tort theories create the possibility of punitive damages (in an amount sufficient to punish the wrongdoer for its conduct and to deter others from engaging in similar conduct in the future). Second, even in those cases in which the measure of damages is limited to the value of what has been lost, the courts have allowed calculations that yield a far greater damages award than would a simple multiplier of the pro rata net profits of the dealership. For example, a dealer who carries five lines of equipment often covers the overhead with the first four and makes the profit on the fifth. The loss of that fifth line represents the difference between profit and loss to the dealer, a loss much greater than the proportion of the profit that is represented by revenues from the terminating manufacturer's product. Some courts have therefore recognized that a dealer whose overhead was not substantially reduced by a termination may recover damages on the basis of its anticipated gross profits that were attributable to the terminating manufacturer's products.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="690"><H4><STRONG>Injunctive or Declaratory Relief </STRONG></H4></A>
A strategic consideration for both sides in the dealer termination setting is whether to seek injunctive relief (for a dealer being terminated) or a declaratory judgment (for a terminating manufacturer). Courts often recognize that a dealer threatened with termination does not want to live on the income from a damages award, but rather would prefer to continue to operate the business. Courts therefore will often permit the entry of injunctive relief preserving the relationship pending trial if the injunction is sought before the termination becomes effective. However, courts generally are unwilling to grant injunctive relief after the termination becomes effective.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="700"><H2><STRONG>Recommendations for Distributors and Dealers </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI>Assuming the parties have unequal bargaining power, do without a written agreement if possible.
<LI>Ask good questions as to how the termination provision will really work and obtain a side letter with respect to termination concerns.
<LI>Pay close attention to forum selection, arbitration, choice of law, limitation of damages, and contractual "statute of limitation" clauses, and try to obtain a side letter stating that they do not apply to you.
<LI>If you see a termination coming, try and negotiate reasonable performance criteria as an alternative to termination.
<LI>Consider commencing a lawsuit and seeking injunctive relief in advance of the effective date of the termination and seek to negotiate an extension of the termination date to allow you to try and negotiate a resolution of the dispute, allowing continuation of the distributorship or dealership subject to meeting reasonable performance criteria.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="710"><H2><STRONG>Recommendations for Manufacturers </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<LI>Terminate for good reasons only, and communicate those reasons in advance of the termination, giving the distributor or dealer a reasonable opportunity to correct any correctable reasons for termination.
<LI>Do the above six-step analysis before implementing a termination decision.
<LI>Most importantly, have a written agreement, which should contain:
<UL>
<LI>Definite duration
<LI>Reservation of rights to the manufacturer, such as the right to appoint other dealers within the territory; rights to terminate the relationship upon sale of assets or a decision to go to direct distribution, even if those rights are not presently exercised
<LI>Disclaimer of any franchise relationship
<LI>Choice of law provision
<LI>Forum selection clause
<LI>Possibly an arbitration clause in a specified forum
<LI>Limitation of damages and contractual statute of limitations clauses
<LI>Integration clause, with references to how ongoing relationships, including day-to-day business agreements, will be handled
<LI>Authority clause limiting those who can bind the corporation
<LI>Possibly a two-way street provision requiring payment of attorneys' fees by the losing party
<LI>Possibly a "good cause" requirement for termination, specifically allowing termination for a reasonable array of good business reasons.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Health Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Health law is a relatively new and rapidly expanding area of legal specialization. Many lawyers are attracted by the dynamic character of this constantly evolving area of practice. Clients range from health care consumers seeking assistance to pay for health care to large corporate health care providers seeking to buy a chain of nursing homes. Because of the diversity of clients, the health law practice area has numerous subspecialties. This chapter covers subjects of most interest to businesses and health care providers. Employee benefits plans are discussed in the <A HREF="b15.html">Employee Benefits Law</A> Chapter. Medical malpractice is discussed in the <A HREF="b28.html">Professional Malpractice Defense Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Access to the Health Care System </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The most important health care issue for many individuals is access to the health care system. The state of Minnesota has some of the finest health care providers and facilities, yet Minnesotans can face a number of hurdles before receiving treatment. Patients, their families, and health care institutions all need to be aware of the legal framework that exists to guarantee access to health care.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Paying for Health Care </STRONG></H3></A>
The most important health care issue for individuals and their health care providers is often paying for health care. The three primary government-sponsored health care programs are Medicaid, Medicare, and MinnesotaCare. Minnesota's Department of Human Services processes payments to health care provides under these plans. In most cases, medical professionals have a right to payment within 30 days.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Medicaid </STRONG></H4></A>
Medicaid should not be confused with Medicare. Despite their similar names, the two programs are substantially different. <A HREF="#50">Medicare</A>, described below, is a program funded and administered entirely by the federal government (Social Security Administration) to provide health care to elderly and disabled persons. Medicare coverage is uniform throughout the country. Medicaid is a cooperative program partly funded by the federal government, partly by the individual states, and mostly run by the states to provide health care to indigent persons. Each state has wide latitude in deciding how Medicaid operates within the state. In Minnesota, Medicaid provides a wider range of medical goods and services than in some other states. 
<P>
The federal government's role in Medicaid is quite limited. It pays a percentage of the cost of each state's health care program for indigents and ensures that every state's program complies with various federal requirements. The amount of money a state receives from the federal government is called the Federal Financial Participation (FFP). Each state's FFP is determined by a formula based on the state's per capita income and the amount of medical services the state chooses to provide to its needy persons. 
<P>
For an individual to receive Medicaid, the county applies a complex formula that considers the applicant's unique situation. The individual applicant must have few assets and very low income. A person generally cannot have more than $3000 in assets or more than $420 income per month. There are several assets the formula does not count, including:
<UL>
<LI>Homestead (of any value)
<LI>Automobile under $4500 in value, if necessary for employment, receiving health care, modified for a handicapped person, or essential for performing daily tasks
<LI>Burial funds
<LI>Household goods and personal effects (of any value)
<LI>Capital and operating assets of a business necessary to earn an income
</UL>
A person can intentionally reduce his or her assets to the point where he or she qualifies for Medicaid. As long as transfers are compensated, it is legal to restructure one's assets and income with the intent of qualifying for Medicaid. For example, it is permissible for a person to invest all of his or her available cash in a larger homestead or in expanding a business in order to reduce his or her counted assets to below $3000. It is not permissible simply to give the available cash to family members or friends. Lawyers who specialize in Medicaid are often experienced in advising clients how to restructure their assets and income to qualify for Medicaid. 
<P>
Anyone whose income is above Medicaid limits might still receive Medicaid with a spend-down provision. The spend-down is equal to the amount a person's income exceeds Medicaid limits. Medicaid occasionally agrees to cover the amount that a person's medical bills exceed a patient's spend-down. 
<P>
Restructuring assets to qualify for Medicaid can be an especially attractive option for senior citizens, even if they already qualify for Medicare. Medicaid coverage is better for persons living in nursing homes because Medicaid pays for a wider variety of nursing care services and for a longer period of time than does Medicare.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Medicare </STRONG></H4></A>
Medicare is a federal program administered entirely by the Social Security Administration and is designed to cover some basic medical and health care costs of eligible individuals over age 65 and some disabled individuals under age 65 regardless of financial need. Medicare has become an enormous federal program, providing billions of dollars in coverage every year.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG><EM>Parts A and B </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Medicare has two primary divisions, called Part A and Part B. Medicare Part A, commonly known as Hospital Insurance, covers medically necessary hospital and related health care. Included in Part A are costs for such expenses as inpatient hospital care necessitated by acute illness, skilled nursing home care, certified hospice care for the terminally ill, inpatient psychiatric care, and care in the home by a certified home health care provider. 
<P>
Medicare Part B, commonly known as Supplemental Medical Insurance, is a voluntary health insurance program designed to cover some of the costs not covered by Medicare Part A, such as outpatient hospital services, outpatient physical therapy, speech pathology services, necessary ambulance service, and medical equipment. Unlike Part A, which is paid for out of Social Security taxes and is free to anyone qualifying for it, Part B is an optional program that carries small monthly premiums. 
<P>
The federal government contracts with private insurance companies to handle routine claims processing, payment, and other functions under Parts A and B. Private insurance companies contracted under Part A are called fiscal intermediaries. The fiscal intermediary for almost all of Minnesota is Blue Cross/Blue Shield of St. Paul. Private insurance companies contracted under Part B are called carriers. The Travelers of Bloomington is the carrier for the counties around the Twin Cities metropolitan area and Rochester. Blue Cross/Blue Shield is the carrier for the rest of Minnesota. The Travelers Insurance Company of Salt Lake City is the carrier for Railroad Retirement beneficiaries in Minnesota. 
<P>
Anyone eligible to receive Retirement and Survivor's Insurance (RSI) or Railroad Retirement benefits is eligible to receive Medicare Part A coverage, although the person need not actually be receiving financial benefits through either of these two programs in order to receive Medicare benefits. Anyone age 65 or older not eligible for RSI or Railroad benefits can still receive Medicare Part A coverage by paying a monthly premium. Medicare Part B coverage is automatically available to anyone who qualifies for Medicare Part A benefits. In fact, all applicants for Medicare Part A benefits are automatically enrolled in Medicare Part B unless they opt out of Part B coverage.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG><EM>Costs not Covered by Medicare </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Medicare was never intended to provide comprehensive coverage for all medical needs of America's elderly population, but rather was intended to supplement private resources. Many health services are not covered by Medicare. For example, Medicare does not pay for: 
<UL>
<LI>Custodial care, such as help with bathing, walking, or exercising, that could reasonably be given by someone without medical training and is generally intended to help the patient with his or her daily living needs
<LI>Dentures or routine dental care
<LI>Eyeglasses, hearing aids, and examinations to prescribe or fit them
<LI>Nursing home care (except skilled nursing care)
<LI>Prescription drugs
<LI>Routine physical checkups and related tests
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG><EM>Insurance Issues Related to Medicare </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Many seniors look for some form of private insurance to supplement Medicare coverage. Some seniors are able to get continuation or conversion coverage from group policies they had at their workplace. Under these plans, seniors continue to be covered by the policies that covered them while they were working. Another popular option for seniors is to join a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). HMO coverage is similar to continuation or conversion coverage, but many HMO's have more complicated rules for persons who are covered by Medicare, so it pays to learn about a particular HMO's policies regarding Medicare benefits before signing up. 
<P>
In addition, there are private insurance policies for seniors intended to cover gaps in Medicare coverage, such as deductibles, co-payments, or procedures not covered by Medicare. These policies are commonly referred to as Medigap policies. Medigap policies have been a source of much confusion and outright fraud in Minnesota. As a result, the state legislature has created a complex scheme to regulate them. The two types of Medigap policies are basic policies and extended basic policies. The State of Minnesota requires that basic Medigap coverage offered in the state include coverage for several preventative health care procedures and that extended Medigap coverage cover everything covered by basic Medigap coverage plus 100 percent of the cost of several routine cancer screening procedures, immunizations, and many more preventative tests and measures. In Minnesota, most dread disease policies -- policies designed to cover particular types of illnesses, such as cancer or heart disease -- are illegal to sell to Medicare beneficiaries. For certain indigent elderly, Medicaid is available, and therefore private insurance is financially inadvisable. 
<P>
In addition, seniors may obtain prescription drugs through MinnesotaCare (discussed below) in which drug companies may voluntarily participate.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>MinnesotaCare </STRONG></H4></A>
In response to the growing number of Minnesotans unable to afford private health insurance, the Minnesota legislature created a subsidized health insurance program known as MinnesotaCare. The program is administered by the Minnesota Department of Human Services and is open to permanent Minnesota residents who are not eligible to receive Medicaid (Medical Assistance, or MA, discussed above) and who are also unable to get employer-paid health insurance and are not covered by any other health insurance plan. 
<P>
MinnesotaCare works like many private health insurance plans. Eligible applicants pay monthly premiums based on family size and income. In return, they receive a variety of health care services, equipment, supplies, and prescriptions from private or public providers. Many of these items have co-payments associated with them. 
<P>
MinnesotaCare's eligibility requirements are complex. When originally begun, the program covered only children, parents, and dependents. As funding increased, MinnesotaCare's coverage umbrellas slowly expanded to include single adults and married couples without children whose income is no more than 135 percent above poverty level. Many persons originally ineligible to enroll have become eligible.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Access to Facilities </STRONG></H3></A>
Hospitals may not legally refuse to treat a patient if the patient has health care insurance, but it can happen either because of prejudices or a hospital's concern about being reimbursed through Medicare or Medicaid. Several federal and state laws exist to guarantee a patient's access to health care. The Internal Revenue Service requires hospitals to admit all paying members of their communities in order to enjoy tax exempt status. The Hill-Burton Act, which provides construction grants to many hospital projects, requires hospitals receiving grants under its programs to admit all paying patients. Both Medicare and Medicaid require all hospitals participating in these programs to care for all covered patients. 
<P>
Most of these laws guaranteeing access to health care facilities are rarely ever needed because hospitals are eager to admit paying patients. The AIDS epidemic has made accessibility an issue in some recent cases because some hospitals are concerned with the potentially enormous costs of fighting the disease, worried about spreading the disease, or because some decision makers object to the lifestyles of some AIDS sufferers. Laws governing the medical industry clearly forbid health care providers from using personal bias to decide whom to treat.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Access to Medical Records </STRONG></H3></A>
In Minnesota, a health care institution must provide a patient with the originals or copies of medical or psychological records kept on file. The patient may be required to pay reasonable copying charges. The health care provider can withhold the records only if he or she believes release would be detrimental to the patient's physical or mental well-being or could cause the patient to inflict self harm or to harm another person. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Patient Control over Health Care Decisions </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once a patient has gained access to the health care system, the law guarantees the patient's right to be kept informed of his or her status and involved in decisions affecting his or her care. Health care providers need to be aware of their responsibilities under these laws.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Right to Consent to Care </STRONG></H3></A>
In general, a doctor cannot diagnose or treat a patient without first obtaining that person's informed consent. A doctor need not obtain a client's consent to treat mental illness, mental retardation, or chemical dependency. However, failure to obtain informed consent for any other kind of treatment can subject the doctor to charges of battery, invasion of privacy, or malpractice. If the person cannot consent for himself or herself, a guardian, conservator, or close relative can give permission to treat a patient. In an emergency, the head of a health care facility can give consent to treatment for a patient if the patient's close relatives cannot be reached. A patient's consent to treatment will be implied if the patient is unable to give consent and an emergency exists or if the patient can give consent but there is not sufficient time to properly inform the patient of all risks and alternatives. 
<P>
Minors generally need to have the approval of a parent or guardian to undergo a medical or surgical procedure. Exceptions to this rule are emergencies, certain reproductive matters, testing and treatment for certain sexually-transmitted diseases, and emancipated minors. In Minnesota, a minor is considered emancipated and able to consent to medical treatment if he or she is living apart from guardians and is managing his or her personal finances. 
<P>
Most doctors are smart enough to know that they should not treat a patient without any permission, so disputes in this area rarely center on whether a doctor had permission. More often, disputes turn on whether the doctor disclosed sufficient information for the patient's consent to be informed or whether the doctor went beyond the consented actions. 
<P>
To give informed consent in Minnesota a patient must be given information about: 
<UL>
<LI>Diagnosis
<LI>Nature and purpose of proposed treatment
<LI>Risks and consequences of proposed treatment
<LI>Likelihood of success
<LI>Alternative treatments and likely prognosis if not treated
</UL>
All of these points must be communicated in language the patient is likely to understand. 
<P>
In addition, a patient must be informed as to whether his or her treatment is experimental. Experimental research cannot be performed on a patient without the patient's consent. The consent or refusal to participate in experimental research must be recorded in the patient's permanent record.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Right to Refuse Treatment </STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota statutes also give patients the right to refuse treatment, medication, or dietary restrictions. Patients who refuse recommended treatments must be informed of the likely medical and psychological results of their refusal, and documentation must be placed in their record.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Anatomical Gifts </STRONG></H3></A>
Many people want to donate their bodies to science when they die. Donated human organs can be transplanted into other people, giving the recipient a chance at a longer or more productive life. A wide variety of institutions also need bodies and organs for scientific, medical, and educational purposes. Unfortunately, many potential transplant recipients and many scientific and educational institutions are unable to secure sufficient donations because too few people are willing to donate or because potential donors do not know how to make their wishes known. To solve this problem, the state of Minnesota adopted the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act to govern the donation of bodies and body parts for transplant, medical, and scientific purposes. 
<P>
Under this law, a person of sound mind, who is at least 18 years of age, may donate all or part of his or her own body. There are several ways for a donor to record his or her wish to make a donation. The donor may make the donation a provision in a will. If part of a will, the provision becomes effective immediately upon death, unlike other provisions of the will which need to go through probate before they become effective. However, a will is not the best place for a donation provision because its terms may not be known immediately upon death. If the terms of a will are not read for several days after the donor dies, it may be too late to make an effective donation. A more common form of recording one's wish to make a donation is through use of a donor card often carried in a wallet. Drivers in Minnesota can also indicate their wish to be a donor on their driver's license. In addition, one can make a written document of donation which must be signed by the donor and witnessed by at least two other people. A donation can also be made orally. Oral donations are effective if witnessed by at least two other people. A dying patient can communicate his or her wish to make a donation to an attending physician who can act as one of the required witnesses. However, the attending physician must not be the physician who removes or transplants the organ. An intent to make a gift can be revoked orally or in writing. 
<P>
If there is no donation information in a client's file, doctors and hospitals in Minnesota are required, at or near the time of death, to ask the patient or his or her family about making a donation. Doctors and hospital administrators are required to use reasonable discretion and sensitivity and are not required to make a request if they feel that a body or part is not suitable for current needs. 
<P>
If a dying person is unable to communicate and has not made his or her donation wishes known, a family member or guardian can make a gift of all or part of that person's body, with certain limitations. 
<P>
The law forbids the sale of body parts. The recipient cannot pay for the anatomical gift but can and does pay for the cost of transportation and transplant. Only the following are allowed to receive bodies or body parts: hospitals, surgeons, physicians, educational institutions involved in medical or dental research, a storage facility for any of these persons or institutions, or any specified individual who needs the organ personally for therapy or transplantation.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>Patient Rights Inside the Health Care System </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Patients are guaranteed rights inside the health care system. Patients need to be aware of these rights and their health care providers need to understand their responsibilities under the law.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Patient Bill of Rights </STRONG></H3></A>
Patients and residents of health care facilities must be informed of their rights as patients and be given a written copy of the following rights:
<UL>
<LI>Right to know the identity of all physicians treating them and all outside health care providers
<LI>Right to receive all appropriate health care
<LI>Right to receive complete and current information regarding their diagnosis, treatment, alternative treatments, and risks
<LI>Right to participate in planning their health care
<LI>Right to refuse care (unless not competent)
<LI>Right to privacy regarding their health care
<LI>Right to be free from isolation and restraints unless other less restrictive measures are ineffective or not feasible
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Information about Health Care Providers </STRONG></H3></A>
Patients have the right to access some information about health care providers. Medical professionals must be licensed, and are held to certain standards of conduct. If they fail to live up to these standards, they may face punishment. Doctors who are the subject of malpractice awards or settlements must be reported to Minnesota's Board of Medical Malpractice. The Board has the authority to suspend a doctor's license for failure to pay student loans, conviction of a felony reasonably related to the medical practice, or conviction of a felony-level criminal sexual offense, for example.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Confidentiality </STRONG></H3></A>
There are two principal forms of protection for patients worried about the confidentiality of their medical records or information they provide to their health care providers. Minnesota Rules of Evidence prohibit the introduction in court of confidential communications between a patient and a health care provider. The public policy behind this rule is the promotion of full and complete communication between doctors and their patients. Minnesota also recognizes a civil legal action for patients whose doctors release patient records without patient authorization. Under Minnesota law, a health care provider must have the patient's consent to release records to a third person. This general law does not prevent a doctor from releasing records to another doctor in an emergency for the purpose of treating the patient. Neither does it prevent the release of records to the Minnesota Department of Health. 
<P>
Both of these protections will yield if they conflict with other public policies. For example, a doctor who is told by a patient that the patient plans to kill a particular person has a legal obligation to warn that person. Also, doctors have an obligation to report to the police anyone who comes for treatment of a suspicious wound, such as a stab or gunshot wound. 
<P>
The AIDS epidemic has tested the boundaries of patients' rights to confidentiality. All health care providers who know that a person has HIV have a legal obligation to warn anyone with whom the carrier is intimate. The State of Minnesota requires that a diagnosis of HIV-positive status be reported to the State Department of Health. A person who is HIV-positive has an obligation to warn potential partners and to practice safe sex. Lying, misrepresenting, or failing to reveal one's HIV positive status could leave a person open to charges of fraud, misrepresentation, battery, and civil lawsuits.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Employee Health Care </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A business owner or manager is perhaps most concerned with getting legal help to understand the complexities of employee health care and the many state and federal regulations governing it. 
<P>
Health care costs are rising and many businesses are finding it impossible to continue to give their employees the same level of benefits they once had. At the same time, individual health policies have become prohibitively expensive. As a result, more than 34 million Americans remain uninsured and the cost of health care has become one of the major reasons for strikes and other labor disputes. These are two of the primary factors creating increasing political and social pressure for health care reform and which have moved politicians to begin the difficult process of reshaping the way medical care is purchased and delivered in this country. 
<P>
How these reforms progress and the shape they eventually assume will have a tremendous effect on businesses and their relationships with their employees and insurers. Many employers, whether large or small, will need to seek an attorney's help to keep track of the many changes taking place.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>State Reforms </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The 1992 Minnesota Legislature began the state's effort to redesign health care when it passed a sweeping bill designed both to finance health care for the uninsured and to control health care costs. The ultimate aim of the plan, known as MinnesotaCare, is to provide health insurance coverage to slightly less than half of the uninsured people in the state. MinnesotaCare extends coverage to people with enough income to make them ineligible for Medicaid but who are still unable to afford to buy their own insurance. 
<P>
The 1993 and 1994 Legislatures modified the 1992 health care proposals with equally sweeping reforms that encourage physicians, clinics, hospitals and insurers to organize networks of health care providers into associations called integrated service networks (ISNs). Only nonprofit corporations will be allowed to form ISNs, and they must provide a full array of 24-hour health services and participate in the General Assistance, Medicaid and MinnesotaCare programs. The Minnesota Department of Health will oversee the ISNs.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Immigration Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

For centuries, people from around the world have been coming to the United States. They come to work, get an education, escape oppression, start a new life, do business, visit friends, or sightsee. Over the years, the United States has seen tremendous diversity in the countries immigrants come from and their reasons for coming here. In response to the incredible demand for permission to enter this country, the federal government has established a complex set of laws that determines who may enter this country and for what reasons. This chapter discusses legal immigration and travel to the United States and the responsibilities of employers under these laws.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>United States Citizenship </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
United States citizens have a right to travel to and live in the United States and enjoy the fullest protection of United States laws. People who are not citizens of the United States usually must have a visa to enter and may not enjoy the protection of all United States laws.
<P>
A person can become a United States citizen either through birth or through a process known as naturalization. A person can be a United States citizen from birth either by being born here, or by being born in a foreign country but having a parent who is a citizen of the United States. Anyone born in the United States has automatic citizenship, regardless of the parents' citizenship, and even if both parents are living in this country illegally at the time of the child's birth. The only exception is that children born to foreign diplomats in the United States do not get automatic citizenship. Anyone not born a citizen must be naturalized to become a citizen. Occasionally, a group of people is naturalized by treaty or by act of Congress. Usually, a person goes through the process individually.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Aliens, Immigrants, Nonimmigrants, and Residents </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An alien is a citizen of any country other than the United States. A person who comes here to stay permanently is called an immigrant. Someone who intends to return to his or her country of origin is called a nonimmigrant, even if he or she intends to stay for a substantial period of time. For example, a student might stay in the United States many years to complete an education and still be considered a nonimmigrant. The distinction between immigrant and nonimmigrant is crucial. Permission to enter as a nonimmigrant often is easier to get than permission to enter as an immigrant, so some people are tempted to claim they intend to return to their home country in order to enter this country. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is aware of this temptation and often will deny a nonimmigrant visa application to anyone suspected of wanting to remain permanently. Also, being granted a nonimmigrant visa sometimes can make it more difficult to get an immigrant visa later. A permanent resident is an alien who has been given permission to live permanently in the United States.
<P>
In a dispute with the INS over an applicant's true intent, the applicant always bears the burden of proving intent to remain here temporarily. For some people, this burden is nearly impossible to overcome. For example, the spouse of a permanent resident normally must wait over two years for available immigrant visas. If he or she claims to want to visit only temporarily, he or she must overcome the presumption that a married person would want to remain permanently with his or her spouse.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>The Visa System </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A visa is a stamp in a person's passport that gives him or her conditional approval to enter the United States. Most matters involving visas are handled by the INS. Most aliens apply for visas from a consulate or embassy of the United States in the alien's home country.
<P>
Citizens of some countries, primarily European countries and Japan, may enter the United States for up to 90 days without a visa. To be eligible, citizens of these countries must show the INS that they have a return ticket home and that they intend to engage in a type of business or tourist activity that would be allowed under a "B Visa," described below. Canadian citizens generally do not need visas to enter temporarily. In some instances, they must obtain INS approval in advance if they are coming here to work.
<P>
Congress establishes a complex set of quotas that limits the number of visas that can be granted for most types of visas. Whether an applicant receives a visa turns on the type of visa requested, the applicant's reason for traveling to the United States, and the applicant's country of origin. Probably the most important element of obtaining a visa successfully is knowing for which visa category to apply. For certain categories of visas and certain countries of origin, an applicant can wait many years before he or she even will be considered for a visa. Sometimes the wait would be much shorter if the applicant applied for a different type of visa. Unfortunately, once an applicant applies for one type of visa, it can be difficult to change the application to another class of visa. For this reason, it is wise to consult an immigration attorney before applying for any kind of visa.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Nonimmigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
There are different kinds of nonimmigrant visas, identified by the letters A­R, available for persons who do not intend to remain in the United States permanently. All nonimmigrant visas are based on what the applicant intends to do in this country. It is important that employers be aware of the variety of visas that exist. Following is a list of the categories of visas available.
<UL>
<LI>A Visas: for diplomats and their families.
<LI>B Visas: for aliens coming to this country to do business but not for employment or labor for hire, such as to do business research, engage in litigation, or negotiate contracts; B-2 Visas, the most common nonimmigrant visas, allow aliens to enter the country temporarily to engage in tourism, visit with friends or relatives, or to receive medical treatment.
<LI>C Visas: to enter the United States only for immediate and continuous transit through the country to a third country.
<LI>D Visas: for crew members of foreign vessels or airplanes.
<LI>E Visas: for traders and investors covered by commercial treaties between the United States and foreign countries, as well as spouses and children of E Visa holders.
<LI>F Visas: for students in full-time academic programs, from the elementary school level up to the post-graduate level, as well as spouses and children of F Visa holders, and allowing employment for fewer than 20 hours a week, mainly at certain on-campus jobs typically done by students.
<LI>G Visas: for representatives, officers, and employees of foreign countries to international organizations.
<LI>H Visas: for workers needed by U.S. employers to fill temporary openings; H-1B Visas commonly are held by aliens with highly specialized knowledge working in professional jobs.
<LI>I Visas: for media representatives and their families.
<LI>J Visas: designed to bring foreigners here to participate in exchange programs designated by the United States Information Agency.
<LI>K Visas: to allow an alien engaged to a United States citizen to enter to marry the citizen, as well as for any minor children of the alien.
<LI>L Visas: for intracompany employee transfers (e.g., for employees of multinational corporations).
<LI>M Visas: for students in vocational or nonacademic study programs.
<LI>N Visas: for relatives of certain international organization employees here on G Visas.
<LI>O Visas: for artists, entertainers, athletes, scientists, and certain business professionals with extraordinary ability in their field, and persons needed to accompany and assist them.
<LI>P Visas: for performing artists, entertainers and athletes; similar to O Visas, but easier to get and intended more for group entertainers or athletes who come here for a specific performance or tour.
<LI>Q Visas: for participants in international cultural exchanges.
<LI>R Visas: for religious workers and their families.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Immigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
An applicant who intends to stay in this country permanently generally is admitted either on the basis of employment or family connections. The main exception is for political asylum seekers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Employment-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can receive permission to immigrate to this country on the basis of his or her employment. There are five categories of employment, known as preferences, through which an alien can be permitted to immigrate.
<UL>
<LI>First Preference: Individuals of extraordinary ability, outstanding professors or researchers, and multinational executives.
<LI>Second Preference: Professionals with advanced degrees and aliens with exceptional abilities in science, art, or business. (Note: The terminology is confusing, but "exceptional ability" is a different standard from "extraordinary ability.")
<LI>Third Preference: Skilled workers, professionals, and other workers for which there is a shortage of workers in the United States.
<LI>Fourth Preference: Certain special workers, such as religious workers. 
<LI>Fifth Preference: Investors creating employment for workers in the United States; the investment must be substantial (i.e., between $500,000 and $1,000,000).
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Family-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can get a visa as an immediate relative of a United States citizen if he or she is a child, spouse, or parent of the citizen. In addition, there are four family-based immigrant visa categories: 
<UL>
<LI>First Preference:	Unmarried children of United States citizens.
<LI>Second Preference: Spouses and unmarried children of lawful permanent residents.
<LI>Third Preference: 	Married children of United States citizens.
<LI>Fourth Preference: Siblings of adult United States citizens.
</UL>
Each preference is allotted a total number of visas. Generally speaking, the higher the applicant's preference, the shorter the wait to get a visa. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Special Classes of Immigrants </STRONG></H4></A>
Some groups of immigrants receive special treatment and fall outside the preference system described above.
<P>
Diversity immigrants are immigrants from countries deemed under-represented in the pool of applicants for visas throughout the years. A new program implemented by the INS in 1995 provides a certain number of visas to be granted to applicants from low-admission countries. Applicants also must have a high school education or two years of training or experience in a particular occupation.
<P>
A person is a refugee if he or she is outside the United States, is fleeing or has fled his or her country, and has a well-founded fear that if returned to the home country, he or she will be persecuted because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An asylee is an alien already in the United States who, like a refugee, has a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to his or her home country. The President and Congress decide each year the total number of refugees and asylees to accept into the country. Occasionally, Congress grants immigrant visas allotted for individuals from specific countries according to political factors. Recent programs have included China, Hong Kong, and Tibet.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Entry and Exclusion </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A visa only gives conditional approval to enter the country. Once an alien arrives in the United States with a visa, he or she must apply for entry from INS officials at the point of entry. For most aliens, this is a mere formality, but INS can exclude persons with valid visas for a variety of reasons including communicable diseases, physical or mental disorders that pose a threat to others, drug addiction, or criminal history. Involvement in espionage or terrorist activity against the United States government or its people is grounds for exclusion. The Secretary of State also has broad discretion to bar entry of anyone whose presence would have an adverse effect on the foreign policy of the United States. Sometimes, waivers are available for aliens who otherwise would be denied entry for certain reasons. For example, the child of a United States citizen may be granted a waiver to enter to receive treatment for drug addiction.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Getting a Green Card and Becoming a Naturalized Citizen </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Becoming a permanent resident is the first step that an alien must take to become a naturalized American citizen. People with permission to live in the United States permanently are issued "green cards" that allow them to work with few restrictions. A permanent resident can apply to become a naturalized citizen after five years, or three years if married to a United States citizen.
<P>
The INS is diligent in investigating marriages between United States citizens and aliens to ensure that aliens do not become permanent residents through sham marriages. Immigration law specifies that an alien seeking permanent residence based on a marriage to a United States citizen of less than two years first is granted conditional permanent resident status. After two years, the husband and wife must apply to the INS to remove this conditional status.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Deportation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Deportation is the expulsion of an alien who entered illegally, or entered legally but has done something to become deportable. With few exceptions, any violation of the conditions of a visa, no matter how minor, is grounds for deportation to a person's country of origin. Conviction for any crime but the most minor also is grounds for deportation. Deportation can delay an alien whose long-term goal is to live permanently in this country. After being deported, aliens are forbidden to re-enter the country for five years. Aliens deported for aggravated felonies, such as drug smuggling, are barred from re-entry for 20 years or may be barred permanently. The delay in returning to the United States may be even greater for aliens from countries with long waiting lists. Returning home under a deportation order may result in the embassy's refusal to entrust the individual with another temporary visa.
<P>
There are a number of remedies to deportation, especially if the deportable person has lived in the United States for a long time, building a life that demonstrates good moral character. Even if the deportable individual has not been here long, there may be certain waivers or defenses to deportation. Among the most common is asking the court for "voluntary departure," which allows the individual to depart the United States on his or her own.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Business Concerns with Immigration Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Businesses often recruit foreign citizens with specialized skills to come to the United States and work for their companies. As discussed earlier in the description of visa categories, whether an employee can get a work visa depends, to a great extent, on his or her skills. Some immigration lawyers specialize in helping businesses meet the legal requirements for prospective employees to work in the United States.
<P>
All employers must verify that all employees are legally authorized to work in the United States, according to federal immigration laws. This verification is accomplished by having employees complete an immigration document, known as Form I-9, at the time of hiring. If employers fail to verify that employees are eligible to work in the United States, they may be subject to warnings, penalties, fines, and even criminal prosecution. However, employers must also be careful that their procedure for verifying legal authorization does not discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, or citizenship status. Employers cannot hold a certain group of employees to tighter scrutiny than other employees, and they should not take national origin or citizenship status into account when making hiring decisions. 
<P>
There are a number of traps into which an employer might fall if procedures are not carefully established and implemented. For example, some employers have been fined for applying stricter application procedures to job applicants who did not speak English, were members of minority groups, or who had not lived in the United States for long. An experienced immigration attorney can advise on how to establish procedures that verify the legal status of all employees without illegally discriminating.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Intellectual Property Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The creative ideas generated by businesses are among their most important strategic competitive weapons. This creative output is afforded protection under the law, but if not properly managed, a company's ideas can be used by others and result in a loss of competitive advantage. The law gives different protection to different categories of intellectual property. Which category applies depends on the particular subject matter in question. This chapter summarizes three types of intellectual property protection: copyright, patents, and trademarks. The <A HREF="b07.html">Arts, Entertainment, Advertising &amp; Media Law</A> Chapter discusses intellectual property issues of concern to persons in those fields.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Copyright </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A copyright is an exclusive legal right given to a creator of original literary or artistic work. Copyright protection is provided by federal law.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Coverage </STRONG></H3></A>
Copyright protection is granted to original works of "authorship" fixed in a tangible form of expression. Authorship includes literary works, such as novels, poems, and short stories; musical works, including any accompanying words; dramatic works, including any accompanying music; dance works; paintings; photographs; sculptures; movies and sound recordings; and architectural works. Copyright protection applies to a wide range of expression, from computer software to advertisements. What all of these items have in common is an original expression of an idea. Copyright applies to the expression of the idea, not the idea. Whether something infringes on a copyright is difficult to discern and a great deal of case law has been written on the subject. For example, in a written work outright plagiarism -- that is, the exact copying of words -- is infringement, but a copyright does not prevent others from using the facts and ideas used in that work. 
<P>
Copyright is separate from the subject matter of the copyright. For example, if a person buys a painting from an artist, he or she buys the painting only and not the copyright. If the buyer makes copies of the painting and sells them, the buyer is infringing on the artist's copyright. Copyright gives the creator of the work the exclusive right to reproduce the work, prepare other works based on copyrighted work, distribute copies, perform the work, and display the work. An owner of a copyright can sell one, some, or all of these exclusive rights. For example, an author of a novel can sell the movie rights to one person and the paperback rights to another.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Creation </STRONG></H3></A>
Copyright protection originates from the time the work is created. A work does not have to be published in order to receive copyright protection. There are no applications to fill out in order to have copyright protection. Copyright protection lasts a limited time. The time period depends on when the work is created and whether or not it was published. Generally, works created on or after January 1, 1978, have copyright protection from the time of creation throughout the creator's life, plus an additional 50 years. For works made during the course of employment, the duration of copyright is 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever is shorter.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Owner </STRONG></H3></A>
The owner of a copyright is typically the creator of the work. However, if a person is employed by another and creates the work while on the job, the copyright is owned by the employer, not the employee. This is known as work made for hire. If a person hires an independent contractor to create a work, he or she should address the copyright ownership up front. One does not necessarily own the copyright for an item that an independent contractor creates on the job. In this situation, the parties should decide who owns the copyright and whether the work is work made for hire.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Notice and Registration </STRONG></H3></A>
As stated previously, copyright protection arises when a work is created and does not require registration or notice. However, a person may give notice that the work is copyrighted and register a copyright. For works created after March 1, 1989, it is no longer required to place a copyright notice on the work. However, it is a good idea to place the copyright notice on all creative works to give notice of the copyright claim. If there is an infringement of a copyright, a court will not allow the party who infringed to claim that he or she did not know that the work was copyrighted if a notice was placed on the work.
A copyright notice contains three parts:
<UL>
<LI>The word "Copyright," the abbreviation "Copr.," or the © symbol
<LI>The year the work was first published
<LI>The name of the copyright owner
</UL>
The federal law states that the notice should be placed in a manner and location to give reasonable notice of the copyright claim. When one places a copyright notice on a work, it should be in a conspicuous location. 
<P>
Besides placing a copyright notice on an original work, a person may also register the copyright. Registering a copyright is not required, but it provides three benefits: first, a presumption that the copyright claim is valid; second, the award of attorney fees and statutory damages in an infringement case; and finally, copyright registration is a prerequisite to bringing an action for copyright infringement. 
<P>
Registering a copyright is relatively straightforward. In general, the registration should be done within three months of publication. A person must complete an application supplied by the Library of Congress, Copyright Office. This form is sent to the Office with a filing fee and copies of the work. The number of copies to be supplied depends on whether the work has been published, whether the work has been published outside the United States, or if the work is a contribution to a collective work.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Fair Use </STRONG></H3></A>
Although a copyright gives its owner exclusive rights, fair use of a copyrighted work is not considered an infringement of copyright. Fair use includes copying for purposes such as news reporting, teaching, research, and comments and criticisms. Factors to be considered in determining whether use is fair use include the purpose of the use, whether the use is for profit or not, the amount of the work used, and the effect of the use on the value of the work. There are also exceptions for libraries and teachers.

<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Patent </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A patent is a right granted by the federal government to an inventor to exclude others from making, using, or selling an invention. The invention must be novel, non-obvious and utilitarian in order to qualify for a patent. The rationale behind patents is to reward an inventor for the time and efforts used in the creation of an invention. A patent is granted for a limited time period. After a patent expires, the inventor loses the exclusive rights to the invention. A patent protects an invention only in this country. If an inventor wants to have protection in other countries, those countries' patent procedures must be followed.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Patent Categories </STRONG></H3></A>
An invention must be new, useful (except for design patents that must be ornamental), and not obvious in order to be granted a patent. There are three categories of patents -- utility patents, design patents, and plant patents. A utility patent is granted to anyone who invents or discovers any new or useful process, method, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or any improvement thereof. A new industrial or technical process may be patented. Manufacture refers to the articles that are made. Composition of matter relates to chemical compositions and includes mixtures of ingredients as well as new compounds. A utility patent is granted for a term of 17 years. A design patent is granted to anyone who invents a new, original, and ornamental design for an article of manufacture. The appearance of the article is protected under this patent. A design patent is granted for a term of 14 years. A plant patent is granted to any person who invents or discovers and asexually reproduces any distinct and new variety of plant. The plants may include any mutants, hybrids, and newly found seedlings, except a tuber-propagated plant or a plant found in an uncultivated state. A plant patent is granted for a term of 17 years.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Application </STRONG></H3></A>
In order for a patent to be granted to an inventor, an application for a patent must be filed. Once a patent has been applied for, the inventor may proclaim that his or her product has a patent pending, but this does not provide any protection against infringement; it only serves as a warning to others that a patent may be forthcoming. A patent application is made to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, which is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. A patent application is confidential; however, if a patent is granted, the application becomes public information. 
<P>
The application includes three components. First, the applicant must submit a written document that describes the invention and states the claims of the inventor. The statement must be in such detail that a person knowledgeable in the subject matter area could build and use the invention based on the information provided. The claims must state the patented characteristics of the invention. This document must also contain a declaration by the inventor that he or she believes himself or herself to be the original and first inventor of the application's subject matter. The declaration must be notarized. The second component of the application is drawings. Drawings of an invention should be furnished to illustrate the invention. An inventor should supply as many drawings as are necessary to adequately describe the invention. The third requirement is the filing fee. The fees may be reduced by 50 percent if the patent applicant is an individual, small business, or nonprofit organization. 
<P>
After a patent application is filed, a patent examiner reviews the application. The examiner may allow the patent, reject the application, or object to the application. A rejection means that the examiner believes the invention should not be granted a patent, while an objection means that there is a problem with the application. A problem with the application can be fixed -- an inventor can amend the patent application to address the concerns raised by the examiner. An inventor can appeal a patent rejection. 
<P>
A patent will not be granted if the invention was in public use or on sale in the United States more than one year before filing the application. Even an inventor's own use of the invention may bar him or her from receiving a patent if the use occurred for more than one year before application. A patent also will not be granted if the invention was the subject of a patent application in another county that matured more than one year prior to the filing of a patent application. 
<P>
Patents are granted only to the inventor; however, an inventor may sell the rights to the patent or sell licenses whereby another can pay a fee to use the patent. The license may be exclusive or nonexclusive. If the rights to a patent are assigned, the assignment should be registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. 
<P>
Before an inventor applies for a patent, a search should be done to determine whether a patent already has been granted for the invention. This search may be expensive. The Public Search Room of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is the primary source of information. Also, a Patent and Trademark Depository Library has been established at the Minneapolis Public Library and Information Center. 
<P>
When a patent is granted, an inventor must pay an issuance fee. Also, maintenance fees for the patent are paid three times during the patent period to keep the patent in force. Minnesota statutes require any invention development services in Minnesota to disclose the number of customers who have received additional money by virtue of the work done by the invention developer service. 
<P>
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office maintains a register of attorneys and agents who meet the legal, scientific, and technical requirements to practice patent law, and who agree to uphold high standards of professional conduct.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Trademark </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Perhaps the best definition of what a trademark is used for was provided by the United States Supreme Court in 1942, which stated that "a trademark is a merchandising shortcut which induces a purchaser to select what he wants, or what he has been led to believe he wants." A trademark is either a word, phrase, symbol, or design, or a combination of those items, that identifies and distinguishes the source of the goods or services of one party from those of others. A service mark is the same except that it identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product. The terms "trademark" and "mark" are often used interchangeably to refer to both trademarks and service marks. 
<P>
Rights to a trademark arise when a trademark is used or an application to register is made and the applicant intends to use the mark. A trademark gives the owner exclusive use of the trademark as long as it is used to identify goods or services. As is the case with copyrights, federal registration is not necessary for a trademark to be protected. A trademark is good from the first time a product is used in interstate commerce. A mark may lose its trademark significance if it becomes associated with a generic name. For example, the terms "nylon" and "escalator" were once trademarks that became generic. As with a copyright, there are a number of advantages to federal registration. A trademark may be registered with either the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or the Minnesota Secretary of State. Registration in one office does not register the trademark in the other office.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Federal Trademark Registration </STRONG></H3></A>
As previously mentioned, federal registration of a trademark is not required; however, there are two benefits from registering. First, the owner of a federal trademark registration is presumed to be the owner of the trademark. Second, the owner of a federal trademark registration is entitled to use the trademark nationwide. 
<P>
An application for federal trademark registration goes through two stages. First, the application must be accepted, and second, once the application has been accepted, the process to determine trademark registration begins. An application to register a trademark must be filed in the name of the owner. The owner can be an individual, partnership, or corporation. An owner who has already begun using a trademark can file an application based on that use. An owner who has not yet used the trademark may make an application based on an intention to use the trademark. Use of a trademark in promotion or advertising before the trademark is used with the products or goods does not qualify as use. If an owner files an application based on intent to use the trademark, she or he must use the trademark and submit proof of this use to the U.S. Trademark and Patent office before the trademark will be registered. 
<P>
The application consists of a completed application form, a drawing of the mark, and a filing fee. There is a separate filing fee for each class of goods or services listed in the application. The Patent and Trademark Office maintains a list of over 40 class categories, from furniture to clothing to chemicals. If the application is based on the use of the trademark, the application must include three examples per class showing actual use of the trademark. A separate application must be filed for each trademark a person wishes to register. The applicant must be careful when identifying goods and services, because an application may not be amended later to add goods or services not within the scope of the original identification. 
<P>
After an application is filed, it is reviewed to determine if it meets the minimum requirements. If it does, the application is given a serial number and the applicant is sent a receipt. If minimum requirements are not met, the application and the fee are returned to the applicant. After an application is accepted, an examining patent and trademark attorney reviews the application to determine whether the trademark should be registered. If the attorney decides that the trademark may not be registered, a letter is sent to the applicant stating the grounds for refusal. The applicant must respond within six months or the application will be abandoned. If the applicant's response does not overcome the attorney's objections, a final refusal will be issued. A common reason for refusing to register a trademark is the likelihood of confusion between the applicant's trademark and a trademark that has already been registered. 
<P>
If there are no objections to the application or the objections have been overcome, the attorney will approve the trademark for publication in the Official/Gazette, a weekly publication of the Patent and Trademark Office. Any party who believes that it may be harmed by the registration of the published trademark has 30 days to file an opposition to the trademark. Oppositions to trademarks are heard before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. 
<P>
If no oppositions are raised, the application continues in the registration process. The next step depends on whether the application is based on actual use of the trademark or intent to use the trademark. If the application is based on the actual use of the mark, the Patent and Trademark Office registers the mark and issues a registration certificate. 
<P>
If the application is based on the party's intent to use the trademark, the Patent and Trademark Office issues a Notice of Allowance. The applicant has six months from the date of the notice to either use the trademark and send to the Patent and Trademark Office a Statement of Use with three samples of use per class or request an extension of time. If the Statement of Use is filed and approved, the Patent and Trademark Office then issues a registration certificate. There is an additional fee per class for these filings. 
<P>
Before a person applies for federal registration of a trademark, a search should be done to determine whether there are any conflicting trademarks. The application fee is not refunded if a conflicting trademark is found. Also, one would not want to spend resources on a trademark that is not available. The Public Search Library of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is the primary source of available trademark information. Also, a Patent and Trademark Depository Library has been established at the Minneapolis Public Library and Information Center. The term of a federal trademark registration is ten years, with ten-year renewal terms. 
<P>
Besides registering a trademark claim, a person may also give notice to the public that trademark rights are claimed. The TM symbol or the SM symbol may be used by anyone to notify the public of the claim. Registration is not required; however, use of the registration symbol ® is permitted only when the trademark has been registered with the Patent and Trademark Office.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>State Trademark Registration </STRONG></H3></A>
A trademark can also be registered with the Minnesota Secretary of State's Office. A state trademark registration is not equivalent to federal registration. A trademark that is federally registered does not need to be registered with a state since federal registration gives the owner the rights to that trademark nationally. However, a party who has not registered a trademark with the Federal Patent and Trademark Office may, in some instances, wish to file the trademark with Minnesota. For example, if a person is operating a small business in Minnesota and has no intention of expanding the business, he or she may consider registering the trademark with the Secretary of State to protect his or her interests only in the state of Minnesota. 
<P>
A trademark registration in Minnesota takes less time and costs less than federal trademark registration. An applicant must submit an application to the state with the appropriate filing fee. State registration only provides protection in Minnesota, so a person can have a trademark registered with Minnesota and another person could legally use the same trademark in Wisconsin. Trademarks registered in Minnesota can also be protected as long as the trademark continues to be used. The initial term of a trademark registration is ten years with subsequent renewal periods. Registering an assumed name or a corporate name in Minnesota is not trademark registration and does not provide trademark protection.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Trade Secret Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Minnesota's Uniform Trade Secrets Act provides protection for a broad category of sensitive business information. The Act provides both injunctive relief and damages for misappropriation of a trade secret. The act defines a "trade secret" as information, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or process that derives value from not being generally known and about which some effort has been made at keeping the information secret. Note that the definition of a trade secret is not limited to documents or information entered into a computer; trade secrets can be information retained only in a person's head. Thus a trade secret can be passed on simply by a key employee leaving to work at a competitor. Note also that the definition requires the business to take steps to keep the information secret; an employer cannot claim misappropriation of a trade secret if the employer never treated the information as secret. 
<P>
Case law interpreting Minnesota's Uniform Trade Secrets Act has focused on the steps a business must take to protect a secret before it can claim misappropriation. An attorney experienced in this area can advise on the steps appropriate for a particular business to take. Generally, a business can help protect trade secrets by maintaining a strict policy regarding the identification, communication and use of trade secrets. Some practical means by which a company can help protect misappropriation of its secrets include reminding employees about confidential communications, asking them to sign confidentiality agreements, reminding them before and after the discussion of a trade secret to keep the information confidential, and by denoting sensitive communications with the word "secret," or "confidential."

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>International Business Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The days when international transactions and business deals were only the realm of huge multinational corporations are over. Today even a sole proprietorship can obtain a license to buy or sell products and services across national boundaries. There is no simple way to sum up all of the regulations that a company might encounter doing business abroad because there are so many foreign countries, each with unique import/export laws, corporate structures, and cultural norms. At the very least, a United States company involved in an international business transaction will be bound by regulations of the United States (the home country), the regulations of the country in which the business is conducted (the host country), and international regulations, which are derived from a variety of sources. This chapter will offer a brief sketch of where and how international businesses are most likely to encounter the legal systems.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Home Country Laws </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The United States has many laws governing international transactions in goods and services. Among these laws are export controls, import controls, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Export Controls </STRONG></H3></A>
Generally speaking, United States government regulations make it much easier for businesses to export than to import. Exports are commonly thought to be beneficial for the domestic economy so the government does not want to impede them. Most government involvement in exports is for the purpose of encouraging a greater volume of exports to existing trade partners, tearing down barriers to American exports, and helping businesses find new markets for their products. Nonetheless, controls are sometimes placed on exports to protect national security, advance foreign policy, or protect the domestic economy from the drain of materials in short supply. Export controls include requirements that persons acquire a license to export certain high technology items or other goods that might be used for military or other strategic purposes. In order to export certain sensitive items, it may be necessary for the exporter to make known or "certify" the country of destination of goods for which a license is required.
<P>
Most export controls are overseen by the Bureau of Export Administration, an arm of the United States Department of Commerce. Department of Commerce officials are an excellent source of information on complying with general export regulations and licensing procedures. 
<P>
Certain classes of exports administered by other federal agencies include:
<UL>
<LI>Endangered fish, wildlife, migratory birds, bald eagles, and golden eagles -- Department of the Interior
<LI>Tobacco seed or any live tobacco product -- Department of Agriculture
<LI>Arms, ammunition, instruments of war -- Department of State, Office of Defense Trade Controls 
<LI>Narcotics and dangerous drugs -- Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Import Controls </STRONG></H3></A>
As mentioned above, the federal government offers substantially more help to exporters than it offers to importers. A bewildering variety of government agencies are involved in one or more aspects of United States import policies and it can be confusing to know which agency or agencies need to approve an import before it can be legally brought into the country. The United States Customs Service assesses and collects duties, taxes, and fees on most imported goods, enforces customs and related laws, and administers certain navigation laws and treaties. The Customs Service publishes several general guides to help importers understand United States import regulations. These guides are available from regional offices in Minneapolis and Duluth. A number of categories of imports are subject to special treatment before they can be brought into this country:
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Agricultural Products </STRONG></H4></A>
<UL>
<LI>Cheese, Milk, and Dairy Products -- Most dairy products are required to have special import licenses, and are subject to quotas administered by the Department of Agriculture's Foreign Agricultural Service. Milk and cream imports must also meet the requirements of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Import Milk Act. Milk and cream importers need permits from the Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, and the Department of Agriculture.
<LI>Fruits, Vegetable, and Nuts -- Many agricultural commodities must meet detailed import requirements related to size, grade, quality, and maturity. Commodities must pass inspection before they are allowed into the United States. Inspection certificates are issued by the Food Safety and Quality Service of the Department of Agriculture. General inquiries about importing fruits, vegetables, and nuts can be directed to the Agriculture Marketing Service of the Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C. 20250.
<LI>Insects -- All insects that could be harmful to domestic crops or trees are forbidden entry into the United States unless they are for scientific research. Insects that could not be harmful to domestic crops can be imported only with special approval from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture.
<LI>Livestock and Animals -- The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service imposes a variety of inspection and quarantine requirements on most livestock and animal by-products. Permits for importation into the United States must be obtained before the item is shipped from its country of origin. Only certain ports of entry into the United States are set up to handle animal inspection and quarantine, so arrangement should be made well in advance to ensure that a desired point of entry can perform the appropriate inspection and quarantine. Exceptions to most of these inspection and quarantine requirements are available for imports from Canadian provinces and certain northern Mexican states.
<LI>Meat and Meat Products -- Commercial shipments of meat and meat products are regulated by the Department of Agriculture and must be inspected by both the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the Department and the Food Safety and Inspection Service of the Department before they are permitted entry into the United States. Noncommercial shipments of meat are regulated by the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which is enforced by the Food and Drug Administration.
<LI>Plant and Plant Products -- The Department of Agriculture regulates the importation of plants and plant products. Certain endangered species may require special inspection and approval or may be denied entry altogether.
<LI>Poultry and Poultry Products -- Imports of poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are controlled by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the Food Safety and Quality Service of the Department of Agriculture. Permits, special markings, labeling, and in some cases foreign inspection certificates are required. Inquiries about other birds can be made to the Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington, D.C. 20240.
<LI>Seeds -- Imports of seeds are governed by the Federal Seed Act of 1939 and regulations of the Agricultural Marketing Service of the Department of Agriculture.
Arms, Ammunition, and Radioactive Materials
<LI>Arms, Ammunitions, Explosives, and Instruments of War -- These imports are severely limited and can only be brought into the United States with express permission and license of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of the Department of the Treasury. Even temporary importation or transit across the territory of the United States is prohibited without a license from the Office of Munitions Control, Department of State, Washington, D.C. 20520.
<LI>Radioactive Materials -- Most radioactive materials are subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. License to import these items into the United States can be granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20520.
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Consumer Products </STRONG></H4></A>
<UL>
<LI>Appliances -- Household appliances must meet energy efficiency standards set by the Department of Energy, Consumer Products Efficiency Branch before they can be brought into the country. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission, Division for Energy and Product Information sets standards for labeling household appliances. Importers intending to bring any common household appliance into the United States should contact both of these agencies for the requirements in effect at the desired date of importation.
<LI>Flammable Fabrics -- Fabrics intended for wearing apparel or interior decoration must meet strict standards for non-flammability set by the United States Consumer Products Safety Commission. Some products that do not meet these standards can be brought into the country with special permission, provided they are intended for finishing or processing that will make them meet federal non-flammability standards.
<LI>Radiation Producing Products -- Many radiation producing products, such as television sets, microwave ovens, sunlamps, and ultrasound equipment are subject to radiation performance standards set by the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968. Any product with a performance standard set by the Act can only be imported into the United States with the permission of the Food and Drug Administration, National Center for Devices and Radiological Health, 1390 Picard Drive, Rockville, MD 20850.
<LI>Radio Frequency Devices -- Radios, televisions, tape recorders, and other radio frequency emitting devices can only be imported with documentation from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that they are in conformity with, will soon be in conformity with, or are exempt from FCC requirements.
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Food, Drugs, Cosmetics and Medical Products </STRONG></H4></A>
<UL>
<LI>Foods and Cosmetics -- Imports of most foods, beverages, and cosmetics are controlled by the Food and Drug Administration of the Department of Health and Human Services, Rockville, MD 20857. Imports of products regulated by the Food and Drug Administration are subject to inspection, and possible detention, at the BORDER. Prohibited products are any products that are defective, unsafe, filthy, produced under unsanitary conditions, or branded in such a way that they are false, misleading, or improperly labeled. Seafoods are subject to additional standards set by the National Marine Fisheries Service of the Department of Commerce, Washington, D.C. 20910.
<LI>Biological Drugs -- Import of biological products for human use is regulated by the Public Health Service Act. Foreign producers intending to send their products to the United States must obtain licenses for both their facility and individual shipments from the Food and Drug Administration, Department of Health and Human Services, Rockville, MD 20857. Biological drugs for animal use are regulated by the Virus Serum Toxin Act, which is enforced by the Department of Agriculture. The Virus Serum Toxin Act requires special permits and labels before biological drugs for animal use may be imported into the United States.
<LI>Drug Paraphernalia -- Imports are prohibited under the United States Code. Penalties for illegal imports of drug paraphernalia include both jail time and fines. Prohibited items include water pipes, roach clips, miniature spoons, bongs, and cocaine freebase kits.
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Gold, Silver, Currency, and Stamps </STRONG></H4></A>
<UL>
<LI>Gold and Silver -- Imports of gold and silver are subject to detailed quality and marking regulations established by the National Stamping Act and enforced by the Department of Justice, Washington, D.C. 20530.
<LI>Monetary Instruments -- Anyone importing into the United States or receiving from overseas more than $10,000 in monetary instruments, including currency, travelers checks, money orders, and negotiable instruments or investment securities, must file a report of the transaction with the Customs Service at the point of entry.
<LI>Postage Stamps -- It is illegal to import facsimiles of United States postage stamps, unless they are intended for philatelic, educational, historical, or newsworthy purposes. Further information on these regulations can be obtained by contacting the United States Secret Service of the Department of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20223.
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Pesticides, and Toxic and Hazardous Substances </STRONG></H4></A>
<UL>
<LI>Pesticides -- Pesticides, fungicides, herbicides, and rodenticides are governed by the Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act of 1947 and the Federal Environment Pesticide Control Act of 1972. All imports of these substances must be registered with the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances, Washington, D.C. The registration can be completed in advance of shipment. If the shipment is approved by the Agency, the Office of Pesticides and Toxic Substances provides the importer with a Notice of Arrival that must be presented to Customs officials in order for the items to be released from Customs custody.
<LI>Hazardous Substances -- Several federal regulations govern imports of hazardous substances packaged for household use. Marking, labeling, and packaging regulations are enforced by the Department of Transportation, Office of Hazardous Materials Transportation, Washington, D.C. 20590.
<LI>Toxic Substances -- The Toxic Substances Control Act regulates imports of chemical substances that pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. Customs officers are required to impound all imports of toxic substances until the importer can show proof of compliance with or exemption from the requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act.
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Textiles, Wool, and Fur </STRONG></H4></A>
<UL>
<LI>Textiles -- Textile fiber products imported into the United States are subject to identification and marking requirements set forth in the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act. More information on the Act and regulations promulgated under it can be obtained from the Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.
<LI>Wool Products -- Wool products are regulated by the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939. The Act requires most wool imports to be clearly labeled to show the total wool weight and content of the product. Pamphlets describing the requirements of the Act can be obtained from the Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.
<LI>Fur Products -- Most fur imports are subject to regulation under the Fur Products Labeling Act. Detailed descriptions of the Act and its requirements can be obtained from the Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580.
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Subjects of Voluntary Restraint Agreements </STRONG></H4></A>
Voluntary Restraint Agreements limit exports to the United States of certain products from certain countries. An example of such an agreement is the limit on steel and machine tools manufactured in Japan and South Korea. Voluntary Restraint Agreements are reached through trade negotiations between the United States government and representatives of foreign countries.

<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Foreign Corrupt Practices Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a federal act that forbids any United States citizen or resident of the United States to give or offer to give gifts, bribes, or anything of value to a foreign official or political figure in an attempt to influence any decision. The text and intent of the FCPA are quite simple but both have been criticized severely by many American business leaders as naive and an unnecessary handicap to American business efforts abroad. Many people believe the FCPA is an awkward, even elitist attempt to impose American values onto foreign transactions that occur in dramatically different cultures. Even the law itself recognizes the difficulty of imposing American ethical norms on overseas transactions. Thus, the law contains an exception for payments made to foreign government officials if the money or goods are "facilitative payments for routine government action."  The boundaries of what items constitute "facilitative payments" or what actions are "routine government actions" are hazy at best. Business leaders concerned with how a transaction might be viewed under the FCPA should consult legal counsel experienced in this area.

<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Host Country Laws </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Host countries have their own laws that United States companies must obey when doing business there. There can be a variety of tax consequences, restrictions on the movement of capital, merger restrictions and financial disclosure legislation. Furthermore, in some countries a company's capital and property can be nationalized with few, if any, due process protections. For instance, American businesses trying to establish a presence in Russia have firsthand experience with what it is like to make deals in a country where laws and monetary exchange rates can change dramatically from day to day. 
<P>
This chapter cannot summarize all the laws an American business might encounter doing business internationally. However, the United States Department of Commerce operates a Trade Information Center in Washington, D.C., that counsels American businesses wanting to do business overseas, which can be reached at 1-800-872-8723. The Department of Commerce also operates a National Trade Data Bank that collects information on trade with specific countries, and which can be reached at (202) 482-1986. The Department of Commerce can direct interested business persons to one of over a hundred different Country Desk Officers who specialize in advising businesses and individuals on a particular country's economy, trade policies, political situation, and United States government policies toward that country.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>International Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A wide variety of international codes and laws regulate international sales, such as the Convention on International Sale of Goods. In addition, there are codes of conduct for international businesses that, although not enforced by any one legal body, are generally adhered to by many parties actively engaged in international business. The sources described above for finding more information on host country laws can also be excellent sources of information on international laws applicable to trade with a particular nation or part of the world.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>International Contract Considerations </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Contracts are the basis on which international trade is conducted. Many of the contracts entered into are similar to those used in every domestic business, such as employment contracts, distributorship contracts, and purchasing contracts. However, there are some issues that are of particular concern in the international arena. For example, an international contract should specify which language will be used to conduct business and specify a set rate of exchange between currencies. In addition, because international business dealings involve governmental regulation at several levels, it is common to include a government approval clause in contracts. Such a clause states which partner in the contract is responsible for obtaining any governmental permission needed for the transaction. 
<P>
Some preparation must also be made for the handling of any disputes that may arise between the parties. A contract may specify that in the event of a grievance the parties will attempt arbitration before any lawsuit is filed. Contracts may also include a choice-of-forum or a choice-of-law clause. The former signifies a country in which a lawsuit will be brought in case of a dispute. The latter denotes a set of laws that are to be followed to settle a grievance, regardless of where the grievance occurs.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>International Letter of Credit </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In some international negotiations, a letter of credit may be necessary to help facilitate the transaction. Unlike most domestic transactions in which the buyer and seller typically know each other or have easy access to reliable financial data about one another, in many international transactions the buyer and seller know very little about each other and may have a difficult time learning more about each other. The seller may not know how creditworthy a buyer is or how shifts in exchange rates could alter the terms of the agreement. A buyer may not know the seller's reputation for quality and timeliness or whether the seller will be able to handle customs formalities sufficiently well to ship the product to the buyer. Because they are far apart, neither may be able to get adequate assurance from the other without help from third parties. This is usually accomplished through use of letters of credit. 
<P>
The term "letter of credit" is actually a shorthand way of referring to a complex set of agreements and documents whereby a bank assumes responsibility for paying the seller for the goods and for assuring that the goods were properly shipped. In a typical letter of credit transaction the buyer contracts with its bank to issue a letter of credit to the seller. The letter of credit is a promise from the bank to pay an amount to the seller if and only if the seller can produce adequate documentation (such as invoices, bills of lading, inspection certificates) proving that the goods were shipped properly and will be received as agreed upon. The buyer and its bank make a separate arrangement between them so the bank is reimbursed. In some transactions the seller's bank will also be involved in guaranteeing payment to the seller if the seller provides adequate documentation as described above.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Labor Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The term "labor law" encompasses a myriad of workplace issues dealing with how an employer interacts with organized groups of employees, such as a union. This chapter examines the principal federal and state laws governing the relationship between management and organized labor and employee and employer rights and responsibilities during collective bargaining. The <A HREF="b16.html">Employment Law</A> Chapter covers the rights and obligations of employees as individuals, and discusses such issues as Social Security, Unemployment Compensation Insurance, sexual harassment, and racial discrimination. The <A HREF="b15.html">Employee Benefits Law</A> Chapter discusses employee benefits programs commonly used by employers to attract new employees and reward their existing employees. It is important to note that while labor law, employment law, and employee benefits law are treated separately in this <STRONG>Guide,</STRONG> the issues raised in one of these three areas of law often involve issues from the other two. For example, an employee benefits package (an employee benefits law issue) can determine whether an individual worker is an independent contractor or employee (an employment law issue), and are often the subject of union negotiations (a labor law issue). Refusal to provide maternity benefits (an employee benefits issue) may lead to allegations of sexual discrimination (an employment law issue) which are frequently handled by union committees set up to pursue employee complaints (a labor law issue).
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Federal Legislation Regarding Unions </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The United States has seen the struggle between labor and management played out over a long history. Relations between labor and management in this country frequently have been tense with power seeming to ebb and flow between workers and business owners. Some of the most heated battles in the struggle for workers' rights were fought right here in Minnesota as management and labor fought over the issues that mass industrialization brought to the state. In time, much of the relationship between management and labor came to be governed by federal laws enacted in response to the strife and economic disruption caused by long strikes. The history of federal labor legislation is a story of Congress reacting to the perceived imbalance of power between organized labor and management in this country, stepping in to bolster or curtail the power of the labor movement. The principal federal laws setting ground rules for how management and labor deal with each other are the Norris-LaGuardia Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the Labor-Management Relations Act, and the Landrum-Griffin Act.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Norris-LaGuardia Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Norris-LaGuardia Act was one of the first attempts to limit the power of federal courts in labor disputes. Prior to the adoption of the Norris-LaGuardia Act in 1932 many courts looked upon concerted actions by groups of employees, such as strikes, boycotts, and picketing as criminal conspiracies punishable by law. Industrial representatives frequently turned to courts sympathetic to management interests in order to get temporary or permanent injunctions against labor unions to prevent them from organizing workers, calling strikes, picketing, or boycotting. The primary accomplishment of the Norris-LaGuardia Act was to do away with the power of the federal judiciary to use injunctions to stifle the nascent labor movement. The Act so severely limited the use of injunctions (courts are permitted to enjoin union activity in rare instances to prevent violence) that today court-ordered injunctions are no longer a viable tool for management to use in labor disputes.
<P>
The Norris-LaGuardia Act also made illegal the theretofore common practice of requiring new employees to sign pledges not to join unions as a pre-condition of employment. So-called "yellow dog" contracts had been a common tool that management used to squash labor unions.
<P>
Even more significant than its literal impact was the policy implication of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. For the first time, Congress said that federal courts were not the proper forum for resolving labor-management disputes. Henceforth government would be more neutral in letting market forces determine the proper balance of power between workers and their employers. Perhaps naively, Congress assumed that simple government neutrality would provide the best environment for union-management negotiations.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>National Labor Relations Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 (NLRA), frequently referred to as the Wagner Act, represented the first substantial effort by the federal government to reshape the balance of power between labor and management in this country. The NLRA explicitly guarantees employees the right to form labor organizations and to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing. The NLRA made illegal a number of management practices that had been used to interfere with employee efforts to self-organize. The NLRA provides stiff penalties for employers who interfere with its provisions.
<P>
The NLRA also established an administrative agency, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and endowed it with the power to administer and enforce its provisions. The NLRB's five board members are appointed by the United States President with the advice and consent of the Senate for five-year terms. The Board's home is in Washington, D.C. Most employer-employee interaction with the NLRB is through one of over 30 regional offices throughout the country. Each regional office is headed by a regional director who reports to the general counsel in Washington.
<P>
Under the NLRA, the term "employee" includes a very broad range of workers who earn wages, salaries, or commissions. Specifically exempted from its coverage are agricultural workers, domestic servants, persons employed by their own parent or spouse, railroad employees, and independent contractors. The definition of an independent contractor is discussed in the <A HREF="b16.html">Employment Law</A> Chapter. Employers should know that courts have generally interpreted "independent contractor" quite narrowly for purposes of deciding whether someone is protected by the NLRA. Thus, an individual who is considered an independent contractor for purposes of complying with other federal regulations might be considered an employee under the NLRA.
<P>
The NLRA remains the primary law regulating relations between labor and management in this country. Most post-NLRA legislation sought merely to refine and improve the provisions of the NLRA rather than replace it with another scheme. For instance, the NLRA contained no restrictions on the activities of unions. Later laws would impose rules on how unions operate internally and require labor organizations to submit periodic financial information to the government.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Labor-Management Relations Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Labor-Management Relations Act also called the Taft-Hartley Law was an attempt by Congress to limit the abuses of organized labor's power after the Second World War and to reign in the power of the NLRB. The Labor-Management Relations Act is a complex piece of legislation.The Act established the general counsel position of the NLRB, and gave the general counsel authority to issue complaints. It barred "closed shop" agreements that allow employers to hire only union members. However, "union shop" agreements, in which employers are required to join the union after a set period of time, were not prohibited. The Act's other provisions are:
<UL>
<LI>Prohibiting unfair labor practices used by management to discourage union membership, such as discrimination in hiring and tenure
<LI>Prohibiting unfair labor practices by labor such as refusal to bargain or illegal strikes or boycotts
<LI>Instituting a 60-day "cooling off" period before a work stoppage at the end of a collective bargaining agreement
<LI>Creating special powers to limit strikes that could threaten the security of the nation
<LI>Forcing unions to file financial reports with the NLRB
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Landrum-Griffin Act </STRONG></H3></A>
The Landrum-Griffin Act (officially the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act) was enacted to reform the way that unionized labor and union management interact, in an attempt to protect members of labor unions from perceived abuses from corrupt labor leaders. The bill gave union members a "bill of rights" they could assert against union leadership and established procedures to help union members uncover unscrupulous practices of labor leaders. The Landrum-Griffin Act requires certain financial disclosures by unions, establishes procedures that unions must follow to elect officers, provides penalties for financial abuses committed by union officials and strictly limits secondary boycotts and picketing.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Forming a Union </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An employer whose employees are considering organizing should be aware of what the law requires of all parties.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Employee Procedures </STRONG></H3></A>
A group of employees can form a union by filing a petition at the regional office of the NLRB. The petition must show that at least 30 percent of the employees of the prospective bargaining unit support the petition to organize. An NLRB official will determine whether the petition is valid and whether any legal obstacles need to be overcome. The board will then hold hearings for company and union representatives and hold an election within the company to vote for or against the union.
<P>
An important issue at this stage is what constitutes an appropriate bargaining unit. Different employees have different interests and goals for collective bargaining. If the bargaining unit is too broad, some members of the unit may not be effectively represented, but if the unit is too small, it may lack clout to bargain with management. The following factors are typically considered when deciding upon the appropriate bargaining unit:
<UL>
<LI>Amount and method of calculating pay
<LI>Similarity of benefits
<LI>Similarity of hours worked
<LI>Type of work performed
<LI>Qualifications, skill, and education required for the position
<LI>Physical proximity of workers and integration of tasks
<LI>Employer's supervisory or organizational structure
<LI>Employee preferences
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Employers' Rights and Obligations during Organizational Drives </STRONG></H3></A>
The Labor-Management Relations Act gives employers substantial freedom to present their views during union organization drives in unwritten, printed, and graphic forms, so long as such dissemination contains no threat of reprisal or promise of benefit. This right to express one's views on unions generally, to criticize a particular union, or to express a preference for one union over another can quickly lead to problems for employers who are unfamiliar with how courts have interpreted the requirement that there be no threat of reprisal.
<P>
It is important that employers realize that their actions will be closely watched during organization drives. An employer should not make unusual wage adjustments, threaten economic reprisals, try to convince employees to sign individual employment agreements, question employees about their union status or activities, or do anything else that could be construed as illegal anti-union activity.
<P>
When a union is soliciting employees to join a union, the employer is prohibited from pressuring employees against joining or discriminating against those who organize or join the union. The NLRB has heard thousands of complaints accusing employers of discriminating against organizing efforts. Although the complaints are necessarily heard on a case-by-case basis, the following are most often found to constitute illegal discrimination against efforts to organize:
<UL>
<LI>Refusing to hire anyone involved in a union
<LI>Failing to recall seasonal workers who join a union
<LI>Discharging or laying off of an employee
<LI>Demoting or transferring an employee to a less desirable job or location
<LI>Mistreating employees following organizing efforts
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Negotiating with a Union </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once the NLRB has certified a union to represent a group of employees, management is required to deal with that union.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>The Duty to Engage in Collective Bargaining </STRONG></H3></A>
The law imposes upon labor and management the obligation to engage in collective bargaining. While neither side is obligated to agree to any particular proposal made by the other side, both labor and management have an obligation to:
<UL>
<LI>Meet at reasonable times
<LI>Confer "in good faith" with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment
<LI>Incorporate into a written contract any agreement reached in oral negotiations
</UL>
If the NLRB has certified a union to represent the employees, the employer must discuss wages and employment conditions with that union. Negotiations usually begin with the union submitting a proposed contract to management, which then submits counter proposals to the union representatives. Employers and employees usually are represented by counsel when entering a collective bargaining agreement.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>The Exclusivity Principle </STRONG></H3></A>
The NLRA contains an exclusivity principle which declares that if the NLRB has recognized a union as the representative of a group of employees or if the employer has privately agreed to so recognize the union, the union has the exclusive right to represent those employees. This exclusivity provision can trip up even well-meaning employers who are not careful to avoid bargaining with other than the union's representatives. Often a problem can develop when an employer is approached by an independent group of employees, acting on their own, bringing to management a specific problem. If he or she attempts to respond to the employee-initiated contact without first going through the union, the employer can run afoul of the NLRA's exclusivity principle.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Strikes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Strikes can be classified four ways -- economic strikes, unfair labor practices strikes, wildcat strikes, and illegal strikes. The law treats each category differently.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Economic Strike </STRONG></H3></A>
An economic strike results when employees strike after a stalemate in negotiations over a contract with management. The NLRA protects workers against unfair labor practices during an economic strike and guarantees that they retain their status as employees during the strike. After an economic strike, an employer may not refuse to re-hire a striker solely because he or she participated in an economic strike.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Unfair Labor Practice Strike </STRONG></H3></A>
An unfair labor practice strike is a strike over an alleged unfair labor practice. Employees who take part in an unfair labor practice strike retain their status as employees. Once the NLRB determines an employer's actions to be an unfair labor practice, employees are entitled to have their old jobs back, even if their employer has hired replacement workers in the interim.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Wildcat Strike </STRONG></H3></A>
A wildcat strike is a strike initiated by a group of employees without sanction of their union. Wildcat strikers are not protected by the provisions of the NLRA and may be permanently fired by their employers.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Illegal Strike </STRONG></H3></A>
A number of categories of strikes are specifically made illegal by the Labor-Management Relations Act, including:
<UL>
<LI>Strikes attempting to force an employer or a self-employed person to join a union
<LI>Strikes attempting to pressure an employer to stop doing business with another person
<LI>Strikes to force an employer to bargain with a minority union after the NLRB has certified a majority union to represent the employees
<LI>Strikes that begin within 60 days preceding the expiration of a labor agreement
</UL>
Employees who participate in an illegal strike lose their status as employees.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Boycotts and Picketing </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Labor Reform Act makes it illegal for a union to go on strike, refuse to work or otherwise threaten an employer if the purpose of its actions is to:
<UL>
<LI>Force the employer not to handle the goods of another employer
<LI>Stop any person from using, handling, selling, or transporting the products of another employer
<LI>Make another employer recognize or bargain with a union, other than a union certified by the NLRB
<LI>Force the employer to bargain with a union when a different union has already been certified by the NLRB
</UL>

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Nonprofit Corporations Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Today, many small organizations are interested in the benefits of tax-exempt, nonprofit status. Forming a tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation is a fairly complex endeavor that requires time, money and an understanding of legal and tax technicalities -- all of which can be scarce in organizations that would most likely benefit from tax-exempt treatment and nonprofit status. Still, the benefits available to nonprofits are so great that it is often worth the time and energy to become familiar with the necessary steps. Some of the rules governing how a nonprofit corporation must be formed and run are complex. An organization will likely need professional advice from an attorney to establish the business, and from an accountant to oversee financial matters when the corporation is in operation. This chapter explores the issues uniquely of concern in forming a nonprofit corporation and the process of gaining tax-exempt status for a nonprofit corporation.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Becoming a Tax-Exempt, Nonprofit Corporation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The process of becoming a tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation actually has two distinct phases, first, creating the nonprofit corporation, then, applying for tax-exempt status for the corporation once it has been created. The chronology of these two phases is important. The second phase -- applying for tax-exempt status -- will be far simpler for organizations that keep that goal in mind during the first phase -- creating the nonprofit corporation.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Benefits of Tax-Exempt, Nonprofit Status </STRONG></H3></A>
The primary benefits of tax-exempt, nonprofit status are financial. All or most of the money made by a tax-exempt, nonprofit corporation is free of federal, state, and local taxes, so the organization can devote a larger share of its funds to the ends for which it was formed rather than turning it over to the government. Furthermore, nonprofit status is often a prerequisite to obtaining private grants or government funding. Donors are more likely to contribute financially to tax-exempt, nonprofits than to non-exempt organizations because donors can write off their donation on their tax returns. In addition to tax benefits, there may be low-cost postage and advertising rates available to nonprofit organizations and many retail stores offer reduced rates to nonprofits and their employees.
<P>
As with all other businesses, nonprofits are open to lawsuits and liability for the way they conduct themselves. Organizing as a nonprofit corporation can shield the individuals who run the organization from personal liability for the debts of their organization.
<P>
The often overlooked advantages of forming a tax-exempt, nonprofit organization are the internal benefits that the organization experiences when forced to commit to writing its management structure and corporate purpose. Many nonprofits start out as a small group of committed persons working toward a definite goal. If the organization grows, commitment levels can fall and goals multiply. Having to think through the organization's purposes and management procedures can bring clarity, focus, and structure at an early stage in the organization's life. These qualities can be invaluable as the organization grows, takes on new projects, and adds new members, or if internal disputes arise.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Drawbacks of Tax-Exempt, Nonprofit Status </STRONG></H3></A>
Just because an organization qualifies for tax-exempt, nonprofit status does not mean that seeking nonprofit status is the best plan. Tax-exempt, nonprofit status does have drawbacks:
<UL>
<LI>Profits of the organization cannot be divided among workers or directors (although workers and directors can be paid reasonable salaries).
<LI>Only a small amount of the group's income can be earned from sources unrelated to the organization's reason for receiving tax-exempt status.
<LI>The assets of the group cannot go toward purposes other than those that warranted the tax-exempt status.
</UL>
Many businesses do not take advantage of tax-exempt, nonprofit status because they prefer the flexibility and possibility of personal financial gain associated with for-profit status. Other organizations that could qualify as nonprofit simply do not incorporate in order to avoid the paperwork. For very small organizations that do not need donations or that have few tax obligations, forming a nonprofit corporation and seeking tax-exempt status may be more trouble than it is worth.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Nonprofit Corporations in Minnesota </STRONG></H3></A>
Most nonprofit corporations in Minnesota are governed by the Minnesota Nonprofit Corporation Act. The Minnesota Nonprofit Corporation Act does not apply to cooperative associations, public cemetery associations and corporations, private cemeteries, and some religious associations. Under the Minnesota Nonprofit Corporation Act, a nonprofit corporation may not be formed for any purpose that involves pecuniary gain, paying dividends or any other pecuniary remuneration, directly or indirectly to its members, other than those members that are nonprofit organizations or subdivisions, units, or agencies of the federal state, or local government. There are many rules to be aware of when forming and running a nonprofit corporation. In addition to the information in this chapter, much of the information in the <A HREF="b29.html">Publicly Held Corporations Law</A> Chapter is equally applicable to nonprofit corporations.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Necessary Documents </STRONG></H4></A>
At the very beginning of the process of forming a nonprofit corporation, there are two documents that a group can use to file for incorporation -- articles of incorporation and bylaws. The articles are the documents filed with the Secretary of State's Office and form the charter document of the corporation. Articles of incorporation must include:
<UL>
<LI>The name of the corporation
<LI>The address of the registered office of the corporation and the name of the registered agent, if any, at that address
<LI>The name and address of each incorporator
<LI>A clear statement that the corporation is organized pursuant to the Minnesota Nonprofit Corporation Act
</UL>
Although the list of required items is short, most articles of incorporation are complex, because incorporators want to craft an organization uniquely suited to the people who form it and the purposes for which it is formed. The Minnesota Nonprofit Corporation Act contains numerous "fallback" provisions detailing how the corporation operates. Some provisions automatically apply unless they are specifically modified in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. Other provisions can only be modified in the articles of incorporation. An attorney experienced in advising nonprofits can help an organization decide how much it wants to alter the "fallback" provisions of the Act and whether it is best to do so in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. Incorporators are charged with signing and delivering the articles of incorporation to the Secretary of State's Office.
<P>
The nonprofit corporation may, but need not, have bylaws. Bylaws usually define the rules and procedures under which the corporation will operate. Bylaws typically include:
<UL>
<LI>The number, qualifications, manner of election, powers, duties, and compensation of directors
<LI>The qualifications for membership
<LI>Different classifications for members
<LI>The manner of admission, withdrawal, suspension, and expulsion of members
<LI>Property, voting, and other rights and privileges of members
<LI>Appointment and authority of committees
<LI>Appointment or election, duties, compensation, and tenure of officers
<LI>Time, place, and manner of calling, conducting, and giving notice of member, board, and committee meetings or of conducting mail ballots
<LI>Making of reports and financial statements to members
<LI>The numbers required to establish a quorum for meetings of members, committees and the board
</UL>
Later, the articles of incorporation and bylaws must be submitted to the IRS when filing for federal tax-exempt status under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, discussed below. In Minnesota, a nonprofit corporation should file bylaws and articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State's Office. All nonprofit corporations in the state are required to file an annual registration with the Secretary of State's Office. The organization must also register with the Charities Division of the Minnesota Attorney General's Office if it solicits donations within the state.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Required Officers </STRONG></H4></A>
Corporations governed by the Minnesota Nonprofit Corporation Act must have at least two officers -- a president and a treasurer -- although the same person can perform both functions. Unless modified by the articles, bylaws, or resolution, the president shall:
<UL>
<LI>	Actively manage the general business of the corporation
<LI>	When present, preside at meetings of the board and member meetings
<LI>	Ensure that orders and resolutions of the board are carried out
<LI>	Sign and deliver deeds, mortgages, bonds, contracts, and other 
instruments pertaining to the business of the corporation
</UL>
Unless the corporation modifies the following requirements in its articles, bylaws, or resolution, the treasurer shall:
<UL>
<LI>Keep accurate financial records for the corporation
<LI>Endorse and/or deposit money, drafts, checks, and notes in the name of the corporation
<LI>Disburse corporate funds in the name of the corporation
<LI>As required, keep the president and board informed of the financial condition of the corporation
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Liability of Officers </STRONG></H4></A>
Incorporating means that a business is considered a legal entity separate from that of its employees and directors, and thus is able to make contracts and incur liability in its own right. But the employees and directors can have legal responsibilities for actions taken on behalf of the corporation.
<P>
Minnesota Statutes require that the director of a nonprofit corporation discharge his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the corporation, and "with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances." A director who performed his or her duties in accord with this standard is not liable by reason of having been a director.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Getting Tax-Exempt Status for a Nonprofit </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A fairly wide variety of businesses and groups can qualify for federal tax-exemption. Some groups such as chambers of commerce, social clubs, and credit unions may be entitled to federal tax-exempt status under very narrowly drawn statutes not discussed here. The most desirable form of tax-exempt status is found in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. This is the most desirable form of tax-exemption because 501(c)(3) corporations are not only exempt from federal, state, and local taxes, but donors to the organization can qualify for tax write-offs for their contributions to the organization.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Nonprofits that Qualify for 501(c)(3) Status </STRONG></H3></A>
There are five different purposes for which the IRS allows organizations to file for tax-exempt status as nonprofit corporations under 501(c)(3) of the tax code. They are:
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Charitable Purpose </STRONG></H4></A>
The term "charitable" here is more broadly defined than in common usage, referring to anything that has benefit for the public. Organizations established for a charitable purpose can be intended to benefit only a relatively small group of people, but not so small that the actual beneficiaries are specifically listed. Examples of charitable purposes include the maintenance of public buildings and relief for the poor.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Religious Group </STRONG></H4></A>
This term is broadly interpreted. "Religious groups" include mainstream organized churches as well as many other organizations that have truly and sincerely held beliefs. The only necessary factor for qualifying as a religious group is that the group be pursuing the advancement of religion. It is more difficult to qualify as a "church" for tax-exempt purposes than it is to qualify as a religious group.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Scientific Organization </STRONG></H4></A>
Groups whose primary purpose is scientific research in the public interest are also eligible for tax-exempt status. Research is considered to be in the public interest if the results are eventually made available to the public.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Literary Purpose </STRONG></H4></A>
Literary purpose is a rarely-used category for filing because most literary organizations that could fit this classification file instead as educational organizations. Generally, groups that sell books that promote the public interest, sell them at or below cost, and make them available to the general public would qualify as groups organized for literary purposes.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Educational Organization </STRONG></H4></A>
Educational organization is another broadly defined filing category in which endeavors that are aimed at self development as well as community benefit are allowed tax-free status for the purpose of education. A person or group may qualify under this purpose to espouse a point of view, provided it is not a political position.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Application for Federal Tax-Exemption </STRONG></H3></A>
There are four publications and forms available from the IRS that should be used to apply for 501(c)(3) tax exemption.
<UL>
<LI>Package 1023
Application for Recognition of Exemption
<LI>Form 8708
User Fee for Exempt Organization Determination Letter Request
<LI>Form ss-4
Application for Employer Identification Number
<LI>Publication 557
</UL>
Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization
Each of these publications is available free of charge and all come with detailed instructions or advice. The IRS will respond to the application in one of three ways -- granting the exemption, requesting further information before making a final decision, or issuing notice of proposed adverse determination. Form 1023 is the nucleus of the application. The 1023 packet includes instructions for responding to a request for further information or notice of proposed adverse determination. If the nonprofit corporation is granted tax-exempt status, the determination letter will summarize the basis for the decision and conditions that must be met to maintain it.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Qualifying for State Tax-Exempt Status </STRONG></H3></A>
In order to receive state tax-exemption, a nonprofit must file a separate application with the Minnesota Department of Revenue. The state decision of whether to grant a nonprofit corporation state tax exemption always follows the IRS decision regarding tax-exempt status, so nonprofits should not apply to the Department of Revenue until they receive an official notification letter from the IRS. The state application, known as M-120, is very simple to complete. Applicants must attach to the M-120 form a copy of their federal exemption application and a copy of the federal determination letter. If granted, the Minnesota exemption will be made retroactive to the date of the federal exemption.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Personal Injury Defense Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Personal injuries, as the name implies, are injuries to an individual person. In contrast, crimes are wrongful acts against society. The government punishes those who commit crimes -- criminals -- with criminal penalties. For personal injuries, the government does not punish the wrongdoer but gives the victim the right to pursue a private, civil lawsuit, called a tort action, against the wrongdoer. Some wrongful acts are both crimes and torts, and can subject the wrongdoer to both criminal penalties imposed by the government and tort remedies sought by the injured party. This chapter outlines the general legal principles courts use to decide most personal injury cases, and gives an overview of the personal injuries that most often lead to lawsuits.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Tort Law Generally </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Most civil suits are determined using theories contained in the law of torts (from the Latin word <STRONG>tortus,</STRONG> meaning twisted). Personal injury lawsuits are usually based on the tort law premise that when someone does something that harms another person either physically, mentally, or financially, the person who suffers the harm ought to be compensated for the loss and the person who caused the loss should pay. Whether a civil lawsuit based on tort law will succeed depends upon the type of tort committed.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Degree of Fault </STRONG></H3></A>
Each of the three kinds of torts -- negligence, intentional misconduct, and strict liability -- has its own degree of fault (not to be confused with the <A HREF="#40">burden of proof</A> , discussed below) that a plaintiff must show in order to collect from a defendant. Proving that someone else was negligent hinges on the following question: Was the party who allegedly caused the injury behaving at least as carefully as a reasonable person would have behaved under the same circumstances? If not, then that party was negligent and has committed the tort of negligence. Examples of negligence include an automobile accident caused by a reckless driver, or a customer falling and being hurt at a store because a store owner did not repair a defective door or an unsafe escalator. If a reasonable person would have driven more prudently, or if a reasonable store owner would have repaired the defective door or unsafe escalator, then the negligent party could be found liable by a judge or jury. Product liability cases often allege negligence. For example, a plaintiff might allege that a reasonable automotive engineer would have known that a particular type of steering system would cause a driver to lose control of a car and thus should have taken steps to redesign the steering system. 
<P>
The outcome of lawsuits alleging negligence can be difficult to predict because guessing how much care a reasonable person would have exercised in the same situation is difficult. The reasonable person standard is vague, imprecise, and apt to be interpreted differently by different people. Often, a practice that seemed reasonable in the past may appear unreasonable with the benefit of hindsight. Finding an attorney who has experience with how juries typically interpret the reasonable person standard is therefore one of the most important steps in successfully defending a personal injury lawsuit alleging that a person acted unreasonably. . 
<P>
Intentional misconduct occurs when someone does something to deliberately hurt another person or damage another person's property. For example, if a manufacturer deliberately sells products it knows to be defective, it is causing harm on purpose. A plaintiff alleging intentional misconduct need not compare the defendant's actions to those of a reasonable person; he or she need only show that the defendant intended his or her actions. In a civil lawsuit alleging intentional misconduct, a plaintiff can recover punitive damages in addition to awards for injuries, pain, and suffering. Punitive damages, designed to punish people or organizations for unlawful acts, are often very large sums of money. Until recently, there were few limits on the amount of money a jury could award as punitive damages. However, federal and state legislatures have recently passed laws putting caps on punitive damage awards in certain types of cases, and judges have long had the authority to reduce many types of punitive damage awards. Still, it is to the plaintiff's advantage to convince a jury that his or her injuries were the result of intentional misconduct rather than negligence. 
<P>
The final theory of tort liability, strict liability, applies only to very dangerous situations. If someone does something extremely dangerous, such as demolish a building, and someone gets hurt as a result, the injured person can sue for damages without having to prove the defendant acted negligently or with intent to cause harm. The principle behind strict liability lawsuits is that some activities are so dangerous that, in exchange for permission to engage in the activity, the actor must assume total responsibility for any results.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Burden of Proof </STRONG></H3></A>
The burden of proof in a tort case, as in most civil law cases, is lower than the proof required in criminal law cases. In a criminal case, the state must prove a person's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. To win a personal injury lawsuit based on tort law, the plaintiff need only demonstrate  that a majority of the evidence shows that an injury was caused by the defendant's tortious actions. The different burdens of proof mean that a company might be acquitted of criminal charges stemming from its actions and still be found liable in a civil lawsuit stemming from the same actions.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Comparative Fault </STRONG></H3></A>
Tort law attempts to compensate victims if their injury is caused by another person. When one person clearly causes all of another person's injury, blame is easy to place. In many other cases, however, the victim's actions help cause the injury or make it worse than it would otherwise be. For instance, a negligent driver might injure a pedestrian who is negligently walking in the street, instead of on a sidewalk where a prudent pedestrian normally walks. A prudent person might be slightly injured when using a defective chain saw, whereas a less prudent person might incur more severe injuries by negligently failing to wear safety goggles while using the chain saw. In these cases, a judge or jury must calculate how much each party is at fault. Each state has its own rules for calculating damages that can be recovered when a victim is at least partially to blame for his or her own injury.
<P>
Minnesota has a comparative fault rule. Under the comparative fault rule, a judge reduces the amount of any damage award by the percent that the victim's own actions contributed to his or her injuries. For example, if a jury finds that a plaintiff suffered $100,000 in damages, but was 30 percent at fault, the judge reduces the damage award by 30 percent, to $70,000. In Minnesota, the reduction is only up to 50 percent. If the victim is more than 50 percent at fault, he or she collects nothing.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Vicarious Liability </STRONG></H3></A>
There are several ways that a business can be held liable for the actions of its employees. All are known as vicarious liability. For example, a company might be held responsible for damage caused by an employee if the company knows that the employee is likely to injure someone and negligently fails to exercise adequate control over the employee. The owner of a vehicle can be held responsible for accidents caused when another person drives the vehicle if the owner negligently entrusts the vehicle to the other driver. Generally however, a business owner is not responsible for acts committed by independent contractors. 
<P>
The most common form of vicarious liability is known by the Latin term, <STRONG>respondeat superior</STRONG> Under respondeat superior, an employer is responsible for torts committed by employees within the scope of their employment. For example, if a pedestrian is struck and injured by a person driving to a party, the victim has a claim against the driver. However, if the pedestrian is hit by a person driving a delivery van for his or her employer, then respondeat superior allows the pedestrian to bring claims against both the driver and the employer. 
<P>
Frequently, personal injury plaintiffs cannot recover anything from the employee because he or she has no money. Because employers usually have more money or better insurance, plaintiffs often focus their recovery efforts on the employers. An employer may have a cause of action against the employee who exposed the company to liability, but such actions are rarely pursued either because the employee has no money or the employer assumes that to do so would create ill will among remaining employees.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Premises Liability </STRONG></H3></A>
Premises liability is an area of tort law that governs the duties owed by landowners to persons on their property. Generally speaking, a landowner is liable for anyone injured on the landowner's property and a jury can award damages to the injured person. However, a landowner may not be liable if he or she had no way of knowing about a hazard that caused an accident. No one is responsible if an accident was truly unavoidable, and, as described above, a plaintiff cannot recover from someone unless the plaintiff can prove fault (strict liability is the only exception to this principle). In general, a landowner is not liable for injuries to a trespasser, although a landowner must take reasonable care to protect persons who are likely to approach a property for legitimate purposes, such as letter carriers or delivery persons. Anyone, even a trespasser, can sue a landowner if he or she is injured by an unjustified hazard on the property, such as a trap designed intentionally to injure people. 
<P>
Under a theory known as "attractive nuisance" a landowner can be liable for injuries to small children if the landlord fails to take preventative action to avoid injuries to children he or she should have known would come onto the property. A swimming pool is a classic example of an attractive nuisance. An apartment complex that maintains a private outdoor swimming pool is obligated to take measures designed to keep out trespassers, such as erecting a fence or having a lifeguard present, because the law assumes that the owner of a pool should know that children will be attracted to a pool despite warning signs. 
<P>
If someone is injured on public land adjacent to a landlord's property, the landlord generally is not legally liable unless he or she did something to cause the injury, such as hitting a passerby with the falling branches of a tree being cut down on the landowner's property. 
<P>
Business owners can always be sued if their own carelessness or negligence causes others to be injured. Historically this meant landowners were not liable for the actions of third parties they did not control. Today, however, business owners can sometimes be liable for injuries caused by third parties committing crimes on their property. An increasing number of crime victims are winning lawsuits filed against business owners who did not, in a jury's opinion, take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of their customers. This type of lawsuit extends the landowner's duty to foresee, and take steps to prevent, possible illegal activity on his or her property. An example of this type of case is one in which a person who is attacked in a parking lot sues the lot's owner for failing to provide security measures that might have prevented the attack. 
<P>
Whether a lawsuit based on premises liability will succeed largely depends on a jury's opinion of whether a reasonable business owner would have foreseen the probability of the crime occurring. For example, if tenants of an apartment building complain several times to their landlord that their security system is not working, and burglars later burglarize several apartments, the tenants might have grounds for a successful lawsuit against their landlord alleging negligence in failing to fix the security system.

<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Product Liability </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A common kind of personal injury lawsuit is one that results from an injury caused by a defective product. Product liability lawsuits require the plaintiff to prove that a product was defective and that the defect was the principal cause of the plaintiff's injury. This section describes the most important principles of law governing product liability cases.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Kinds of Defects </STRONG></H3></A>
Product liability lawsuits typically allege one or more of three kinds of defects -- defective warning, design defect, and manufacturing defect. Often, a single lawsuit will allege all three theories.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Defective Warning </STRONG></H4></A>
A manufacturer has a duty to provide adequate instructions concerning the safe use of its product and must warn buyers of any dangers associated with the product. If such warnings are not present, the manufacturer may be liable for injuries caused by the product. Manufacturers therefore have a duty to perform safety tests to determine what warning labels need to be put on a product. These tests should simulate conditions under which the product would ordinarily be used. For example, the manufacturer of a hand-held electric hair dryer must anticipate that its product might be used above a sink full of water and therefore must warn buyers that dropping the product in water may lead to electrocution. However, a warning label need not be put on an obviously dangerous product, such as a kitchen knife. 
<P>
Included in the duty to warn is a duty to provide post sale information. Under Minnesota law, manufacturers must warn consumers of hazards associated with a product discovered after a product has been sold. A manufacturer may also be required to recall products in which defects have been discovered and to redesign the products to make them safe. In Minnesota, these are continual obligations of manufacturers. In other words, a manufacturer must warn consumers about, and possibly recall, an unsafe product, even if the manufacturer stopped making it many years ago.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Design Defect </STRONG></H4></A>
Sometimes products are built exactly as designed, but are dangerous because of poor engineering, inadequate testing or poor choice of construction materials. A manufacturer is negligent if it fails to take reasonable care to ensure that a product is designed to perform safely. Not only must companies make sure their products are safe when they are used in the intended way, but also in unintended, though foreseeable, ways. If a manufacturer cannot eliminate a danger from a product, or install a guard to protect a user from the danger, then the manufacturer must warn the user of the danger. Most product liability cases attempt to prove that a design defect caused an injury.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Manufacturing Defect </STRONG></H4></A>
This type of defect occurs when a product is designed well, but through a flaw in the manufacturing process, fails to meet the specifications contained in the design. For example, even if a motorcycle manufacturer ordinarily makes a well-designed gasoline tank for its motorcycles, if it makes a leaking one that causes a fire, then the manufacturer could be liable for injuries caused by that defect.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Types of Product Liability Claims </STRONG></H3></A>
Most often, product liability lawsuits are brought under one or more of three theories -- strict liability, negligence, and wrongful death. Knowing which theory a plaintiff is pursuing in a particular case is important because each theory applies different standards and has a different statute of limitations.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Strict Liability </STRONG></H4></A>
Strict liability holds a manufacturer liable for injuries sustained by a person using its product, if the product is found to be unreasonably dangerous. Under Minnesota law, a plaintiff pursuing a claim for strict liability must prove that a product was defective and unreasonably dangerous, that the defect was present while the product was still in the manufacturer's control, and that the defect was the cause of the injury. The statute of limitations in Minnesota for product liability lawsuits based on strict liability is four years from the date of the injury.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Negligence </STRONG></H4></A>
Product liability lawsuits can allege negligence when a manufacturer fails to exercise the care that would be exercised by a reasonable manufacturer in the same or similar situation. Whereas strict liability focuses on the manufactured product, negligence theory focuses on the conduct of the manufacturer. A manufacturer who implements very strict production controls designed to ensure that products are made properly may be able to avoid committing a negligence tort because all due care was taken that reasonably could be expected. 
<P>
Minnesota, like some other states, has laws that under certain conditions allow a plaintiff to collect damages from companies that distribute or sell defective products, even if the company did not design, test, or manufacture the product. If distributors or sellers knew that a product was defective but did nothing to keep it from reaching consumers, they could be held liable for damages. In addition, a distributor who damages a product can be held liable for any injuries this causes, and a retailer who incorrectly assembles or installs a product can also be sued. The statute of limitations in Minnesota for product liability lawsuits based on negligence is six years from the date of the injury.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Wrongful Death </STRONG></H4></A>
A wrongful death lawsuit is usually a lawsuit filed by the surviving relatives of a person killed by a defective product. Although a wrongful death lawsuit can be filed in other types of personal injury cases such as automobile accidents, it is most often associated with product liability cases. Under Minnesota law, any dependent heirs such as sons or daughters of a person killed by a defective product can sue the manufacturer for that person's future income that was lost when he or she died. Surviving relatives cannot, however, sue a manufacturer to collect damages for the pain and suffering of a person wrongfully killed by a manufacturer's defective product. However, the estate of the dead person can sue to collect money needed to pay any bills for medical treatment received by the person before he or she died. 
<P>
A person who files a wrongful death lawsuit after the death of a spouse can sue for damages to recover for loss of companionship, affection, and sexual relations. Minnesota also has a fetal protection law that allows wrongful death lawsuits to be filed if a manufacturer's defective product (or a car accident) causes the death of a viable fetus, that is, one that would be capable of surviving outside the mother's womb.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="170"><H2><STRONG>Dram Shop Laws </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Dram shop laws are laws that can make a business owner liable for injuries caused by an intoxicated person if the business is responsible for causing that person to become intoxicated illegally. The Minnesota Dram Shop Act allows a spouse, child, parent, guardian, or employer of the intoxicated person, or any other person injured by the intoxicated person, to bring a civil action for damages against the party that caused the intoxication by illegally selling alcoholic beverages. Cases most commonly brought under the Act allege illegal sale of alcohol to minors or sale of alcohol to persons who were obviously intoxicated at the time of sale. 
<P>
The only defense specifically permitted by the Act is that the business establishment reasonably and in good faith relied upon proof of age offered by the person who subsequently became intoxicated. The law states that the only proofs of age sufficient for a business owner to rely upon this defense are:
<UL>
<LI>A valid driver's license or identification card issued by any state or Canadian province
<LI>A valid military identification card issued by the United States Department of Defense
<LI>In the case of a foreign national (from any nation other than Canada), a valid passport
</UL>
Thus, businesses licensed to serve alcohol can limit their exposure to liability under the Minnesota Dram Shop Act by implementing programs designed to train employees when to refuse to serve alcohol and preventing the illegal sale of alcohol to minors by insisting upon proof of age from the above list.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Workers' Compensation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Like many other states, Minnesota has a Workers' Compensation system to compensate workers for any injuries occurring in the workplace. Without a Workers' Compensation system, workers injured while on the job would have to prove that their employer's negligence led to the injury. Because the system does not require proof of negligence, anyone injured while working for an employer subject to the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Act (only a few employers are exempt) has a greater chance of being compensated than if he or she were injured in some other way and had to file a civil lawsuit. Instead of filing suit, a worker notifies his or her employer of the injury, and the employer then contacts its insurance carrier, which handles payment of any medical bills and other claims made by the employee. All employers subject to the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Act must either carry Workers' Compensation insurance or demonstrate that they have the financial resources to cover any reasonably anticipated claims. 
<P>
The Workers' Compensation system operates under rules substantially different from those used to settle other types of personal injury claims. For this reason, many lawyers specialize in handling only Workers' Compensation disputes, while other lawyers who routinely do personal injury work never handle Workers' Compensation claims. 
<P>
Under the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Act an injured employee may be eligible for some or all of the following:
<UL>
<LI>Medical services, including all reasonable expenses for care and treatment
<LI>Temporary total disability payments, which provide the employee with as much as two-thirds of his or her weekly wage for the time the worker is unable to work
<LI>Temporary partial disability for employees who are able to work part-time but not able to earn the same amount of money as earned at the time the injury happened
<LI>Permanent partial disability if the employee is permanently disabled
<LI>Permanent total disability payments (as high as two-thirds the salary of the worker at the time of the injury) for employees who are totally disabled and unable to work again
<LI>Death benefits (for some burial expenses and benefits to dependents of the deceased employee) in case of fatal work-related injuries
</UL>
In return for this relatively easy route to compensation, there is a limit to the amount of money that can be awarded for a work-related injury. For example, employers (or their insurers) are only required to pay for medical expenses, permanent injuries, and/or lost wages. An employer cannot be made to pay for emotional distress, pain and suffering, and loss of companionship, affection, or sexual relations. There are only a few exceptions to these limits on an employer's liability for a work-related injury; the limits generally apply even if an employer's negligence caused the injury.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Settling Workers' Compensation Disputes </STRONG></H3></A>
Often a worker contacts an attorney because the employer or its insurance carrier refuses to pay a Workers' Compensation claim, maintaining that either the injury was not work-related or that the benefits demanded exceed those that are justified for the injury. Sometimes a dispute arises over when an employer stops making Workers' Compensation payments. When a dispute arises, a variety of options exist to settle it, including an administrative conference, conciliation court, or as a final option, a hearing before a Workers' Compensation judge. 
<P>
By far the most common way to resolve disputes is through a semiformal administrative conference subject to the rules established by the state's Department of Labor and Industry. At the conference, a Department representative acts as an informal mediator and referee who decides what kind of evidence can be discussed by those attending. These rules are very liberal, meaning that almost all applicable evidence can be discussed. Typically, the employer, an investigator from the insurance company (if the employer is not self-insured), the Department representative, the injured employee and the employee's attorney (if one has been hired) attend the conference. The goal of such a conference is to reach a voluntary resolution to the dispute, but if one cannot be reached, the Department representative will make a judgment that everyone is obliged to follow. Such a judgment can be appealed to the Department by anyone involved in the conference. 
<P>
Going to conciliation court is another way to resolve disputes over a Workers' Compensation claim. Both the employer and employee, however, must agree to turn over the dispute to a conciliation court and the amount of the dispute cannot exceed $5000. Either side can decide whether to be represented by an attorney in such a proceeding, a decision that should not be made lightly because the decision of the conciliation court judge cannot be appealed. 
<P>
Finally, a dispute over a Workers' Compensation claim can be taken to a special Workers' Compensation court where a judge will formally hear evidence about the injury and will resolve the dispute in a written decision that both sides must follow. Anyone disagreeing with the decision can appeal it to the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals, and if still unsatisfied, to the Minnesota Supreme Court. 
<P>
Which of the three ways is best to resolve a Workers' Compensation dispute depends on the particular details surrounding the injury and the amount of money involved. In general, the administrative conference can be the best and least expensive way to solve a dispute, but only if employer and employee are willing to negotiate fairly and compromise if necessary. Both the administrative conference and conciliation court are options that can be pursued without lawyers, and therefore either may be a relatively inexpensive option.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Hiring and Workers' Compensation </STRONG></H3></A>
It is illegal for an employer to refuse to hire an individual because he or she has a disabling condition from a prior injury. However, employers are protected from some Workers' Compensation liability if an employee is hired with a pre-existing condition. If an employee suffers an injury that is made worse because of a condition existing prior to the time of hiring, the employer is protected from some liability under the Minnesota Second Injury Law. The purpose of this law is to encourage employers to hire people who may have disabilities from a previous injury.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Probate, Estate Planning &amp; Trusts Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Although no one likes to think about dying, there are good reasons to prepare for this inevitable event by setting up a plan to distribute one's estate after death. A person's estate consists of all his or her property and possessions, and includes bank accounts, real estate, furniture, automobiles, stocks, bonds, life insurance policies, retirement funds, pensions, and death benefits. If a person plans well, his or her estate can often be passed on after death quickly, easily, and subject to fewer taxes. This chapter discusses the most common estate planning tools -- wills and trusts -- and gives special attention to the interests of business owners. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Wills </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A will is the most common document used to specify how an estate should be handled after death. Anyone designated to receive property under a will (or trust) is called a beneficiary. A will can be simple or elaborate, depending upon the size of the estate and the wishes of the person who makes it -- the testator. Many types of post-death instructions can be described in a will. A will can describe who should receive specific items of furniture, artwork, or jewelry. A will can name a guardian who will take care of minor children should there be no surviving parent. A will can disinherit a child if the testator does not want the child to receive any part of the estate. The options for what a person can do with a will are varied but limited. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Requirements for a Valid Will </STRONG></H3></A>
Each state sets slightly different formal requirements for the creation of a legal will. In Minnesota, a person must be at least 18 years old in order to make a legal will. In addition, he or she must be of sound mind, which means that the individual has no mental disability that prevents him or her from understanding the full nature of the document he or she signs. In Minnesota, a will must be in writing and must be witnessed and signed by at least two other people. A handwritten will, often called a holographic will, is valid in Minnesota provided that it is witnessed and signed by two people. Individuals must sign their own wills, but if they are illiterate or otherwise incapacitated, they can direct another person, in the presence of witnesses, to sign for them. A will is valid until it is revoked or superseded by a new will. Individual provisions can be changed by a codicil, which is described in the section, <A HREF="#80">Changing and Updating Wills</A>. 
<P>
It is not necessary to hire an attorney to create a will. A non-attorney can create a will, but he or she must pay close attention to the details outlined above. Smaller estates can be described simply, and making a will to disperse a smaller estate can be done by almost anyone. The simplest will in history ever to be declared valid by a court contained only three words: "All to wife." However, a lawyer's guidance is very helpful with complicated property holdings or an estate with many assets, especially if they are located in several different places. Small business owners need the advice of an experienced attorney to transfer their assets. In these cases, an attorney's help can ensure that the transfer of property described in the will is done in a way that minimizes the survivor's tax liability. In addition, a complicated estate may require documents other than a will, such as a trust agreement, to ensure that all of a person's wishes are carried out. 
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Personal Representative </STRONG></H3></A>
A will typically appoints someone called a personal representative to carry out the specific wishes of the person who has died -- the decedent. The personal representative should be a trusted friend or family member who should be made fully aware of his or her duties before the decedent dies. A personal representative must do many things, including collecting and managing the decedent's assets, collecting any money owed at the time of death, selling any assets, if necessary, to pay estate taxes or expenses, and filing all required tax returns. Because a personal representative is allowed to charge a fee for doing this work, choosing a friend or family member who is also a beneficiary to fill this role may be a good choice, as he or she may not charge the full amount allowed by law. To ensure that one's estate has a personal representative chosen by the decedent, it is wise to name one or more contingent personal representatives who can take over the responsibilities of the primary personal representative if the primary personal representative is unable to assume the responsibilities of the position. 
<P>
If a person does not name a personal representative in his or her will, state law establishes the order in which a probate court appoints relatives to act as personal representative. If none of these family members agree to be the personal representative, the probate division of the district court may appoint a professional administrator to do the job.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Appointing a Guardian for Children </STRONG></H3></A>
A person with minor or dependent children can name in a will a guardian to care for those children should there be no surviving parent. If a person fails to name someone to assume the role of guardian, the probate court appoints someone. The person chosen by the court will usually be a close relative or friend, but it may not be the person the parent would have chosen. As with the selection of a personal representative, it is important that the potential guardian understands the provisions of the will and is willing to accept the responsibilities of being a guardian. Also, it is wise to name an alternate guardian should the primary guardian be unable to accept the responsibility. Of course, the selection of a guardian for children is likely to influence how the parent wants to distribute his or her property. Otherwise, a decedent's money might go to one person while his or her children go to another person. The parent may want to give property to someone only if the recipient accepts guardianship of a child. In this way, the guardian is given the financial resources to care for the child.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Planning for Incapacity </STRONG></H3></A>
People drafting wills often use the opportunity to plan for the possibility of their own incapacity. By preparing a document called a durable power of attorney, they can give another person of their choosing full legal authority to act on their behalf should they become unable to handle their personal and financial affairs. Without a durable power of attorney, a person's family might need to go to court to have someone appointed to handle the person's legal affairs. If a power of attorney is made part of the will, it is essential that the will be made known to family members before the testator becomes incapacitated. If a will is kept secret, locked away in a safe deposit box until a person dies, it will be too late for the power of attorney provisions to be useful. 
<P>
Some people also use a document called a durable power of attorney for health care to make health care decisions in advance should they subsequently become incapacitated. 
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Restrictions on Wills </STRONG></H3></A>
In order to protect spouses and dependent children, some laws prevent a person from disinheriting a spouse or child. A married person cannot completely disinherit his or her spouse without the spouse's consent. Occasionally this happens through a prenuptial agreement, for example, in which a second spouse agrees that an entire estate will go to children from a first marriage. In the absence of a contrary agreement, a surviving spouse has the right of election, which allows him or her to take a portion of the spouse's estate. This is used when a spouse is unhappy with the provisions of a will. A person may legally disinherit a child by clearly specifying in a will that the child not receive any of the estate. 
<P>
There are other limits to a will. Anything owned in joint tenancy with another person will go to the surviving joint tenant. Arrangements must be made to end the joint tenancy before death if one joint tenant does not want the other to inherit the jointly held property. Because there may be significant tax consequences in doing so, these changes should be made only after consulting an attorney. Other possessions are not considered part of the estate because they are already promised to someone else. For example, a testator cannot specify in a will that someone other than the beneficiary of a life insurance policy gets the benefits described in that policy. However, a person can designate his or her estate as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. In this case, the money from the policy will be added to other estate assets and will be distributed according to the will. Similarly, the money from a retirement plan goes to the persons named on the plan, regardless of whether they are beneficiaries in a will. Laws designed to uphold public policy also limit what can be done with a person's assets after death. For example, conditions in a will encouraging someone to do something illegal or immoral in order to inherit money or property would not be enforced.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Changing and Updating Wills </STRONG></H3></A>
The provisions of a will are valid until they are changed, revoked, destroyed, or invalidated by the writing of a new will. Changes or additions to a will can be included in a document called a codicil. Codicils must be written, signed, and witnessed in the same way as a will. Wills cannot be changed simply by crossing out existing language or writing in new provisions. In order to avoid making a new will or codicil each time a person's possessions change, a will can specify that personal property is to be distributed according to instructions outlined in a separate document. A person can then revise the separate document as often as necessary, without observing all of the formalities required to change the will itself. 
<P>
If someone dies with a will that is not up-to-date, people may not be provided for adequately. For example, a person chosen to be a personal representative or guardian may have died or fallen out of favor with the author of the will, or a favorite charity may no longer be in existence. A significant amount of case law has dealt with how a probate court is to proceed with a will that has become unenforceable because of changed circumstances. These headaches can be avoided if a will is reviewed at least every two years and revised for major changes in tax laws or for personal events such as births, deaths, marriages, divorces, or significant changes in the size of the estate. It is also a good idea to review a will if its author moves to another state, because the new state of residency may have different inheritance and tax laws. In Minnesota, a divorce automatically revokes any distribution to the former spouse.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>The Right of Election </STRONG></H3></A>
As discussed previously, Minnesota's probate code protects surviving spouses from being entirely disinherited by a decedent spouse. A surviving spouse who is unsatisfied with his or her portion under an otherwise valid will is allowed to exercise the right of election and take one-third of the decedent's estate. Thus, the one-third portion is the minimum amount a surviving spouse may receive. A will can give more to the surviving spouse, but if it gives less, the surviving spouse can simply elect to forego his or her share under the will in favor of this statutorily guaranteed one-third share.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Dying Without a Will </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
If a person does not have a will or has not adequately planned for the distribution of his or her estate at death, survivors can face a complicated, time-consuming, and costly process. Often survivors wind up having to pay more taxes on their inheritance than they would have paid had there been a will or other estate planning tool. To provide for surviving friends and relatives, or to support favorite causes or charities, a person can plan for the distribution of his or her estate after death. With planning, an estate can be distributed as fairly as possible with as little tax burden as legally allowed. 
<P>
When a decedent leaves no will or other comparable estate planning tool, he or she is said to have died intestate. The division of the state district court system set up to handle wills and trusts is called the probate division. When a person dies intestate, the probate division steps in to divide the decedent's estate, according to a formula known as the state inheritance laws. Under the state inheritance laws, the probate division uses formulas set by the legislature to divide a deceased person's possessions among any surviving relatives. 
<P>
A probate division applying the state inheritance laws first deducts from the estate funeral expenses, any unpaid medical bills, taxes, family allowance expenses, and any other debts owed. If the decedent has a surviving spouse and no children, the entire estate, after these deductions, goes to the spouse. If there are children, and the family home was not held in joint tenancy, the surviving spouse receives the right to the homestead for his or her life, known as a life estate, and a portion of the remaining estate. Surviving children receive whatever is left of the estate after the spouse's share is deducted, and they inherit the homestead when the surviving spouse dies. In the absence of a will, a surviving spouse with at least one child generally receives a life estate in the homestead, the first $70,000 of the estate, plus one-half of the amount remaining after the first $70,000 is deducted. The other one-half of the estate is divided equally among the decedent's children. If one of the decedent's children dies before the decedent, that child's share passes to his or her living descendants, if any. Anyone entitled to inherit a portion of an intestate decedent's estate is known as an heir. 
<P>
One problem with relying on a probate division applying state inheritance laws to distribute one's estate is that it may not distribute the estate in the manner the decedent would have wanted. State inheritance laws only recognize relatives. The inheritance laws never permit the probate division to support a decedent's close friend, lover, or favorite charities. If no relatives are found, the estate goes to the state. Clearly, for most people writing a will or creating a trust is advisable.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Trusts </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A trust is another frequently used estate planning device that manages the distribution of a person's estate.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Mechanics of a Trust </STRONG></H3></A>
To create a trust, the owner of property (grantor) transfers the property to a person or institution (trustee) who holds legal title to the property and manages it for the benefit of a third party (beneficiary). The grantor can name himself or herself or another person as the trustee. A trust can be either a testamentary trust or a living trust. A testamentary trust transfers the property to the trust only after the death of the grantor. A living trust, sometimes called an inter vivos trust, is created during the life of the grantor and can be set up to continue after the grantor's death or to terminate and be distributed upon the grantor's death. 
<P>
Unlike a will, which in some cases can be drafted without the help of an attorney, a person should never draft a trust without the aid of a lawyer. Many complex laws regulate trusts depending on the size and composition of the estate. Trusts must be carefully structured if they are to take advantage of beneficial tax treatment. An experienced attorney should always assist in drafting a trust so that it is valid, meets the needs of the estate, and does not conflict with any previously drafted will.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Advantages and Disadvantages of a Trust </STRONG></H3></A>
Trusts have many advantages over wills. The advantages depend on whether a living trust or testamentary trust is chosen. All trusts have the advantage of allowing the grantor to determine who receives the benefit of the money, when they receive it, and what conditions must be met. If a spouse is unable or unwilling to manage assets, if children are minors or unable to handle money responsibly, or if a beneficiary is disabled, creating a trust can be a better way of passing on assets. Living and testamentary trusts are an especially popular way of providing for beneficiaries' future educational or medical costs. 
<P>
Some advantages are particular to living trusts. First, a living trust can give its grantor substantial tax advantages. Second, possessions held in a living trust are not subject to estate administration by the probate division after the grantor dies. Survivors do not have to reveal the details of any possessions held in trust through the public filing process that takes place during probate. In addition, if the grantor owns real estate in another state, establishing a living trust for the title to that property may allow survivors to avoid probate in the other state. A living trust can free the grantor from the burden of overseeing his or her financial affairs because a trustee manages all the assets of a living trust. More importantly, a living trust allows a trustee to manage the trust funds in the event that its creator becomes incapacitated or mentally or physically unable to oversee his or her possessions. If a living trust contains all of a person's assets, then he or she may not need a will, and his or her survivors may be able to avoid probate. If only part of a person's possessions are held in living trust, then a will is necessary to distribute those items in the estate not placed into a trust. However, a pour-over provision in a will can place any possessions remaining upon death into a pre-existing living trust. 
<P>
The primary disadvantage of a living trust is that it involves the loss of some flexibility and control over one's assets. Unlike wills, which become effective only at death, a living trust becomes effective immediately upon its creation. For the person who wants to retain unrestricted control over his or her estate, a will or a testamentary trust is a better estate planning tool because it can be changed at any time prior to death. 
<P>
The primary advantage of a testamentary trust is that it allows the grantor to retain unrestricted control over his or her estate. A testamentary trust becomes effective only upon the death of its grantor. Like a will, a testamentary trust can be changed at any time prior to death.
The primary disadvantage to testamentary trusts is that they do not take advantage of the beneficial tax treatment given to living trusts. Because a testamentary trust only takes effect when the grantor dies, the grantor cannot enjoy any tax advantage during his or her life. Also, most testamentary trusts must go through probate.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Revocable and Irrevocable Trusts </STRONG></H3></A>
A living trust can be either revocable or irrevocable. As implied by their names, a revocable trust can be changed or revoked after its creation, while a person signing an irrevocable trust gives up the right to change or revoke the trust. Revocable trusts are quite often devised to supplement a will and/or to name someone to handle the grantor's affairs should the grantor become incapacitated. A trust usually must be made irrevocable if the grantor wants to avoid income or estate taxes. Tax authorities consider the grantor of a revocable trust to be the owner of the property because he or she still controls the property. For this reason, income from assets held in a revocable trust must be reported as income to the grantor for income tax purposes. At the death of the grantor, property in a revocable trust is included in the estate for calculating estate taxes. 
<P>
Irrevocable trusts are often designed to be the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. Such a life insurance trust can also spell out how the policy's money is distributed to survivors. In addition, irrevocable trusts are often set up to manage money given to minors and to charities. Finally, an irrevocable trust can be used to transfer assets to another person in the event that the grantor requires expensive medical care. Although doing so may protect the grantor's family by ensuring that the cost of medical care does not wipe out the family fortune, it may also make the grantor ineligible to receive federal and state Medical Assistance. State law prohibits the beneficiary of a trust fund from receiving public assistance or public health care benefits. However, the 1993 Minnesota Legislature passed a law permitting disabled people to receive supplemental needs trusts without jeopardizing their public assistance status. These trusts must be designed to meet the special needs of disabled people that are not met by public assistance benefits; therefore, one should only create this kind of trust after consulting with an attorney.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Probate </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
With few exceptions, the estate of a person who dies owning property in his or her name cannot be legally distributed without first going through probate. Only if all of a decedent's property is held in joint tenancy or in trust can survivors avoid probate. Probate can operate either formally, with court supervision, or informally, without court supervision. Whether formal or informal, the first duty of the probate division is to determine whether the decedent left a valid will. If the decedent left a valid will, the division oversees the process of settling the estate according to the terms of the will. If the decedent did not leave a will or if the probate division determines the will is invalid, the probate division applies the state inheritance laws, described earlier, to the estate. 
<P>
Informal probate is designed for estates in which court supervision or adjudication is not required because the estate has no uncertainties, legal disputes, or complex administrative requirements. A personal representative can apply for informal probate and become personally responsible for probating the estate completely, correctly, in accordance with state statutes, and promptly. Most personal representatives engage an attorney to handle at least a portion of their duties even with informal probate. 
<P>
When the probate division formally supervises distribution, its responsibilities may include:
<UL>
<LI>Overseeing the distribution of estate assets, including payment of state and federal taxes
<LI>Hearing any contested claims by creditors or others seeking to collect from the estate
<LI>Choosing a personal representative when one is not named in the will
<LI>Supervising the actions of the personal representative, including the payment of state and federal taxes
<LI>Ensuring that the personal representative posts a surety bond to protect creditors and others in the event that the executor acts improperly
<LI>Deciding which possessions are subject to estate administration and which are not
<LI>Determining a decedent's true heirs
<LI>Ruling on the legitimacy of any claims outstanding against the estate
<LI>Supervising the transfer of assets to beneficiaries named in the will
<LI>Overseeing a guardian's use of property placed in trust for the benefit of children or dependents
</UL>
Making out a will does not guarantee that survivors can avoid all problems of distribution, but a carefully drafted will can mean that their time in court is minimized.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>Avoiding Death Taxes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A carefully created estate plan can considerably reduce the tax burden on an estate. Although the state of Minnesota no longer has an inheritance tax, under Minnesota and federal law a decedent with an estate worth more than $600,000 must file an estate tax return and possibly pay federal and Minnesota estate taxes. The federal government's inheritance tax scheme is quite complicated. Under federal tax law a person is allowed to leave $600,000 tax-free to one or more individuals, other than a surviving spouse. The surviving spouse is entitled to receive an unlimited amount tax-free. If the estate is a very large one, however, and the entire estate is left to the surviving spouse, that surviving spouse may lose the option of giving $600,000 tax-free to individuals of his or her own choosing. An experienced tax attorney can create trusts that will allow the two spouses to pass on a total of $1,200,000 free of unnecessary estate taxes. Regardless of whether the recipient pays state or federal estate taxes, there may be income tax consequences for the recipients under a will.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="170"><H2><STRONG>Concerns for Owners of Closely Held Businesses </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Closely held businesses present unique challenges to the person planning for his or her estate. Often a businessperson's interest in a closely held business is his or her primary source of income and constitutes the bulk of his or her wealth. Because interests in a closely held business often lack liquidity and are difficult to value, transferring them before or after death can be difficult and determining the taxes owed can be time consuming. 
<P>
Only an attorney experienced in estate planning for owners of closely held businesses can adequately advise on all aspects of treating closely held business assets. Before an attorney can prepare a will or trust, however, the person with an interest in a closely held business must consider his or her own need for income until death, the likelihood that someone in the family will want to continue playing an active role in the business, and the ability of a recipient to pay death taxes and administration costs if the business is going to continue after the owner's death. 
<P>
Some common options chosen by small business owners include partner buyout agreements, gift-leaseback arrangements, life insurance policies, incorporation, or selling the business. In a partner buyout agreement, partners can agree that a surviving partner will buy the interest of a decedent at a price agreed upon in advance. Partner buyout agreements are common but they need to be updated periodically as the value of the business changes. Under a gift-leaseback arrangement, substantial assets are put in trust for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries then leased back to the business. The primary benefit of a gift-leaseback arrangement is that the beneficiary receives financial support but business operations cannot be disrupted. Life insurance policies can provide a recipient with sufficient cash to pay taxes and administration costs without having to sell the business. Incorporating often makes it easier to value the business. 
<P>
Selling the business may seem drastic, but doing so can mean the recipient receives more money. Many small business owners feel strong emotional attachment to businesses they have grown from scratch. Often emotional attachments lead an owner to refuse to sell a business and the family has to sell it later in order to pay off bills or because no one is capable of managing the business. Accepting the need to sell a business while its owner is still alive can be wise because the owner has time to find a suitable buyer. In addition the business is likely to fetch a higher price because its current owners can offer to oversee the transition to new ownership.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Professional Malpractice Defense Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Professional malpractice occurs whenever a professional performs his or her duties improperly or unethically out of ignorance, carelessness, or intentional misconduct. Professional malpractice is a subcategory of tort law. The <A HREF="b26.html">Personal Injury Defense Law</A> chapter examines several key tort law concepts that arise in general personal injury tort litigation, but because professional malpractice lawsuits raise a number of distinct issues, professional malpractice deserves its own chapter. This chapter examines some of the issues involved in professional malpractice suits arising in the medical, legal, engineering, architecture, and accounting professions. It is important to note that professional malpractice is only one way in which professionals can incur liability for their job-related actions. A doctor can be sued for breach of contract if he or she backs out of an agreement to work for a hospital. A nurse might be sued for assault and battery if he or she intentionally harms another person with an improper injection. 
<P>
Medical malpractice comprises the majority of professional malpractice lawsuits brought in this country. This is not to say that medical professionals are more prone to committing malpractice. Rather, historical and social factors have made it easier to sue doctors than other professionals, so most case law in the professional malpractice arena stems from medical mishaps. As it has become easier and more common to sue other professionals for malpractice, many of the concepts developed in medical malpractice lawsuits are being adopted for use in other professional malpractice lawsuits. Thus, many key concepts in the professional malpractice arena are explained using medical examples. A good understanding of how medical malpractice lawsuits proceed can help one predict how other professional malpractice lawsuits are likely to be decided.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Medical Malpractice </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
"Medical malpractice" does not apply only to medical doctors; other health care providers are frequently sued for medical malpractice. Psychologists, dentists, and nurses are just a few of the numerous types of health care professionals who can be sued for medical malpractice.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Defending Against Medical Malpractice </STRONG></H3></A>
A key to understanding any medical malpractice lawsuit is comprehending the elements of malpractice. Under Minnesota law a person makes out a prima facie case of medical malpractice by establishing four elements -- duty owed to the patient, breach of the standard of care, causation of harm, and damages to the patient. A party accused of medical malpractice can defend itself either by showing that one of these elements is missing and/or by establishing an affirmative defense. An affirmative defense is a legal argument that admits the existence of all required elements, but nonetheless excuses the actions of the medical professional.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Duty Toward the Patient </STRONG></H4></A>
The first element in any medical malpractice lawsuit is that of a duty owed to the patient. Without a legal duty to act, a medical professional can stand by doing nothing while a person suffers, and still not commit malpractice. Thus, the first question to address in a medical malpractice lawsuit is whether the medical professional had any duty at all to the plaintiff. 
<P>
Often this question is easily answered. When a patient goes to a doctor with a problem and the doctor agrees to treat the patient, the two have entered into a contract and the doctor has a duty to treat the patient. By agreeing to diagnose or treat a patient the doctor has indicated that he or she has the appropriate training and skill to adequately care for the patient and has assumed a duty toward the patient. 
<P>
Cases in which the duty owed a patient is contested generally arise in the context of a doctor who has done nothing toward the patient (nonfeasance), rather than having done something incorrectly (malfeasance). Historically, in the American system of jurisprudence, a person generally had no affirmative duty to help others, absent some special relationship between the two parties. A doctor dining out at a restaurant had no general duty to help someone experiencing a heart attack. The doctor could continue his or her meal and do nothing to help the heart attack victim because the law imposed no duty to act in this circumstance. If, however, the person having the heart attack was the doctor's child the law did impose a duty to act because of the parent-child relationship. Despite the apparent callousness of this rule, it remains the law in most states. 
<P>
Minnesota has altered this rule, but only slightly, with the Minnesota Good Samaritan Law. Under the Good Samaritan Law, any person at the scene of an emergency who knows that another person is exposed to or has suffered grave physical harm must, to the extent he or she can do so without risk to self or others, give reasonable assistance to the exposed person. The person who violates this law is guilty only of a petty misdemeanor. Under the Good Samaritan Law, any person who, without compensation or the expectation of compensation, renders emergency assistance, care, or advice at the scene of an emergency or during transit to an emergency medical care center, is insulated from liability for acts or omissions in rendering that care unless he or she acts in a willful, wanton, or reckless manner in providing the assistance, care, or advice. 
<P>
Once a person has begun to help another person, the law does impose a continuing duty to help the injured person if ceasing aid would cause harm to the injured person. Thus, if a doctor at a restaurant rushes to help the victim of a heart attack, he or she may have a duty to continue to aid the patient. 
<P>
An important area of medical malpractice law receiving increased attention in the courts deals with the circumstances under which a doctor owes a duty to persons other than the patient. In some situations, the doctor may owe a duty to persons other than those who undergo his or her treatment. For example, a pedestrian injured when an automobile driver suffers an epileptic seizure while driving might charge that the driver's doctor violated a duty to the general public by failing to properly diagnose the driver's epileptic condition. The victim of a domestic assault might charge that the perpetrator's psychiatrist had a duty to warn the victim of the patient's unstable condition. Under Minnesota law a psychologist, nurse, or chemical dependency worker licensed by the state must make reasonable efforts to communicate any serious specific threats to a potential victim if the practitioner has reason to believe his or her patient is capable of carrying out the threat.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Breach of the Standard of Care Owed to the Patient </STRONG></H4></A>
Medical malpractice results if the doctor injures his or her patient by using less skill and care than a reasonably competent doctor would use in diagnosing or treating the same condition. In order to avoid liability for medical malpractice, a physician must -- at a minimum -- use the same level of care that any other reasonably competent doctor would use under the same circumstances. In most cases, a plaintiff must present expert testimony on what the standard of care should have been. Medical malpractice lawsuits often become battles where each side has expert witnesses declaring wildly different levels of acceptable medical standards. 
<P>
In practice, a doctor is not considered a reasonably competent doctor if he or she does not keep abreast of current, commonly accepted methods of treatments or uses outmoded methods. However, if there are two or more commonly accepted methods of treatment, a doctor is free to use whichever he or she chooses, so long as the method is accepted by a substantial number of physicians. 
<P>
A doctor who clearly disregards well-established medical standards or who attempts to perform medical procedures clearly beyond his or her capabilities is not using the same level of care that a reasonably competent physician would use. Anyone injured by such a careless doctor can sue for medical malpractice and would almost certainly recover damages from his or her doctor. 
<P>
When examining the actions of a generalist, Minnesota courts usually ask whether the physician applied the degree of skill and learning possessed by members of the profession in similar localities or communities. However, when the professional accused of medical malpractice is a specialist, his or her actions are judged against the actions of members of the profession across the nation.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Causation of Harm </STRONG></H4></A>
The third element of a medical malpractice lawsuit is causation. Causation is frequently divided into two separate inquiries -- whether the professional's actions in fact caused the harm to the patient, and whether the professional's actions were the proximate cause of the patient's harm. 
<P>
The "cause in fact" inquiry is usually answered with a "but for" or <STRONG>sine qua non</STRONG> test. A doctor's actions caused the patient's harm if, but for that action, the patient would not have been harmed. <STRONG>Sine qua non</STRONG> is a Latin expression meaning "without which not. " In other words, a doctor's actions caused harm if, without that action, the harm would not have occurred. 
<P>
The proximate cause inquiry asks whether the professional ought to be held responsible for his or her actions even if those actions did in fact cause the harm. In some rare instances, the physician's actions are so removed from the final harm to the patient that the law cuts off liability for those actions by saying that the tortious conduct was not proximate to the harm. 
<P>
Sometimes this causation inquiry is answered rather easily -- a doctor gives a patient the wrong drug and that drug causes permanent injury. Thorny issues arise when the harm to the patient had more than one cause. For example, two doctors, acting independently, might both prescribe the same wrong medication. If "but for" analysis is applied to each doctor's actions in isolation, it cannot be said that his or her actions were the cause of harm to the patient because the patient would have been harmed through the malpractice of the other doctor. Different jurisdictions have created their own rules to deal with "multiple cause" injuries. In Minnesota the courts have dealt with this issue by holding that when there is more than one person whose conduct may have caused or contributed to an injury or death, proximate causation can be established by showing that a particular defendant's actions were a "substantial factor" in causing the plaintiff's injury.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Damage to the Patient </STRONG></H4></A>
A person who is the victim of medical malpractice can sue for the injuries and all direct consequences of those injuries. "Direct consequences" include any mental or physical pain and suffering caused by the careless doctor, and any lost wages resulting from the injury. Due to the seriousness of some errors, awards can be quite high.
Reserved.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG><EM>Breach of Confidentiality </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
In order to collect a large damage award in a case of a breach of confidentiality, a person must show that the doctor's careless disclosure caused him or her great harm. For example, a patient might be able to collect a great deal of money if a doctor told the patient's rich aunt that the patient had a heroin addiction and the aunt subsequently wrote the patient out of her will. This injury is far greater than if the doctor was overheard at a party asking his or her patient about a wart problem.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Affirmative Defenses </STRONG></H3></A>
As described above, a defendant asserting an affirmative defense admits, for the purpose of argument, that the plaintiff can establish the existence of all four elements of a medical malpractice action, but the defendant argues that the existence of some other factor excuses the medical professional's actions.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Conflicting Legal Duty </STRONG></H4></A>
Generally, a doctor violates a patient's right to confidentiality by releasing information about his or her medical condition to unauthorized persons or organizations. However, there are a few conditions under which a doctor is legally required to inform others of a patient's medical condition. If a patient suffers a gunshot wound, for example, the doctor treating him or her must inform the police. Also, a doctor must inform the Minnesota Department of Health of anyone with a serious communicable disease, including HIV or AIDS. In Minnesota, a doctor treating a minor who appears to be the victim of child abuse must report the child's condition to appropriate authorities.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Consent </STRONG></H4></A>
Consent is the most frequently asserted affirmative defense in medical malpractice lawsuits. In order to establish the affirmative defense of consent in Minnesota a defendant must show that a patient was informed of all risks associated with a procedure and that the defendant did not go beyond the procedures to which the plaintiff consented. 
<P>
Doctors and hospitals have tried to protect themselves from medical malpractice lawsuits by having patients sign consent forms before they receive treatment. These consent forms typically include warnings that medicine is an imperfect art and not an exact science, and that patients must assume all the risks of any surgical procedures. By signing a consent form, a person does not give up all his or her rights to sue the medical professional if things go wrong. First, such an agreement may not be valid if the doctor does not fully inform the patient of the risks associated with the particular surgery. In other words, only a complete and informed consent is valid. However, even a valid consent form is no protection for a doctor who either performed surgery that went beyond the consent of the patient or who failed to perform the surgery according to well-accepted medical standards. A patient may also sue a doctor (or a hospital) if a person other than the one named on the consent form performs the surgery.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>The Future of Medical Malpractice Lawsuits </STRONG></H3></A>
Medical malpractice lawsuits have been targeted as one of the factors contributing to the spiraling costs of health care. Medical malpractice suits have increased dramatically both in frequency and in the amount of damages awarded. As a result, the price doctors pay for malpractice insurance has soared. These costs are passed on to patients and their insurers. Of course, insurers then pass the increased costs on to their customers in a seemingly endless cycle. Calls are frequently heard in Congress and in state legislatures to put caps on the amount of money judges or juries can award in medical malpractice lawsuits. The theory behind these proposals is that too many judges and juries fail to see the connection between spiraling malpractice awards and spiraling medical costs. Proponents of this legislation argue that people hurt by bad medical care should be compensated, but that the current system relies too heavily on emotional appeals in the courtroom and less on reasoned analysis of how much the victims of medical malpractice truly need to be compensated for their loss.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Legal Malpractice </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An increasingly common target of professional malpractice lawsuits are lawyers themselves. Although there is no precise definition of legal malpractice, generally speaking, a lawyer commits legal malpractice when he or she fails to provide quality legal services to a client. Bad conduct that is not unique to lawyers may lead to a lawsuit, but does not constitute legal malpractice. For instance, a lawyer who misses deadlines, inadequately prepares for a trial, misses numerous court dates, hearings, or appointments with the client, or represents both sides in a dispute without informing both parties, commits legal malpractice. A lawyer who steals funds from the client, or who assaults or defrauds the client has committed a crime but probably has not committed legal malpractice.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Defending Against Legal Malpractice Claims </STRONG></H3></A>
A legal malpractice lawsuit generally has four elements -- existence of an attorney-client relationship, breach of the duty owed to the client, injury to the client, and causation between the lawyer's actions and the harm to the client. A judge or jury examines all four elements in a legal malpractice trial and if any element is missing, the plaintiff cannot recover. Thus to understand how an attorney defends himself or herself against a claim of legal malpractice it is necessary to understand how Minnesota courts interpret each of these four elements.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Existence of an Attorney-Client Relationship </STRONG></H4></A>
The duty that a lawyer owes a client has two components -- legal competency and fiduciary obligations. The lawyer must exercise the legal skill that a competent attorney would exercise and must meet all of his or her fiduciary obligations to the client. No lawyer is expected to know the law so well that he or she can give perfect answers to every legal question, but lawyers are expected to know how to research issues and to recognize the limit of their knowledge when they reach an unsettled or unclear area of law. In one early Minnesota case, the Minnesota Supreme Court defined the duty an attorney owes a client: "An attorney is bound to exercise only a reasonable degree of care and skill having reference to the character of the business undertaken, and is not answerable for every error or mistake but will be protected provided he acts honestly and in good faith to the best of his skill and knowledge, or with at least reasonable skill and learning and an ordinary degree of attention and care." <STRONG>Sjobeck v. Leach,</STRONG> 6 N.W.2d 819, 213 Minn 360, (1943).
A lawyer's fiduciary obligations include a duty of undivided loyalty to the client's interests and confidentiality. As part of this fiduciary duty, a lawyer has an obligation to disclose any conflicts of interest that might impair his or her loyalty to the client or any personal constraints that might affect his or her ability to represent the client. 
<P>
Many legal malpractice suits have centered on the question of when these duties to a client arise. There is an important distinction between consulting an attorney about a legal matter and retaining that attorney to handle the matter. Generally speaking, only retaining an attorney obligates him or her to act on behalf of a client. Many Minnesotans have learned this lesson the hard way. They thought that consulting a lawyer about their legal problem meant that their case was being handled by that attorney so they stopped taking steps to pursue their claim. Meanwhile the lawyer they consulted allowed the statute of limitations to run out on the claim because the lawyer believed that he or she had not been retained to act on the client's behalf. Many legal malpractice suits have disputed whether an original office visit with a lawyer constituted a consultation or a hiring. 
<P>
Closely related to the issue of whether an attorney-client relationship has been formed in an initial consultation is that of whether or not an attorney gives legal advice to a potential client during the initial consultation. In one case, the Minnesota Supreme Court upheld a lower court's award of damages to a woman who consulted with an attorney about her husband's medical malpractice claim. At the initial consultation, the lawyer told the woman that he thought she had no claim against her husband's physician and thus the lawyer would not take the case. Relying on the lawyer's opinion, the woman waited too long to file her lawsuit and the statute of limitations expired on her claim. When she sued the attorney for legal malpractice, she alleged that the advice she received was sufficient to establish an attorney-client relationship between herself and the lawyer. The court found that an attorney-client relationship existed, in part because the attorney had rendered legal advice under circumstances that made it reasonably foreseeable that if the advice were rendered negligently, the person receiving the advice could be injured by acting upon it. 
<P>
The lesson for lawyers and prospective clients is that before leaving a lawyer's office, the individual and the lawyer should be absolutely clear as to whether the lawyer has or has not been hired. If an attorney declines to handle a case, he or she should be careful about saying that the individual has no case, and take care to suggest, perhaps, that the individual seek other counsel. If the individual believes that the attorney has been hired, he or she should be absolutely clear regarding what steps he or she believes the lawyer will take to handle a matter.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Breach of Duty to the Client </STRONG></H4></A>
Breach of duty is frequently the toughest element to prove in a legal malpractice lawsuit because a lawyer can make mistakes and still not commit legal malpractice. Law is an inexact science. Competent lawyers frequently disagree on the best course of action in a particular legal matter. Sometimes, the strategy that a lawyer chooses to pursue in a particular matter is a combination of knowledge about the law and guesswork about how a judge or jury will react to the facts of a case. A client may be able to show that another lawyer would have pursued a different strategy, and still the client may be unable to show that the first lawyer committed a breach of duty. Even an error in judgment does not create malpractice liability so long as it is within the bounds of honest exercise of professional judgment. Expert testimony generally is required to establish the standard of care that should be applied to an attorney whose conduct is alleged to constitute legal malpractice. However, there are some behaviors almost any judge or jury could call legal malpractice even in the absence of expert testimony. For example, if an attorney missed a filing deadline and allowed a statute of limitations to expire thereby causing a court to deny a lawsuit, then the client would have a strong case for legal malpractice.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Injury </STRONG></H4></A>
When a plaintiff claims breach of duty, the plaintiff must show not only the alleged breach of duty, but the injury caused thereby. A lawyer might miss a deadline, but if he or she is subsequently granted an extension, the client is not injured. If missing the deadline bars the plaintiff's claim, he or she might recover damages. A lawyer might forget to assert a claim, but if the claim would have been denied anyway, the client has not been injured. Usually a plaintiff can only recover direct economic losses, such as the money needed to pay another attorney to re-do legal work or any fees or penalties paid, or for any interest income lost because of an attorney's malpractice. It is difficult, although not impossible, to recover for speculative losses (what might have happened if a different lawyer had been hired), emotional losses, or legal expenses incurred hiring a new lawyer to sue the previous lawyer. 
<P>
Proving legal malpractice can be difficult because merely losing a case is not sufficient grounds to recover for malpractice. Like medicine, the law is not an exact science and many strategic legal decisions are made based on an attorney's background and experience. Even if a lawyer made a significant error in judgment that the client thinks caused the loss of the case, he or she does not automatically have the basis for a legal malpractice lawsuit. The same standard of reasonableness that applies in other areas of tort law also applies here. An attorney's honest mistake will be judged against the course of action a reasonable and knowledgeable attorney would have taken. 
<P>
All states set statutes of limitations on legal malpractice lawsuits. Some of the time limits begin when someone discovers that he or she has been harmed, while others begin when service by a professional is rendered. Thus, it is important to research this information as soon as one feels there may be a justifiable claim.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Causation </STRONG></H4></A>
Finally, as is true with medical malpractice claims, the plaintiff in a legal malpractice action must show that the breach was both the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. An attorney's actions are the actual cause, or cause in fact, of a client's injury if but for those actions the client would not have been harmed. Proximate cause is a thorny legal concept that essentially asks whether the breach was sufficiently responsible for, or sufficiently related to, the injury such that the lawyer should be held responsible. 
<P>
Causation is easiest to prove if a lawyer misses a deadline or gives advice that is clearly wrong. In these cases, the client can usually show exactly what would have happened had the lawyer met the deadline or given correct advice. Causation is more difficult to show when a lawyer pursues a wrong course of action in trial. In this case, the client has to show what the judge or jury would have done had the lawyer chosen another strategy. This can be difficult. The client needs to prove, to the judge's or jury's satisfaction, what another lawyer would have done, and how the jury and/or judge would have reacted to that strategy. The first lawyer might argue successfully that even had a different strategy been pursued, the outcome of the case would have been the same. 
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>The Future of Legal Malpractice Lawsuits </STRONG></H3></A>
Attorneys who try legal malpractice cases have had increasing success recently with new theories of liability for legal malpractice. One trend focuses on attorney investments and financial dealings. Courts can find that a lawyer breached a fiduciary duty to a client by failing to reveal stock ownership in an opposing corporate party or by using insider information learned about the client to make profits in the stock market. 
<P>
A growing trend is for the court to allow claims brought against lawyers by persons other than clients. For example, the beneficiaries under a client's will might bring a legal malpractice action against a lawyer who incorrectly drafted a deceased client's will if the beneficiaries are upset with their share of the estate. Depositors in a failed savings and loan company might sue lawyers who gave advice to the savings and loan.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Accountant Malpractice </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
While the number of professional malpractice lawsuits against doctors is leveling off nationally, the number of professional malpractice lawsuits against accountants is on the rise. There are a number of theories to explain why lawsuits against accountants are becoming more common. Perhaps the most likely explanation is that with the growing number of business insolvencies, lenders and investors are looking to other parties from which to recoup losses. Accountants appear to be an easy target because so often they are close to the heart of business decision making. Whatever the reason for the increasing number of lawsuits against them, accountants need to be aware of the ways they can become liable for the results of their work. 
<P>
As is true for doctors and lawyers, accountants can be sued for malpractice if they perform a service at a level below that which would be expected of a competent accountant. An accountant cannot be sued merely because of an honest mistake; he or she must be found to have made an error that a reasonable accountant would not have made. 
<P>
Accountant malpractice lawsuits differ in a number of important ways from medical or legal malpractice lawsuits. One of the most important differences between accountant malpractice lawsuits and medical or legal malpractice lawsuits is the role played by written compilations of standards of conduct for the accounting and auditing professions. These rules, known as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (GAAS), are frequently used in accountant malpractice lawsuits to judge the actions of defendants. Although mere blind adherence to these standards is not an absolute defense to malpractice liability, it is a powerful defense against an allegation of malpractice if a defendant can show that his or her actions complied with a rule found in GAAP or GAAS. 
<P>
Another way in which accountant malpractice lawsuits differ from medical or legal malpractice lawsuits is that many accountant malpractice cases are based on violations of federal and state statutes relating to the sale of securities. Accountants' financial statements are frequently used in connection with various kinds of securities offerings and are frequently submitted with annual reports or other periodic filings companies must make in order to comply with SEC requirements. If the financial statements are erroneous and lead to negative market impacts, then investors frequently try to recoup their losses by asserting securities claims against the accountants who prepared the statements. The statutes most commonly used to bring claims against accountants are the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Act of 1934, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Each is quite complex and a discussion of their intricacies is beyond the scope of this chapter, but an attorney experienced in defending accountants against charges of professional malpractice can advise accountants of their responsibilities and potential liabilities under these acts.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Engineer and Architect Malpractice </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Engineers and architects can also be sued for malpractice. Engineers and architects can be liable for the actual construction and design of a building itself if the structure proves unsafe or unsound, or they can be liable for negligent review of a building under construction or remodeling. If an engineer or architect reviews a structure and declares it sound to a perspective buyer, and it is discovered later that the building needed structural repairs, the buyer may have grounds for a professional malpractice lawsuit against the engineer or architect. 
<P>
Lawsuits that allege that an architect or engineer committed professional malpractice differ substantially from medical or legal malpractice lawsuits in that virtually all agreements between an architect or engineer and an owner are in standardized written contracts. 
<P>
Lawsuits against an engineer or architect alleging professional malpractice hinge more on interpretation of contract than on the application of common law principals. Another factor further distinguishing professional malpractice lawsuits against engineers and architects from professional malpractice lawsuits against doctors and lawyers is that standard contracts used in the engineering and architecture professions often call for disputes to be submitted to binding arbitration. The <A HREF="b02.html">Contract Law</A> chapter addresses general issues of contract law interpretation, and the <A HREF="b05.html">Alternative Dispute Resolution</A> chapter describes the processes used in arbitration. 
<P>
The standard contract used by engineers and contractors can be modified. However, architects and engineers should seek advice from an attorney experienced in disputes between owners and architects or engineers before agreeing to modify the terms of a standard form contract. Often, even seemingly innocuous language changes can substantially shift liabilities between the parties. For example, disputes often arise over the standard of care to be applied in judging the professionals' actions. The standard of care against which an engineer's or architect's actions generally are judged is the "ordinary and reasonable skill usually exercised by one in that profession." Some owners suggest changing the language to require the architect or engineer to exercise the "highest professional standards." While these words may appear to be innocuous, they should never be integrated into an agreement as they can set impossibly high standards for any architect or engineer to meet.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Publicly Held Corporations Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

The classic definition of a corporation is that a corporation is a fictitious or artificial person. For legal and tax purposes, a corporation is a separate entity from its owners, an entity that can make purchases, enter into contracts, must pay taxes, and can sue and be sued on its own behalf. A publicly held corporation is a corporation that has shares that are held by a large number of people. In contrast, a closely held corporation is one that has shares held by a small number of people.
<P>
There is no definitive line that separates a publicly held corporation from a closely held corporation. For certain limited purposes, the Minnesota Business Corporations Act defines a closely held corporation as a corporation with 35 or fewer shareholders. The Minnesota's Workers' Compensation Act defines a closely held corporation as a corporation whose stock is held by no more than 10 persons. In addition, federal law requires that publicly held corporations with more than $5,000,000 in assets and whose outstanding securities are held by more than 500 shareholders of record must meet several unique requirements of the Federal Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, including a requirement to submit periodic financial information to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
<P>
This chapter discusses how to form a publicly held corporation, the advantages and disadvantages of corporate status, and mergers and acquisitions. The <A HREF="b11.html">Closely Held Business Law</A> Chapter discusses other ways to organize a business and addresses issues uniquely of concern to closely held corporations. The <A HREF="b25.html">Nonprofit Corporations Law</A> Chapter discusses how to form a nonprofit, tax-exempt corporation. The <A HREF="b30.html">Securities &amp; Venture Finance Law</A> Chapter discusses securities laws and regulations that affect most publicly held corporations.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Forming a Publicly Held Corporation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A corporation can only be created by complying with the statutes of its state of incorporation. In most states, "incorporators" initially organize the corporation, "shareholders" own the corporation and elect a "board of directors" that is responsible for management and control of the corporation. The board of directors then chooses officers who are responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations of the corporation.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Advantages of Corporate Status </STRONG></H3></A>
Becoming a corporation gives a business several advantages over other forms of business organization such as sole proprietorship or partnership.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Survivability </STRONG></H4></A>
One advantage is that because a corporation is an artificial person, its existence does not depend on who its owners are at any given time. A corporation can survive the death of an individual shareholder or director or the transfer of shares. The corporation "dies" only when it is dissolved, either voluntarily or involuntarily. The ability to survive the death or departure of any individual person gives the corporation stability and makes it a more attractive candidate for long-term financing. Survivability also permits the corporation to raise funds by selling shares to new investors because new owners can be added without disturbing the corporate form.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Shareholder Insulation from Debt and Liability </STRONG></H4></A>
A corporation is liable for its own debts and obligations without limit, but because the corporation can take out loans and be sued in its own name, the shareholders are not personally liable for those debts should the corporation be unable to pay. Absent an agreement to the contrary, a corporation's creditors may not seek to collect debts from the owners of the corporation. In legalese, the shareholders enjoy "limited liability." Limited liability makes investment in a corporation more attractive to potential investors because the most that can be lost is the initial investment.
<P>
Incorporators of new corporations may not be able to enjoy limited liability immediately, however, because owners of a new corporation may be required by financial institutions to give personal financial assurances in order to receive funding. Financial institutions understand the risk they take by making loans to young corporations without established credit records and thus they may try to limit their exposure by requiring shareholders to personally guarantee loans should the corporation be unable to make payments.
<P>
In addition to the possibility that financial institutions will require personal guarantees for loans to corporations, on rare occasions a court will ignore a business' corporate status and make its shareholders personally liable for the debts of a corporation. Disregarding corporate status is known as "piercing the corporate veil." In Minnesota, piercing the corporate veil is extremely rare. Minnesota courts use a two-prong test in deciding whether to pierce the corporate veil and ignore a corporation's corporate status.
The first prong considers:
<UL>
<LI>The shareholders' relationship to the corporation
<LI>Whether there was insufficient capitalization for corporate undertakings
<LI>Observance of corporate formalities such as regular meetings and elections
<LI>Nonpayment of dividends
<LI>Nonsolvency of the corporation at the time of the transaction in question
<LI>Siphoning off of funds by a dominant shareholder
<LI>Absence of corporate records
<LI>Use of the corporation as a facade for individual dealings
</UL>
The second prong of the test focuses on the plaintiff's relationship to the corporation and asks whether piercing the veil is necessary to prevent injustice or fundamental unfairness.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Centralized Management </STRONG></H4></A>
Another benefit of corporate status is centralized management. The shareholders of a publicly held corporation are its owners, but management and control of the corporation are the responsibility of the board of directors, who may or may not be shareholders. In contrast, in a partnership, each partner has a right to participate in management.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Transferability of Interest </STRONG></H4></A>
Shares of stock in a corporation may be freely bought, sold, assigned, or otherwise disposed of by their owners unless there are special circumstances. In contrast, partnership interests are not freely transferable without the permission of remaining partners. The free transferability of shares increases their value because investors know they will be able to sell the shares quickly and easily should they choose to do so.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Disadvantages of Corporate Status </STRONG></H3></A>
Becoming a corporation is not the best course of action for all businesses, as corporate status does have its disadvantages.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Double Taxation </STRONG></H4></A>
The biggest drawback of corporate status is double taxation. Most publicly held corporations file their own tax returns and pay taxes on corporate profits before paying dividends to the shareholders. When the shareholders receive the dividends, these profits will be taxed on the individual shareholders' tax returns. In contrast, the profits of a partnership are only taxed once because a partnership pays no taxes before distributing profits. Partners only pay taxes on their individual share of the profits.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Cost </STRONG></H4></A>
Given the more complex nature of organizing and running a corporation as compared to other forms of business organization, most corporations pay more for professional services from accountants and lawyers. In addition, the fees for incorporating are generally higher than fees for other forms of business organization. Finally, a corporation that sells securities faces very substantial costs to comply with a myriad of securities regulations.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Inflexibility </STRONG></H4></A>
Another significant drawback to corporate status is the loss of flexibility in running a business. In order to avoid the possibility of a court piercing the corporate veil, a corporation needs to observe several formalities, such as regular meetings and elections. For some small businesses, the loss of flexibility may make corporate status more trouble than it is worth. 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>State of Incorporation </STRONG></H3></A>
Incorporators usually choose to incorporate under the laws of the state in which the corporation is primarily located, although they can choose to incorporate under the laws of another state. For example, close to one-third of the corporations in the United States are incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware, even though most of them do little, if any, business in Delaware. The state of Delaware has purposefully sought to entice corporations to incorporate under its laws by maintaining an especially efficient, well run, system of courts that exclusively handles corporate matters. Because so many corporations are organized under Delaware laws, the Delaware Corporate Code has been litigated extensively. A result of the extensive amount of case law interpreting the Delaware Corporate Code is that outcomes of lawsuits are often easier to predict in Delaware, so many business operators now feel more comfortable knowing that corporate disputes will be handled in Delaware courts applying Delaware laws.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Minnesota Requirements for Corporations </STRONG></H3></A>
Corporations formed under Minnesota law must comply with the requirements set forth in the Minnesota Business Corporations Act (MBCA). Any natural person at least 18 years of age may form a corporation by filing articles of incorporation with the office of the Minnesota Secretary of State.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Articles of Incorporation </STRONG></H4></A>
The MBCA allows corporations to have very simple articles of incorporation. Articles of incorporation need only include:
<UL>
<LI>The name of the corporation
<LI>The address of the corporation's registered office and name of the registered agent, if any, at that address
<LI>The aggregate number of shares that the corporation has authority to issue
<LI>The name and address of each incorporator
</UL>
The reason articles of incorporation can be so simple is that the MBCA contains a long list of provisions that apply to all corporations unless specifically modified in the articles of incorporation, including:
<UL>
<LI>The board of directors has the power to adopt, amend or repeal bylaws 
<LI>Absent directors must be given an opportunity to give written consent or opposition to proposals
<LI>An affirmative vote of a majority of the directors present at a meeting is required for board action
<LI>All shares have equal rights and preferences in all matters
<LI>A shareholder has preemptive rights to acquire newly issued shares 
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Name Registration </STRONG></H4></A>
Minnesota Statutes require that any business operating in Minnesota under a name other than the full name of the business owner must register the assumed name with the Minnesota Secretary of State. A "Certificate of Assumed Name" form is available from the Minnesota Secretary of State's office. The business owner must fill out the form and submit it and the accompanying fee to the Secretary of State. After the Secretary of State notifies the owner that the filing has been accepted and the proposed name does not conflict with corporate or partnership names on file, the owner must publish notice of the assumed name in a newspaper. The newspaper chosen must be in the county where the principal office of the business is located. The corporation's name registration is valid for ten years and can be renewed.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Tax Identification Numbers </STRONG></H4></A>
Corporations in Minnesota must obtain federal and state tax identification numbers. A corporation with employees must also register with the Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training for an Unemployment Compensation Insurance number. Businesses that sell goods or services that are taxable must obtain a sales and use tax permit from the Minnesota Department of Revenue.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Forms of Corporations </STRONG></H3></A>
Corporations can be formed in a number of different ways.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>Subchapter C Corporation </STRONG></H4></A>
Most large, publicly held corporations are Subchapter C corporations. The Subchapter C corporation takes its name from Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code. A Subchapter C corporation is subject to the general corporate taxation rules discussed above.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG>Subchapter S Corporation </STRONG></H4></A>
A Subchapter S corporation derives its name from Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code. Under Subchapter S, a corporation that meets certain requirements may be treated as a corporation for purposes of insulating its shareholders from personal liability for corporate debts, but treated as a partnership for tax purposes. Shareholders of a Subchapter S corporation receive limited liability protection, and their profits from the business are included on their individual income tax return. Minnesota has similar tax treatment for such corporations.
<P>
To be treated as a Subchapter S corporation under federal tax laws, the corporation:
<UL>
<LI>Must be a domestic corporation (not foreign)
<LI>Must not be part of an affiliated group of corporations
<LI>Must not have more than 35 shareholders
<LI>Must have only one class of stock
<LI>Must have only shareholders who are individuals, a decedent's estate, or one of a special class of trusts (not corporations or partnerships)
<LI>Must have no shareholders who are nonresident aliens
</UL>
After a business has incorporated, all shareholders must consent to Subchapter S treatment. The election to be treated as a Subchapter S corporation must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service in a timely manner.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Director's Fiduciary Responsibilities </STRONG></H3></A>
The attitude of lawmakers toward corporate directors is somewhat contradictory. Because directors hold great power in a corporation's management structure, the law imposes upon them a high standard of fidelity and loyalty to the interests of the corporation. On the other hand, because most Americans value the freedom of corporations to take risks and pursue untested ventures, lawmakers are loathe to restrict the actions of directors. In legalese, directors are said to owe the corporation "fiduciary duties." The outlines of directors' fiduciary duties are frequently the subject of lawsuits alleging that a director had a conflict of interest in his or her dealing with the corporation or failed to exercise good business judgment.
<P>
Minnesota Statutes require a director to "discharge the duties of the position of director in good faith, in a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interest of the corporation, and with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise under similar circumstances."
<P>
Directors who perform their duties in compliance with the above standard are not liable for their actions merely by reason of being or having been a director of the corporation. Put another way, directors' decisions made honestly and with reasonable prudence do not subject a director to liability even if they turn out badly for the corporation.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Mergers and Acquisitions </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There are two ways that a corporation can grow -- either it can add new employees and customers of its own, or it can merge with or acquire another business. There are many reasons why merging with or acquiring another business can be preferable to internal growth.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Benefits of Merging and Acquiring </STRONG></H3></A>
Though there are many possible reasons for mergers and acquisitions, the following are the most common benefits to be gained.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="230"><H4><STRONG>Economies of scale </STRONG></H4></A>
By consolidating purchasing, advertising, and administrative functions, a larger, merged company often can be more efficient than two smaller companies.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="240"><H4><STRONG>Diversification and Access to Assets </STRONG></H4></A>
A merger may give a company better access to credit and new products and may help to even out peaks and valleys in cash flow and profits.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="250"><H4><STRONG>Tax Advantages </STRONG></H4></A>
The Internal Revenue Code provides some incentive for a financially healthy corporation to acquire a troubled business. If the acquiring corporation meets several strict requirements, it may be able to use a limited part of the net operating loss carryover of the acquired business against the acquiring company's taxable income.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="260"><H4><STRONG>Personal Considerations </STRONG></H4></A>
An owner looking to make assets more liquid, either out of retirement considerations or because of dissent within the company, may look to a sale or merger. Sometimes a business may be growing so quickly that its owners need the skills and resources of a competitor to keep up with the growth. In some instances an older, more stable company may be interested in sharing its experiences in exchange for the higher profit margins of a smaller, up-and-coming business.
<P>
<A NAME="270"><H3><STRONG>Ways of Merging with or Acquiring Another Business </STRONG></H3></A>
Generally, businesses are acquired or merged through one of three possible approaches. Which method might be the best in a particular situation depends on such considerations as tax laws, antitrust laws and corporate laws.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="280"><H4><STRONG>Asset Acquisition </STRONG></H4></A>
In this method, a buyer will purchase some or all of the seller's assets in exchange for securities, cash or property of the acquiring corporation. If the seller is a corporation, the structure of the selling corporation will remain intact until the corporation is dissolved and the proceeds from the sale are distributed to shareholders. Minority shareholders will generally not have a say in the sale of the business and, as the buyer is not purchasing an entire business but rather parts of the whole, the buyer need not assume the liabilities of the seller. Asset acquisition is a way to acquire the physical property and accounts of another business without also acquiring its liabilities.
<P>
Acquiring the assets of a business can be more expensive than other types of acquisitions or mergers. There may be some difficulty in transferring contracts, leases and licenses from third parties, and titles to each asset sold must be separately transferred.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="290"><H4><STRONG>Stock Acquisition </STRONG></H4></A>
Stock acquisitions are frequently called takeovers. A corporation's shareholders, not its management, own the company (although managers often are significant shareholders themselves). Thus, the shareholders are always free to sell their shares of stock to a purchaser. In the event that the management does not approve of the sale, the acquisition is called a hostile takeover.
<P>
Under this arrangement, the directors' approval is not needed to purchase the corporation and the only documents that need to be transferred are stock certificates (rather than titles), contracts or any other form of consideration by third parties.
<P>
There are a number of problems with takeovers. For example, the new majority shareholders may be liable for debts incurred under the old leadership prior to the purchase. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission may require registration for the sale, and minority shareholders may be able to hold out and retain positions within the acquired corporation.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="300"><H4><STRONG>Statutory Merger </STRONG></H4></A>
Under a statutory merger, two corporations agree to combine and form a single corporation under state law. This arrangement must be agreed to by at least two-thirds of the shareholders from each corporation and by both boards of directors. Only one company survives, and it takes over all operations, assets, and liabilities of both companies. The shareholders of the disappearing corporation trade in their shares of stock for an equity position in the surviving business. In a related type of merger, called a statutory consolidation, the two businesses both cease to exist and form an entirely new entity.
<P>
A statutory merger is beneficial because all title transfers are automatic if the arrangement follows state guidelines, and because all assets of both companies are retained in the merger.
<P>
On the other hand, this type of arrangement runs the risk of assuming all liabilities of the disappearing corporation, and the process can be costly and time-consuming due to the necessity of shareholder meetings and the technicalities of state laws.
<P>
<A NAME="310"><H3><STRONG>Corporate Buy-Sell Agreements </STRONG></H3></A>
As with any buy-sell agreement, price is the cornerstone of an agreement to buy or sell a corporation or its assets. Determining the worth of a company to be purchased or merged can be accomplished through a variety of means. The price of a company can be determined by the book value of the company, by an independent appraisal, by comparing the price/earnings ratio within the seller's industry, or by any of several other methods. The method of sale can significantly affect the overall cost to the buyer and seller due to tax considerations. Some acquisitions are considered tax-free, while others are taxable. An accountant should be able to help a company understand and take advantage of such tax-minimizing schemes as the pooling-of-interest accounting method.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="320"><H4><STRONG>Employee Considerations </STRONG></H4></A>
An agreement should guarantee that key employees are retained and that contracts for employment are transferred to the buyer company. The buyer should review any collective bargaining agreements thoroughly, since they may be binding. Retirement plans will likely be transferred to the buyer company as well.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="330"><H4><STRONG>Seller Indemnification </STRONG></H4></A>
It is common for an agreement to dismiss the buyer from any future unassumed liabilities from an asset purchase.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="340"><H4><STRONG>Securities Regulations </STRONG></H4></A>
A buyer of a business who offers securities in exchange for the business, or for significant shares of the business, may be considered an "issuer" of the securities and therefore may be required to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The buyer may, however, be eligible for exemption under the law. Determining whether a business must register and which kind of registration it must undertake can affect the sellers' ability to resell the securities they receive as payment. There are a number of other considerations under both federal securities laws and state blue-sky laws to be aware of in mergers and acquisitions that involve the exchange of stocks. The advice of a competent attorney is highly recommended.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="350"><H4><STRONG>Buyer-Seller Representations </STRONG></H4></A>
The buyer in a transaction in which the seller is being paid in stock will generally warrant that the stock is legal, authorized, and fully paid. The seller in the same type of exchange will warrant that the stock is legal, and will further note the condition of the business in financial documents.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Securities &amp; Venture Finance Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

There are two basic ways for a new business to raise money -- borrowing money and selling shares of ownership in the company. A brand new business that survives more than a few years is bucking the odds. The vast majority of new businesses do not reach their first anniversary and only a handful reach their fifth. Lenders are keenly aware of these statistics, and thus they view funding startup businesses as highly risky. Conventional banks generally are wary of lending money to new businesses and usually require a large capital investment by the prospective business owner as well as a personal guarantee from him or her to repay the loan if the business cannot. In practice, securing money for a new venture largely depends on what owners can raise on their own. The following is a discussion of some options for those looking to finance new ventures.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Securities </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An option for business owners in need of capital but unable or unwilling to go into debt is to sell equity stakes in the business. Securities such as stocks and bonds are different from other commodities because they have no value by themselves. Rather, they are evidence of a debt owed to their holder. They are written secured promises to pay back money or other payment. All offerings of securities can be placed into one of two categories depending on the regulations that govern them. Securities that are exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 are called private placements, while all other sales of securities are called public placements. Although the majority of business issue securities are exempt from registration requirements, it can be very difficult to discern whether a specific business is exempt.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Stocks and Bonds </STRONG></H3></A>
There are two different types of securities: stocks and bonds. Bonds are documents that signify a debt owed. Selling a bond is like a loan agreement in which the bond holder is promised the return of the original sum loaned out plus interest over time. Generally, bonds are secured with collateral, which ensures that the debt will be satisfied even in the case of default by the party that issued the bonds.
<P>
Stocks signify an equity or ownership interest in a company. The unit of ownership is the share, and the holder of one or more shares in a company has some say in how the company is run, how profits are spent, and how the company's assets should be divided upon dissolution of the company. Some companies distribute profits to shareholders by paying dividends. Other corporations reinvest the profits within the business, thereby theoretically increasing the value of the stock.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Securities Markets </STRONG></H3></A>
The vehicles through which sales and purchases of securities are conducted are called securities markets. These markets do not necessarily have a physical location, but are sometimes just informal networks through which buyers and sellers of securities make transactions. The largest securities market -- in terms of the value traded -- is the bond market. The bond market is the means through which the United States government, state and local governments, and corporations borrow money from the public. Because bonds are generally less attractive to individual buyers and more likely to be purchased by professional investors, bond markets are less widely regulated than are markets for common stock. 
<P>
There are two kinds of markets for stocks -- over-the-counter markets and exchange markets. An over-the-counter market is the less rigid of the two. This type of market exists via a network of transactions, with no permanent physical location. Instead the market uses telephone and computer connections. This kind of market allows a wider variety of firms to participate in the trading of securities. 
<P>
Exchange markets differ from over-the-counter markets in several important ways. Exchange markets operate in a facility in which actual transactions occur between parties on a trading floor. The New York Stock Exchange is the largest such exchange. Exchange markets differ further from over-the-counter markets in that they operate under more strict guidelines governing who can and cannot trade on the exchange. The distinction between the two is blurring because of new technologies which call into question the need for "floor" trading. 
<P>
A securities firm makes its money in several different ways. In an exchange transaction, the firm charges a commission on the purchase or sale of the stock. In the case of over-the-counter stock, a firm is hired to create a market for a certain stock. In such cases, the firms will sell the stock to customers at a price higher than that sold to other brokers. The firm makes its profit from the difference between its cost for the stock and the price of stock as offered to the public.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Private Placements </STRONG></H3></A>
Private placements or offerings are sales of securities that are not subject to requirements for registration under the Securities Act of 1933. As these exemptions are fairly complex, and the punishment for breaking securities regulations is severe, seeking legal advice from an expert in the field of securities regulation is highly recommended.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Initial Public Offerings </STRONG></H3></A>
A business "goes public" when it solicits or concludes a sale of securities from a group of public investors. Although there are exemptions available under both federal and state laws, public offerings generally must comply with registration requirements set forth by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission and state authorities. An initial public offering, often referred to as an IPO, is the first such public sale by an organization.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Regulation </STRONG></H3></A>
Largely because of the nature of securities -- that they do not have a value in and of themselves and can therefore be created and sold in unlimited amounts -- there has developed a fairly sophisticated network of laws governing their use and sale. Securities law is governed by both state and federal laws, but all these laws have four main purposes:
<UL>
<LI>To ensure that investors have an accurate idea of what they are getting (and how much) when they purchase securities
<LI>To ensure disclosure of information concerning corporations or other entities that are trading in securities
<LI>To prevent fraud, insider trading, abuse of non-public information, or other price manipulation
<LI>To govern those who buy and sell securities on the secondary market to investors
</UL>
Securities regulations can be extremely technical. A business seeking to issue securities to finance its business should consult an expert. If the business is not exempt from registration, meeting the registration requirements can be quite expensive. On the other hand, public placements offer distinct advantages over private placements. Securities regulations are complicated rules that protect the investor or buyer of the securities. For this reason, sales of securities done in violation of state and federal rules are subject to strict civil and criminal penalties, even if the violations are inadvertent or the result of ignorance.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Federal Laws </STRONG></H4></A>
There are a number of federal laws upon which much of the regulation of the sale of securities is based. The Securities Act of 1933 deals with the initial public offering of securities. The aim of the legislation is to prohibit fraud or deception in the sale of the securities by providing for full disclosure of facts concerning the securities for sale and the business and finances of the issuer. 
<P>
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulates trading in the secondary market. Like the earlier act, it also requires disclosure of information about the offering. This act established the Securities and Exchange Commission, the principal regulatory body policing securities markets. It also instituted several other restrictions on publicly held corporations, such as a restriction on the amount of credit that can be extended for the purchase of securities. The Act further requires that brokers, dealers, and businesses that deal in securities register with the SEC. It was amended in 1975 to give the government even broader powers over securities exchange and the structure of the market system.
<P>
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 regulates public issues of large securities. The Investment Company Act of 1940 regulates publicly owned businesses that deal primarily in the buying and selling of securities. The Investors Advisers Act of 1940 sets down rules for the registration and regulation of investment advisors, similar to those used in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 established the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which has the authority to oversee the liquidation of securities firms and to pay off debts owed to their customers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Minnesota Laws </STRONG></H4></A>
In addition to federal securities laws, there are state securities laws, generally referred to as "blue sky laws." Like the federal laws, blue sky laws provide for registration of brokers and dealers, require that information be made available about securities open for trading, and also mandate penalties for fraudulent or deceptive practices.
<P>
Securities offered in Minnesota generally must be registered with both the federal Securities and Exchange Commission and the Minnesota Department of Commerce before they can legally be advertised or sold to investors. However, there are exemptions from the registration requirement under both state and federal laws. <A HREF="#100">Exemptions</A> are discussed in more detail below.
<P>
Minnesota statutes provide that a corporation can issue securities or rights to buy securities only when the corporation has been so authorized by its board of directors acting in accordance with the articles of incorporation. Thus, the first step for any corporation is to determine whether there are sufficient authorized but unissued shares available. If additional shares have not been authorized, then the articles of incorporation may need to be amended to allow for sufficient authorized stock.
<P>
Under Minnesota law, unless limited or denied by the articles of incorporation, a shareholder in a Minnesota corporation has a right to buy a certain number of newly offered shares, based on the proportion of previously existing shares that he or she already owns. This "preemptive right" can substantially limit a corporation's ability to restructure itself.
Also under Minnesota law, a corporation can sometimes receive something other than money, such as goods or services, in exchange for shares. The non-monetary consideration must bear a reasonable relation to the value of the shares. This area has been the subject of much litigation and is full of pitfalls for novices.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Exemptions </STRONG></H4></A>
Exemptions from many rules are available under both state and federal laws. Any one security may qualify for exemption under state laws but not federal laws, or vice versa. Examples of such exemptions include offering a key employee of a company a chance to become a shareholder in the company. Placements with large institutional investors, such as insurance companies, may be exempt also. Offerings that do not exceed five million dollars can be exempted from regulations by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission. Other exemptions are available to the sale of securities to parties that meet the definition of accredited investors such as a bank, pension fund, or a charitable foundation with assets of at least $5 million, a director or officer of the issuer, or a wealthy individual.
<P>
Most smaller businesses are exempt from the registration requirement, which is the most expensive requirement to meet. The federal laws generally exempt any offerings which are confined to any single state. However, the federal courts have interpreted this exemption narrowly and have determined that even some state issuances are subject to federal regulations because they use the federal mailing system. The federal government also provides an exemption to businesses that offer less than $1.5 million worth of securities per year.
<P>
Although there are several areas under which companies are exempt from registration requirements, these rules are subject to interpretation and may change. Businesses contemplating offering securities should not rely on the possibility that they may be subject to one or more of the exemptions unless they have received expert legal advice.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Debt Financing </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Selling securities is difficult and highly regulated. The cost of meeting these regulations, as well as the difficulty in convincing buyers that a business is a good investment, makes offering securities impractical for many startup companies. Another way of selling ownership in a company -- by admitting partners into the deal for a cost (called a limited liability company) -- is an option, but a business owner must be willing to forgo some of the profits and convince prospective members they will make money. Further limiting the appeal of memberships in limited liability companies is the fact that they are not freely transferable to third parties. Thus, it is a somewhat easier task to raise money through debt financing, available from banks, credit corporations and local and state loan programs. There are various ways a business can go about finding venture capital from public and private sources.
<P>
Anyone trying to use a lender to raise money for a new business will need to give a prospective lender detailed information about the form a new company will take. At a minimum, a prospective business owner will have to provide information about his or her current financial situation, including all business and personal assets and debts. Also, an applicant must be prepared to provide information about how the money requested will be spent and a full description of the intent of the business, along with information about the experience and management capabilities of the owner and those expected to be employed in top positions. A lender will also want to know how much money the owner plans to invest in the business and any projections of how much the project is expected to earn in its first year.
<P>
Retail and service-oriented businesses often have more difficulty obtaining financing because the funding for these types of businesses is used for expenses such as inventory, fixtures and working capital -- collateral that usually does not meet a lender's criteria for resale recovery. Often, these endeavors are financed primarily, if not fully, through equity. With that background in mind, following are various types of debt financing options that are available.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Conventional Bank Loans </STRONG></H3></A>
Bank loans are a common way of financing new ventures. The most advantageous to young businesses, but toughest to obtain, are unsecured loans. These are usually available only for short term loans to borrowers with strong balance sheets, ample cash flow, and a low debt-to-equity ratio. Unsecured loans are usually made for less than one year, and the interest rate is a factor of the size of the loan, financial health of the borrower, and the type of industry or business in which the borrower engages. Easier to obtain are a variety of secured loans, which can be structured in a variety of ways and which can give the lender a security interest in accounts receivable, inventory, or raw materials.
<P>
It is almost impossible to finance a business with 100 percent debt. Cautious bankers -- and bankers are a cautious bunch -- typically require that at least half of the startup costs be covered by the owner, and nearly any source of financing will require at least a 20 percent equity stake by the owner.
<P>
As noted above, financiers are more willing to provide funding for projects in which there is collateral that can be easily sold if necessary to recoup the lender's investment. Thus, manufacturing and industrial operations are historically easier ventures to finance than retail and service businesses.
<P>
A bank is a corporation that earns money by maintaining savings and checking accounts, issuing loans and credit, and dealing in negotiable securities for governments and corporations. Banks invest the money entrusted to them by their customers. The investments that banks are allowed to make are regulated and banks are defined by the limitations put upon them. The types of banks, from least to most regulated, are commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loans.
<P>
Commercial banks are the most common and most loosely regulated type of bank. These banks must have more deposits on hand than other types of banks in order to handle the daily transactions of the bank and prevent a money shortage (and the panic that can result). These types of banks are often publicly held corporations.
<P>
Savings banks are a rarer form of bank, although they are fairly common in the midwest. These are limited-service banks that were originally formed to encourage people to save their money. To this end, savings banks traditionally offered as their major service "time" savings accounts that prevented withdrawal of money deposited until a set period of time had elapsed. In modern times, the services of this type of bank have expanded somewhat. A business person looking for a lender should note that a savings bank will sometimes offer higher interest rates on accounts than a commercial bank. This is because a savings bank does not have to keep as high a portion of its deposits in reserve as do commercial banks. Savings banks are usually owned in the form of a partnership among depositors who receive dividends in the form of interest on their accounts.
<P>
The third type of bank is a savings and loan association. Despite news of scandals and problems in recent years, savings and loan banks have traditionally been highly regulated, conservative organizations whose primary purpose, other than encouraging savings, is to provide loans for homes and businesses.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Asset Based Lenders </STRONG></H3></A>
Asset based lenders use assets as collateral to lend money to businesses that would not ordinarily qualify for a bank loan. Businesses that are growing fast but have not established a credit history with a bank might find these lenders helpful. Generally, businesses that seek asset based loans are high risks, so asset based lenders charge a premium for their service. Some asset based lenders will use a business' receivables and inventory as collateral. Others may prefer to use real estate or equipment as collateral.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Commercial Finance Companies </STRONG></H4></A>
Commercial finance companies specialize in financing higher risk applicants unable to obtain conventional bank financing. Their interest rates can be substantially higher than those offered by conventional banks because of the increased risks. Commercial finance companies often are more willing to finance riskier applicants because they have more experience evaluating the liquidation value of failed businesses.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Venture Capital Companies </STRONG></H4></A>
Venture capital companies provide capital to businesses that might not be eligible for straight bank loans but have high potential in their market. These companies assess the viability of an emerging business and fund it by taking a stake in the company. Thus, the success of the venture capital firm depends on the success of the business. Many investors demand a say in management decisions for their investment capital -- a demand that is anathema to some entrepreneurs.
<P>
Only about one out of every ten investments reaps profits for venture capital companies, so they are choosy about where they place their money. Many firms specialize in certain areas in which they have expertise. Before approaching a venture capitalist, a business owner should prepare a solid business plan that takes into account marketing plans, cash flow and research needs.
<P>
Venture capital companies specialize in lending to startup companies or established companies expanding into new risky markets. Venture capital companies may be the only option available to some businesses. Venture capital companies frequently prefer to acquire stock in the company as a way to finance the loan, insist on playing a substantial role in managing the company, and can have substantial involvement in the day-to-day operations of the business.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Public Financing </STRONG></H3></A>
There are many government programs charged with helping businesses succeed. One of the ways the government encourages new businesses is by making loans easier to obtain. The United States Small Business Administration (SBA) helps qualified small businesses get loans by offering guarantees to banks for those loans. The SBA will guarantee 85 to 90 percent of a loan depending on the size of the loan (the maximum is $750,000). It is difficult to receive the SBA's help, however, without sizable investment capital from investors.
<P>
In addition to SBA help, there are a number of other government programs, from local and federal sources, designed to help specific kinds of businesses such as minority-owned businesses.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="170"><H2><STRONG>Franchises </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Strictly speaking, franchising is not a type of new venture financing, but it can be a way for an existing business to expand rapidly and move into new markets for a reasonable cost. A franchise is a right given to a private person or corporation to market a given product within a certain area. When a business with a trademark sells the rights to that trademark for use by a distributor of products or services, their relationship can be a franchise. Usually the business selling the franchise also provides market assistance to the buyer.
<P>
Franchises are governed by both state and federal law. It is extremely important to know these laws before starting a business that may franchise or if a business is considering becoming a franchisee for another business. The laws are drafted using broad language and some people find themselves in violation of the laws, even though they are not engaged in activities they consider to be franchising.
<P>
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforces laws and rules regulating franchises. These rules do not require a business to register with or seek the approval of the FTC before offering or selling a franchise. The rules only apply to franchises that are "in or affecting interstate commerce." Although there are differences between the laws that govern state and federal franchise law, it is most important to remember that the name of a company is not important as long as the relationship meets the definition of a franchise. This means that if a business is entering into a limited partnership, it may also be entering into a franchise agreement. The FTC rules define a franchise as a "continuing commercial relationship" between two or more parties. This continuing relationship is further defined as one in which supplies for reorder are made available to the purchaser after the first required inventory is purchased.
There are three basic types of "continuing commercial relationships" covered by the rules:
<UL>
<LI>Package franchises, defined as prepackaged business programs developed and identified by the franchisor. McDonald's is an example of this type, also called a "business format" franchise.
<LI>Product franchises, arrangements where the franchisor sells goods that bear his or her trade name to a franchisee, who in turn sells them to the public under that same name. The dealer company maintains a degree of control over the selling of the goods by the franchisee in this arrangement.
<LI>Business opportunity ventures, in which the franchisor retains more control than in either of the previous arrangements. In this type of franchising agreement, the franchisee is required to buy and sell the goods or services of the franchisor or another business. Furthermore, the franchisor arranges the location of the business, seeks out business for the junior partner, and even provides employees. An example of this type of arrangement is a vending machine route, where a company finds a place to put the machines and sells the candy to the franchisee, but the franchisee collects the money and restocks the machines.
</UL>
Franchises are also discussed in the <A HREF="b11.html">Closely Held Business Law</A> Chapter and the <A HREF="b19.html">Franchise &amp; Dealership Law</A> Chapter.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Accidents &amp; Personal Injury Law 
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Personal injuries, as their name implies, are injuries to an individual person. Crimes are wrongful acts against society. The government punishes those who commit crimes-criminals-with criminal penalties. For personal injuries, the government does not punish the wrongdoer but gives the victim the right to pursue a private, civil lawsuit, called a tort action, against the wrongdoer. Some wrongful acts are both crimes and torts, and can subject the wrongdoer to both criminal penalties and tort remedies. This chapter outlines the actions that lead to most personal injury lawsuits, including general accidents and injuries, professional malpractice, use of defective products, and injuries occurring to workers on the job. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>General Concepts of Tort Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Tort laws are based on the premise that when someone does something to harm another person physically, mentally, or financially, the person harmed ought to be compensated for the loss. Tort lawsuits are governed by a set of rules that are different from the rules that govern criminal lawsuits.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Degree of Fault Needed to Recover </STRONG></H3></A>
There are three kinds of torts-negligence, intentional misconduct, and strict liability. Each requires the plaintiff to show a different degree of fault to recover from the defendant.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="40"><H4><STRONG>Negligence </STRONG></H4></A>
A person is negligent if he or she fails to act as a reasonable person would act in a similar situation. Examples of negligence include automobile accidents caused by inattentive driving, or a fall at a store caused when a store owner fails to repair a defective escalator. If a reasonable person would have been driving attentively, or if a reasonable store owner would have fixed the unsafe escalator, the person who drove inattentively or failed to make repairs could be found negligent by a judge or jury. Negligent behavior is almost never criminal.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="50"><H4><STRONG>Intentional Misconduct </STRONG></H4></A>
Intentional misconduct occurs when someone, acting deliberately, does something that hurts another person or damages that person's property. The law does not require that the person intend to cause the injury he or she actually inflicts, only that he or she acted deliberately. For example, a driver of an automobile may intend only to scare a pedestrian by swerving toward the pedestrian, but if the driver hits the pedestrian, the driver commits intentional misconduct. Intentional misconduct can be more difficult to prove than negligence, but often a plaintiff can recover greater damages if he or she can show the defendant acted intentionally. Intentional misconduct is often also criminal behavior. Examples of intentional misconduct include assault and battery. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="60"><H4><STRONG>Strict Liability </STRONG></H4></A>
In some situations, a plaintiff can recover for injuries received even if the defendant uses utmost care. In these situations, a defendant is said to be strictly, or absolutely, liable for any damages resulting from his or her actions. The principle behind strict liability is that some activities are necessary, but so dangerous that even a reasonable person can not make them completely safe. Strict liability usually applies only to very dangerous situations and to products liability. As a social policy, defendants are permitted to engage in certain activities but are held strictly liable for any injury resulting from the activity. Strict liability claims most commonly result from extremely dangerous activities such as blasting, excavating, or demolishing a building or from defective products. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Comparative Fault </STRONG></H4></A>
Tort law attempts to compensate victims if their injury is caused by another person. Where one person clearly causes all of another person's injury, blame is easy to place. In many other cases, however, the victim's actions help cause the injury or make it worse than it would otherwise be. For instance, a negligent driver might injure a pedestrian who is negligently walking in the street, instead of on a sidewalk where a prudent pedestrian normally walks. A victim might have been slightly injured by using a defective chainsaw, but his or her injuries are made worse because the victim negligently fails to wear safety goggles while using the chainsaw. In these cases, a judge or jury must calculate how much each party is at fault. Each state has its own rules for calculating damages that can be recovered when a victim is at least partially to blame for his or her own injury. 
<P>
Minnesota has a comparative fault rule. Under the comparative fault rule, a judge reduces the amount of any damage award by the percent that the victim's own actions contribute to his or her injuries. For example, if a jury finds that a plaintiff suffered $100,000 in damages, but was 30 percent at fault, the judge reduces the damage award by 30 percent to $70,000. In Minnesota, the reduction is only up to 50 percent. If the victim is more than 50 percent at fault, he or she collects nothing.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Vicarious Liability </STRONG></H3></A>
There are several ways that a person can be held liable for the actions of another person. All of these are known as vicarious liability. For example, a parent might be held responsible for damage caused by his or her child if the parent knows that the child is likely to injure someone and the parent negligently fails to exercise any control over the child. The owner of a vehicle can be held responsible for accidents caused when another person drives the vehicle if the owner negligently entrusts the vehicle to the other driver. The most common form of vicarious liability is called respondeat superior. Under respondeat superior, an employer is responsible for torts committed by employees within the scope of their employment. A business owner is usually not responsible for acts committed by independent contractors. For example, if a pedestrian is struck and injured by a person driving to a party, the victim has a claim against the driver. If the pedestrian is hit by a person driving a delivery van for his or her employer, then respondeat superior gives the pedestrian claims against both the driver and the employer. Frequently, personal injury plaintiffs cannot recover anything from the employee because he or she has no money. Employers usually have more money or better insurance, so plaintiffs often focus their recovery efforts on the employers.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Burden of Proof </STRONG></H3></A>
The burden of proof in a civil case is less strict than the proof required in criminal lawsuits. In a criminal case, the state must prove a person's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The state is required to meet this high standard because a defendant's liberty, and possibly even life, are at stake. The plaintiff in a personal injury lawsuit need only show that it is more probable than not that an injury was caused by the defendant's actions. If the jury finds that the evidence even slightly favors the injured party, then it must find for the plaintiff. The personal injury plaintiff need only meet this lower standard because the defendant's life and liberty are not at stake. 
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Defenses </STRONG></H3></A>
One is sometimes allowed, or privileged, to commit acts that would otherwise constitute assault or battery and not be liable for damages. If one acts in defense of self, others, or one's land, the use of force can be justified. Minnesota has a Good Samaritan law that gives well-intentioned people a defense to liability if they injure someone while sincerely attempting to help the person. For example, if a person witnesses a car accident and in trying to help the victim accidentally worsens the victim's injury, the person who tries to help has a defense to charges of assault and battery.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Damages </STRONG></H3></A>
The damages a victim may collect depend on the type of tort alleged. For injury to the body, a plaintiff can collect lost wages, diminished earning capacity, costs of medical care, pain, and suffering. For injury to property, a plaintiff can recover diminished value of the property, replacement costs, or cost of repair.
<P>
In a lawsuit alleging intentional misconduct, the plaintiff can often recover punitive damages in addition to any awards for injuries, pain, and suffering. Punitive damages, designed to punish people or organizations for unlawful acts, are often very large sums of money. Until recently, there were few limits to punitive damages. Although federal and state legislatures have recently passed laws capping punitive damages in certain types of cases, it can still be to the plaintiff's advantage to convince a jury that injuries were the result of an intentional act and not mere negligence.
<P>
A wrongful death lawsuit is a lawsuit filed by the surviving relatives of a person. For example, under Minnesota law, any dependent heirs, such as sons or daughters, of a person killed by a defective product can sue the manufacturer for loss of that person's future income. Surviving relatives cannot, however, sue a manufacturer to collect damages for the pain and suffering of a person wrongfully killed by a manufacturer's defective product. However, the estate of the deceased person can sue to collect money needed to pay any bills for medical treatment received by the person before he or she died.
<P>
A surviving spouse can sue for damages to recover for loss of advice, comfort, assistance, and protection. Minnesota also has a fetal protection law that allows wrongful death lawsuits to be filed if a manufacturer's defective product or a car accident causes the death of a viable fetus.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Suing the Government </STRONG></H3></A>
There was a time when citizens could not sue the government for torts committed by government employees. The federal and state governments enjoyed complete immunity from tort lawsuits. This immunity has been partially waived, but there are limits on tort actions against the government. Although the federal government and most states now permit suits for personal injuries suffered because of the negligence of a government employee or as a result of a dangerous condition on government property, there are limits on how much can be collected and when a suit must be initiated.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="130"><H2><STRONG>Areas of Personal Injury Practice </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Lawyers practicing personal injury law generally fall into one of four practice areas: product liability, professional malpractice, general accidents and injuries, and Workers' Compensation.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Product Liability </STRONG></H3></A>
Injuries resulting from defective products are the basis of some personal injury lawsuits. Product liability lawsuits frequently receive attention in the media. Stories of people recovering damages for faulty breast implants, exploding gas tanks, or flammable children's clothing all make headlines. Because a faulty product line can injure many people, product liability lawsuits are sometimes brought as class action lawsuits in which many injured people, the class, bring one united lawsuit against the manufacturer, share legal costs, and split any award.
<P>
Product liability claims usually rely on one of three theories: strict liability, negligence, and breach of warranty. Each of these has its standards and possible damages. Often a single injury leads a plaintiff to bring claims under all three theories against the manufacturer. For example, a person injured when a microwave oven explodes might allege that the oven's manufacturer breached a warranty, negligently manufactured the oven, and that the oven was so dangerous that its manufacturer should be held strictly liable for all injuries it caused.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Strict Product Liability </STRONG></H3></A>
Strict liability makes the manufacturer of a product liable to the user of a product injured while using the product if the product was unreasonably dangerous. This theory focuses on the product itself. In Minnesota, a person alleging strict product liability must show that:
<UL>
<LI>The product was in a defective condition, so that it was unreasonably dangerous even if used for its intended purpose
<LI>The defect existed when the product left the manufacturer's control
<LI>The defect caused the plaintiff's injury
</UL>
For example, if a chair has a defective leg that makes it unsafe to sit in, the leg is defective when the chair leaves the manufacturer, and that weak leg causes injury to a person who falls after sitting down in the chair, the manufacturer can be strictly liable for damages.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG>Negligent Design or Manufacture </STRONG></H4></A>
Manufacturers can be sued for negligence. If a manufacturer negligently designs or manufactures a product, the manufacturer is liable to those hurt by the product. Unlike strict liability theory, which focuses on the product, negligence claims focus on the manufacturer's actions in designing and manufacturing the product. As in all negligence cases, the manufacturer can be found liable if a judge or jury finds that the manufacturer failed to exercise the degree of care that a reasonable manufacturer would exercise in manufacturing the product or that the product was not manufactured according to the manufacturer's own specifications.
<P>
Under this theory, the manufacturer of the faulty chair might be liable if the company did not conduct reasonable inspections to ensure that products were checked for defects before being sold to consumers. It is important to note that the manufacturer is not negligent merely for failing to produce a perfectly safe product. Minnesota courts use a reasonable care balancing test that asks jurors to balance the likelihood and seriousness of harm against the feasibility and burden of possible precautions that might have avoided the harm. For example, manufacturers might not be required to install a safety feature if doing so would make the product prohibitively expensive or impossible to use. In these cases, the manufacturer has a duty to warn users of the product of the risks associated with its use so that users can protect themselves. This is why ladders have so many warnings on them. No ladder can be made perfectly safe, so manufacturers warn consumers of their dangers. 
<P>
Some of the most convincing evidence of negligence is what other manufacturers of similar products do. If a manufacturer fails to take precautions or to provide warnings that are standard in the industry, there is a strong likelihood a jury may find the manufacturer was negligent.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG>Breach of Warranty </STRONG></H4></A>
Manufacturers can also be liable for product injuries caused by a breach of warranty. Breach of warranty lawsuits can involve the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a bundle of statutes adopted in Minnesota and other states to govern many commercial transactions. Under the UCC, a product must be fit for its intended purpose. If a consumer buys a product and is hurt while using it for a purpose for which it is clearly intended, the manufacturer can be liable. A product must also be fit for a particular purpose for which the seller knows the buyer is purchasing the item. A manufacturer can also make additional warranties to the consumer. The breach of any of these warranties can make the manufacturer liable to consumers hurt by the product. In some situations, a manufacturer is allowed to disclaim some of these warranties, so a plaintiff must check to determine which of the warranties apply.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Professional Malpractice </STRONG></H3></A>
A malpractice lawsuit can be brought against any kind of professional, including psychologists, clergy, accountants, financial advisors, doctors, and lawyers. Two common types of professional malpractice claims are those against doctors and lawyers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG>Legal Malpractice </STRONG></H4></A>
There is no precise definition of legal malpractice. Generally speaking, a lawyer commits legal malpractice when he or she fails to provide quality legal services to a client. Bad conduct that is not unique to lawyers may lead to a lawsuit, but does not constitute legal malpractice. For instance, a lawyer who misses deadlines, does inadequate preparation for a trial, or represents both sides in a dispute without informing both parties, commits legal malpractice. A lawyer who steals funds from the client, assaults, or defrauds the client, has committed a crime but probably has not committed legal malpractice. Many of the steps discussed in the <A HREF="c01.html">How to Hire an Attorney</A> Chapter can help a consumer avoid malpractice disputes.
<P>
A legal malpractice lawsuit generally has four elements: duty, breach, injury, and proximate causation. A judge or jury examines all four elements in a legal malpractice trial, and if any element is missing, the plaintiff cannot recover.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="200"><H4><STRONG><EM>Duty </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The duty a lawyer owes has two components. The lawyer must exercise the legal skill that a competent attorney would exercise and must meet all of his or her fiduciary obligations to the client. Fiduciary obligations include a duty of undivided loyalty to the client's interests and confidentiality. No lawyer is expected to know the law so well that he or she can give perfect answers to obscure legal questions. Lawyers are expected to know how to research issues and to recognize their limits when they reach an unsettled or unclear area of law. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="210"><H4><STRONG><EM>Breach </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
A lawyer commits a breach if he or she fails to do his or her duty. Breach is frequently the toughest element to prove in a legal malpractice lawsuit, because a lawyer can make mistakes and still not commit a breach. Law is an inexact science. Even competent lawyers frequently disagree on the best course of action in a particular legal matter. Sometimes, the strategy chosen is a combination of knowledge about the law and guesswork about how a judge or jury will react to the facts of a case. A client may be able to show that another lawyer would have pursued a different strategy, and still the client may be unable to show that the first lawyer committed a breach.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="220"><H4><STRONG><EM>Injury </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
A plaintiff must show that he or she was injured by the lawyer's breach of duty. A lawyer might miss a deadline, but if he or she is subsequently granted an extension, the client is not injured. If missing the deadline bars the plaintiff's claim, he or she could recover full damages. A lawyer might forget to assert a claim, but if the claim would have been denied anyway, the client has not been injured. Usually a plaintiff can only recover direct economic losses, such as the money needed to pay another attorney to re-do legal work or any fees or penalties paid, or for any interest income lost, because of an attorney's malpractice. It is difficult, although not impossible, to recover for speculative losses, what might have happened if a different lawyer had been hired, emotional losses, or legal expenses incurred hiring a new lawyer to sue the previous lawyer.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="230"><H4><STRONG><EM>Proximate Cause </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Finally, the client must show that the breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury. Proximate cause is a thorny legal concept that essentially asks whether the breach was sufficiently responsible for the injury that the lawyer should be held responsible. Proximate cause is easiest to prove if a lawyer misses a deadline or gives advice that is clearly wrong. In these cases, the client can usually show exactly what would have happened had the lawyer met the deadline or given correct advice. Proximate cause is more difficult to show where a lawyer pursues a wrong course of action in trial. In this case, the client has to show what the judge or jury would have done had the lawyer chosen another strategy. This can be difficult to show. The client needs to prove, to the judge or jury's satisfaction, what another lawyer would have done, and how the jury would have reacted to that strategy. The first lawyer might argue successfully that, even had a different strategy been pursued, the outcome of the case would have been the same. 
<P>
Attorneys who try legal malpractice cases have had increasing success recently with new theories of liability for legal malpractice. One trend focuses on attorney investments and financial dealings. Courts can find that a lawyer breached a fiduciary duty to a client by failing to reveal stock ownership in an opposing corporate party or by using insider information learned about the client to make profits in the stock market. Another growing trend is for the court to allow claims brought against lawyers by persons other than clients. For example, the beneficiaries under a client's will might bring a legal malpractice action against a lawyer who incorrectly drafted a deceased client's will if the beneficiaries are upset with their share of the estate. Depositors in a failed savings and loan company might sue lawyers who gave advice to the savings and loan.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="240"><H4><STRONG>Medical Malpractice </STRONG></H4></A>
Medical malpractice includes many forms of liability-producing conduct that occur in rendering medical services. Medical malpractice does not apply solely to medical doctors. Psychiatrists, dentists, nurses, and hospitals can be sued for medical malpractice. Wrongful conduct that is not unique to doctors or other health care professionals may give rise to a legal action, but does not meet the definition of medical malpractice. For example, a patient might bring a breach of contract claim against a doctor who fails to provide services agreed upon in a contract, or a patient might bring fraud charges against a doctor for misrepresenting his or her expertise. These are not medical malpractice claims.
<P>
A medical malpractice lawsuit generally has four elements: duty, breach, injury, and proximate causation. A judge or jury examines all four elements in a medical malpractice trial, and if any element is missing, the plaintiff cannot recover.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="250"><H4><STRONG><EM>Duty </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
A doctor who has agreed to treat a patient has a duty to that patient to use at least the same level of care that any other reasonably competent doctor would use to treat a condition under the same circumstances. One problem in determining duty is that the average jury member or judge may not be able to determine what a doctor should have done in a particular instance. Medical malpractice lawsuits require expert testimony from another doctor as to the standard of care that should have been given. The plaintiff needs an affidavit from a medical expert when starting a lawsuit.
<P>
There are many complex questions in deciding what testimony to allow. In every case, the judge must decide whether a doctor's actions are to be judged against all other doctors or only against doctors specializing in a particular type of practice. Some judges may allow evidence of what other doctors in the same region would do, while some judges allow testimony about what other doctors nationally would have done. Success in a medical malpractice case frequently depends on how a judge answers these questions. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="260"><H4><STRONG><EM>Breach </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
A person breaches a duty when he or she fails to use the same level of care another reasonably competent professional would exercise in the same circumstances. Breach is frequently the toughest point to prove in a medical malpractice lawsuit, because competent doctors frequently disagree on the best course of action in a particular medical matter. Like law, medicine is an inexact science. A client may show that another doctor would have taken a different course of action and still be unable to show the first doctor committed a breach. The plaintiff must prove the level of care a reasonably competent professional would have exercised and show that the defendant's actions fell short of that level.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="270"><H4><STRONG><EM>Injury </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Injury is usually not difficult to prove in medical malpractice actions. A patient dies, is left crippled, or perhaps has chronic pain. Often, it is the doctor who has most trouble disproving this element because it can be difficult to prove that a patient who claims to be injured is not injured. Many legitimate injuries, such as whiplash, have few quantifiable manifestations even though they cause their sufferers to feel pain.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="280"><H4><STRONG><EM>Proximate Cause </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Finally, proximate causation can be difficult for a patient to prove because a bad result does not necessarily equal malpractice. Even with excellent treatment, a patient might not recover totally from the condition for which he or she seeks treatment. A doctor accused of malpractice might be able to show that even had a different treatment been followed, the patient would have suffered identical injuries.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="290"><H4><STRONG><EM>Third-Party Lawsuits </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Third persons can sometimes bring medical malpractice lawsuits against doctors. For example, a person who gets an infectious disease from a friend might sue the friend's doctor for inadequately treating the disease. A person injured in an automobile accident might bring a medical malpractice lawsuit against the driver's doctor if the doctor medicated the patient without telling the patient not to operate a car afterward.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="300"><H4><STRONG><EM>Consent Forms </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Consent forms required by most doctors and hospitals typically include warnings that patients must assume all the risks of any surgical procedures. By signing one of these forms, a patient does not give up all right to sue if things go wrong. Such an agreement may not be valid if a doctor does not fully inform the patient of risks associated with a particular procedure. Even a valid consent form is no protection for a doctor who either performs surgery that goes beyond the consent given or who fails to perform a procedure according to well-accepted medical standards. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="310"><H2><STRONG>General Accidents and Injuries </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A broad variety of accidents and injuries can lead to personal injury lawsuits. Some of the most common are discussed in this chapter. Libel and slander are discussed in the <A HREF="c11.html">Arts, Entertainment &amp; Media Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="320"><H4><STRONG>Assault and Battery </STRONG></H4></A>
Many people believe that assault and battery are one action. They are actually two closely related but distinct actions. Assault is the attempt or threat to inflict injury on another person when coupled with the apparent ability to carry out the attempt or threat. Assault does not require actual physical contact. For example, if someone threatens to strike a neighbor and appears capable of carrying out the threat, the person making the threat may be liable for assault even though he or she never touches the neighbor. Battery is similar to assault but requires actual unwelcome physical contact. The physical contact need not be so strong as to injure the other person. For example, a person can commit battery by touching another person in an unwelcome sexual manner.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="330"><H4><STRONG>Illegal Confinement </STRONG></H4></A>
Illegal confinement, also known as false imprisonment, is confinement by force, threats of force, or physical barriers when one has no right to do so. Merchants are given a limited right to temporarily detain persons suspected of shoplifting. Under the shopkeepers' privilege, merchants who reasonably believe someone is attempting to leave a place of business without paying for an item or service can detain the person for questioning and notifying the police. A merchant who keeps the suspect longer than is reasonable or necessary under the circumstances can be liable for illegal confinement.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="340"><H4><STRONG>Landowner Liability </STRONG></H4></A>
There are several ways a landowner can be liable to someone injured on the landowner's property. Business owners and home owners can be sued if they do something wrong that causes others to be injured on their property. A business owner can sometimes be sued for injuries caused by people committing crimes on their property if the business owner did not take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of customers. An example of this type of case is a person being attacked in a parking lot and then suing the lot's owner for failing to provide security measures that could have prevented the attack.
<P>
In general, a landowner is not liable for the injuries of a trespasser, although the landowner must take reasonable care to protect the people he or she knows to come on to one's property for legitimate purposes, such as a letter carrier. Under a separate doctrine known as attractive nuisance theory, a landowner can be liable for injuries to children injured on his or her property if there is something on the landowner's property, like a swimming pool, that is dangerous, attractive to children, and the landowner fails to adequately ensure that children cannot get to the nuisance. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="350"><H4><STRONG>Automobile Accidents </STRONG></H4></A>
Automobile accidents account for a large percentage of the personal injury lawsuits filed. Minnesota requires its residents to buy no-fault motor vehicle insurance for their vehicles. The purpose of the act is to eliminate tort actions resulting from minor accidents because damages for injuries are settled without determining fault. Each person in an accident files a claim with his or her own insurance company asking for reimbursement for any medical bills resulting from the accident and for any economic losses such as lost wages. There is a $40,000 limit to these no-fault benefits, $20,000 for medical expenses and $20,000 for lost income, replacement services, funeral expenses, and certain survivors' benefits. In addition, Minnesota requires all vehicle owners to buy insurance to cover themselves if they have an accident with an uninsured or underinsured motorist. 
<P>
The no-fault act, however, does include a tort threshold that allows someone to sue for greater damages, including punitive damages if the victim:
<UL>
<LI>Is permanently injured
<LI>Is permanently disfigured
<LI>Dies
<LI>Is disabled for more than 60 days
<LI>Sustains more than $4000 in medical expenses
</UL>
If a person's injuries fall into one of these categories, he or she has the option of bringing a lawsuit, which does require proving fault. If a jury awards damages as a result of such a lawsuit, the law requires that the damage award be reduced by any amount of money already received under the no-fault benefit system.
<P>
<A NAME="360"><H3><STRONG>Workers' Compensation </STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota's workers' compensation system compensates workers for injuries occurring in the workplace. Without a Workers' Compensation system, workers injured on the job would have to prove that their employer's negligence led to the injury. Because the system does not require proving negligence, a worker injured on the job has a better chance of being compensated than if he or she is injured in some other way and has to file a civil lawsuit. Instead of filing suit, a worker notifies his or her employer of the injury and the employer then contacts its insurance carrier, which handles payment of any medical bills and other claims made by the employee. All employers subject to the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Act must either carry workers' compensation insurance or demonstrate they have the financial resources to cover any reasonably anticipated claims.
<P>
The trade-off for this relatively easy route to compensation is a limit to the amount of money that can be awarded for a work-related injury. With few exceptions, employers or their insurers are only required to pay for medical expenses, permanent injuries and/or lost wages. An employer cannot be made to pay for emotional distress such as pain and suffering. 
<P>
Often a worker contacts an attorney because the employer or its insurance carrier refuses to pay a worker's compensation claim, maintaining that either the injury was not work-related or that the benefits demanded exceed those justified for the injury. Sometimes a dispute arises after an employer stops making worker's compensation payments. When disputes arise, a worker has a variety of options, including an administrative conference, conciliation court, or as a final option, a hearing before a workers' compensation judge.
<P>
The most common way to resolve disputes is through a semi-formal administrative conference, subject to rules established by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry. At the conference, a Department representative acts as an informal mediator and referee who decides what kind of evidence can be discussed by those attending. Typically, the employer, an investigator from the insurance company if the employer is not self-insured, the Department representative, the injured employee, and the employee's attorney, if one has been hired, attend the conference. The goal of a conference is to reach a voluntary resolution to the dispute. If the parties cannot resolve their dispute, the Department representative issues a judgment that everyone is obliged to follow. Such a judgment can be appealed to the Department by anyone involved in the conference.
<P>
Going to conciliation court is another way to resolve disputes over a workers' compensation claim. Both the employer and employee, however, must agree to turn over the dispute to a conciliation court, and the amount of the dispute cannot exceed $5000. Either party can decide whether to be represented by an attorney in such a proceeding, a decision that should not be made lightly, because the decision of the conciliation court judge cannot be appealed.
Finally, a dispute over a workers' compensation claim can be taken to a special workers' compensation court, where a judge will formally hear evidence about the injury and will resolve the dispute in a written decision that both sides must follow. Anyone disagreeing with the decision can appeal it to the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals, and if still unsatisfied, to the Minnesota Supreme Court.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Arts, Entertainment &amp; Media Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
The law of arts, entertainment, and media crosses over many lines. A person involved in one of these areas may be confronted with issues on contracts, copyright, trademarks, constitutional rights, business organization, and tax. This chapter will highlight some of the specific issues a person may encounter in the areas of art, entertainment, or media law. The following chapters may also be useful: <A HREF="c09.html">Organizing a Business</A>, <A HREF="c05.html">Constitutional Law &amp; Civil Rights</A> , <A HREF="c07.html">Contract Law</A> , and <A HREF="c08.html">Intellectual Property</A>. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Protecting Creative Work </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
It is essential for artists to protect their rights in their creation. As discussed in the <A HREF="c08.html">Intellectual Property</A> Chapter, the law provides artists rights when creating an original work. These rights are exclusive to the creator; however, the creator may grant licenses to the work. Although the law grants the rights to the creator, it is up to him or her to protect and enforce those rights. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Copyright Infringement </STRONG></H3></A>
When a party uses a copyrighted work without authorization, and this use violates one of the artist's exclusive rights, infringement occurs. The owner of the copyright can bring a federal civil action against the infringer. The plaintiff in an infringement action must prove that he is the owner of the copyright and that the defendant infringed upon one of the plaintiff's exclusive rights. Copyright registration presumes that the person registered as the owner is the owner of the copyright. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that the defendant had access to the plaintiff's work and the defendant's work is substantially similar to the plaintiff's work. Once the plaintiff proves these two elements, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that the defendant's work was created independently. Before the infringement issue is resolved through a trial or settlement, a copyright owner can go to court and ask for a restraining order against the defendant to prevent the defendant from continuing the alleged infringement activity. If the activity is determined to be infringement by the court, it may grant an injunction, permanently barring the defendant's actions. A plaintiff who prevails in an infringement case can recover money damages as provided by statute or actual damages incurred as a result of the infringement, plus any profits made by the infringer. The choice of damages is made by the plaintiff. Attorney's fees may also be granted by the court in a successful infringement case. A defense to an infringement claim is that one is an innocent infringer. This is a person who relies on an authorized copy where the copyright notice has been omitted and he or she had no other reason to believe the work was protected. An innocent infringer is not liable for actual or statutory damages. 
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Trademark Registration of Names </STRONG></H3></A>
A general discussion of trademarks is included in the <A HREF="c08.html">Intellectual Property</A> Chapter; however, it is worth noting here the importance of artists and entertainers protecting their names. A trademark is a word, symbol, design, or a combination which identifies a party's goods and services and distinguishes them from another's goods and services. Artists and entertainers provide goods like paintings, compact discs, photographs, and poems, and provide services in live performances. An artist's or entertainer's name can sell merchandise and tickets. The name used by an artist or entertainer can be a trademark or service mark. Because an artist's or entertainer's creativity and work have gone into producing his or her goods and services, it may be prudent to protect his or her name by trademark or service mark registration. As in copyright infringement, a party who believes her trademark has been infringed may bring a private, civil action for money damages and/or injunctive relief.
<P>
Artists and entertainers doing business under a name other than their own, who are not incorporated, are required to file that name with the Minnesota Secretary of State's office. Information on registering an assumed name is included in the <A HREF="c09.html">Organizing a Business Chapter</A>.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Licenses </STRONG></H3></A>
A person may derive income from reproducing, distributing, performing, or displaying a copyrighted work, or by creating additional works based upon a copyrighted work. This income can be generated by either the artist or by a party who buys the rights from the artist to do any or all of those activities. The buyer of rights in a work has a license. This license may be exclusive or non-exclusive. The artist or entertainer may receive a flat fee or a percentage of the profits for the license. It is important to receive legal representation before a person relinquishes rights and grants a license to a creation.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Artists' Moral Rights </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
It is believed that there is a unique bond between an artist and the work he or she creates. Based on this belief, there are rights which are specific for artists. These rights are known as moral rights (droit moral). Moral rights protect, among other things, the integrity of an artist's work so that it cannot be changed without his or her permission. Copyright protection is part of artists' moral rights. 
<P>
Moral rights originated in France and are recognized in a number of countries including, in a limited way, the United States. However, the United States does not recognize all moral rights. There are also differences between states in protecting artists' moral rights. If an artist wants certain rights that are not provided by law, one option is to put these rights into a contract. The following are some of the moral rights.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Right to Create </STRONG></H3></A>
The right of an artist to create or not create a work is included in moral rights. Disputes over the right to create usually arise when an artist refuses to create or complete a work for which he or she was commissioned. Artists are rarely forced to create because courts are reluctant to force someone to perform services. The party contracting for the work may also be reluctant to have the artist forced to finish the work. However, an artist who fails to fulfill his or her duties under a contract is liable for damages.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Name Attribution </STRONG></H3></A>
In 1990, the federal Visual Artists Rights Act (VARA) was passed. This act applies to paintings, drawings, prints, or sculptures, and amends the Copyright Law by providing certain artists with attribution and integrity rights. VARA permits an artist to claim credit for the work he or she has created. The artist also has the right to stop the use of his or her name as the artist of a work if the work is distorted, mutilated, or modified, and credit to such work would be prejudicial to the artist's honor or reputation. 
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Integrity </STRONG></H3></A>
VARA provides artists the right to prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of work which would be prejudicial to the artist's honor or reputation. VARA also provides the artist the right to prevent destruction of a work of recognized stature. What constitutes a work of recognized stature is determined by scholars, curators, and collectors. This protection may be limited if the work is placed on a building.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Artists' Economic Rights </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER> 
Artists' economic rights give an artist the right to participate in the profits from resales of his or her work. Authors and entertainers typically enjoy royalty payments from subsequent reproduction and syndication. Fine artists, on the other hand, receive payment upon the initial sale only and unfortunately fail to receive profits from the resale of their work. The United States and Minnesota do not provide economic rights to artists. If an artist includes in a sales contract a provision requiring a share of profits from any resale, enforcement of such a provision may be a problem.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Independent Contractor or Employee </STRONG></H3></A>
It is essential that an artist or entertainer who is hired to create a work determine whether he or she is an independent contractor or an employee. As stated in the <A HREF="c08.html">Intellectual Property</A> Chapter, copyright does not vest in an employee creating a work, but it does vest in an independent contractor hired to create a work. An employee creating work for her employer has created a "work for hire" and the copyright belongs to the employer. A person who has been hired to create work for another and is not an employee, retains the copyright unless there is a written relinquishment of these rights. 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Taxation </STRONG></H3></A>
The method of income taxation depends on whether a person is an employee or an independent contractor. Employers withhold and pay taxes for employees, while independent contractors are responsible for paying their own taxes. The <A HREF="c15.html">Employment Law</A> Chapter has information on what constitutes an employee and an independent contractor.
<P>
There are a few other tax issues on which an artist or entertainer may wish to consult a qualified attorney. If an artist or entertainer is conducting a business, expenses related to this business may be deducted from his or her income and result in paying fewer taxes. One should make sure he or she is applying for deductions to their fullest benefit. Also, because the income of artists and entertainers can be sporadic and result in years of low income and other years of higher income, a person may want to determine if there is a way that the income could be staggered to pay a lower tax rate and defer the payment of taxes. Finally, artists may wish to make charitable contributions of work and take a deduction on their tax return. Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue Service only allows artists to deduct the costs of the materials and supplies used and not the value of time, services, or the fair market value of the work.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Consignment </STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota Statutes state that when an artist delivers a work of art to an art dealer for the purpose of exhibition or sale on a compensation basis, the acceptance of the work by the art dealer constitutes a consignment unless there is an outright sale. A consignment of art means the art dealer is an agent of the artist for the purpose of sale or exhibition, the art is held in trust by the art dealer and not subject to the art dealer's creditors, the art dealer is responsible for any damage or loss of art while it is in his or her possession, and proceeds from the sale of the art must be held in trust for the benefit of the artist. 
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Entertainment Agencies </STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota Statutes require that any person involved in procuring, offering, or promising employment or engagements for three or more artists or groups of artists at any one time, or who has a written contract or a verbal agreement with an establishment or an individual to provide artists for one or more engagements, must be licensed as an entertainment agency by the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry. Entertainment agencies are also required to submit to the Department of Labor and Industry the forms of contracts they will use and a schedule of fees to be charged and collected. 
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Contracts </STRONG></H3></A>
The <A HREF="c07.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter summarizes the components of a valid contract. In addition, this chapter discusses a number of items which an artist or entertainer can address in a contract. It is essential that when an artist or entertainer contemplates relinquishing rights or signing a long-term performance contract, he or she receive legal counsel, as contracts such as these can be complex and have far-reaching effects. Also, it almost goes without saying that artists and entertainers should be cautious about the people with whom they enter into contracts. Although one may have a binding legal agreement, if it is with an unscrupulous person, enforcing such a contract may be very difficult.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>Obscenity </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Although the United States Constitution guarantees one the freedom of expression, this right has limitations, one of which is obscenity. Obscene material is not entitled to constitutional protection. The United States Supreme Court created the following test to use in determining whether material is obscene or not: whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest; whether the works depict or describe, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value. This standard is difficult to apply in the abstract, and can vary widely from community to community. See the <A HREF="c05.html">Constitutional Law &amp; Civil Rights</A> Chapter for a discussion of obscenity with regard to free speech. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="170"><H2><STRONG>Defamation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The down side of free speech, however, is that injudicious speech can sometimes lead to a defamation suit. Defamation is a false statement which damages another person's reputation or character. Statements that falsely accuse one of a crime, dishonesty in business, or unchastity will probably be found defamatory. Libel is written defamation and slander is spoken defamation. There have been many defamation cases, and the requirements for proving a defamation case are many and varied depending on who the plaintiff is and what was said or written. This section will outline the basic components of a defamation case and the possible defenses. It should be noted that an estate of a dead person cannot bring an action for defamation. 
<P>
A defamatory statement must be included in a statement of fact, not a statement of opinion, to be actionable. There is a difference between stating a person is "a jerk" (opinion) and a person is "a convicted murderer" (fact). Statements are defamatory if they injure a person's reputation, or expose him or her to contempt, ridicule, degradation, or hatred. The statement must also be false. No matter how damaging a statement, if it is true, there is no action for defamation, although there may be grounds for a slightly different lawsuit, such as harassment. In order to bring an action for defamation, the statement must be communicated to a third party. This is called publication. The statement must also identify the party being defamed. A person need not be identified by name, but a reasonable person must be able to identify the plaintiff from the statement.
<P>
Once a plaintiff in a defamation case has proven that the defendant published a false, defamatory statement of fact about the plaintiff, the plaintiff must prove that the statement was published with either actual malice or negligence. The standard used depends on whether the plaintiff is considered a public figure or a private person. A public figure can be a celebrity, politician, police officer, or citizen active in public policy. If the plaintiff is held to be a public figure, he or she must prove that the defendant acted maliciously by deliberately failing to verify the statements. A plaintiff who is a private person must prove that the defendant was negligent in publishing the statement and should have known that the statement was false. 
<P>
As mentioned before, truth is a defense to a defamation action. Also, proof that a statement was an opinion or that the statement was made during a judicial or legislative proceeding, or made by a government official while conducting business, are defenses.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Bankruptcy Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
If a person falls behind in paying off debts and it appears that he or she will not be able to make payments as they come due, it is better to take action rather than let one's financial situation deteriorate. For many people, the answer to financial problems is to declare bankruptcy, a legal proceeding in federal court that allows a person to be released from the obligation of paying some or all of his or her debts. 
<P>
It is often said that bankruptcy gives a debtor a fresh start, but filing bankruptcy is not a panacea for all financial problems because it is not painless. Declaring bankruptcy can seriously damage a person's credit rating, making it difficult to establish credit or take out loans. Many people can work themselves out of even very serious debt without ever going near a bankruptcy court, so declaring bankruptcy should not be an automatic first step for someone experiencing financial problems.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Bankruptcy Code </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Bankruptcy law is federal law. The United States Constitution grants to the federal government the exclusive right to make bankruptcy laws. Pursuant to this authority, the federal government created the Bankruptcy Code, Bankruptcy Rules of Procedure, and a system of Bankruptcy courts to handle bankruptcies throughout the country. This is not to say that bankruptcy law is uniform throughout the nation, however. Although the federal government has final authority to make all bankruptcy laws, in some instances the Bankruptcy Code grants to individual states the power to deviate from federal rules in limited circumstances. For instance, the bankruptcy code allows a debtor to keep certain assets, known as exempt assets, that creditors cannot reach to satisfy a debt. The bankruptcy code gives states the authority to expand the categories of exempt assets if they choose. Thus, the amount of assets beyond the reach of creditors differs depending upon the state where the debtor files for bankruptcy. 
<P>
The Bankruptcy Code creates different categories of bankruptcy, known as chapters, appropriate for different debtors. The two most common forms of consumer bankruptcy are Chapter 7 and Chapter 13.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Chapter 7 </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The vast majority of bankruptcy cases are Chapter 7 cases. Chapter 7 is often called liquidation bankruptcy. Chapter 7 is commonly used by individuals who want to walk away from their debt simply, but it may also be used by businesses that want to terminate their operations and liquidate their assets. When a debtor files Chapter 7, the bankruptcy court appoints a person to administer the case. This person is called the trustee. The debtor turns over some or all of his or her debts and assets to the trustee. The trustee then liquidates the property by selling it off and dividing the resulting cash among the creditors. 
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Step 1: Petition and Schedules </STRONG></H3></A>
A Chapter 7 case begins when the debtor files a petition with the bankruptcy court. Any individual, partnership, or corporation can file Chapter 7 regardless of the amount of debt or whether the debtor is solvent or insolvent. The petition should be filed with the court serving the area where the debtor lives or where his or her principal place of business or assets are located. 
<P>
Along with the petition, or shortly thereafter, the debtor files with the court several schedules listing current income and expenditures, a statement of financial affairs, all executor contracts, existing or potential lawsuits by or against the debtor, and any recent transfers of assets. If a debtor does not reveal a debt in these schedules, the bankruptcy court cannot discharge or cancel that debt. Any debt omitted from these schedules is called a non-scheduled debt and is not affected by the bankruptcy.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Step 2: Stay </STRONG></H3></A>
Filing the petition automatically stops (stays) all of the listed creditors from trying to collect the money owed them. The stay arises automatically, without any judicial action, although the court usually does notify creditors of the filing of the petition. The stay is effective from the time of filing, even if the creditors do not receive notice until much later. As long as the stay is in effect, creditors cannot generally start or continue actions against the debtor to collect on the debt. Lawsuits, garnishment actions, even telephone calls to the debtor must cease.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Step 3: Creditors Meeting </STRONG></H3></A>
After the debtor files a Chapter 7 petition, the court appoints a trustee to administer the case and liquidate assets. The trustee usually calls a meeting of the debtor, the debtor's attorney, and the creditors. The debtor must attend this meeting. Creditors may attend in order to ask questions, and examine documents concerning the debtor's financial affairs and property. In most consumer bankruptcies, all of the debtor's assets are either exempt or subject to valid liens, so there are no assets for creditors to pursue. In these cases, known as "no asset" cases, it is likely that no creditors show up at the creditors meeting. If it appears that a case will have assets to pursue, creditors usually show up at this meeting to gather information about the case because they plan to ask the bankruptcy judge to declare some of the debts non-dischargeable, they plan to challenge the exempt status of some asset, or they plan to file claims.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Step 4: Claims </STRONG></H3></A>
After the creditors meeting, the creditors can file a claim against the debtor with the court. If the case has non-exempt assets free of security interests, these will be used to satisfy valid claims.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Step 5: Liquidation, Discharge, and Reaffirmation </STRONG></H3></A>
The trustee's primary role is to sell off the debtor's non-exempt assets in a way that maximizes the amount the creditors receive for their claims. Revenues from assets subject to security interests, such as property subject to a mortgage, is used to satisfy the debt on the particular asset. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy concludes when the trustee sells the debtor's property, distributes the cash to the creditors, and discharges the remaining debt. The discharge extinguishes the debtor's remaining personal liability on the debt. Certain items are non-dischargeable and thus unaffected by the bankruptcy. Non-dischargeable debts include:
<UL>
<LI>Alimony and child support
<LI>Most tax obligations
<LI>Most student loans
<LI>Liability for damages resulting from willful or malicious acts
Creditors can ask the court to deny an individual debtor a discharge. The grounds for denial of discharge are extremely narrow and requests for denial are rarely granted. Grounds for denial include:
<LI>The debtor fails to adequately explain the loss of assets
<LI>The debtor perjured himself or herself or failed to obey lawful orders of the court
<LI>The debtor fraudulently transfers, conceals, or destroys property that should be in the estate
</UL>
Because a secured creditor has rights that permit him or her to seize pledged property, a debtor may want to reaffirm a debt even after it has been discharged if the debtor wants to keep the property. A reaffirmation is an agreement between the debtor and the secured creditor that the creditor will not exercise his or her right to take back the asset so long as the debtor makes payments.
<P>
A debtor must wait six years before he or she can file for Chapter 7 again.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="90"><H2><STRONG>Chapter 13 </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Chapter 13 bankruptcy is often referred to as a "wage-earner plan," because it is generally used by people with stable incomes who want to repay at least some of their debts but are currently unable to do so. A debtor may file Chapter 13 bankruptcy if his or her financial crisis is temporary and he or she thinks that his or her income will grow enough in the next few years to pay off all debts. The main advantage to Chapter 13 is that the debtor is allowed to keep his or her property while a court-approved repayment plan is in effect. However, only individuals with less than $100,000 in unsecured debts and less than $350,000 in secured debts are eligible to file a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Corporations and partnerships cannot file Chapter 13 bankruptcies. In addition, the debtor must have a job or prove to the court that he or she has the ability to earn stable income.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Step 1: Petition </STRONG></H3></A>
The petition required for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is similar to that described above for Chapter 7. The debtor provides the court with the following:
<UL>
<LI>Lists of all creditors, including the amount and nature of claims
<LI>The source, amount and frequency of debtor income
<LI>Lists of all property
<LI>Detailed descriptions of the debtor's monthly living expenses, including food, clothing, shelter, utilities, taxes, transportation, and medical care
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Step 2: Stay </STRONG></H3></A>
Filing a Chapter 13 petition automatically stays most actions against the debtor. So long as the stay is in effect, creditors generally cannot start or continue lawsuits, garnishment actions, or even phone the debtor demanding repayment. Chapter 13 also has a special stay provision that prohibits creditors from collecting consumer debt owed to the debtor by a third person.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Step 3: Plan </STRONG></H3></A>
Within 15 working days of filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the debtor presents a plan to the court that spells out how he or she proposes to pay off debts over a three-year period or, by permission, over a five-year period. The plan must provide for the full payment of claims entitled to priority. For reasons of public policy, the Bankruptcy Code has several categories of unsecured claims that have priority over other unsecured claims including:<UL>
<LI>Costs of administering the bankruptcy
<LI>Employees' wages, salaries, and commissions
<LI>Contributions to employee benefit plans
<LI>Deposits accepted by the debtor for personal items or services that the debtor did not deliver
<LI>Taxes
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Step 4: Creditors Meeting </STRONG></H3></A>
A creditors meeting is usually held about 20 to 40 days after the petition is filed. The debtor and trustee must attend the conference, but creditors have the option to attend. Trustee and creditors can question the debtor about financial affairs and terms of the plan. Any problems with the plan are usually solved during or shortly after this meeting. 
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Step 5: Confirmation Hearing </STRONG></H3></A>
After the creditors meeting, the bankruptcy court determines at a bankruptcy hearing whether the plan is feasible and meets the standards for confirmation set by the bankruptcy code. Creditors are allowed to object to confirmation. The most common objections are that the debtor has not pledged sufficient disposable income to the plan or that the creditors receive less than they would if the debtors assets were liquidated in a Chapter 7 proceeding.
<P>
For most plans in Minnesota, the Bankruptcy Court allows a five-year repayment plan. The court occasionally reduces the size of some of the dischargeable debts. During this three- or five-year period, a portion of the debtor's paycheck goes to a court-appointed trustee who divides the money among the debtor's creditors.
<P>
If approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the plan prevents a debtor's creditors from garnishing wages or repossessing property.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Step 6: Discharge </STRONG></H3></A>
A Chapter 13 debtor is entitled to a discharge if he or she successfully completes all payments under an approved plan. The discharge releases the debtor from all debts provided for or disallowed under the plan. Creditors provided for under the plan may not start or continue actions against the debtor to collect a discharged obligation.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Advantages of Chapter 13 over Chapter 7 </STRONG></H3></A>
Filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy has advantages over a Chapter 7 liquidation. Unlike a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, there is not a six-year waiting period before the debtor can file bankruptcy again. Thus, with only a few exceptions, the debtor can file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy at any time after filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy. This means that if the debtor finds that he or she cannot make the payments specified in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan, he or she can still act to discharge debts through a Chapter 7 liquidation.
<P>
The non-dischargeable debts under a Chapter 13 bankruptcy are generally the same as the non-dischargeable debts in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. However, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows the debtor to discharge a few more types of debts than does a Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
<P>
If the debtor owns an unincorporated business, such as a freelance consulting business, she can continue to own and operate the business under a Chapter 13 plan. Under a Chapter 7 liquidation, a Bankruptcy Court may order that such a business or its assets be sold. Also, the automatic stay of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy protects any co-signers of consumer debts, whereas a Chapter 7 offers only very limited protection of others who may share the debtor's obligation.
<P>
Finally, certain homeowners may prefer a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, because in many instances it allows them to make up past payments on their mortgage. When someone falls behind in making mortgage payments or is in actual default, a lender quite often "accelerates" the payments. For a debtor in this situation, filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy may allow her to "decelerate" or reduce those monthly payments and may even reinstate the mortgage by wiping out a prior default. However, the same advice given above to a homeowner considering a Chapter 7 bankruptcy also applies here. If saving a house is the primary reason for filing bankruptcy, it is wise to talk through all the possibilities with an attorney, because the laws governing this area are extremely complicated and it is easy to make a costly misstep.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="170"><H2><STRONG>Conversion </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Bankruptcy Code allows a debtor to convert a Chapter 7 case to Chapter 13 or vice versa as long as the debtor meets the eligibility requirements of the new chapter and the case has not previously been converted from the new chapter. In other words, the debtor is not allowed to repeatedly convert the case from one chapter to another.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Involuntary Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Unlike the types of situations described above, where the debtor decides whether to file bankruptcy, in an involuntary bankruptcy creditors force the debtor into bankruptcy. Under certain conditions, creditors can petition the Bankruptcy Court to initiate a Chapter 7 or 11 (but not a Chapter 13) bankruptcy against a debtor. The court will only accept such a petition if it is signed by at least three creditors who are owed a total of at least $5000 in unsecured debt. If a debtor has fewer than 12 unsecured creditors, however, just one unsecured creditor owed at least $5000 can file an involuntary bankruptcy petition.
<P>
Involuntary bankruptcy is rare, but if someone does file a petition against a debtor in Bankruptcy Court, he or she has an opportunity to file an answer to the petition and refute any charges made against him or her by creditors in the petition. If the judge sides with the debtor, the court dismisses the petition and can make the creditors pay reasonable attorney's fees and any money the debtor loses in defending the case. In addition, if the judge decides that the petition was filed in bad faith the court may also award the debtor punitive damages.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="190"><H2><STRONG>Effects of Declaring Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The old adage that it is better to know how to swim before jumping into deep water applies to anyone considering filing bankruptcy. 
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Poor Credit Rating </STRONG></H3></A>
Consumer laws allow credit agencies to list on reports of a person's credit history all of his or her bankruptcy filings in the preceding ten years. This means that mortgage companies, banks, credit card companies, landlords, employers, and all others who can legally obtain a copy of a person's credit report will know about his or her troubled financial past. Filing bankruptcy can make it difficult to obtain credit for those ten years.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Creditor Scrutiny </STRONG></H3></A>
One of the first events in a bankruptcy is a meeting between the debtor and all his or her creditors. At this meeting, the creditors and a court-appointed trustee are allowed to examine all of the debtor's financial records, such as bank statements and loan documents, and ask questions about how money has been spent. For anyone with anything unsavory or illegal to hide, such as gambling debts with a bookie, a bankruptcy proceeding can be incriminating.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Cost </STRONG></H3></A>
Understandably, bankruptcy attorneys are very careful about a clients' ability to pay legal bills. Most bankruptcy attorneys usually collect enough money in advance from their near-bankrupt clients to handle a typical bankruptcy filing. This may be more than some clients can pay, especially if there is any contest with creditors. In addition, the trustee in charge of a bankruptcy case is paid by commission, a percentage of the money that he or she distributes to pay creditors.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="230"><H2><STRONG>Other Forms of Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There are three other kinds of bankruptcy filings that are not discussed more fully in this chapter because of their limited relevance to consumers. Knowing about them can help one better understand bankruptcy options:
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 9 </STRONG></H3></A>
Chapter 9 is a very rare form of bankruptcy available only to municipalities.
<P>
<A NAME="250"><H3><STRONG>Chapter 11 </STRONG></H3></A>
Chapter 11 is available for corporations, partnerships, and individuals but is mostly used by troubled corporations and partnerships. Chapter 11 allows the debtor to remain in operation while being sheltered from some of its debts. 
<P>
<A NAME="260"><H3><STRONG>Farm Bankruptcies </STRONG></H3></A>
Chapter 12 is available only to family farmers and is designed to allow farmers to stay in business while attempting to pay off their debts. Chapter 12 offers several advantages over other bankruptcy chapters because it recognizes the seasonal nature of most agricultural income, the difficulty of predicting in advance how much a farmer will profit from a crop, and the fact that most farmers need much more credit than do most individuals. Chapter 12 was originally scheduled to be repealed on October 1, 1993, but the repeal date was pushed back to October 1, 1998.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="270"><H2><STRONG>Transfers to Avoid Losing an Asset in Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Some transfers that are valid outside the context of bankruptcy are invalid in bankruptcy. The Bankruptcy Code empowers a bankruptcy trustee to invalidate certain transfers made prior to a bankruptcy filing.
<P>
<A NAME="280"><H3><STRONG>Fraudulent Conveyances </STRONG></H3></A>
The Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act is designed to remove any temptation a debtor may have to hide property, by giving it to a relative, for example, before declaring bankruptcy. Any transfer of the debtor's assets made within 90 days of filing bankruptcy or one year if a relative or business associate is involved, is carefully scrutinized by the Bankruptcy Court. If the court determines that the debtor attempted to defraud creditors by selling property at a below-market price, the court can order that property or other assets be given over to the trustee. Anything sold at a reasonable market value before a bankruptcy filing cannot be recovered by the court under the rules of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act.
<P>
<A NAME="290"><H3><STRONG>Preferences </STRONG></H3></A>
A preference occurs when a debtor treats one creditor more favorably than another. For instance, if a debtor with only $100 owes $100 each to creditors A and B and pays A completely, leaving nothing for B, then A has received a preference. Bankruptcy condemns preferences if the following conditions exist:
<UL>
<LI>Transfer is for the benefit of a creditor
<LI>Transfer is made for debt owed prior to the initiation of bankruptcy
<LI>Debtor is insolvent at the time of transfer
<LI>Transfer is made 90 days before filing of the bankruptcy or one year if made to an insider such as a relative or director of a corporate debtor
</UL>
<P>
Creditors receiving preferences can be forced to return them to the debtor's estate.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="300"><H2><STRONG>Collection Agencies And The Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Although not a part of Bankruptcy Code, laws regulating collection agencies are usually of concern to anyone experiencing financial difficulties. Both state and federal laws limit the kinds of activities that a collection agency can engage in as it tries to collect a debt. These laws only apply to third-party collection agencies and not to in-house collections. That is, if a creditor tries on its own to induce its delinquent accounts to pay their overdue bills it is not required to follow the laws governing collection agencies. But if a creditor turns collection matters over to a collection agency, the collection agency's employees must follow the rules. Laws regulating debt collection agencies are discussed more fully in the <A HREF="c06.html">Consumer Protection</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="310"><H2><STRONG>Alternatives to Bankruptcy </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Anyone in financial trouble has undoubtedly received many letters from creditors demanding payment on debts owed. Even a very demanding creditor may have a change of heart once a debtor mentions the possibility of filing bankruptcy, because creditors know that bankruptcy means that they may only get a fraction of what is owed them.
<P>
Anyone confident that his or her financial problems are only temporary may want to consider asking major creditors to accept reduced payments for a short period or asking for a short delay in making payments. Provided that the debtor has not already given creditors reason to doubt his or her sincerity, e.g., by completely ignoring their letters or by consistently breaking promises, chances are good that creditors will agree on one of these plans.
<P>
As mentioned above, creditors know that bankruptcy means they will probably get just a small fraction of the total sum owed them. Creditors also know that if they sue to collect their money, they undergo the hassle of going to a judge to get a court order to garnish the debtor's wages. This is time-consuming and costly. All these factors make it more likely that a creditor will agree to a repayment plan.
<P>
Many creditors can be understanding if approached with a reduced or delayed payment plan accurately spelling out the debtor's financial situation and showing that the debtor is trying to spread out his or her meager resources in a way that tries to please everyone. A consumer credit counselor can help set up such a plan. Credit counselors can help to analyze and organize one's finances to set up a deferred or reduced payment plan. 
<P>
In a typical case, a credit counselor devises a repayment plan that is then described in a form letter to be mailed to the debtor's major creditors. There are both advantages and disadvantages to using credit counselors, however. On the plus side, creditors who see that a debtor has taken the effort to consult with a credit advisor may be more likely to accept a repayment plan because seeing a credit counselor shows that the debtor is serious about getting out of debt. But credit counseling services also charge fees for their work, which may be more than an already-stressed budget can handle. However, there are some nonprofit agencies that offer credit counseling for a sliding-scale fee.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Criminal Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
This chapter outlines how the criminal justice system operates, describes some of the most common criminal infractions, rights of persons accused of crimes, and rights of crime victims. Domestic abuse and protective orders are covered in the <A HREF="c16.html">Family Law</A> Chapter. Criminal procedure is covered in the <A HREF="c03.html">Process of a Case: Civil &amp; Criminal</A> Chapter. Private causes of action that result from criminal conduct are covered in the <A HREF="c10.html">Accidents &amp; Personal Injury Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Criminal Codes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Criminal law defines conduct that is prohibited and the range of penalties that can be imposed for violating these prohibitions. Persons who violate criminal laws can lose their freedom by either being jailed or imprisoned or, in some states, by being executed. All crimes are defined by statutes. These statutes are collected and organized into codes known as criminal codes. In addition to the Minnesota state criminal code, which applies only in Minnesota, the federal government has a criminal code that regulates certain crimes nationwide. Most criminal activity violates either a state law or a federal law, not both. An important area regulated by both federal and state criminal codes is drug crimes. A person who violates the laws governing controlled substances (which can be illegal drugs such as marijuana and cocaine or a legally prescribed drug such as codeine) can be prosecuted in either state or federal court or both.
<P>
Every crime is statutorily defined by a list of elements. In a criminal trial, a prosecutor attempts to prove that all the elements of the crime that the defendant is accused of committing are met. If a court or jury finds that all the elements of the crime are met, the accused is guilty of the crime.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Offenses </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Criminal codes penalize a broad variety of activities. Criminal codes make a major distinction between felonies and misdemeanors. Felonies are crimes for which a person can be sentenced to more than one year in prison. Misdemeanors are divided into three categories: gross misdemeanors, misdemeanors, and petty misdemeanors.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Alcohol and Drug-Related Traffic Offenses </STRONG></H3></A>
Alcohol and drug-related traffic offenses, commonly known as driving while intoxicated (DWI) offenses, are frequently prosecuted. There are several types of offenses with which a person can be prosecuted as DWI. If a person's blood alcohol content (BAC) is .10 or greater and the person is in physical control of a motor vehicle, he or she is considered to be driving while intoxicated. Even if the BAC is .10 or more within two hours after the person was driving, the same criminal charge applies.
<P>
Another type of charge is simply being under the influence of alcohol or drugs. If a person's ability to drive is adversely affected by alcohol or a controlled substance, even if the BAC is not over the limit, the person is said to be driving under the influence. Generally, if the evidence shows that a person's BAC was .04 or more, that is sufficient to prove he or she was under the influence. It is also a DWI-related crime in Minnesota to refuse to submit to a chemical blood, breath, or urine test if the person is asked to do so by a police officer.
<P>
DWI laws do not require a person actually to be driving a car to be guilty of the offense. All that is required is that the person be "in physical control" of the vehicle. Physical control can mean sitting in a car, even without the keys in the ignition. Also, the vehicle does not have to be a car. DWI-related offenses can apply to farm tractors or boats.
<P>
The first time a person violates any of these provisions is a misdemeanor. However, it is a gross misdemeanor to violate any of the DWI-related provisions twice in five years or three times in ten years. It is also a gross misdemeanor to commit a DWI-related crime while there is a child in the vehicle.
<P>
Generally, when a person is convicted of DWI, his or her driver's license will be revoked for 30 days, and a chemical dependency assessment charge of $125 will be imposed. Refusal to submit to alcohol or drug testing will result in automatic license suspension for 90 days. If the person convicted of DWI is under 21 years of age, the license or permit may be revoked for six months. Subsequent offenses bring more severe penalties. When a person commits DWI-related crimes repeatedly, he is described as a "habitual offender," and the penalties for additional offenses increase to include mandatory imprisonment. In some cases, a person who has committed repeated DWI-related crimes may have the following penalties imposed:
<UL>
<LI>The motor vehicle may be impounded
<LI>The person may be required to abstain from consuming alcohol and controlled substances
<LI>The person may be required to submit to treatment or rehabilitation
<LI>Probation
<LI>The person may lose driving privileges for life
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Assault </STRONG></H3></A>
As discussed in the <A HREF="c10.html">Accidents &amp; Personal Injury Law</A> Chapter, Minnesota law distinguishes between assault and battery in private lawsuits. Minnesota's criminal code does not distinguish between assault and battery; instead, criminal assault includes both. Assault is defined as an act done with intent to cause another to fear immediate bodily harm or death or intentionally inflicting or attempting to inflict bodily harm on another. Assault is further broken down into degrees depending on whether injury is actually inflicted, the identity of the victim, and the degree of injury. The different treatment of assault and battery between the civil and criminal systems can be confusing. For example, attacking someone with a knife is called assault in the criminal code and battery under the civil system. Threatening to attack someone with a knife without actually doing so equals assault under both the criminal and civil codes.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Harassment and Stalking </STRONG></H3></A>
Harassment and stalking are closely related crimes. Harassment and stalking can include:
<UL>
<LI>Repeated, intrusive, and unwanted acts, words, or gestures intended to 	 	adversely affect the safety, security, or privacy of another
<LI>Targeted residential picketing directed at a particular residence that interferes  		with the safety, security, or privacy of its residents
<LI>Pattern of attending public events after being notified that one's presence is  		harassing to another
<LI>Repeated unwanted phone calls, letters, telegrams, or packages
</UL>
Harassment and stalking can be difficult to prove, so it is important that a victim try to document the activities as much as possible. Letters, photographs, journal entries describing dates, times, places, and witnesses can be helpful in prosecuting a harasser or stalker.
<P>
Someone being victimized by a family or household member can seek an order of protection from district court to protect the victim from abuse. Anyone can ask a state district court for a restraining order to protect himself or herself from anyone else, whether or not the abuser is a family or household member.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Theft </STRONG></H3></A>
The legal definition of theft encompasses a broad range of activities when one person uses, transfers, conceals, or retains possession of another person's property without the other person's consent. This definition is much broader than what most persons believe to be theft and can include writing bad checks, unauthorized use of a credit card, keeping found property without making a reasonable attempt to find its rightful owner, misusing trade secrets, unlawfully tapping into cable television services, wrongfully receiving public assistance, and removing serial numbers from movable property with the intent of concealing the identity of the true owner.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Burglary and Robbery </STRONG></H3></A>
Burglary is unlawfully breaking into, or remaining in, a building with the intent to commit a crime there. It is burglary to enter a house unlawfully with the intent to steal money or property, but it is also burglary to enter with the intent to commit a felony such as arson or murder. A person commits a burglary regardless of whether he or she actually steals anything or commits any other felony while in the house. Simple robbery is unlawfully taking personal property from another person or in the presence of the other person while using or threatening to use force against the person. Aggravated robbery is robbery committed with a dangerous weapon.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Homicide and Suicide </STRONG></H3></A>
Homicide is the killing of another human being. There are four types of homicide: murder, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter, and criminal vehicular homicide.
<P>
Murder is the unlawful killing of another with premeditated intent to kill and malice (hatred). Murder is divided into subcategories by degree of seriousness. Murder in the first degree is killing someone with premeditation and intent or during the commission of a violent felony. The amount of premeditation required is very slight, even a moment spent thinking about killing a person before actually killing that person may be sufficient to constitute premeditation. Murder in the second degree is killing someone with intent to kill but without premeditation or killing someone while committing a felony offense. Murder in the third degree is causing the death of another person without intent to kill but through a dangerous act or by distributing a controlled substance.
<P>
Manslaughter differs from murder because manslaughter does not require proof of hatred. There are two kinds of manslaughter: voluntary and involuntary. Voluntary manslaughter is killing another person while intentionally engaged in an action which is very dangerous. Involuntary manslaughter is an unintentional killing. This is usually the result of criminal negligence rather than hatred. 
<P>
Criminal vehicular homicide is causing the death of another person as a result of negligently operating a motor vehicle.
<P>
Suicide is taking one's own life. Suicide and attempted suicide are no longer crimes in Minnesota. However, aiding another person to commit suicide or attempt suicide are crimes. Assisted suicide is a controversial issue that has hotly divided public opinion. In Minnesota, most acts that assist another person to commit suicide are clearly illegal. A few actions are specifically exempted from punishment. For example, withdrawing life support in accordance with a living will or established medical practice is not illegal.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Sex Crimes </STRONG></H3></A>
Rape, sodomy, incest, fornication, pimping, and prostitution are crimes in Minnesota. Some of these laws, like the prohibitions against sodomy and fornication, are technically still on the books, but rarely enforced. In fact, Minnesota laws are somewhat contradictory because they criminalize sodomy and fornication, but they also make it a crime to discriminate in housing and employment against persons who engage in these activities.
<P>
Most persons accused of sex crimes are tried for violations of a modern law that lumps many actions together under the title of criminal sexual conduct. Criminal sexual conduct is divided into four degrees depending upon the age of the victim, age of the accused, whether force is used, and the existence of any special relationship between the parties, such as parent-child or physician-patient. 
<P>
In Minnesota, judges are required to double the punishment imposed on a pattern sex offender, which is someone who repeats or is likely to repeat a sex crime, or someone who plans the crime.
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>White Collar Crimes </STRONG></H3></A>
A number of miscellaneous nonviolent crimes are frequently lumped together as white collar crimes. There is no fixed definition of white collar crime, although it usually includes bribery, embezzlement, fraud, forgery, and violations of trust committed by corporations or individuals engaged in commerce. Historically, many white collar crimes have received lenient punishment from a criminal justice system that considered white collar crimes to be less serious than more violent crimes. Today, the trend is for stricter punishment of white collar crimes in recognition of the financial damage they inflict on society.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Civil Rights Crimes </STRONG></H3></A>
The Minnesota Human Rights Act forbids discrimination in employment, housing, and commerce on the basis of race, sex, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, disability, sexual orientation, or age. Violation of these prohibitions can subject the violator to criminal prosecution.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Attempt, Conspiracy, Aiding and Abetting </STRONG></H3></A>
Anyone who, with intent to commit a crime, does an act which is a substantial step toward committing the crime may be guilty of attempting to commit a crime. The substantial step can not be mere preparation for the crime. For example, if someone buys a gun with intent to kill another person, purchasing the gun is mere preparation and thus is not an attempt. If he or she buys a gun and goes to the other person's house, only to be scared away by the presence of police, he or she may be guilty of attempting to commit a crime. Merely thinking about committing a crime is not a crime. 
<P>
The law of conspiracy and the law of aiding and abetting are two more general doctrines that apply to a wide range of substantive offenses. Conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime. A conspirator is considered criminally liable for the acts of co-conspirators if the acts were reasonably foreseeable. If two or more people conspire to commit a crime and at least one of them takes action to further the conspiracy, all parties are guilty of the crime of conspiracy.
<P>
Also, a person who aids or advises another in committing a crime can be criminally liable for the acts of the other person. Thus, intentionally advising a person how to commit a crime, for instance, is aiding and abetting. The law treats an aider and abettor as equally liable.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Federal Drug and Gun Laws </STRONG></H3></A>
Federal laws contain harsh penalties for distributing controlled substances, especially if any firearms are even remotely involved. For example, any person who possesses with intent to distribute five grams of crack cocaine is subject to a mandatory five-year sentence without parole. If a gun is available for use or being carried during a drug transaction, a five-year mandatory sentence must be imposed consecutively to a conviction for any drug offense. The gun does not have to be displayed or used but simply available for use. Thus, if a person possesses five grams of crack cocaine with intent to distribute it from their home and a gun is on the premises, the person would receive a mandatory ten-year sentence, without parole, even for a first offense and even if the offender is only 18 years old. In most circumstances, federal judges cannot depart from these mandatory sentences. Penalties for other controlled substance offenses are also harsh and become much harsher as quantities of the contraband increase. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Defenses </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In some criminal trials, all the elements of a crime are met but the accused is not punished because he or she has a valid defense to excuse the crime. As a general rule, a person may use whatever force, short of deadly force, he or she reasonably believes is necessary to prevent immediate unlawful harm to self or another person. If a person claims self-defense, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that self-defense was not the motive. A person defending property from interference by others is only allowed to use reasonable force. Using deadly force is only permissible when it reasonably appears necessary to avoid immediate death or serious injury to a person or to prevent the commission of a felony in the actor's dwelling.
<P>
Intoxication is not a defense to a crime by itself, but, in rare cases, can prevent a person from being guilty because he or she can not form the necessary intent to commit a crime. For example, someone who is intoxicated probably cannot commit a crime that requires he or she act intentionally, but the intoxicated person may be guilty of another crime that does not require intentional actions.
<P>
Except for involuntary manslaughter, anyone who participates in a crime because he or she is coerced with threats that create a reasonable apprehension of immediate death, is excused from criminal liability. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>Punishment </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Crimes are divided into categories depending on their seriousness. The most serious crimes, including kidnapping, murder and rape, are called felonies and are subject to the strictest punishment, such as lengthy imprisonment. Lesser crimes are called gross misdemeanors. Still lesser crimes are called misdemeanors. Punishment for committing a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor may include jail time or fines.
<P>
A category below misdemeanors is called petty misdemeanors. Despite their name, petty misdemeanors are not actually crimes under Minnesota law. In Minnesota, petty misdemeanors carry fines of no more than $100 ($200 in a few cases) and a person cannot go to jail for committing a petty misdemeanor. Most minor traffic offenses are petty misdemeanors. Anyone who commits the same petty misdemeanor repeatedly, such as being caught speeding three times within a one-year period, can be charged with a misdemeanor.
<P>
Minnesota has laws that allow the authorities to seize property connected with the commission of a crime. For example, Minnesota authorities can seize guns and ammunition found in a vehicle used to commit a felony offense, near a person carrying a felony-level amount of drugs, or on the property where a felony-level of drugs is found.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="170"><H2><STRONG>Crime Victim's Rights </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Crime victims have several rights in Minnesota's criminal justice system. The crime victim has a right to be notified of:
<UL>
<LI>Plea bargain agreements
<LI>When and where the accused will be tried and, if found guilty, sentenced
<LI>Transfer of the offender to a less secure correctional facility
<LI>Release of the offender from prison or other institution
<LI>Evidence indicating the presence of sexually transmitted disease, if victimized by a sexual assault
The crime victim has the following rights in connection with the prosecution of a defendant:
<LI>Right to testify to the court about the impact of the crime on the victim
<LI>Right to object to any plea bargain
<LI>Right to give written objection to a sentence
<LI>Right to request a speedy trial
<LI>Right to request court-awarded restitution
</UL>
The Minnesota Crime Victim Reparations Board can help some crime victims with some financial losses. Victims of violent crimes can ask the board for reimbursement of medical costs, counseling costs, lost wages, and other costs associated with the crime. Surviving family members of homicide victims can request aid for funeral expenses, loss of support, and counseling. There are several requirements that must be met for a victim to get reimbursement. Victims of most crimes must report the crime to the police within five days of the crime and must cooperate fully in the investigation and prosecution. Most claims must be filed within one year of the victim's injury or death.
<P>
The victim can sometimes get the person who committed the crime to pay to replace stolen or damaged property. In this case, the state arranges to collect the money from the criminal and sends a check to the victim when all the restitution has been made. If the court does not order restitution, or if a prosecutor does not press charges, the victim still has the option to sue the person in civil court. Other services available to certain crime victims are battered women's shelters and sexual assault assistance. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Juveniles and the Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Minnesota has a juvenile court system for minors under age 18 that operates separately from other courts. Minors who run afoul of the law are said to commit delinquent acts rather than crimes. The distinction is one of words only. Delinquent acts committed by a minor are called crimes if committed by an adult. The most significant distinction between the juvenile court system and adult criminal courts is in courtroom procedures. Juvenile courts are generally less formal than other courts. Juveniles do not have a right to a trial by jury in Minnesota. 
<P>
Minnesota recently made dramatic changes in how some violent juvenile offenders are treated. A juvenile age 14 to 17 accused of committing a felony can be tried as an adult if the juvenile court finds the accused is dangerous and unsuitable for treatment within the juvenile system. These proceedings are conducted in open court. However, no one under the age of 14 in Minnesota can be tried as an adult, no matter how serious the offense. A juvenile court must make juveniles found guilty of traffic offenses pay reasonable restitution for damage caused by their actions.
<P>
Minors giving courtroom testimony in an assault case or other crime of violence such as murder can have a supportive person present during their testimony. This new law greatly expands the conditions under which a supportive person can assist a minor giving testimony.
Minnesota also has established a class of serious juvenile offenders, called the extended jurisdiction juvenile (EJJ). The EJJ does have the right to a public defender and the right to a jury trial. EJJs are serious offenders who are sentenced with a juvenile court penalty as well as an adult court penalty. The adult-level penalty is not imposed unless the limitations of the sentence are violated.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Elder Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Elder law is one of the fastest growing specialty areas of legal practice today. As recently as ten years ago, almost no one would have claimed to practice elder law because most lawyers viewed elderly clients in the same way as any other clients. Lawyers assumed that, outside of the area of estate planning, the concerns of elderly clients were indistinguishable from the interests of any other group. As a consequence, few lawyers focused their practices on senior citizens, and many seniors felt their unique concerns were ignored by the legal profession. 
<P>
All this is changing rapidly. As the average age of Americans rises, society is becoming increasingly aware of the unique problems facing elderly people, as well as the professional opportunities available in serving them. Government has responded with a wide array of state and federal programs designed to guarantee financial and physical well-being for the elderly and to fight age-based discrimination. As senior citizens take a more active role in asserting their rights, an increasing number of the elderly have sought legal representation from lawyers sensitive to their needs. 
<P>
Elder law is not a well-defined area of legal specialization. Elder law crosses traditional boundaries and borrows from many other areas such as health law, probate, estate planning and trusts, civil rights, and even consumer protection. Each of these areas is discussed fully in separate chapters of this guide.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Age Discrimination in Employment </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Minnesotans have among the longest life expectancies in the country. With longer life expectancies and better access to health care, more elder Minnesotans are staying active longer and want to remain in the work force past traditional retirement age. Also, many elder Minnesotans need the income from employment. Consequently, employers have far more elderly employees, and the number of elderly job applicants is higher than at any other time in history. Unfortunately, incidents of age-based job discrimination are also on the rise. 
<P>
Seniors in Minnesota have two primary means to fight age discrimination in the workplace: the Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA) and the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA).
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Minnesota Human Rights Act </STRONG></H3></A>
MHRA is a comprehensive anti-discrimination package prohibiting labor organizations, employers, and employment agencies from discriminating based on race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, disability, sexual orientation, or age. Under MHRA, it is illegal in most instances for an employer to use a person's age as a basis for decisions regarding hiring, tenure, compensation, terms, upgrading, conditions, facilities, or privileges of employment if the person is over the age of 18. MHRA does permit an employer to offer various insurance plans or other fringe benefits to an employee based on age but only so long as the cost to the employer is reasonably equivalent for all employees. The most important exception to MHRA is for mandatory retirement ages. Some employers can legally enforce a mandatory retirement age if the policy meets a number of statutory requirements. 
<P>
Any person who feels victimized by a violation of MHRA may bring a civil action directly against the employer or may file a charge with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights. If the worker chooses to file a charge directly, it generally must be filed within one year of the alleged unfair discriminatory practice.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 </STRONG></H3></A>
The ADEA also prohibits age-based discrimination by labor organizations, employers, and employment agencies. Under ADEA, employers are prohibited from using age as a basis for making hiring, firing, promotion, or compensation decisions, or from limiting, segregating, or classifying employees in any way that would deprive them of employment opportunities or adversely affect employment status. ADEA also specifically prohibits the use of job advertisements that specify an applicant should be "young," a "recent graduate," or that use terms such as "retired" or "over 65." 
<P>
ADEA has five major exceptions to its coverage:
<UL>
<LI>Tenured Faculty Members-Prior to 1994, ADEA allowed compulsory retirement at age 70 for tenured faculty members at institutions of higher learning.
<LI>Executives and Policy Makers-A small number of very high-level employees with very substantial executive authority are not covered by ADEA and can be subjected to compulsory retirement at age 70.
<LI>Good Cause-An employer is always permitted to discharge an employee for "good cause," a catch-all category that includes many different forms of failure to do a job adequately.
<LI>Occupational Requirement-In certain, very narrowly defined situations, an action otherwise impermissible under ADEA may be legal where such a requirement is "reasonably necessary to the operation of the business" or is based on "reasonable factors other than age." For example, employers can have mandatory retirement policies for firefighters and airplane pilots.
<LI>Bona Fide Seniority Systems and Employee Benefit Plans-It is generally permissible for an employer to adopt a bona fide seniority system or employee benefit plan so long as the system or plan is not intended to evade the purposes of ADEA. 
</UL>
A victim of age-based discrimination can bring an action under ADEA against his or her employer within two years of a nonwillful violation or within three years of a willful violation.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Relationship Between MHRA and ADEA </STRONG></H3></A>
The relationship between MHRA and ADEA is complex, primarily because ADEA was not intended to supersede or replace existing state regulations regarding age-based discrimination. Because of the complex interplay between the two laws and because they have different statutes of limitation, a lawyer or representative of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or Minnesota Department of Human Rights can best advise a victim of discrimination how, when, and where to proceed against an employer.

<CENTER><A NAME="60"><H2><STRONG>Health Care Decisions and Protective Arrangements </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
With Minnesotans living longer than ever before and medical technology advancing at a dizzying pace, more people are beginning to plan now for their future health care.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Living Will </STRONG></H3></A>
Despite its popular name, a living will is not actually a will at all. A living will is a document spelling out how much and what kind of medical care its writer (declarant) wants should he or she become terminally ill and incapable of communicating his or her wishes. Any competent adult can make a living will. A person may also designate someone else (proxy) to make these decisions. A common perception about living wills is that they are only appropriate for people who do not want extraordinary measures taken to sustain their life. This perception is incorrect. The treatment choice may range from no treatment at all to every possible life-sustaining treatment. Living wills are still controversial and many states refuse to recognize them. The State of Minnesota has chosen to recognize them and created the Minnesota Living Wills Act to give its citizens more input in deciding what health care they will receive. 
<P>
A person does not need a lawyer to draft a living will, but many people have them drafted at the same time that they are having a traditional will drafted. Many people also seek advice from a doctor before drafting a living will because most people would not be able to describe their wishes specifically without first researching the kinds of medical technology currently available to them. Individuals can direct that certain treatments be given for specific illnesses. They can specify a preference for home, hospital, or hospice treatment. They can make known any religious objections to a particular treatment. The individual can even specify, in advance, the individuals who are likely to try to interfere with treatment decisions and clarify his or her wishes with regard to those persons. The most important point about a living will is that the individual decides how much and what kind of health care he or she wants.
Under a new Minnesota law, a living will also may include a section on organ donation. A person may state whether he or she wishes to donate organs upon death and specify any limitations or special wishes. 
<P>
There are several technical requirements to create a valid living will in Minnesota. Minnesota has a suggested form to follow in the creation of a living will, which must be followed substantially for the living will to be valid. Living wills can be used only for terminal illnesses. Treatment decisions for nonterminal illness can be addressed by the creation of a durable power of attorney for health care (discussed below). There must be at least two witnesses or one notary public to the creation of a living will. A living will becomes effective upon its delivery to an appropriate health care professional. A copy should also be given to a family member and any family clergy. A doctor does have a right to decline to follow the terms of a living will but must assist the patient in finding another doctor and must see that the new doctor is aware of the living will. Living wills may be totally or partially revoked at any time in any manner, regardless of the physical or mental condition of the declarant. 
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care </STRONG></H3></A>
A power of attorney is a document that one person (principal) signs in order to give another person (agent) authority to make decisions and carry out financial tasks. A traditional power of attorney ends if the principal becomes incapacitated. A durable power of attorney remains in effect after the principal becomes incapacitated. A springing power of attorney takes effect only when the principal becomes incapacitated. In Minnesota, state law permits the creation of a durable power of attorney specifically for health care decisions when, in the opinion of the principal's health care provider, the principal is unable to make or communicate health care decisions. Unlike a living will, a person's health condition does not have to be terminal for a durable power of attorney to be effective.
A principal must be at least 18 years of age in order to create a durable power of attorney. Minnesota has a suggested form to follow in creating a durable power of attorney for health care that must be signed by the principal or someone acting on behalf of the principal, and must be witnessed by two persons at least 18 years of age or acknowledged by the principal in front of a notary public.
A durable power of attorney for health care can be revoked. Unless the document specifically provides otherwise, if the agent is the spouse or registered domestic partner of the principal, divorce, annulment, or termination of domestic partnership revokes the durable power of attorney for health care. 
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Guardianship and Conservatorship </STRONG></H3></A>
A court may appoint a conservator or guardian to manage another person's personal affairs, estate, or both should the person ever become incapacitated and incapable of making personal or financial decisions. Guardianship and conservatorship are closely related concepts under Minnesota law. Their creation and functioning are quite similar and most of the laws governing them are identical. Under a guardianship, a person or entity is appointed to exercise a certain list of powers, including paying for support, maintenance, and education, paying lawful debts, possessing and managing the estate, collecting debts, and instituting lawsuits on behalf of another person, the ward. Under a conservatorship, known in many other states as limited guardianship, a person or entity is appointed by the court to exercise some, but not all, of these powers on behalf of another person, known as the conservatee. While both conservatorship and guardianship place someone in charge of another person's affairs, neither a guardian nor a conservator is obligated to use his or her own funds to provide for the ward or conservatee. The guardian or conservator is entitled to reasonable compensation in fulfilling his or her duties. 
<P>
To create either a guardianship or conservatorship, any person can petition a probate court, whether that person be a potential guardian, a potential ward, or a third person. Usually it is done by a family member or close friend concerned about the person's competence to manage property or make personal decisions. A petition must include the name and other information about the person, the value of the person's property, name and other information about the proposed guardian or conservator, and must set forth the reasons why a guardianship or conservatorship is needed. The petitioner has the burden of proving the ward's or conservatee's incapacity, and the court applies a standard of the best interest of the ward or conservatee in making its decision. A ward or conservatee can be restored to capacity by petition to the court. Anyone can bring such a petition and must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the ward or conservatee is no longer incapacitated and is able to make provisions for personal care or self-management of property.  
<P>
Conservatorship and guardianship, for most families, are drastic alternatives to be used only as a last resort. Family relationships can be terribly strained when a child alleges that a parent has become incompetent. Relationships between siblings can be strained if more than one child wishes to be named conservator or guardian of a parent or if no child wants the responsibility. Many of these problems can be avoided if the person, while he or she is still competent, creates a living will or durable power of attorney, discussed earlier in this chapter, or a living trust as discussed in the <A HREF="c19.html">Probate, Estate Planning &amp; Trusts</A> Chapter.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Commitment to a State Institution </STRONG></H3></A>
There are many institutions for mentally ill, mentally retarded, or chemically dependent persons in Minnesota. There are three ways an individual can be committed to one of these institutions.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Voluntary Commitment </STRONG></H4></A>
A person 16 years of age or older in Minnesota can voluntarily request to be admitted to a hospital or public mental health institution for treatment of mental illness, mental retardation, or chemical dependency. This is usually done very informally by phone or by appearing in person at the institution and requesting admission. The state is required by law to provide mental health services, regardless of a person's ability to pay, but the individual and the individual's spouse or parents (if the individual is under age 18) are financially liable for the costs of treatment.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Emergency Hold </STRONG></H4></A>
A health care professional or peace officer can hold a person under emergency involuntary admission for up to 72 hours if the person is found to be sick, incapacitated, or drugged and poses an imminent danger to self or others. The person held under an emergency hold has the right to a medical examination within 48 hours and a right to be informed in writing that the emergency hold expires in 72 hours. If the institution believes the person should be held longer, it must seek judicial commitment.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Judicial Commitment </STRONG></H4></A>
Any adult can petition a court for judicial commitment of another individual. The person petitioning for involuntary judicial commitment must file the petition in the county where the facility is located. Each county designates a person to receive commitment petitions. The petition must state the facts that make commitment necessary, names and addresses of witnesses to these facts, and names and addresses of the subject's nearest relatives. Upon the filing of a petition for commitment, the court appoints an examiner to evaluate the person and make recommendations to the court. The proposed patient receives notice of the hearing and a written summary of his or her rights. A judge can involuntarily commit someone to a state institution for an initial period of up to six months. After that period, the patient is entitled to periodic review of his or her case and possible release.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Social Security </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Congress passed the Social Security Act in 1935 to create a very broad social safety net for all American workers and their families. The Social Security Act and subsequent amendments to it started several public benefit programs. Most of these programs are financed by taxes on the income of American workers. Employers automatically deduct a portion of each worker's paycheck and match that amount with money from their own pocket. Self-employed workers are responsible for paying the entire amount themselves. 
<P>
The three largest programs within the Social Security Act are Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Health Insurance (RSDHI), Supplemental Social Income (SSI), and Medicaid. RSDHI is the name of the federal government's benefits program for workers and retirees and is of most interest to seniors. RSDHI is further subdivided into three branches for retirement, disability, and health insurance (Medicare).  
<P>
These three programs within RSDHI are extremely complex. However, the various branches of RSDHI are closely related and a general familiarity with them is helpful for understanding one's entitlements.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Retirement and Survivor's Insurance </STRONG></H3></A>
Despite the fact that Retirement and Survivor's Insurance (RSI) is only one branch of RSDHI, which in turn is only one branch of the Social Security Act, when most people refer to social security they actually mean RSI. Payments from RSI are the social security checks that millions of Americans receive each month. RSI costs the federal government billions of dollars every year and constitutes a significant portion of the federal budget. For many, RSI is their only source of income, so any proposed changes to RSI inevitably provoke intense emotions. Social Security is not intended to be a person's sole source of income, but is intended only to supplement other income sources such as pensions, insurance, savings, and investments.  
<P>
A worker gains RSI coverage by performing covered employment for a given length of time. The term "covered employment" includes most types of work including full- or part-time wage or salary workers, self-employed persons, farm workers, members of the United States Armed Services, employees of private nonprofit organizations, most federal, state, and local government employees, and most domestic workers. The only major exceptions are for federal workers hired before 1984, certain religious workers, employees of certain religious sects, and railroad employees separately covered by the Railroad Retirement System (RRS). The rules of eligibility and benefit amount are quite complex and provide limited coverage for spouses, children, and survivors.  
<P>
The usual age for first receiving RSI benefits is 65; however, a worker has the option of initiating benefits at age 62. All benefits are based on what is called the primary insurance amount (PIA)-the amount a worker is entitled to if he or she retires exactly at age 65. The amount of each monthly check varies depending on how much the worker made each year. The higher his or her pay, the higher the benefits, up to a maximum dollar amount. Initiating benefits at age 62 means that the recipient is only entitled to a permanently reduced monthly amount equal to a percentage of their PIA. This reduction amounts to approximately 7 percent of the PIA for each year a person receives benefits before age 65. Postponing the receipt of benefits until after age 65 can entitle a worker to receive permanently increased monthly amounts based on their PIA. Cost-of-living increases are built into the system so that the monthly checks automatically increase each year as the national cost of living rises. Workers under age 70 can see their benefit checks reduced if they earn income greater than a specified amount. After age 70, a person's benefits remain the same regardless of how much he or she earns at a job. 
<P>
The spouse of an eligible worker can usually draw spousal benefits on the worker's account if he or she is at least 62 years old or cares for a child eligible for child's benefits on the worker's account. The spousal benefit is usually equal to one-half of the worker's PIA. A divorced spouse can still receive spousal benefits if he or she was married to the insured worker for at least ten continuous years and has not remarried. A child or grandchild of an insured worker can draw benefits if he or she was dependent on the worker when benefits began, is unmarried, 18 years old or younger, or older than 18 years but became disabled before reaching age 22. A surviving widow or widower of a fully insured worker can draw full benefits on the worker's account at age 65. A one-time death benefit is available to fully insured workers' relatives. A survivor qualifying for the death benefit must apply for it within two years of the worker's death. 
<P>
As a general rule, an eligible individual must apply for RSI benefits in order to receive them. It is wise to apply at least two months in advance of when one wants benefits to begin, as it can take time for paperwork to be completed. Failure to apply for benefits as soon as one is entitled to them can forfeit earned benefits. In limited circumstances, an applicant is entitled to receive benefits for up to six months preceding the application. Benefits before that time would be permanently lost. Anyone interested in learning how much he or she is likely to receive in RSI benefits can visit a local Social Security office and request an estimate of future benefits based on past earnings.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Railroad Retirement System </STRONG></H3></A>
The Railroad Retirement System (RRS) is a federal income insurance program specifically for workers in the railroad industry. RRS originally existed entirely independently of the Social Security Administration, but in 1974 its provisions were substantially integrated into the Social Security Administration. The integration is not entirely a smooth one, however, and the combination of the two programs has led to very complex and confusing rules which are often the source of errors in awarding benefits. 
<P>
Most of the rules for Railroad Retirement closely parallel those for RSI. A retired railroad worker is eligible for monthly benefits if he or she worked for a railroad employer for at least ten years before reaching age 65. As with RSI, a worker can opt to retire earlier at age 62 but will receive reduced benefits. Anyone with fewer than ten years employment in the railroad industry is ineligible for railroad benefits, but the years of railroad employment can be added to years of nonrailroad employment for purposes of calculating RSI benefits. 
<P>
Some railroad workers who retired before January 1, 1975, are entitled to draw both full RSI benefits and full Railroad Retirement benefits. Most other workers, however, will have RSI benefits reduced by the amount of the Railroad benefits.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Disability Benefits </STRONG></H3></A>
The federal government has two disability benefit programs administered by the Social Security Administration for qualified applicants-RSDHI Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). These two programs are substantially similar and are governed by many of the same rules. An individual who qualifies for one program can occasionally receive benefits from both programs simultaneously.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="180"><H4><STRONG>RSDHI Disability Insurance </STRONG></H4></A>
RSDHI Disability Insurance provides benefits for workers with a substantial work history in covered employment who are unable to continue work because they have become disabled before reaching their 25th birthday. The term "covered employment" includes most types of work. Both the disabled worker and any dependent may be eligible for RSDHI disability benefits and, in a few cases, disabled survivors of an insured worker can receive benefits. 
<P>
Both RSDHI and SSI programs define disability as "inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determined physical or mental impairment which can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months." The disability can be either physical or mental and must be "of such severity" that an applicant is no longer able to engage in any kind of substantial gainful work, given his or her age, education, experience, and place of residence. 
<P>
The applicant for either RSDHI disability or SSI has the burden of showing the disability by medical evidence. Most applicants must wait for five full months before their benefits begin. Each applicant's case is reviewed periodically to determine whether his or her condition has improved to the point where he or she is able to resume working.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="190"><H4><STRONG>Supplemental Security Income </STRONG></H4></A>
SSI is a nationwide income maintenance program designed to help elderly, blind, or disabled persons with limited income and assets. Although SSI is administered by the Social Security Administration, it is not funded by Social Security taxes. SSI differs from RSI because it is based solely on financial need; a person's past work record is entirely ignored in determining eligibility for SSI. Thus, a disabled person under age 65 who has not worked sufficient quarters to qualify for RSDHI disability may be eligible to receive SSI disability benefits.  
<P>
To receive SSI, a person must be 65 years of age or older, blind, or disabled. A person qualifying on the basis of blindness or disability must be referred to vocational rehabilitation services. If the disability is related to alcohol or drug dependency, the applicant can be required to enroll in an appropriate treatment program or risk losing eligibility. Residence in a public institution such as a prison or certain hospitals disqualifies an applicant and the applicant must take appropriate steps to get any pensions, annuities, retirement, disability benefits, worker's compensation benefits, unemployment insurance, or veterans benefits to which he or she may be entitled. The formula for determining SSI eligibility and benefits takes into account both income level and assets. 
<P>
When the federal government created SSI, it replaced many state-administered welfare programs for the elderly, the blind, and the disabled. The state of Minnesota chose to continue its own programs to supplement SSI benefits. These programs are known as Minnesota Supplemental Aid (MSA) and Minnesota General Assistance (MGA). MSA provides monthly checks to qualified elderly, blind, and disabled persons. The eligibility requirements for MSA are substantially similar to those for SSI but also take into consideration the applicant's living expenses in determining eligibility and benefit levels. The purpose of MGA is to help very poor Minnesotans who are unable to work but whose needs are not met by other federal or state programs. Very few elderly Minnesotans will qualify for MGA because the receipt of SSI and/or MSA would disqualify them from receiving MGA. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="200"><H2><STRONG>Medicare </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Medicare is a federal program administered by the Social Security Administration designed to cover some basic medical and health care costs of eligible individuals over age 65 and some disabled individuals under age 65. Medicare has become an enormous federal program, providing billions of dollars in coverage every year.  
<P>
Medicare should not be confused with Medicaid. Medicaid is a program administered by the Social Security Administration to pay doctor and hospital bills of people with limited income and assets. Unlike Medicaid, Medicare benefits are available to qualified individuals regardless of financial need. Because Medicare is closely linked to RSI, Disability Insurance, and Railroad Disability benefits, a basic understanding of the eligibility requirements and application procedures for those programs is helpful for an understanding of Medicare.
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Parts A and B </STRONG></H3></A>
Medicare has two primary divisions, called Part A and Part B. Medicare Part A, commonly known as Hospital Insurance, covers medically necessary hospital and related health care. Included in Part A are costs for such expenses as inpatient hospital care necessitated by acute illness, skilled nursing home care, certified hospice care for the terminally ill, inpatient psychiatric care, and care in the home by a certified home health care provider.  
<P>
Medicare Part B, commonly known as Supplemental Medical Insurance, is a voluntary health insurance program designed to cover some of the costs not covered by Medicare Part A, such as outpatient hospital services, outpatient physical therapy, speech pathology services, necessary ambulance service, and medical equipment. Unlike Part A, which is paid for out of Social Security taxes and is free to anyone qualifying for it, Part B is an optional program that carries small monthly premiums. 
<P>
The federal government contracts with private insurance companies to handle routine claims processing, payment, and other functions under Parts A and B. Private insurance companies contracted under Part A are called fiscal intermediaries. The fiscal intermediary for almost all of Minnesota is Blue Cross/Blue Shield of St. Paul. Private insurance companies contracted under Part B are called carriers. The Travelers of Bloomington is the carrier for the counties around the Twin Cities metropolitan area and Rochester. Blue Cross/Blue Shield is the carrier for the rest of Minnesota. The Travelers Insurance Company of Salt Lake City is the carrier for Railroad Retirement beneficiaries in Minnesota.  
<P>
Anyone eligible to receive RSI or Railroad benefits is eligible to receive Medicare Part A coverage, although the person need not actually be receiving money benefits through either of these two programs in order to receive Medicare benefits. Anyone age 65 or older not eligible for RSI or Railroad benefits can still receive Medicare Part A coverage by paying a monthly premium. Medicare Part B coverage is automatically available to anyone who qualifies for Medicare Part A benefits. In fact, all applicants for Medicare Part A benefits are automatically enrolled in Medicare Part B unless they opt out of Part B coverage. 
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Costs not Covered by Medicare </STRONG></H3></A>
Medicare was never intended to provide comprehensive coverage for all medical needs of America's elderly population, but rather was intended to supplement private resources. Many health services are not covered by Medicare. For example, Medicare does not pay for: 
<UL>
<LI>Custodial care that could reasonably be given by someone without medical training and is generally intended to help the patient with his or her daily living needs, such as help with bathing, walking, or exercising
<LI>Dentures or routine dental care
<LI>Eyeglasses, hearing aids, and examinations to prescribe or fit them
<LI>Nursing home care (except skilled nursing care)
<LI>Prescription drugs
<LI>Routine physical checkups and related tests
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Insurance Issues Related to Medicare </STRONG></H3></A>
Many seniors look for some form of private insurance to supplement Medicare coverage. Some seniors are able to get continuation or conversion coverage from group policies they had at their workplace. Under these plans, seniors continue to be covered by the policies that covered them while they were working. Another popular option for seniors is to join a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO). HMO coverage is similar to continuation or conversion coverage, but many HMOs have more complicated rules for persons who are covered by Medicare, so it pays to learn about a particular HMO's policies regarding Medicare benefits before signing up.  
<P>
Another popular option for seniors is private insurance policies intended to cover gaps not covered by Medicare, such as deductibles, co-payments, or procedures not covered by Medicare. These policies are commonly referred to as Medigap policies. Medigap policies have been a source of much confusion and outright fraud in Minnesota, so the state legislature has created a complex scheme to regulate them. The two types of Medigap policies are basic policies and extended basic policies. The state of Minnesota requires that basic Medigap coverage offered in the state include coverage for several preventative health care procedures and that extended Medigap coverage covers everything covered by basic Medigap coverage plus 100 percent of the cost of several routine cancer screening procedures, immunizations, and many more preventative tests and measures. In Minnesota, most dread disease policies-policies designed to cover a particular type of illness, such as cancer or heart disease-are illegal to sell to Medicare beneficiaries. For certain indigent elderly, Medicaid is available, and therefore private insurance is financially inadvisable. 
<P>
Seniors also receive benefits, such as discounted prescription drugs, through MinnesotaCare (discussed in the <A HREF="c17.html">Health Law</A> Chapter).

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Employment Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>

Workers enjoy many rights designed to make the workplace safe and free from illegal discrimination and harassment. This chapter outlines some of the more important federal and state laws that govern the legal relationships and problems that develop between an employer and employee.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>The Employment Relationship </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Many of the rights a worker enjoys turn on the legal relationship that exists between the worker and his or her employer. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Independent Contractor Versus Employee </STRONG></H3></A>
When a worker gets paid to do a task or provide a service for another person, the worker is either an independent contractor or an employee. The distinction is important both for the business and the worker, but it is not always clear. An employer who hires someone as an independent contractor can avoid many tax and record-keeping requirements. For a worker, the classification determines the benefits a worker is entitled to, whether the worker can file a workers' compensation claim, and whether the worker is protected by federal and state wage and hour regulations. Employees enjoy substantially more protection in the workplace than do independent contractors. 
<P>
Whether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee is based on the work performed, not the worker's title. The more control an employer has over a worker, the more likely it is the worker is an employee. The more a worker acts like an independent business enterprise, the more likely the worker is an independent contractor. In some cases, the status is clear: a worker who arrives at a set time every day, is trained by the employer, uses the boss's tools or equipment, and is paid by the hour, week, or month, is most likely an employee. Someone who works for more than one company at a time, can set his or her own hours, and realizes a profit or risks a loss is most likely an independent contractor.
<P>
A worker or an employer who is unsure about the legal status of the employment can ask the Internal Revenue Service, the Minnesota Department of Revenue, or the Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training for an opinion based on the respective agency's guidelines. Guidelines vary from agency to agency, and one agency may classify someone as an employee even though another considers the same employee an independent contractor.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Employment at Will </STRONG></H3></A>
The state of Minnesota recognizes the traditional rule of employment at will. This means that, unless there is an agreement to the contrary, an employer can discharge an employee at any time for any reason other than an illegal reason. It also means that an employee can resign at any time, for any reason, with or without giving notice. The implications of this relationship are far-reaching. Employers do not need a good reason to fire someone. So long as an employee is not fired for an illegal reason, such as racial or gender discrimination, even a silly reason is enough to fire an employee. Similarly, an employee is free to leave an employer for any reason at all, even if by doing so he or she greatly inconveniences the employer. 
<P>
Most workers in Minnesota are at will employees. Generally, all employees are at will unless the employer does something to change the status of the relationship. There are several ways an employer can alter the relationship. An employer might enter into an oral or written contract guaranteeing to employ someone for a specific period of time or promising to terminate the employee only for specified reasons. An employee handbook or collective bargaining agreement can limit the employer's right to terminate employees. An employer can inadvertently limit his or her right to fire an employee if, by his or her actions, he or she gives the employee reason to believe the job will continue. For example, if an employer promises a job to someone from out of state and that person moves to Minnesota specifically to take the job, the employment relationship is probably not at will because the employee has gone to the trouble and expense of moving after reasonably relying on the promise of new employment.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="50"><H2><STRONG>Government Administered Benefits </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Three programs administered by the state and federal governments are of primary interest to workers: Unemployment Compensation Insurance, Workers' Compensation Insurance, and Social Security. Each of these programs determines a worker's benefits according to the terms and conditions of employment. 
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Unemployment Insurance </STRONG></H3></A>
Unemployment insurance provides benefits to employees who are laid off, fired, or forced to leave their jobs. Most employees are covered by unemployment insurance, a program administered by the state and funded by employer contributions.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Application </STRONG></H4></A>
Unemployment benefits are not automatic; the worker must apply for them from the Minnesota Department of Jobs and Training. After gathering information about an applicant, the department makes an initial determination whether the person is eligible to receive benefits. If the department's decision is that the employee is eligible, the department informs the former employer. Because the former employer pays the benefits, the employer has the right to know what the former employee told the department and has an opportunity to present its side of the story. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Eligibility </STRONG></H4></A>
Not everyone who leaves a job is eligible to receive unemployment benefits. To be eligible to receive unemployment benefits, the employee must have worked at least 15 weeks and made at least $1000 in wages in any one calendar quarter. The employment must end either by the employer being fired for a reason other than misconduct, or by the employee quitting because of an intolerable work environment.
<P>
Independent contractors are not covered by unemployment insurance. 
<P>
An applicant cannot receive benefits if any one of the following conditions applies:
<UL>
<LI>The applicant is a student hired by the educational institution in which he or she was enrolled
<LI>The applicant is a commission-only salesperson
<LI>The applicant is fired for misconduct
<LI>The applicant participates in a labor strike
<LI>The applicant refuses an offer to work again for the former employer
<LI>The applicant fails to apply for or accept suitable work
<LI>The applicant quits for any reason other than an illegal or otherwise intolerable work environment
</UL>
Because employers and employees often have different ideas of what constitutes a reasonable work environment, the issue in most disputes over unemployment claims is whether the employer created an intolerable workplace environment. Only certain kinds of employer actions give someone a legitimate reason to quit a job and still collect unemployment benefits. Some valid reasons are: sexual harassment by an employer or inaction by an employer who was informed of instances of sexual harassment, a substantial cut in pay or benefits, drastic changes in working conditions or hours without an employee's consent, and requiring an employee to break the law or work under obviously unsafe conditions. 
<P>
Conditions of employment that generally do not let an employee collect unemployment benefits include: a demotion or other change in management structure that leads to a modest decrease in wages or benefits, disagreements over management policy, and reasonable changes in workplace hours or employee regulations.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Benefits </STRONG></H4></A>
If the department decides that an applicant is eligible to receive benefits, he or she receives a portion of their previous salary up to a maximum ceiling determined by the average statewide salary calculated each year. Benefits are paid for up to 26 weeks or until an applicant has received one-third of his or her former salary, whichever is sooner. Finding a part-time or temporary job will not necessarily prevent someone from receiving unemployment benefits if he or she continues to look for permanent work. The recipient keeps $50 or 25 percent of his or her weekly income, whichever is more. Unemployment benefits are reduced by any income in excess of $50 or 25 percent.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Workers' Compensation </STRONG></H3></A>
Workers' Compensation provides benefits to employees injured in the workplace, regardless of whether their own or anyone else's negligence causes the injury. With few exceptions, all Minnesota employees are covered by the Minnesota Workers' Compensation Act. 
<P>
The benefits available to workers include death benefits, permanent and temporary total disability, permanent and temporary partial disability, and medical and related expenses. The benefit amounts are determined by state guidelines and can be as high as two-thirds of a worker's salary at the time of the injury. 
<P>
Workers' Compensation is discussed further in the <A HREF="c10.html">Personal Injury</A> Chapter. 
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Social Security </STRONG></H3></A>
Social Security provides benefits for retired workers, including full- or part-time wage or salary workers, self-employed persons, farm workers, members of the United States Armed Services, employees of private nonprofit organizations, most federal, state, and local government employees, and most domestic workers. The usual age for first receiving Social Security benefits is age 65; however, a worker has the option of initiating benefits at age 62. The amount of each monthly check varies depending on how much the worker made each year. The higher his or her pay, the higher the benefits, up to a maximum dollar amount. 
<P>
Social Security is discussed in greater detail in the <A HREF="c14.html">Elder Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Civil Rights in the Workplace </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Four major federal laws-the Civil Rights Acts of 1964 and 1991, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990-protect the rights of American workers to be free from workplace discrimination. Minnesota workers also have additional protection under the Minnesota Human Rights Act. 
<P>
Many federal civil rights laws apply only to employers with a minimum number of employees. The federal Americans with Disabilities Act, for example, only applies to employers with 15 or more employees after July 26, 1994. The Minnesota Human Rights Act, however, applies to all Minnesota employers who have one or more employees, except close relatives. In addition, the Minnesota act covers more types of discrimination than do the federal laws.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>In General </STRONG></H3></A>
Most employment discrimination is outlawed by two major civil rights acts passed by Congress in 1964 and 1991 and by the Minnesota Human Rights Act. Through a combination of these laws, Minnesota workers are protected against discrimination based on race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, status with regard to public assistance, membership or activity in a local commission, age, or disability.
<P>
People frequently refer to "Title VII" rights when they are talking about a particular section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII prohibits discrimination in a wide number of employment areas including hiring, firing, recruitment, transfers, promotions, testing, layoffs, recalls, fringe benefits, training, apprenticeship programs, and job advertisements. Title VII also specifically prohibits retaliation against a person who files a charge of discrimination, participates in an investigation of discrimination, or opposes an unlawful employment practice.
<P>
Under certain extremely limited circumstances these civil rights acts allow employers to base their employment decisions or practices on a person's race, marital status, sex, etc., if the employer can demonstrate a truly legitimate need. For example, it is not impermissible sex discrimination to refuse to hire a man to be an attendant in a women's locker room. Religious institutions can refuse to hire individuals based on their religious beliefs, but only for positions that are directly related to the performance of religious duties. Religious institutions are generally not allowed to discriminate when hiring individuals for secular tasks such as secretarial or janitorial work.
<P>
Certain employers, such as police departments, can base employment decisions on an applicant's physical abilities. Some pre-employment exams are allowed under Minnesota law if they measure skills that are truly essential for an applicant to have in order to perform a particular job and are not applied in a selective or discriminatory way. Lawyers, for example, must pass a bar exam before they can practice law, and a company hiring secretaries can give applicants typing exams. 
<P>
Proving discrimination in the workplace depends on the specifics of each situation. It is generally easier to prove discrimination from a repeated pattern of behavior rather than an isolated incident. For example, a strong case of race discrimination could be made against an employer if members of a certain class of people are held to a higher standard than others. 
<P>
In addition, any documented evidence showing an employer is prejudiced against a class of people can strengthen a discrimination case. If an employer makes statements such as "blacks don't take orders well" or "women aren't capable of making tough management decisions," this will likely increase the chances of proving discrimination, especially if the statements are made repeatedly and in the presence of witnesses.
<P>
A person who feels that he or she has been unfairly discriminated against or harassed in the workplace can file a complaint with the Minnesota Department of Human Rights or the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The Minnesota Department of Human Rights enforces the Minnesota Human Rights Act, and the EEOC enforces federal civil rights in the workplace. When a person files a complaint with either of these agencies, that agency cross-files with the other agency. A victim of discrimination has 300 days to file a complaint with the EEOC or 365 days to file a complaint with the Department of Human Rights after the alleged discriminatory incident occurs. The victim of discrimination can also hire a private attorney to pursue a claim against an employer.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Age Discrimination </STRONG></H3></A>
The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) expands Title VII prohibitions against age discrimination. Most employers cannot enforce mandatory retirement policies, except under a few very specific circumstances where age is truly a qualification for doing a particular job, such as firefighting, police work, or flying airplanes. Anyone age 40 or over who works for an employer with 20 or more employees is protected by the ADEA and cannot be retired against his or her will, regardless of age, as long as he or she can do the job. Any Minnesota employer employing fewer than 20 employees is prohibited by Title VII and other federal and state laws from discrimination based on age, but such an employer can force an employee aged 70 or older to retire.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Discrimination Against Persons with Disabilities </STRONG></H3></A>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law that prohibits discrimination based on physical and mental ability. The ADA requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for physically or mentally disabled employees, including modifying facilities and work schedules and providing special training. Using pre-employment tests that identify and exclude disabled applicants is permissible only where the tests are unequivocally job-related.
<P>
The ADA does not change in any way an employer's right to hire people who have the skills to perform the "essential duties" of a job. The ADA makes it illegal to refuse to hire an applicant or to fire a current employee who lacks physical or mental abilities that are not essential to the job. For example, an employer cannot reject a person with epilepsy who has applied for a job as a daycare provider merely because the applicant's epilepsy prevents her from having a driver's license. Just because the applicant could not take children to a hospital in emergencies is not a valid reason to discriminate against the epileptic applicant, since occasionally driving a child to a medical clinic or hospital is not an "essential" task of a daycare provider. 
<P>
An employer required to comply with the ADA must do whatever is reasonable to accommodate a person's disability, including modifying work schedules, changing the work environment, buying or modifying special equipment, or reassigning to another position a disabled employee who can no longer do the "essential duties" of a job. A "reasonable accommodation" for an employer to make is one that does not place an undue burden on the employer. 
<P>
The ADA only protects from discrimination those people with permanent conditions that limit a major life activity. Thus, an employee who has a sprained ankle that is expected to heal fully is not protected under the ADA, even though that employee is disabled for a period of time. A person with a permanent disabling condition that is controlled by drugs, physical therapy, or by some other treatment, however, is covered by the ADA. For example, an epileptic whose seizures are controlled by medication is protected from discrimination by the ADA. People with AIDS or HIV are covered by the ADA. The ADA also prohibits discriminating against individuals who have completed or are still participating in drug rehabilitation programs. However, an applicant or employee currently using illegal drugs is not protected by the ADA.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Sexual Harassment </STRONG></H3></A>
Everyone, male or female, has the right to be free from sexual harassment in the workplace. Sexual harassment can take many forms:
<UL>
<LI>Someone says something sexual about a coworker's appearance
<LI>An employer enforces a mandatory dress code that provokes others to make sexually explicit comments
<LI>Someone makes unwanted sexual contact
<LI>Someone connects a condition of the job, such as a raise, with sexual contact
<LI>Someone makes sexual jokes or explicit sexual comments that embarrass a coworker
<LI>Someone displays or passes around pornographic pictures
</UL>
Although there is no federal or state act that specifically outlaws sexual harassment, sexual harassment is punishable as an illegal form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and under the Minnesota Human Rights Act. Sexual harassment is illegal if participation in any of the above activities is required to get or keep a job, to be promoted, or to qualify for benefits, or if it makes it harder for a worker to do his or her job by creating a hostile environment. 
<P>
Unwelcome behavior must be both undesirable and offensive to be considered sexual harassment. Of these two criteria, the most problematic is determining what kind of behavior is offensive. Because of the diversity of sexual attitudes in this country, what is sexually offensive to one person may just be harmless sexual banter to another. The law uses the "reasonable person" standard to determine what is offensive; if a reasonable person would find an action offensive, then it is offensive. 
<P>
While determining what kind of behavior constitutes sexual harassment is an inexact science, some general descriptions of sexual harassment can be made. A single, or very occasional, sexual joke or sexual comment is not sexual harassment unless the comment unequivocally offers workplace advancement in return for sexual favors. Unwanted touching of someone else's body is sexual harassment, as is the repeated telling of lewd or obscene jokes that make an employee uncomfortable. A case for sexual harassment is strengthened if the person doing the touching or telling the dirty jokes has been repeatedly told that he or she makes the workplace uncomfortable. A case for sexual harassment is weakened if the person claiming harassment participates in the joke-telling or similar activity.  
<P>
In addition to laws designed to give victims a civil remedy against sexual harassment, criminal laws provide remedies against the most serious forms of unwanted sexual contact. If a harasser's behavior crosses the line into assault, battery, or rape, the victim can file criminal charges against the perpetrator. 
<P>
Anyone fired or forced to leave a job because of sexual harassment may be entitled to receive unemployment insurance benefits while searching for a new job.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Pregnancy Discrimination </STRONG></H3></A>
Title VII protects pregnant workers and pregnant job applicants from discrimination. Employers cannot refuse to hire a woman because she is pregnant, fire a woman because she is pregnant, take away benefits or accrued seniority because a woman takes maternity leave, or fire or refuse to hire a woman who has an abortion. 
<P>
Generally, an employer must treat pregnant women the same as other workers who cannot perform their jobs for short periods of time. Thus, if an employer allows employees to take a leave for a broken leg or short-term illness, he or she must allow pregnant women to take a leave under the same terms and conditions. Pregnancy leave is also protected under the Family and Medical Leave Act discussed below. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Other Workplace Rights and Responsibilities </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Wages and Hours </STRONG></H3></A> 
At the start of 1994, the federal minimum wage for adult workers age 18 and over was $4.25 per hour. Exceptions to the minimum wage law are given for some minors, disabled workers, and trainees. Employers must pay at least the minimum wage, even to employees who earn tips. Employers cannot force employees to share their tips with other workers or managers, although employees may do so voluntarily. With few exceptions, employers must pay hourly employees one and a half times their regular rate for all hours worked in a week in excess of 40 hours. 
<P>
Certain salaried workers are exempt from minimum wage standards and overtime regulations. To be exempt, an employee must be in an executive, administrative, or professional position and receive at least $250 each week in salary or fee. The employee must either supervise at least two other workers, manage an office or a business operation, be a skilled artistic performer or a teacher, or work in a profession requiring advanced knowledge, such as engineering. 
<P>
Students who are 16 or 17 years old cannot work on days before school is scheduled between 11:30 p.m. and 4:30 a.m. Minors age 14 and 15 years cannot work between the hours of 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. while school is in session and from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m. during summer vacation, and they cannot work more than three hours per day or 18 hours per week during the school year. Minors aged 15 years or younger working as models, actors, or performers, doing chores such as babysitting and housework for others, or working for their parents are exempt from these time-of-work restrictions. Also exempt from these time-of-work restrictions are newspaper carriers, if they are at least 11 years old, and those working in agricultural jobs with parental permission.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Substance Abuse in the Workplace </STRONG></H3></A>
The Minnesota Human Rights Act does, under some conditions, protect alcoholics and drug addicts from discrimination. The protection is not absolute; an alcoholic or drug addict can be disciplined or fired if the drug or alcohol addiction prevents the addict from performing essential job duties, or if the addiction endangers the safety of others. 
<P>
Under certain circumstances, employers in Minnesota can compel employees to pass drug and alcohol tests as a condition of employment. These tests must not be given in a discriminatory way, and if passing a drug or alcohol test is a job requirement, then all employees performing that job must subject to the testing requirement.  
<P>
An employer may test an employee for drugs and alcohol only under the following conditions:
<UL>
<LI>Reasonable suspicion: when an employer notices obvious signs (slurred speech, glazed eyes, etc.) that an employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol; when an employee injures herself or another worker while on the job, or has an accident while operating a vehicle to perform a work-related task; when an employee has unmistakably violated workplace rules on drugs or alcohol while operating an employer's machinery, equipment, or vehicle.
<LI>Safety-sensitive positions: when an employee performs a task in which impairment by drugs or alcohol directly affects the safety of other workers or the general public.
<LI>Routine physical exams: when conducting a routine physical exam, provided that giving such an exam is directly related to job performance. In addition, such a test cannot be required more than once a year and employees must be given at least two weeks' written notice of the exam.
<LI>Treatment program follow-up: at any time in the two years after an employee completes a drug or alcohol treatment program, provided the treatment was covered by an employee benefit plan or if the employer directed the employee to complete the treatment. 
</UL>
Any such testing must be done in accordance with a written policy, and the policy must be made available in advance to all employees. Also, under the law, an individual who fails a substance test must be given a chance to go through rehabilitation before being fired. 
<P>
<A NAME="210"><H3><STRONG>Parenting, Family, and Medical Leave </STRONG></H3></A>
Both the State of Minnesota and the federal government require certain employers to provide parenting, family, and medical leave to qualified employees. The federal law in this area preempts state law only where the federal law provides greater benefits. In areas for which Minnesota provides greater benefits, Minnesota law is controlling. Accordingly, it pays to be familiar with both laws. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="220"><H4><STRONG>Federal Law </STRONG></H4></A>
The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) is a federal law that allows qualified employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to attend to family matters, including health emergencies. Under the act, a qualified employee may take an unpaid leave following the birth or adoption of a child, after acquiring a foster child, to care for an immediate family member with a serious health condition, or to care for his or her own serious health condition. Men and women are equally entitled to take these leaves.   
<P>
Not every worker is qualified to take these leaves of absence. A person must be a full-time employee of a company with 50 or more employees and have worked for the company at least 12 months. In addition, an employee must have worked at the company for at least 1250 hours during the 12 months immediately prior to taking a leave under the FMLA.   
<P>
Under the act, an employer must maintain the health benefits that an employee was receiving at the time a leave begins, during periods of unpaid FMLA leave at the same level and in the same manner as if the employee had continued to work. Under most circumstances, an employee may elect or the employer may require the use of any accrued paid leave for periods of unpaid leave under the FMLA. The employee is not entitled to accrue benefits such as vacation time or sick leave during a leave under the FMLA.   
<P>
When the leave is foreseeable, an employee must provide the employer with at least 30 days' notice of the need for the leave. If the leave is not foreseeable, then the notice must be given as soon as it is practical. An employer may require medical certification of a serious health condition from the employee and may require periodic reports during the period of leave of the employee's status and intent to return to work. In addition, an employer may require a fitness-for-duty certification upon return to work in appropriate situations.   
<P>
When an employee returns from a leave under the FMLA, the employee is entitled to be restored to the same job the employee left when the leave began. If the same job is not available, the employer must place the employee in an equivalent job with equivalent pay, benefits, duties, and responsibilities. Any benefits accrued by the employee at the time of the leave have to stay with the employee. Under the act, employers are prohibited from discriminating against or interfering with employees who take FMLA leaves.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="230"><H4><STRONG>Minnesota Law </STRONG></H4></A>
Under the Minnesota Family Leave Act employers with 20 or more employees are required to provide qualified employees with up to six weeks unpaid vacation time for the birth or adoption of a child. During the employee's absence, the employer must make insurance benefits available to the employee, although the employee can be required to make the payments for that insurance. Upon return, the employee is entitled to his or her previous job or a comparable position. A worker choosing not to return to work at the end of a leave period may be considered to have voluntarily quit and be denied unemployment benefits. Employers with 20 or more employees must allow employees to use their own accrued sick, disability, or medical leave to care for a sick or injured child for such reasonable period as necessary to care for the child. 
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Privacy </STRONG></H3></A>
Employees' right to privacy while at work is a hotly debated issue today as increasing numbers of employers turn to searches, surveillance, and eavesdropping in an attempt to better monitor their employees' activities. The law in this area is evolving and still largely unsettled, but it is fair to say that an employee surrenders some of his or her right to privacy at the workplace door. An employer has far greater legal right to monitor employees than the government has to monitor citizens.   
<P>
The controlling factor courts look to in deciding if an employee has a right of privacy is whether an employee's expectation of privacy in a particular situation is reasonable. For example, the expectation of privacy is more reasonable for items in a locked desk drawer than for items left out on a desk. Similarly, the expectation is more reasonable for private phone calls made on a pay phone than for work-related calls made on the employer's phone.  
<P>
The reasonable expectation standard is not a very strong guarantor of employee privacy. An employer can dramatically expand his or her right to searches, monitoring, and surveillance simply by giving notice to employees. Once an employee receives notice that the employer reserves the right to monitor calls, search offices, read electronic mail, or film the workplace, there is very little reasonable expectation of privacy. 
<P>
<A NAME="250"><H3><STRONG>Leave of Absence </STRONG></H3></A>
Under Minnesota law, all employers are required to provide paid voting leave during the morning of regularly scheduled state primary or general elections, presidential primary, or election to fill a vacancy in the U.S. House of Representatives or Senate. All employers are required to provide unpaid leave so that employees can serve on juries, testify in trial, or serve in the military. All employers must provide up to 16 hours of unpaid leave per school year so that parents or guardians can attend school conferences or activities otherwise scheduled during the work day. Employers with at least 20 employees are required to provide up to 40 hours paid leave for any employee donating bone marrow.
<P>
<A NAME="260"><H3><STRONG>Whistleblower Statutes </STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota and the federal government both forbid an employer from firing a worker in retaliation for reporting a violation of law or for refusing to participate in activity the employee believes to be illegal. If an employee acts in good faith and reports suspected illegal activities to the employer, any governmental agency, or law enforcement officer, the employee cannot be fired or be treated adversely. The employee need not go through internal employer sponsored channels to report suspected illegal activity. 
<P>
<A NAME="270"><H3><STRONG>Employee Access to Personnel Records </STRONG></H3></A>
Employees who work for companies with 20 or more employees are guaranteed access to their personnel records. An employee is anyone currently working for the company or who has been separated for less than one year. Independent contractors are not covered.  
<P>
The personnel record includes: application, wage or salary history, commendations, warnings, discharge or termination letters, employment history and job titles, and performance evaluations. In most situations, the personnel record does not include written references, information regarding allegations of criminal misconduct, results of employer administered tests, or statements or portions of statements by coworkers concerning job performance that would disclose the identity of the coworker by name, inference, or otherwise.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Family Law 
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Family law touches most people at least once in their lives. When people get married, reach adulthood, have children, or dissolve a marriage, they need to be aware of how their legal status changes. Most family law is state law; there is very little federal regulation of families. Because each state has the authority to regulate families within its BORDERs, this chapter is specific to Minnesota.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Marriage in Minnesota </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In Minnesota, two unmarried persons may marry by obtaining a marriage license and exchanging vows before an official authorized to formalize the vows. Officials authorized to conduct weddings include judges, clerks of court, and licensed religious officials. This exchange must be witnessed by at least two other individuals.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Who Can Marry </STRONG></H3></A>
An unmarried man and an unmarried woman, age 18 or older, are free to marry without permission from parents, guardian, or judge. Men and women between the ages of 15 and 18 can marry with the consent of a parent, guardian, or a judge in juvenile court. Same sex marriages are not recognized. Brothers are not allowed to marry their sisters, uncles their nieces, aunts their nephews, and first cousins are not allowed to marry each other. Minnesota is obligated by the United States Constitution to give full faith and credit to any marriage recognized by any other state, so persons who cannot marry in Minnesota may travel to another state to marry and, on return, their marriage would be recognized by the State of Minnesota.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>License Requirements </STRONG></H3></A>
Marriage licenses can be obtained through the clerk of court in any county in Minnesota. The application must be accompanied by a licensing fee of $65. The applicants must provide proof of age (birth certificates) and proof that any preceding marriages have ended either through death or divorce (death certificate or divorce/dissolution judgment and decree).
<P>
The application provides an area to designate the desired names of the parties after the marriage, however, neither party need change his or her name. Blood testing is not required in Minnesota.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Time Limits </STRONG></H3></A>
There is usually a five-day waiting period after application before the license is issued. This waiting period can be waived by a court order of a county or district judge in response to extraordinary circumstances. Once issued, the marriage license is valid for six months and can be exercised at any time by the individuals before an authorized official anywhere in the state.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>An Individual's Rights Within Marriage </STRONG></H3></A>
Spouses have an obligation to support one another financially. Necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter are the responsibility of both spouses. An individual spouse may build credit or incur debt independently of the other spouse for non-necessities, or the couple may incur such debt together. When one spouse dies, the surviving spouse typically has the right to receive property from his or her spouse. It is difficult, though not impossible, to disinherit a partner to a valid marriage.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Non-Marital Cohabitation </STRONG></H3></A>
Common law marriage is a marriage created by an agreement between two people to marry followed by cohabitation. Although common law marriages are a way for a couple to become married in some states, Minnesota does not recognize common law marriages. Even if a couple presents themselves as husband and wife, a marriage is not valid until the couple obtains a license and exchanges vows. People who are not legally married are not entitled to spousal rights, are not bound by spousal obligations, and are viewed as mere cohabitants.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Termination of Marriage </STRONG></H3></A>
Dissolution, also known as divorce, ends a marriage. A marriage can be dissolved by a judgment and decree issued by a state court. The court also decides such issues as custody, visitation, child support, spousal maintenance (formerly called alimony), and property division.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Grounds for Dissolution </STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota has a no-fault divorce law. Thus, the only ground for dissolution of a marriage is a showing by the parties that there has been an irretrievable breakdown in the marital relationship. Because divorce is no-fault, a court cannot consider either spouse's fault in causing the divorce when making its determinations of custody, visitation, or other dissolution matters.
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Effects of a Dissolving of Marriage </STRONG></H3></A>
Parties to a marriage dissolution can agree with one another how to handle their affairs. Matters on which the parties disagree, however, must be decided by a court. Court-ordered guidelines generally include instructions on child custody, visitation rights, child support, spousal maintenance, and division of marital property.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Child Custody </STRONG></H4></A>
Child custody is determined by a court based upon the best interests of the children. There are two different types of child custody: sole and joint custody. Sole custody gives one parent complete responsibility for raising the children. In joint custody, both parents share that responsibility. Joint custody can be either joint legal custody or joint physical custody. In joint legal custody, the children reside mostly with one parent, known as the custodial parent, who is primarily responsible for the routine decisions affecting the children, but both parents share the responsibility for making important decisions regarding the children. In joint physical custody, each parent is involved in both the day-to-day and the more significant decisions affecting their children, and the children spend time with both parents, although not necessarily an equal amount of time with each.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="120"><H4><STRONG>Visitation </STRONG></H4></A>
Visitation by the parent without custody is strongly encouraged in Minnesota. Typically, the non-custodial parent is granted visitation rights unless the court feels that such visits would be detrimental to the children. Parents can make child visitation agreements themselves, but if a friendly agreement cannot be reached, the court sets a schedule for visitation or orders that the non-custodial parent be allowed reasonable visitation. Certain other people, such as grandparents, who have close relationships with the children, may also be allowed some form of visitation.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Child Support </STRONG></H4></A>
Child support is financial assistance provided by the non-custodial parent to help support the children. Factors affecting the amount of child support a court orders include the parent's income, the children's needs, the number of children, and the needs of the parents. Child support is an independent obligation and must be maintained despite any other problems between the parents, such as disagreements about visitation.
<P>
A recently enacted federal law requires employers to withhold wages from employees who are under a court order to provide child support after January 1, 1994. A new Minnesota law provides that parents who are three months behind in child support payments could lose their driver's licenses. Barbers, contractors, doctors, and others who have licenses to practice their jobs could lose their occupational license if they are three months behind.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Spousal Maintenance </STRONG></H4></A>
Spousal maintenance is financial support provided by one party to an ex-spouse. Either spouse can seek spousal maintenance from the other. Factors that a court evaluates in setting spousal maintenance include the standard of living enjoyed during the marriage, the relative incomes or earning potentials of the parties, and the needs of each party.
<P>
Spousal maintenance can be either temporary or permanent. If a party agrees to give up a claim for spousal maintenance it may not be renewed at a later date. Like child support, spousal maintenance must be maintained despite any disagreements between the ex-spouses. A recently enacted state law provides for revocation of occupational licenses and/or seizure of state tax refunds of persons delinquent in their spousal maintenance payments.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG>Division of Property </STRONG></H4></A>
Courts attempt to divide marital property on a fair, although not always equal, basis. Typically, all of the couple's assets are eligible for division between the two parties. Special attention is paid to the particular needs of the parties in making the division. Property belonging solely to one spouse prior to the marriage, or gifts such as an inheritance, even if received during marriage, may be classified as non-marital property. Non-marital property is usually returned to the party from which it originated and not included in the division of marital assets.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Annulment and Separation </STRONG></H3></A>
An annulment is a court finding that a couple's marriage never legally existed. Such a finding may result in cases of fraud or when proper consent for the marriage was not obtained. These relationships are said to be voidable because either party can ask that the marriage be annulled. The requirements for annulling a marriage are similar to those for obtaining a dissolution. Some marriages, such as those between close relatives, are against the law and are said to be void. Void marriages need not be annulled because no marriage ever existed, so there is no marriage to annul. It is important to note that a legal annulment is different from an annulment granted by a particular church. A religious annulment is spiritual, rather than legal in nature, and does not impact the legal status of the marriage. Likewise, a legal annulment may not satisfy the requirements for a religious annulment.
<P>
A legal separation involves many of the same procedures as divorce, however, the couple remains legally married and remarriage is forbidden. Court decisions made in a legal separation are not final because either party may still seek a dissolution if they so choose. As with a dissolution, the grounds for a legal separation are an irretrievable breakdown of the marital relationship. Often a legal separation is sought by those whose religious beliefs prohibit divorce but who still desire child support and spousal maintenance.
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Antenuptial Contracts </STRONG></H3></A>
An antenuptial contract, also known as a prenuptial agreement, is an agreement between parties to a marriage regarding what rights each has to the other's property upon dissolution of the marriage, legal separation, or death. Antenuptial contracts are valid and enforceable in Minnesota if:
<UL>
<LI>Each party fully discloses his or her earnings and property
<LI>Each party has opportunity to consult with legal counsel of his or her choice
<LI>The agreement is entered into prior to the day the marriage is solemnized
<LI>The agreement is in writing, witnessed by at least two people, and acknowledged by the parties before a person authorized to administer oaths
</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Adoption </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Adoption policy in the United States is currently undergoing a great deal of public scrutiny and remains a hotly debated and legislated area of the law. A few basic adoption principles are discussed below.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Adoptive Placements </STRONG></H3></A>
An agency placement of a child for adoption is one made through a state licensed adoption agency. An independent placement is one arranged between the adoptive and birth parent(s) without assistance of an agency. In this situation, the parties have come together through other means-usually through mutual friends.
<P>
In Minnesota, all agencies specializing in adoption must be licensed by the Minnesota Department of Human Services. Not all licensed agencies are equal, however. There is a great deal of difference among the agencies as to services offered, adoptive clients served, geographic area served, fees charged, and age of the child sought to be adopted. When dealing with an adoption agency, it is best to ask questions to determine whether the needs of the adoptive parents and the birth parents fit the services offered by the agency.
Minnesota has a statewide adoption exchange which lists all children available for adoption.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Open Versus Closed Adoption </STRONG></H3></A>
If the adoptive and birth parents know each other and remain in touch after the adoption, the adoption is said to be open. If they do not know each other and do not stay in touch after the adoption, it is said to be closed.
<P>
Open and closed adoptions are not the only two options available to parents. Open and closed adoptions exist at opposite ends of a continuum of choices. The degree of openness in an adoption is determined by the parties involved and may be quite complex. Most important to a successful adoption is that all expectations regarding openness and the role both sets of parents will play are clearly communicated and understood by all parties. A good adoption facilitator can be of assistance to help in the communications. Adoption attorneys can assist in ensuring the most secure adoption plan in the best interests of the child.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Paternity </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Paternity is the condition of being the father of a child. While the identity of a child's mother is usually obvious from birth, the identity of the father may be unclear. Decisions regarding child custody, visitation, and child support frequently turn on whether a man has established his paternity of a child. Minnesota law presumes a man is the father of a child if he and the mother are married to each other and the child is born during the marriage or within 280 days after the marriage ends, or if certain other conditions exist, such as the man receiving the minor child into his home and holding the child out as his biological child, or paternity is established to a 99% probability by blood testing. Under most circumstances, both the mother and father acknowledge paternity on a recognition form. If two presumptions conflict, paternity can be settled in court.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="220"><H2><STRONG>Abuse </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Abuse is not easily defined. The legal definition of abuse is continuously evolving and changing in response to society's changing understanding of the problem. The information presented below is by no means all-inclusive, and should only be viewed as a tool to prepare for consultation with a skilled professional.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Domestic Abuse </STRONG></H3></A>
Domestic abuse is the generic heading for harmful behavior, both actual or threatened, between family or household members. It includes actual or threatened physical harm, sexual abuse, and assault to the extent that immediate physical harm is feared. The term domestic abuse includes emotional abuse, without an immediate fear of bodily harm. This distinction is important when evaluating one's alternatives for judicial intervention.
<P>
Domestic abuse, by definition, is perpetrated by any adult who is now or used to be married to the victim, who is a parent to the victim, who is unmarried to, but who lives or used to live with the victim, or who is parent to a minor or an unborn child. Usually, the term domestic abuse is used to refer to abuse of a woman by her current or former husband or boyfriend. There are several options available to a victim of domestic abuse. A victim can file criminal charges, file a civil suit seeking damages, or seek an order for protection against the abuser. In ordinary circumstances, the first step is to seek an order for protection from the Family or County Court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="240"><H4><STRONG>Orders for Protection </STRONG></H4></A>
An order for protection is a court order prohibiting the person accused of committing abuse from continuing the abuse against the person bringing the action, the petitioner, or against any minor children in the household. The order forbids the alleged offender, the respondent, from physically harming or causing the fear of harm. The order is enforceable throughout the state of Minnesota, however, it will not necessarily be enforced by officials outside of the state.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="250"><H4><STRONG><EM>Requirements </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Orders for protection can be obtained at the county courthouse or at the county domestic abuse office in the county where the victim lives. To protect the victim and substantiate his or her claim against an alleged abuser, it is important that application be made as soon as possible after the abuse occurs. There is no fee for an order for protection, and the county is obligated to provide the public with assistance in completing the paperwork.
<P>
When completing the paperwork, it is helpful if the abused person or his or her guardian has a picture of the alleged abuser. If a picture is unavailable, a description of the individual is needed along with work and home addresses for the alleged abuser. A prepared statement of all incidents of abuse, both past and present, including dates and notes can help the official to document the need for protection for the judge.
<P>
For a court order to be granted, a petition must be supported with evidence of the alleged abuse, so the abused person or the abused person's guardian must fill out an affidavit describing the events surrounding the abuse and need for protection. If necessary, the abused person or his or her guardian can request a temporary (or <STRONG>ex parte</STRONG>) order for protection. This order might be necessary when an abused person is in danger and the protection is needed immediately.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="260"><H4><STRONG><EM>Hearing </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
A hearing on the matter is normally set within 14 days. The purpose of the hearing is for both the abused person and the person accused of abuse to be able to tell the judge of the events surrounding the alleged abuse. In order to notify the person accused of the abuse of the hearing, the sheriff of the county in which the accused lives serves the papers on the accused.
<P>
Regardless of whether the accused person attends the court hearing, the abused person or his or her guardian must be present. The hearing is the opportunity to present evidence of abuse and for the alleged abuser to defend himself or herself. It is at the hearing that the person alleging abuse should substantiate the abuse with medical records and police reports.
<P>
At this point, the judge may rule on the matter or continue the matter for a later date. If the judge rules on the matter, he or she can grant the petition or dismiss the matter. In order to grant the petition, the judge must believe that protection is necessary for the safety of the person alleging the abuse. The order for protection is usually in effect for one year. If the judge dismisses the matter, he or she does not believe that the request for protection is supported by the evidence. A continuance merely means that the judge believes that more time is necessary to evaluate the case, either for decision-making or collecting evidence.
<P>
Additionally, the court may order a trial for cases where the abuse is denied and may determine temporary custody and visitation of minor children. Courts look to the specific facts of the case and will issue orders in accordance with the circumstances of the case. Other common orders are for restitution, for counseling and/or evaluation, prohibiting any contact, for the accused to refrain from visiting the school and/or workplace of the person alleging abuse, and for child support and spousal maintenance.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="270"><H4><STRONG><EM>Violations of Orders for Protection </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
When an order for protection, either temporary or permanent, is granted and the person prohibited from contacting the abused attempts to violate the order, the police should be contacted through the 911 emergency system and notified of the order. Once the order is enforced and the alleged abuser removed, a complete police report should be filed documenting the incident. Violation of an order is a criminal offense for which charges may be brought.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="280"><H4><STRONG><EM>Changing an Order </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
If circumstances arise making a change in the order necessary, the county domestic abuse office or county clerk must be contacted to set another hearing. An appointment will be set to request a hearing and the process is similar to that listed above. If an extension of the protection period is needed, a victim or guardian should contact the appropriate officials approximately three weeks before the current order expires.
<P>
<A NAME="290"><H3><STRONG>Elder Abuse </STRONG></H3></A>
Abuse of older persons technically falls within the definition of domestic abuse, and such persons are granted the same legal protections as other domestic abuse victims. However, Minnesota also has specific laws that protect adults who are vulnerable because of a mental or physical disability, or because they are dependent on others for their care. Intentional failure to provide necessities, such as food and clothing, is criminal neglect, as is financial exploitation of a vulnerable adult. Intentional abuse is a felony that carries stiff penalties. Health care professionals who suspect abuse of adults are required to report their suspicions to the state.
<P>
<A NAME="300"><H3><STRONG>Child Abuse </STRONG></H3></A>
Child abuse is a serious problem that can take many forms.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="310"><H4><STRONG>Neglect </STRONG></H4></A>
Neglect is the failure of a person responsible for a child to supply necessary food, clothing, shelter, or medical care when that person is able to do so, or failure to protect the child from imminent and serious danger to his or her physical or mental health. Neglect may only be charged against a person who is legally responsible for the child. Neglect does not, however, cover instances where a parent or guardian in good faith relies on spiritual prayer for a sick child. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="320"><H4><STRONG>Physical Abuse </STRONG></H4></A>
Physical abuse is any physical or mental injury, actual or threatened, inflicted upon a child by other than accidental means by a person responsible for the child's well-being. Physical abuse also includes any physical or mental injury that is unexplainable by the child's medical history and any means of discipline or control not authorized by law as acceptable for use with persons who are mentally challenged or impaired.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="330"><H4><STRONG>Mental Injury </STRONG></H4></A>
Mental injury is any harm done to the child's psychological capacity or emotional stability. Evidence of such harm is any observable or substantial impairment of the child's ability to function normally as compared with other children of the same culture.
<P>
Symptoms of mental injury occur in response to repeated and habitual emotional abuse by the person responsible for the care and nurturing of the child. They may include emotionally disturbed behavior, low self-esteem, inappropriate interaction with others, inability to communicate with others, extreme hostility and anger, anti-social behavior, and speech and learning disorders.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="340"><H4><STRONG>Threatened Injury </STRONG></H4></A>
Any statement, overt act, condition, or status that would be considered a risk of physical or sexual abuse constitutes threatened injury.
<P>
<A NAME="350"><H3><STRONG>Sexual Abuse </STRONG></H3></A>
Any person in a position of authority over a child who subjects the child to sexual contact commits sexual abuse. Sexual abuse can also include involving a child in prostitution or pornography. Sexual contact includes any touching, fondling, or molestation, clothed or naked, of intimate parts of the child or the abuser. Intimate parts include the genital area, groin, inner thigh, buttocks or breast of a person.
<P>
A person in a position of authority over the child includes a parent or person acting in the role or place of a parent. A person in the position of authority also includes anyone responsible for, either directly or through another person, the care, supervision, health or welfare of the child, no matter how brief, at the time of the abuse.
<P>
<A NAME="360"><H3><STRONG>Prenatal Exposure to Controlled Substances </STRONG></H3></A>
Non-medicinal use of a controlled substance by a pregnant woman constitutes prenatal exposure to controlled substances. This form of abuse is subject to the same mandatory reporting requirements that apply to other child abuse. Persons not required to report the abuse may voluntarily and confidentially report the abuse when they know or have reason to believe that a pregnant woman is using a controlled substance.
<P>
<A NAME="370"><H3><STRONG>Abuse Reporting Requirements </STRONG></H3></A>
Requirements for reporting abuse depend on whether the victim is a child or an adult.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="380"><H4><STRONG>Reporting Child Abuse </STRONG></H4></A>
Neglect and abuse are leading causes of death in children. By law, certain members of society, by virtue of their professions and positions, are required to report child abuse. Persons required to report abuse, known as mandatory reporters, include doctors, nurses, teachers, police and law enforcement officials, child care providers, and clergy members. Virtually anyone who works directly with children to provide physical and mental care, protection, caregiving, and supervision is required to report actual or suspected instances of child abuse.
<P>
Mandatory reporters are obligated to report to the child protection unit of the local social service or law enforcement agency any abuse and neglect known or believed to have occurred in the last three years. If a mandatory reporter fails to report an instance of known abuse or neglect, he or she is guilty of a misdemeanor.
<P>
Reporting child abuse with an honest belief and without knowledge of any facts or events contradicting the abuse or neglect, will not make a person subject to any lawsuit for mistaken allegations.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="390"><H4><STRONG><EM>Contents of a Report of Child Abuse or Neglect </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Child protection workers must request information from a person reporting child abuse. To expedite the attention given to a child in an abusive or neglected situation, the reporter will want to have the following items ready for report:
<UL>
<LI>The reporter's name, phone number, and relationship to the child and to the alleged offender
<LI>Events surrounding the known or suspected abuse
<LI>The basis for the report
<LI>Identifying information for victim, parents, and the alleged abuser, including names, addresses and phone numbers, if available
<LI>Whereabouts of the victim
<LI>An evaluation of the immediacy of danger to the victim
<LI>Any other information regarding the child or family
</UL>
It is important to remember that if the child is in immediate danger, help should be sought through law enforcement and the emergency 911 system.
<P>
The name of the individual reporting the abuse or neglect must be kept confidential by the child protection workers and can only be released by consent of the reporter or by court order.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="400"><H4><STRONG><EM>After an Abuse/Neglect Report </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Depending upon the urgency of the report, an investigation will be conducted by a welfare agency worker with no connection to the parties. Only if a child is in immediate danger can the child be removed against a parent's or guardian's wishes. A child may be removed temporarily from an immediately dangerous situation, however. A court order is necessary within 72 hours to keep a child against the wishes of a parent or guardian.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="410"><H4><STRONG><EM>Investigation of Child Abuse/Neglect </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
In investigating a report of child abuse or neglect, child protection and social service workers must conduct a face-to-face interview with the child and are not required to obtain parental permission before interviewing the victim of the alleged abuse. By the time that the investigation concludes, however, the parent or guardian must be informed that the child has been interviewed.
<P>
The initial objectives of the investigation by child protection workers are to evaluate the existence of any physical or emotional damage to the child, identify the risk of harm to the child, determine the urgency of the claim, and decide whether immediate intervention is required. As part of the investigation, the agency also interviews the alleged offender. After these factors have been assessed, the goals are to determine whether the family is a candidate for treatment and to initiate and monitor treatment and its progress. If the worker decides that judicial intervention is needed, an action is initiated in juvenile or family court. If there is not enough evidence of abuse, the case will be closed.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="420"><H4><STRONG>Vulnerable Adults Act </STRONG></H4></A>
Minnesota has enacted legislation to protect vulnerable adults from abuse through the Vulnerable Adults Act.
<P>
Vulnerable adults are any persons over the age of 18 residing in, or receiving services from a hospital, care facility, nursing home or other similarly licensed facility. Other adults, regardless of whether they live in or receive care from such facilities, are also considered vulnerable adults. These individuals include persons who are challenged with physical, emotional, or mental impairments. Vulnerable adults may be victims of physical, mental, emotional, and sexual abuse, and of neglect similar to the abuse and neglect of children.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="430"><H4><STRONG><EM>Mandatory Reports </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Certain individuals are obligated to report abuse or neglect of vulnerable adults. These individuals include professionals or employees of a hospital, care facility, or other such state-licensed agency.
<P>
A mandatory reporter who fails to report a known instance of abuse or neglect is subject to a penalty of up to 90 days in jail and a $700 fine. In addition, a mandatory reporter may be subject to damages suffered by the vulnerable adult resulting from the failure to report.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="440"><H4><STRONG><EM>Voluntary Reports </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Others who know of or suspect abuse or neglect can make a report of any known or suspected incident of abuse or neglect. Anyone reporting in good faith is immune from civil liability; a reporter may rely on not being sued by the alleged abuser for damages that occur due to a reasonably believed suspicion of abuse or neglect. A person will, however, be held liable for making a false report where the report was made with knowledge of its falsity or with a blatant disregard for its truth or falsity.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="450"><H4><STRONG><EM>Contents of a Report of Abuse/Neglect </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
A report of an incident of abuse or neglect of a vulnerable adult may be made to the local social service agency, the local law enforcement, the county sheriff's office, the Minnesota Department of Human Services Division of Licensing, or to the Office of Health Facilities in the Department of Health. As with child abuse and neglect, the protection worker must ask for information in order to investigate a claim.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="460"><H4><STRONG><EM>Effect of Filing a Report </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The local welfare agency investigates reports of abuse and can intervene to protect a vulnerable adult. The reporter's identity cannot be revealed to the alleged abuser without the reporter's consent or a court order. In addition to the investigation by the welfare agency, an investigation will likely follow by the Department of Health under its authority over health care facilities.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="470"><H2><STRONG>Reaching the Age of Majority in Minnesota </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
In Minnesota, a person is legally an adult at age 18. With a person's 18th birthday come most of the rights, privileges, responsibilities, and obligations of adulthood. These rights include the right to vote, the right to make contracts, the right to marry without permission from parents or guardians, the right to purchase a firearm, and the right to serve on a jury.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Health Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Health law is a relatively new and rapidly expanding area of legal specialization. Many lawyers are attracted to this constantly evolving area of practice. Their clients range from health care consumers seeking assistance to pay for health care to large corporate health care providers seeking to buy a chain of nursing homes. Because of the diversity of clients, the health law practice area has numerous subspecialties. 
<P>
This chapter covers subjects of interest to individual health care consumers. Living wills and durable powers of attorney are covered in the <A HREF="c14.html">Elder Law</A> Chapter. Discrimination is covered in the <A HREF="c05.html">Constitutional Law &amp; Civil Rights</A> Chapter. Health law issues of interest to health care providers are covered in the <STRONG>Law &amp; Leading Attorneys: Minnesota Business Guide</STRONG>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Access to the Health Care System </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The first issue for many consumers of health care is access to the health care system. The state of Minnesota has some of the finest health care providers and facilities, yet Minnesotans may face a number of access hurdles before receiving treatment.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Medicaid </STRONG></H3></A>
Medicaid should not be confused with Medicare. Despite their similar names, the two programs are substantially different. Medicare is a program funded and administered entirely by the federal government to provide health care to elderly and disabled persons. Medicare coverage is uniform throughout the country. (A full discussion of Medicare is found in the <A HREF="c14.html">Elder Law Chapter</A>.) Medicaid is a cooperative program partly funded by the federal government, partly by the individual states, and mostly run by the states that provides health care to indigent persons. Each state has wide latitude to decide how Medicaid operates within the state. In Minnesota, Medicaid provides a wider range of medical goods and services than it does in some other states. The federal government's role in Medicaid is quite limited. It pays a percentage of the cost of each state's health care program for indigents and ensures that every state's program complies with various federal requirements. The amount of money a state receives from the federal government is called the Federal Financial Participation (FFP). Each state's FFP is determined by a formula based on the state's per capita income and the amount of medical services the state chooses to provide to its needy persons.
<P>
To receive Medicaid, a person must have few assets and very low income as determined by a complex formula. A person generally cannot have more than $3000 in assets or more than $420 income per month. To each applicant the county applies a complex formula which considers the applicant's unique situation. There are several assets the formula does not count. Assets not counted include:
<UL>
<LI>Homestead (of any value)
<LI>Automobile under $4500 in value, if necessary for employment, receiving health care, modified for a handicapped person, or essential for performing daily tasks
<LI>Burial funds
<LI>Household goods and personal effects (of any value)
<LI>Capital and operating assets of a business necessary to earn an income
</UL>
A person can intentionally reduce his or her assets to the point where he or she qualifies for Medicaid. So long as transfers are compensated, it is legal to restructure one's assets and income with the intent of qualifying for Medicaid. For example, it is permissible for a person to invest all of his or her available cash in a larger homestead or expanding a business in order to reduce his or her counted assets below $3,000. It is not permissible simply to give the available cash to family members or friends. Lawyers who specialize in Medicaid are often experienced in advising clients how to restructure their assets and income to qualify for Medicaid.
<P>
Anyone whose income is above Medicaid limits might still receive Medicaid with a spend-down provision. The spend-down is equal to the amount a person's income is over Medicaid limits. Medicaid occasionally agrees to cover the amount that a person's medical bills exceed a patient's spend-down. 
<P>
Restructuring assets to qualify for Medicaid can be an especially attractive option for senior citizens, even if they already qualify for Medicare. Medicaid coverage is better for persons living in nursing homes because Medicaid pays for a wider variety of nursing care services and for a longer period of time than does Medicare.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>MinnesotaCare </STRONG></H3></A>
In response to the growing number of Minnesotans unable to afford private health insurance, the Minnesota legislature created a subsidized health insurance program known as MinnesotaCare. The program is administered by the Minnesota Department of Human Services and is open to permanent Minnesota residents who are not eligible to receive Medicaid (discussed above) and who are also unable to get employer-paid health insurance and are not covered by any other health insurance plan. The program seeks to give every Minnesotan access to full health care services.
<P>
MinnesotaCare works like many private health insurance plans. Eligible applicants pay monthly premiums based on family size and income. In return, they receive a variety of health care services, equipment, supplies, and prescriptions from private or public providers, including services for pregnant women and children, but limiting coverage for abortions to certain circumstances. Many of these items have co-payments associated with them.
<P>
MinnesotaCare's eligibility requirements are complex. When originally begun, the program covered only children, parents, and dependents. As increased funding has become available, MinnesotaCare's coverage umbrella has expanded to include single adults and married couples without children whose income is no more than 135 percent above the poverty level. Many persons originally ineligible to enroll have become eligible, so it is wise to check the latest eligibility requirements with the Minnesota Department of Human Services. 
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Access to Facilities </STRONG></H3></A>
Hospitals may not legally refuse to treat a patient if the patient has health care insurance, but it can happen either because of prejudices or a hospital's concern about being reimbursed through Medicare or Medicaid. Several federal and state laws exist to guarantee a patient's access to health care. Both Medicare and Medicaid require all hospitals participating in these programs to care for all covered patients. 
<P>
Most of these laws guaranteeing access to health care facilities are rarely ever needed because hospitals are eager to admit paying patients. The AIDS epidemic has made accessibility an issue in some recent cases because some hospitals are concerned with the potentially enormous costs of fighting the disease, worried about spreading the disease, or because some decision makers object to the lifestyles of some AIDS sufferers. Laws governing the medical industry clearly forbid health care providers from using personal bias to decide whom to treat.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Access to Medical Records </STRONG></H3></A>
A patient's right of access to his or her own medical and psychological records is an important tool for making wise decisions about health care. In Minnesota, a health care institution must provide a patient with the originals or copies of medical or psychological records kept on file. The patient may be required to pay reasonable copying charges. The health care provider can withhold the records only where he or she believes release would be detrimental to the patient's physical or mental well-being or could cause the patient to inflict self harm or to harm another person. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Patient Control Over Health Care Decisions </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Once a patient has gained access to the health care system, the law guarantees the patient's rights to be kept informed of his or her status and to be involved in decisions affecting care.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Right to Consent to Care </STRONG></H3></A>
In general, a doctor cannot diagnose or treat a patient without first obtaining that person's informed consent. A doctor need not obtain a patient's consent to treat mental illness, mental retardation, or chemical dependency. Failure to get informed consent for any other kind of treatment can subject the doctor to charges of battery, invasion of privacy, or malpractice. If the person cannot consent for himself or herself, a guardian, conservator, or close relative can give permission to treat. In an emergency, the head of a health care facility can consent to treatment if a patient's close relatives cannot be reached. A patient's consent to treatment will be implied where the patient is unable to give consent and an emergency exists or where the patient can give consent but sufficient time does not exist to properly inform the patient of all risks and alternatives. 
<P>
Minors generally need to have the approval of a parent or guardian to undergo a medical or surgical procedure. Exceptions to this rule are emergencies, certain reproductive matters, testing and treatment for certain sexually-transmitted diseases, and emancipated minors. In Minnesota, a minor is considered emancipated and able to consent to medical treatment if he or she is living apart from guardians and is managing his or her personal finances.
<P>
Most doctors are smart enough to know that they should not treat a patient without any permission, so disputes in this area rarely center on whether a doctor had permission. More often, disputes turn on whether the doctor disclosed sufficient information for the patient's consent to be informed or whether the doctor went beyond the consented actions.
<P>
To give informed consent in Minnesota a patient must be given information about: 
<UL>
<LI>Diagnosis
<LI>Nature and purpose of proposed treatment
<LI>Risks and consequences of proposed treatment
<LI>Likelihood of success
<LI>Alternative treatments and likely prognosis if not treated
</UL>
All of these must be communicated in language the patient is likely to understand. 
<P>
Experimental research cannot be performed on a patient without the patient's consent. The consent or refusal to participate in experimental research must be recorded in the patient's permanent record.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Right to Refuse Treatment </STRONG></H3></A>
Minnesota statutes also give patients a right to refuse treatment, medication, or dietary restrictions. Patients who refuse recommended treatments must be informed of the likely medical and psychological results of such refusal, and documentation must be placed in their record. The right of parents to refuse medical treatment for their children is more limited and is discussed fully in the <A HREF="c05.html">Constitutional Law &amp; Civil Rights</A> Chapter. 
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Anatomical Gifts </STRONG></H3></A>
Many people want to donate their bodies to science when they die. Many human organs can be transplanted into other people, giving the recipient a chance at a longer or more productive life. A wide variety of institutions also need bodies and organs for scientific, medical, and educational purposes. Unfortunately, many potential transplant recipients and many scientific and educational institutions are unable to get sufficient donations because too few people are willing to donate or do not know how to make their wishes known. To solve this problem, the state of Minnesota adopted the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act to govern the donation of bodies and body parts for transplant, medical, and scientific purposes. 
<P>
Under this law, a person of sound mind, who is at least 18 years of age, may donate all or part of his or her own body. There are several ways for a donor to record the wish to make a donation. The donor may make the donation a provision in a will. If part of a will, the provision becomes effective immediately upon death, unlike other provisions of the will which need to go through probate before they become effective. A will is not the best place for a donation, however, because its terms may not be known immediately upon death. If the terms of a will are not read for several days after the donor dies, it may be too late to make an effective donation. A more common form of recording one's wish to make a donation is through use of a donor card often carried in a wallet. Drivers in Minnesota can also indicate their wish to be a donor on the driver's license. A written donation must be signed by the donor and witnessed by at least two other people. A donation can also be made orally. Oral donations are effective if witnessed by at least two other people. A dying patient can communicate his or wish to make a donation to an attending physician who can act as one of the required witnesses. The attending physician must not be the physician who removes or transplants the organ. An intent to make a gift can be revoked orally or in writing.
<P>
If a dying person is unable to communicate and has not made his or her wishes known, a family member or guardian can make a gift of all or part of another person's body, with certain limitations.
<P>
The law forbids the sale of body parts. The recipient cannot pay for the anatomical gift but can and does pay for the cost of transportation and transplant. Only the following are allowed to receive bodies or body parts: hospitals, surgeons, physicians, educational institutions involved in medical or dental research, a storage facility for any of these persons or institutions, or any specified individual who needs the organ personally for therapy or transplantation. 
<P>
If there is no previous information in a client's file, doctors and hospitals in Minnesota are required, at or near the time of death, to ask the patient or his or her family about making a donation. Doctors and hospital administrators are required to use reasonable discretion and sensitivity and are not required to make a request if they feel that a body or part is not suitable for current needs.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Patient Rights Inside the Health Care System </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Patients are guaranteed several rights inside the health care system.
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Patient Bill of Rights </STRONG></H3></A>
Patients and residents of health care facilities have a right to be told of their rights while they are patients and to be given a written copy of the following rights:
<UL>
<LI>Right to know the identity of all physicians treating them and all outside providers
<LI>Right to receive all appropriate health care
<LI>Right to receive complete and current information regarding their diagnosis, treatment, alternative treatments, and risks
<LI>Right to participate in planning their health care
<LI>Right to refuse care (unless not competent)
<LI>Right to privacy regarding their health care
<LI>Right to be free from isolation and restraints unless other less restrictive measures are ineffective or not feasible
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Information About Health Care Providers </STRONG></H3></A>
Patients have the right to access some information about their health care providers. Medical professionals must be licensed, and are held to certain standards of conduct. If they fail to live up to these standards, they may face punishment. Doctors who are the subject of medical malpractice awards or settlements must be reported to Minnesota's Board of Medical Malpractice. The Board has the authority to suspend a doctor's license for failure to pay student loans, conviction of a felony reasonably related to the medical practice, or conviction of a felony-level criminal sexual offense, for example.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>HIV Testing </STRONG></H3></A>
Several clinics and hospitals in Minnesota test patients for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). Because of the discrimination many HIV-positive people face, there is concern for confidentiality and anonymity of the test. While all health care providers are generally required to respect a patient's confidentiality (see discussion below) only a few clinics are committed to anonymous testing. At these sites, fictitious names or code numbers are used to hide the patient's identity.
<P>
Anyone interested in being tested for HIV should understand the important distinction between anonymous testing and confidential testing. A test can be confidential yet still be recorded on a patient's permanent record. Anyone with access to that record, including doctors, insurance companies, and the state health department can learn that the person was tested. Anonymous testing is truly anonymous because no one at the testing site knows the person's true identity so the test can never become part of the person's permanent medical record. Anonymous testing can be very important for health insurance coverage. In some extreme cases, merely being tested for HIV has resulted in denial of insurance coverage, regardless of the test's outcome.
<P>
Minnesota grants to victims of sex offenses the right to require a convicted sex offender to be tested for the presence of HIV antibodies and to be informed of the results of such a test. The state prohibits insurance companies from making any use of such a court-ordered test in any decision regarding underwriting, canceling, or failing to renew a policy.
<P>
<A NAME="150"><H3><STRONG>Confidentiality </STRONG></H3></A>
There are two principal forms of protection for patients worried about the confidentiality of their medical records or information they provide to their health care providers. Minnesota Rules of Evidence prohibit the introduction in court of confidential communications between a patient and a health care provider. The public policy behind this rule is the promotion of full communication between doctors and their patients. Minnesota also recognizes a civil legal action for patients whose doctors release patient records without patient authorization. Under Minnesota law, a health care provider must have the patient's consent to release records to a third person. This general law does not prevent a doctor from releasing records to another doctor in an emergency for the purpose of treating the patient. Neither does it prevent the release of records to the Minnesota Department of Health. 
<P>
Sometimes other public policies are considered more important than confidentiality. For example, a doctor who is told by a patient that the patient plans to kill a particular person has a legal obligation to warn that person. Also doctors have an obligation to report to the police anyone who comes for treatment of a suspicious wound, such as a stab or gunshot wound.
<P>
The AIDS epidemic has tested the boundaries of patients' rights to confidentiality. All health care providers who know that a person has HIV have a legal obligation to warn anyone with whom the carrier is intimate. The State of Minnesota requires that a diagnosis of HIV-positive status be reported to the State Department of Health. A person who is HIV-positive has an obligation to warn potential partners and to practice safe sex. Lying, misrepresenting, or failing to reveal one's HIV-positive status could leave a person open to charges of fraud, misrepresentation, battery, and civil lawsuits.

For centuries, people from around the world have been coming to the United States. They come to work, get an education, escape oppression, start a new life, do business, visit friends, or sightsee. Over the years, the United States has seen tremendous diversity in the countries immigrants come from and their reasons for coming here. In response to the incredible demand for permission to enter this country, the federal government has established a complex set of laws that determines who may enter this country and for what reasons. This chapter discusses legal immigration and travel to the United States.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>United States Citizenship </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
United States citizens have a right to travel to and live in the United States and enjoy the fullest protection of U.S. laws. People who are not citizens of the United States usually must have a visa to enter and may not enjoy the protection of all laws.
<P>
A person can become a United States citizen either through birth or through a process known as naturalization. A person can be a citizen from birth either by being born here, or by being born in a foreign country to a parent who is a citizen of the United States. Anyone born in the United States has automatic citizenship, regardless of the parents' citizenship, and even if both parents are living in this country illegally at the time of the child's birth. The only exception is that children born to foreign diplomats in the United States do not get automatic citizenship. Anyone not born a citizen must be naturalized to become a citizen. Occasionally, a group of people is naturalized by treaty or by act of Congress. Usually, a person goes through the process individually.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Aliens, Immigrants, Nonimmigrants, and Residents </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An alien is a citizen of any country other than the United States. A person who comes here to stay permanently is called an immigrant. Someone who intends to return to his or her country of origin is called a nonimmigrant, even if he or she intends to stay for a substantial period of time. For example, a student might stay in the United States many years to complete an education and still be considered a nonimmigrant. The distinction between immigrant and nonimmigrant is crucial. Permission to enter as a nonimmigrant often is easier to get than permission to enter as an immigrant, so some people are tempted to claim they intend to return to their home country in order to enter this country. The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is aware of this temptation and often will deny a nonimmigrant visa application to anyone suspected of wanting to remain permanently. Also, being granted a nonimmigrant visa sometimes can make it more difficult to get an immigrant visa later. A permanent resident is an alien who has been given permission to live permanently in the United States.
<P>
In a dispute with the INS over an applicant's true intent, the applicant always bears the burden of proving intent to remain here temporarily. For some people, this burden is nearly impossible to overcome. For example, the spouse of a permanent resident normally must wait over two years for available immigrant visas. If he or she claims to want to visit only temporarily, he or she must overcome the presumption that a married person would want to remain permanently with his or her spouse.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>The Visa System </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A visa is a stamp in a person's passport that gives him or her conditional approval to enter the United States. Most matters involving visas are handled by the INS. Most aliens apply for visas from a consulate or embassy of the United States in their home countries.
<P>
Citizens of some countries, primarily European countries and Japan, may enter the United States for up to 90 days without a visa. To be eligible, citizens of these countries must show the INS that they have a return ticket home and that they intend to engage in a type of business or tourist activity that would be allowed under a "B Visa," described below. Canadian citizens generally do not need visas to enter temporarily. In some instances, they must obtain INS approval in advance if they are coming here to work.
<P>
Congress establishes a complex set of quotas that limits the number of visas that can be granted for most types of visas. Whether an applicant receives a visa turns on the type of visa requested, the applicant's reason for traveling to the United States, and the applicant's country of origin. Probably the most important element to obtaining a visa successfully is knowing for which visa category to apply. For certain categories of visas and certain countries of origin, an applicant can wait many years before he or she even will be considered for a visa. Sometimes the wait would be much shorter if the applicant applied for a different type of visa. Unfortunately, once an applicant applies for one type of visa, it can be difficult to change the application to another class of visa. For this reason, it is wise to consult an immigration attorney before applying for any kind of visa.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Nonimmigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
There are different kinds of nonimmigrant visas, identified by the letters A­R, available for persons who do not intend to remain in the United States permanently. All nonimmigrant visas are based on what the applicant intends to do in this country. It is important that employers be aware of the variety of visas that exist. Following is a list of the categories of visas available.
<UL>
<LI>A Visas: for diplomats and their families.
<LI>B Visas: for aliens coming to this country to do business but not for employment or labor for hire, such as to do business research, engage in litigation, or negotiate contracts; B-2 Visas, the most common nonimmigrant visas, allow aliens to enter the country temporarily to engage in tourism, visit with friends or relatives, or to receive medical treatment.
<LI>C Visas: to enter the United States only for immediate and continuous transit through the country to a third country.
<LI>D Visas: for crew members of foreign vessels or airplanes.
<LI>E Visas: for traders and investors covered by commercial treaties between the United States and foreign countries, as well as spouses and children of E Visa holders.
<LI>F Visas: for students in full-time academic programs, from the elementary school level up to the post-graduate level, as well as spouses and children of F Visa holders, and allowing employment for fewer than 20 hours a week, mainly at certain on-campus jobs typically done by students.
<LI>G Visas: for representatives, officers, and employees of foreign countries to international organizations.
<LI>H Visas: for workers needed by U.S. employers to fill temporary openings; H-1B Visas commonly are held by aliens with highly specialized knowledge working in professional jobs.
<LI>I Visas: for media representatives and their families.
<LI>J Visas: designed to bring foreigners here to participate in exchange programs designated by the United States Information Agency.
<LI>K Visas: to allow an alien engaged to a United States citizen to enter to marry the citizen, as well as for any minor children of the alien.
<LI>L Visas: for intracompany employee transfers (e.g., for employees of multinational corporations).
<LI>M Visas: for students in vocational or nonacademic study programs.
<LI>N Visas: for relatives of certain international organization employees here on G Visas.
<LI>O Visas: for artists, entertainers, athletes, scientists, and certain business professionals with extraordinary ability in their field, and persons needed to accompany and assist them.
<LI>P Visas: for performing artists, entertainers and athletes; similar to O Visas, but easier to get and intended more for group entertainers or athletes who come here for a specific performance or tour.
<LI>Q Visas: for participants in international cultural exchanges.
<LI>R Visas: for religious workers and their families.
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Immigrant Visas </STRONG></H3></A>
An applicant who intends to stay in this country permanently generally is admitted either on the basis of employment or family connections. The main exception is for political asylum seekers.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="70"><H4><STRONG>Employment-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can receive permission to immigrate to this country on the basis of his or her employment. There are five categories of employment, known as preferences, through which an alien can be permitted to immigrate.
<UL>
<LI>First Preference: Individuals of extraordinary ability, outstanding professors or researchers, and multinational executives.
<LI>Second Preference: Professionals with advanced degrees and aliens with exceptional abilities in science, art, or business. (Note: The terminology is confusing, but "exceptional ability" is a different standard from "extraordinary ability.")
<LI>Third Preference: Skilled workers, professionals, and other workers for which there is a shortage of workers in the United States.
<LI>Fourth Preference: Certain special workers, such as religious workers. 
<LI>Fifth Preference: Investors creating employment for workers in the United States; the investment must be substantial (i.e., between $500,000 and $1,000,000).
</UL>
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Family-Based Immigration </STRONG></H4></A>
An alien can get a visa as an immediate relative of a United States citizen if he or she is a child, spouse, or parent of the citizen. In addition, there are four family-based immigrant visa categories: 
<UL>
<LI>First Preference:	Unmarried children of United States citizens.
<LI>Second Preference: Spouses and unmarried children of lawful permanent residents.
<LI>Third Preference: 	Married children of United States citizens.
<LI>Fourth Preference: Siblings of adult United States citizens.
</UL>
Each preference is allotted a total number of visas. Generally speaking, the higher the applicant's preference, the shorter the wait to get a visa. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Special Classes of Immigrants </STRONG></H4></A>
Some groups of immigrants receive special treatment and fall outside the preference system described above.
<P>
Diversity immigrants are immigrants from countries deemed under-represented in the pool of applicants for visas throughout the years. A new program implemented by the INS in 1995 provides a certain number of visas to be granted to applicants from low-admission countries. Applicants also must have a high school education or two years of training or experience in a particular occupation.
<P>
A person is a refugee if he or she is outside the United States, is fleeing or has fled his or her country, and has a well-founded fear that if returned to the home country, he or she will be persecuted because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. An asylee is an alien already in the United States who, like a refugee, has a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to his or her home country. The President and Congress decide each year the total number of refugees and asylees to accept into the country. Occasionally, Congress grants immigrant visas allotted for individuals from specific countries according to political factors. Recent programs have included China, Hong Kong, and Tibet.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Entry and Exclusion </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A visa only gives conditional approval to enter the country. Once an alien arrives in the United States with a visa, he or she must apply for entry from INS officials at the point of entry. For most aliens, this is a mere formality, but INS can exclude persons with valid visas for a variety of reasons including communicable diseases, physical or mental disorders that pose a threat to others, drug addiction, or criminal history. Involvement in espionage or terrorist activity against the United States government or its people is grounds for exclusion. The Secretary of State also has broad discretion to bar entry of anyone whose presence would have an adverse effect on the foreign policy of the United States. Sometimes, waivers are available for aliens who otherwise would be denied entry for certain reasons. For example, the child of a United States citizen may be granted a waiver to enter to receive treatment for drug addiction.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Getting a Green Card and Becoming a Naturalized Citizen</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Becoming a permanent resident is the first step that an alien must take to become a naturalized American citizen. People with permission to live in the United States permanently are issued "green cards" that allow them to work with few restrictions. A permanent resident can apply to become a naturalized citizen after five years, or three years if married to a United States citizen.
<P>
The INS is diligent in investigating marriages between United States citizens and aliens to ensure that aliens do not become permanent residents through sham marriages. Immigration law specifies that an alien seeking permanent residence based on a marriage to a United States citizen of less than two years first is granted conditional permanent resident status. After two years, the husband and wife must apply to the INS to remove this conditional status.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="120"><H2><STRONG>Deportation </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Deportation is the expulsion of an alien who entered illegally, or entered legally but has done something to become deportable. With few exceptions, any violation of the conditions of a visa, no matter how minor, is grounds for deportation to a person's country of origin. Conviction for any crime but the most minor also is grounds for deportation. Deportation can delay an alien whose long-term goal is to live permanently in this country. After being deported, aliens are forbidden to re-enter the country for five years. Aliens deported for aggravated felonies, such as drug smuggling, are barred from re-entry for 20 years or may be barred permanently. The delay in returning to the United States may be even greater for aliens from countries with long waiting lists. Returning home under a deportation order may result in the embassy's refusal to entrust the individual with another temporary visa.
<P>
There are a number of remedies to deportation, especially if the deportable person has lived in the United States for a long time, building a life that demonstrates good moral character. Even if the deportable individual has not been here long, there may be certain waivers or defenses to deportation. Among the most common is asking the court for "voluntary departure," which allows the individual to depart the United States on his or her own. In any case, anyone facing deportation should seek the advice of counsel well in advance of a deportation hearing.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Probate, Estate Planning &amp; Trusts
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Although no one likes to think about dying, there are good reasons to prepare for this inevitable event by setting up a plan to distribute one's estate after death. A person's estate consists of all his or her property and possessions, and includes bank accounts, real estate, furniture, automobiles, stocks, bonds, life insurance policies, retirement funds, pensions, and death benefits. If a person plans well, his or her estate can often be passed on after death quickly, easily, and subject to fewer taxes. 
<P>
This chapter discusses the most common estate planning tools -- wills and trusts. Living wills, guardianship, and conservatorship are discussed in the <A HREF="c14.html">Elder Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Wills </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A will is the most common document used to specify how an estate should be handled after death. Anyone designated to receive property under a will (or trust) is called a beneficiary. A will can be simple or elaborate, depending upon the size of the estate and the wishes of the person who makes it‹the testator. Many types of post-death instructions can be described in a will. A will can describe who should receive specific items of furniture, artwork, or jewelry. A will can name a guardian who will take care of minor children should there be no surviving parent. A will can disinherit a child if the testator does not want the child to receive any part of the estate. The options for what a person can do with a will are varied but limited. 
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Requirements for a Valid Will </STRONG></H3></A>
Each state sets slightly different formal requirements for the creation of a legal will. In Minnesota, a person must be at least 18 years old in order to make a legal will. In addition, he or she must be of sound mind, which means that the individual has no mental disability that prevents him or her from understanding the full nature of the document he or she signs. In Minnesota, a will must be in writing and must be witnessed and signed by at least two other people. A handwritten will, often called a holographic will, is valid in Minnesota provided that it is witnessed and signed by two people. Individuals must sign their own wills, but if they are illiterate or otherwise incapacitated, they can direct another person, in the presence of witnesses, to sign for them. A will is valid until it is revoked or superseded by a new will. Individual provisions can be changed by a codicil, which is described in the section, <A HREF="#80">"Changing and Updating Wills."</A>
<P>
It is not necessary to hire an attorney to create a will. A non-attorney can create a will, but he or she must pay close attention to the details outlined above. Smaller estates can be described simply, and making a will to disperse a smaller estate can be done by almost anyone. The simplest will in history ever to be declared valid by a court contained only three words: "All to wife." However, a lawyer's guidance is very helpful with complicated property holdings or an estate with many assets, especially if they are located in several different places. In these cases, an attorney's help can ensure that the transfer of property described in the will is done in a way that minimizes the survivor's tax liability. In addition, a complicated estate may require documents other than a will, such as a trust agreement, to ensure that all of a person's wishes are carried out. 
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Personal Representative </STRONG></H3></A>
A will typically appoints someone called a personal representative to carry out the specific wishes of the person who has died‹the decedent. The personal representative should be a trusted friend or family member who should be made fully aware of his or her duties before the decedent dies. A personal representative must do many things, including collecting and managing the decedent's assets, collecting any money owed at the time of death, selling any assets, if necessary, to pay estate taxes or expenses, and filing all required tax returns. Because a personal representative is allowed to charge a fee for doing this work, choosing a friend or family member who is also a beneficiary to fill this role may be a good choice, as he or she may not charge the full amount allowed by law. To ensure that one's estate has a personal representative chosen by the decedent, it is wise to name one or more contingent personal representatives who can take over the responsibilities of the primary personal representative if the primary personal representative is unable to assume the responsibilities of the position.
<P>
If a person does not name a personal representative in his or her will, state law establishes the order in which a probate court appoints relatives to act as personal representative. If none of these family members agree to be the personal representative, the probate division of the district court may appoint a professional administrator to do the job.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Appointing a Guardian for Children </STRONG></H3></A>
A person with minor or dependent children can name in a will a guardian to care for those children should there be no surviving parent. If a person fails to name someone to assume the role of guardian, the probate court appoints someone. The person chosen by the court will usually be a close relative or friend, but it may not be the person the parent would have chosen. As with the selection of a personal representative, it is important that the potential guardian understands the provisions of the will and is willing to accept the responsibilities of being a guardian. Also, it is wise to name an alternate guardian should the primary guardian be unable to accept the responsibility. Of course, the selection of a guardian for children is likely to influence how the parent wants to distribute his or her property. Otherwise, a decedent's money might go to one person while his or her children go to another person. The parent may want to give property to someone only if the recipient accepts guardianship of a child. In this way, the guardian is given the financial resources to care for the child. 
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Planning for Incapacity </STRONG></H3></A>
People drafting wills often use the opportunity to plan for the possibility of their own incapacity. By preparing a document called a durable power of attorney, they can give another person of their choosing full legal authority to act on their behalf should they become unable to handle their personal and financial affairs. Without a durable power of attorney, a person's family might need to go to court to have someone appointed to handle the person's legal affairs. If a power of attorney is made part of the will, it is essential that the will be made known to family members before the testator becomes incapacitated. If a will is kept secret, locked away in a safe deposit box until a person dies, it will be too late for the power of attorney provisions to be useful. 
<P>
Some people also use a document called a durable power of attorney for health care to make health care decisions in advance should they subsequently become incapacitated. Creating a durable power of attorney for health care is discussed in the <A HREF="c14.html">Elder Law</A> Chapter. 
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Restrictions on Wills </STRONG></H3></A>
In order to protect spouses and dependent children, some laws prevent a person from disinheriting a spouse or child. A married person cannot completely disinherit his or her spouse without the spouse's consent. Occasionally this happens through a prenuptial agreement, for example, in which a second spouse agrees that an entire estate will go to children from a first marriage. In the absence of a contrary agreement, a surviving spouse has the right of election, which allows him or her to take a portion of the spouse's estate. This is used when a spouse is unhappy with the provisions of a will. A person may legally disinherit a child by clearly specifying in a will that the child not receive any of the estate. 
<P>
There are other limits to a will. Anything owned in joint tenancy with another person will go to the surviving joint tenant. Arrangements must be made to end the joint tenancy before death if one joint tenant does not want the other to inherit the jointly held property. Because there may be significant tax consequences in doing so, these changes should be made only after consulting an attorney. Other possessions are not considered part of the estate because they are already promised to someone else. For example, a testator cannot specify in a will that someone other than the beneficiary of a life insurance policy gets the benefits described in that policy. However, a person can designate his or her estate as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. In this case, the money from the policy will be added to other estate assets and will be distributed according to the will. Similarly, the money from a retirement plan goes to the persons named on the plan, regardless of whether they are beneficiaries in a will. Laws designed to uphold public policy also limit what can be done with a person's assets after death. For example, conditions in a will encouraging someone to do something illegal or immoral in order to inherit money or property would not be enforced.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Changing and Updating Wills </STRONG></H3></A>
The provisions of a will are valid until they are changed, revoked, destroyed, or invalidated by the writing of a new will. Changes or additions to a will can be included in a document called a codicil. Codicils must be written, signed, and witnessed in the same way as a will. Wills cannot be changed simply by crossing out existing language or writing in new provisions. In order to avoid making a new will or codicil each time a person's possessions change, a will can specify that personal property is to be distributed according to instructions outlined in a separate document. A person can then revise the separate document as often as necessary, without observing all of the formalities required to change the will itself.
<P>
If someone dies with a will that is not up-to-date, people may not be provided for adequately. For example, a person chosen to be a personal representative or guardian may have died or fallen out of favor with the author of the will, or a favorite charity may no longer be in existence. A significant amount of case law has dealt with how a probate court is to proceed with a will that has become unenforceable because of changed circumstances. These headaches can be avoided if a will is reviewed at least every two years and revised for major changes in tax laws or for personal events such as births, deaths, marriages, divorces, or significant changes in the size of the estate. It is also a good idea to review a will if its author moves to another state, because the new state of residency may have different inheritance and tax laws. In Minnesota, a divorce automatically revokes any distribution to the former spouse.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>The Right of Election </STRONG></H3></A>
As discussed previously, Minnesota's probate code protects surviving spouses from being entirely disinherited by a decedent spouse. A surviving spouse who is unsatisfied with his or her portion under an otherwise valid will is allowed to exercise the right of election and take one-third of the decedent's estate. Thus, the one-third portion is the minimum amount a surviving spouse may receive. A will can give more to the surviving spouse, but if it gives less, the surviving spouse can simply elect to forego his or her share under the will in favor of this statutorily guaranteed one-third share. 
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Dying Without a Will </STRONG></H3></A>
If a person does not have a will or has not adequately planned for the distribution of his or her estate at death, survivors can face a complicated, time-consuming, and costly process. Often survivors wind up having to pay more taxes on their inheritance than they would have paid had there been a will or other estate planning tool. To provide for surviving friends and relatives, or to support favorite causes or charities, a person can plan for the distribution of his or her estate after death. With planning, an estate can be distributed as fairly as possible with as little tax burden as legally allowed. 
<P>
When a decedent leaves no will or other comparable estate planning tool, he or she is said to have died intestate. The division of the state district court system set up to handle wills and trusts is called the probate division. When a person dies intestate, the probate division steps in to divide the decedent's estate, according to a formula known as the state inheritance laws. Under the state inheritance laws, the probate division uses formulas set by the legislature to divide a deceased person's possessions among any surviving relatives.
<P>
A probate division applying the state inheritance laws first deducts from the estate funeral expenses, any unpaid medical bills, taxes, family allowance expenses, and any other debts owed. If the decedent has a surviving spouse and no children, the entire estate, after these deductions, goes to the spouse. If there are children, and the family home was not held in joint tenancy, the surviving spouse receives the right to the homestead for his or her life, known as a life estate, and a portion of the remaining estate. Surviving children receive whatever is left of the estate after the spouse's share is deducted, and they inherit the homestead when the surviving spouse dies. In the absence of a will, a surviving spouse with at least one child generally receives a life estate in the homestead, the first $70,000 of the estate, plus one-half of the amount remaining after the first $70,000 is deducted. The other one-half of the estate is divided equally among the decedent's children. If one of the decedent's children dies before the decedent, that child's share passes to his or her living descendants, if any. Anyone entitled to inherit a portion of an intestate decedent's estate is known as an heir. 
<P>
One problem with relying on a probate division applying state inheritance laws to distribute one's estate is that it may not distribute the estate in the manner the decedent would have wanted. State inheritance laws only recognize relatives. The inheritance laws never permit the probate division to support a decedent's close friend, lover, or favorite charities. If no relatives are found, the estate goes to the state. Clearly, for most people writing a will or creating a trust is advisable.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Trusts </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A trust is another frequently used estate planning device that manages the distribution of a person's estate.

To create a trust, the owner of property (the grantor) transfers the property to a person or institution (the trustee) who holds legal title to the property and manages it for the benefit of a third party (the beneficiary). The grantor can name himself or herself or another person as the trustee. A trust can be either a testamentary trust or a living trust. A testamentary trust transfers the property to the trust only after the death of the grantor. A living trust, sometimes called an inter vivos trust, is created during the life of the grantor and can be set up to continue after the grantor's death or to terminate and be distributed upon the grantor's death. 
<P>
Unlike a will, which in some cases can be drafted without the help of an attorney, a person should never draft a trust without the aid of a lawyer. Many complex laws regulate trusts depending on the size and composition of the estate. Trusts must be carefully structured if they are to take advantage of beneficial tax treatment. An experienced attorney should always assist in drafting a trust so that it is valid, meets the needs of the estate, and does not conflict with any previously drafted will.
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Advantages and Disadvantages of a Trust </STRONG></H3></A>
Trusts have many advantages over wills. The advantages depend on whether a living trust or testamentary trust is chosen. All trusts have the advantage of allowing the grantor to determine who receives the benefit of the money, when they receive it, and what conditions must be met. If a spouse is unable or unwilling to manage assets, if children are minors or unable to handle money responsibly, or if a beneficiary is disabled, creating a trust can be a better way of passing on assets. Living and testamentary trusts are an especially popular way of providing for beneficiaries' future educational or medical costs.
<P>
Some advantages are particular to living trusts. First, a living trust can give its grantor substantial tax advantages. Second, possessions held in a living trust are not subject to estate administration by the probate division after the grantor dies. Survivors do not have to reveal the details of any possessions held in trust through the public filing process that takes place during probate. In addition, if the grantor owns real estate in another state, establishing a living trust for the title to that property may allow survivors to avoid probate in the other state. A living trust can free the grantor from the burden of overseeing his or her financial affairs because a trustee manages all the assets of a living trust. More importantly, a living trust allows a trustee to manage the trust funds in the event that its creator becomes incapacitated or mentally or physically unable to oversee his or her possessions. If a living trust contains all of a person's assets, then he or she may not need a will, and his or her survivors may be able to avoid probate. If only part of a person's possessions are held in living trust, then a will is necessary to distribute those items in the estate not placed into a trust. However, a pour-over provision in a will can place any possessions remaining upon death into a pre-existing living trust.
<P>
The primary disadvantage of a living trust is that it involves the loss of some flexibility and control over one's assets. Unlike wills, which become effective only at death, a living trust becomes effective immediately upon its creation. For the person who wants to retain unrestricted control over his or her estate, a will or a testamentary trust is a better estate planning tool because it can be changed at any time prior to death.
<P>
The primary advantage of a testamentary trust is that it allows the grantor to retain unrestricted control over his or her estate. A testamentary trust becomes effective only upon the death of its grantor. Like a will, a testamentary trust can be changed at any time prior to death.
<P>
The primary disadvantage to testamentary trusts is that they do not take advantage of the beneficial tax treatment given to living trusts. Because a testamentary trust only takes effect when the grantor dies, the grantor cannot enjoy any tax advantage during his or her life. Also, most testamentary trusts must go through probate.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Revocable and Irrevocable Trusts </STRONG></H3></A>
A living trust can be either revocable or irrevocable. As implied by their names, a revocable trust can be changed or revoked after its creation, while a person signing an irrevocable trust gives up the right to change or revoke the trust. Revocable trusts are quite often devised to supplement a will and/or to name someone to handle the grantor's affairs should the grantor become incapacitated. A trust usually must be made irrevocable if the grantor wants to avoid income or estate taxes. Tax authorities consider the grantor of a revocable trust to be the owner of the property because he or she still controls the property. For this reason, income from assets held in a revocable trust must be reported as income to the grantor for income tax purposes. At the death of the grantor, property in a revocable trust is included in the estate for calculating estate taxes. 
<P>
Irrevocable trusts are often designed to be the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. Such a life insurance trust can also spell out how the policy's money is distributed to survivors. In addition, irrevocable trusts are often set up to manage money given to minors and to charities. Finally, an irrevocable trust can be used to transfer assets to another person in the event that the grantor requires expensive medical care. Although doing so may protect the grantor's family by ensuring that the cost of medical care does not wipe out the family fortune, it may also make the grantor ineligible to receive federal and state Medical Assistance. State law prohibits the beneficiary of a trust fund from receiving public assistance or public health care benefits. However, the 1993 Minnesota Legislature passed a law permitting disabled people to receive supplemental needs trusts without jeopardizing their public assistance status. These trusts must be designed to meet the special needs of disabled people that are not met by public assistance benefits; therefore, one should only create this kind of trust after consulting with an attorney.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Probate </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
With few exceptions, the estate of a person who dies owning property in his or her name cannot be legally distributed without first going through probate. Only if all of a decedent's property is held in joint tenancy or in trust can survivors avoid probate. Probate can operate either formally, with court supervision, or informally, without court supervision. Whether formal or informal, the first duty of the probate division is to determine whether the decedent left a valid will. If the decedent left a valid will, the division oversees the process of settling the estate according to the terms of the will. If the decedent did not leave a will or if the probate division determines the will is invalid, the probate division applies the state inheritance laws, described earlier, to the estate. 
<P>
Informal probate is designed for estates in which court supervision or adjudication is not required because the estate has no uncertainties, legal disputes, or complex administrative requirements. A personal representative can apply for informal probate and become personally responsible for probating the estate completely, correctly, in accordance with state statutes, and promptly. Most personal representatives engage an attorney to handle at least a portion of their duties even with informal probate. 
<P>
When probate division formally supervises distribution, its responsibilities may include:
<UL>
<LI>Overseeing the distribution of estate assets, including payment of state and federal taxes
<LI>Hearing any contested claims by creditors or others seeking to collect from the estate
<LI>Choosing a personal representative when one is not named in the will
<LI>Supervising the actions of the personal representative, including the payment of state and federal taxes
<LI>Ensuring that the personal representative posts a surety bond to protect creditors and others in the event that the executor acts improperly
<LI>Deciding which possessions are subject to estate administration and which are not
<LI>Determining a decedent's true heirs
<LI>Ruling on the legitimacy of any claims outstanding against the estate
<LI>Supervising the transfer of assets to beneficiaries named in the will
<LI>Overseeing a guardian's use of property placed in trust for the benefit of children or dependents
</UL>
Making out a will does not guarantee that survivors can avoid all problems of distribution, but a carefully drafted will can mean that their time in court is minimized.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="160"><H2><STRONG>Avoiding Death Taxes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
A carefully created estate plan can considerably reduce the tax burden on an estate. Although the state of Minnesota no longer has an inheritance tax, under Minnesota and federal law a decedent with an estate worth more than $600,000 must file an estate tax return and possibly pay federal and Minnesota estate taxes. The federal government's inheritance tax scheme is quite complicated. Under federal tax law a person is allowed to leave $600,000 tax-free to one or more individuals, other than a surviving spouse. The surviving spouse is entitled to receive an unlimited amount tax-free. If the estate is a very large one, however, and the entire estate is left to the surviving spouse, that surviving spouse may lose the option of giving $600,000 tax-free to individuals of his or her own choosing. An experienced tax attorney can create trusts that will allow the two spouses to pass on a total of $1,200,000 free of unnecessary estate taxes.
<P>
Regardless of whether the recipient pays state or federal estate taxes, there may be income tax consequences for the recipients under a will.

<CENTER><A NAME="10"><H1><STRONG>Real Estate Law
</STRONG></H1></A></CENTER>
Real estate law involves rights in the ownership and possession of land and buildings attached to land. Real estate law is often referred to as the law of real property to distinguish it from the law of personal property, which includes all property other than land and buildings upon land. A stumbling block for many consumers entering the real estate market is the number of unfamiliar terms frequently used by real estate professionals. Real estate law uses many old terms and concepts because real estate laws have been around so long, but many rights and responsibilities regarding real estate have evolved and been updated over time as society has changed.
<P>
This chapter summarizes some of the real estate concepts and terms one is likely to encounter, the process one goes through to buy or sell a house, and the rights and responsibilities of landlords and tenants.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Encumbrance </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
An encumbrance is an obligation that attaches to a piece of real property. It is a right or interest held by a party who is not the owner of the property. An encumbrance is not an ownership interest in real property, and the property may be bought and sold even though there are encumbrances attached to the property. Encumbrances attach to property, not the property owners, so a person who buys property with an encumbrance is bound by the encumbrance. There are different types of encumbrances.
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>Easement </STRONG></H3></A>
An easement is the right to use another person's land for a particular purpose. There are many forms of easements. Public utility companies frequently have utility easements that permit them to run gas, water, or electrical lines through property they do not own. The owner of property on a lake shore might sell to the owner of an adjacent lot without lake access an easement to cross over to the shore. A person who owns property that is land-locked may receive an easement from an adjacent land owner to have access in and out of the property. This is called a right-of-way.
<P>
<A NAME="40"><H3><STRONG>Deed Restriction </STRONG></H3></A>
Deed restrictions may also be known as covenants, conditions, or restrictions. Deed restrictions are usually imposed on a buyer of land when the property is sold and the restrictions are included in the seller's deed to the buyer. Restrictions are generally imposed by a property developer to maintain certain standards. Restrictions may included limits on the color one may paint her house, what trees one may plant, or the size of homes to be built on the property.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Lien </STRONG></H3></A>
A lien is a charge against property that provides security for a debt or obligation of the property owner. The lien holder does not own the property. The owner of property may voluntarily agree to a lien, perhaps by taking out a mortgage, or a lien can be imposed, perhaps for nonpayment of taxes. One of the most common liens is the mechanics lien. A mechanics lien arises when someone furnishes labor or materials to improve a piece of property. If the worker or supplier is not paid by the property owner, he or she can file a notice of lien with the county recorder and the property owner and collect the amount owed from a subsequent sale of the property.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Assessment </STRONG></H3></A>
An assessment is a value placed on real property by a local taxing authority for purposes of levying taxes. Real estate taxes are calculated by multiplying the assessed value of a piece of property by the tax rate. Most properties are reassessed periodically, and a property's assessed value may not be the same as its actual market value. A special assessment is a tax levied on a piece of property to pay for improvements that benefit the particular property, such as streets, sidewalks, and street lighting. Special assessments are liens on the property until they are paid.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="70"><H2><STRONG>Real Estate Ownership </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Typically, ownership of real estate includes the right to sell (convey), the right to use the property as security for loans (encumber), the right to improve the land or buildings on the land, and the right to use and possess the property. Property can be owned by one or more persons. The two common ways in which two or more parties can co-own a piece of property are joint tenancy and tenancy in common.
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Joint Tenancy </STRONG></H3></A>
Although usually thought of as a way for a husband and wife to own property, there is no requirement that joint tenants must be married to one another or that there can only be two joint tenants. Owners in joint tenancy have a right to sell, encumber, and possess the entire property. Regardless of the number of joint tenants, when one joint tenant dies, the remaining joint tenants automatically take the deceased joint tenant's share of the property by right of survivorship. In such cases, the surviving joint tenants are required to file a death certificate and an affidavit with the county recorder. Joint tenancy allows the surviving joint tenant to avoid probate, transfer and death taxes.
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Tenants in Common </STRONG></H3></A>
Tenants in common, like joint tenants, share the right to possess, sell, and encumber the property. Unlike joint tenants, tenants in common do not have a right of survivorship. Upon the death of one tenant in common, his or her ownership interest passes to his or her heirs as part of the estate. 
<P>
<A NAME="100"><H3><STRONG>Advantages and Disadvantages of Co-Ownership </STRONG></H3></A>
Although there are advantages to co-owning property, there are drawbacks as well. If co-owners cannot agree on use, sale, or possession of a piece of property, they may have to go to court to resolve the matter in a partition action. In a partition action a joint tenant or tenant in common asks the court to split the property in a fair and just manner. Real property may be difficult to divide and partial interests may be difficult to sell, so a court will usually order that the property be sold and proceeds from the sale distributed to the co-owners in proportion to their interests.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="110"><H2><STRONG>Residential Real Estate </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The most common consumer real estate transactions involve the sale of a home. Unlike years past, today a home buyer faces a variety of options in deciding the type of dwelling to buy. Single family houses are still the most common selections for home buyers. Single family homes provide the maximum amount of privacy and freedom to their owners, but they may also be the most expensive option and require the most upkeep. Condominiums and townhouses may be an option for some purchasers. Both give their owners many of the advantages of home ownership, such as tax deductibility of mortgage interest, and the advantage of having someone else care for lawns and exterior upkeep. Residents usually pay association fees to cover maintenance.
<P>
A homestead is not a particular type of dwelling; instead, it is a tax classification that can dramatically lower what a homeowner pays in real estate taxes. People who live in their own property are taxed at a much lower rate than if they rent out that property to others. If the property one buys was previously rental property, one could end up paying non-homestead taxes for the first year. To change the tax status of the property, a person must close on the property by December 1 and apply for homestead status with the county in which the property lies by December 15. 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Title </STRONG></H3></A>
Title to real estate is the right to, or ownership of, the property. Title may refer to the actual ownership or to the documentary evidence of that ownership. In order to sell a piece of property, all title matters must be cleared. Usually, this is accomplished through a title search, which is a diligent search of all records relating to the property to determine whether the owner can sell the property and whether there are any claims against it. If any defects in title are discovered during the title search, the seller is usually given time to cure the defect. Title insurance is often taken out to protect against any hidden defects in the title. There are two types of title insurance. One type protects the lender's interest in the property and the second protects the home owner's interest. 
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Deeds </STRONG></H3></A>
A deed is a written instrument that transfers the title of property from one person to another. There are many different types of deeds. Generally, in Minnesota, title is transferred by a general warranty deed. A general warranty deed provides the greatest protection to the purchaser because the seller pledges or warrants that he or she legally owns the property and that there are no outstanding liens, mortgages, or other encumbrances against it. A warranty deed is also a guaranty of title, which means that the seller may be held liable for damages if the buyer discovers that the title is defective. A warranty deed is no substitute for title insurance, however, as a warranty from a seller who later dies or goes bankrupt may have little value. 
<P>
Another type of deed used is a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed relinquishes whatever interest, if any, the seller may have in the property to the buyer. A quitclaim deed gives the buyer the least protection of any deed. If the seller is the sole owner of the property, the quitclaim deed is enough to transfer title, but the buyer takes a risk by accepting a quitclaim deed because it offers the buyer no guarantee that the title is valid. Quitclaim deeds are used frequently during the property settlement phase of a marriage dissolution.
<P>
<A NAME="140"><H3><STRONG>Recording </STRONG></H3></A>
In Minnesota, real estate records are kept in each county. Owners and parties with real estate interests are required to file, in the county, all documents affecting their interest in property in order to give public notice of the interest. Titles in Minnesota may be registered under the abstract system or the Torrens system. Abstract records go back hundreds of years and an abstract of title is a record of all the entries for that property. Torrens or registered property is much simpler, more modern, and more efficient. Instead of a thick abstract of title, Torrens property has a certificate of title.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="150"><H2><STRONG>Buying or Selling a Home </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Because Minnesota has many programs to help people buy a home, home ownership is a possibility for people at all income levels. Buying a home can be one of the most rewarding experiences a person can have and one of the most complicated and stressful. Every home purchase involves a number of complex legal issues, unfamiliar terminology, and lots of paperwork. Knowing how the process works can reduce much of the headache.
<P>
<A NAME="160"><H3><STRONG>Real Estate Agents </STRONG></H3></A>
One of the first decisions for someone interested in buying or selling a home is whether to use the services of a real estate agent. Real estate agents are hired to help buyers and sellers come together to complete the sale of a house. Home buyers and sellers can choose to work with an agent either exclusively or nonexclusively. If one decides to work with an agent, he or she will sign several contracts to clarify the relationship between the consumer and the agent. These contracts may relate to dual agency. This term refers to an agent who is representing a buyer in an offer on a house when the agent has a relationship with the seller of the house. An agent has dual loyalties when he or she finds a buyer for a house that the agency has listed. It may be difficult for one party to fairly represent both a buyer and a seller. The seller wants the highest price possible while the buyer wants to pay the lowest price. The contracts state what the agent can share with the other party and which information must remain confidential. 
<P>
<A NAME="170"><H3><STRONG>Seller Disclosures </STRONG></H3></A>
When a seller signs the standard purchase agreement, he or she is required to disclose certain known problems and hazards to the buyer. A buyer may ask for a real estate transfer disclosure statement which supplements the information provided in the purchase agreement. A seller is not required to provide this statement to the buyer. This statement notifies prospective buyers of all known structural defects, as well as comments on the heating, plumbing, mechanical, and electrical systems. Just because problems are listed on this statement does not mean that the seller must repair the problems, but the buyer may request either repair or a price break because of the problem. In some communities, the seller is also required to complete a Truth in Housing Inspection Report. In that case, an inspector checks the house for defects and lists them in the report. Sellers must disclose the location of any wells on the property and whether the wells are in use or sealed.
<P>
<A NAME="180"><H3><STRONG>Home Warranties </STRONG></H3></A>
All builders in Minnesota are required to warrant the quality of the homes they build. Some builders participate in additional, private insurance programs. Minnesota law requires builders to repair anything under warranty including workmanship and materials for one year, mechanical systems for two years, and major structural defects for up to ten years.
<P>
<A NAME="190"><H3><STRONG>Lead-Based Paint Abatement </STRONG></H3></A>
Home buyers should be aware of new laws dealing with removal of lead-based paint from a home. Starting on July 1, 1994, any person who removes paint from a home built before February 27, 1978, must determine if lead is present and whether the work is considered lead abatement. If the work is considered lead abatement, the abatement must be done by either a licensed lead abatement contractor or in some instances, the owner, who must follow strict requirements. In addition to requirements for removal of lead-based paint, there are also requirements for disposal of the lead debris.
<P>
<A NAME="200"><H3><STRONG>Foreclosure </STRONG></H3></A>
Nobody in the process of buying a house wants to think about falling behind in house payments and the possibility that a bank or mortgage company will foreclose on a loan and claim possession of the house. Nevertheless, it is wise to give some thought to why lenders go about foreclosing on a piece of property so that the consumer can minimize the probability of losing a house.
<P>
Up to a point, lenders will typically work with a homeowner who falls behind in making payments because they do not want to go through the hassle and expense of foreclosing on a property. Homeowners should communicate with their lenders, possibly even before any payments are missed, if there are financial difficulties present which make the payment of the mortgage difficult. It can take months for a lender to begin a foreclosure, and more months before it is completed, so there is usually time available to get the money needed to assure a lender that the consumer will not default on a mortgage.
<P>
After a lender begins the foreclosure process, there is a period of time called a redemption period during which a homeowner can stop the foreclosure by making all delinquent mortgage payments plus the lender's court costs and attorney fees. 
<P>
In Minnesota, a homeowner can offer a lender the deed to the property as a way to satisfy a debt. Doing this means losing the property, but if a property owner truly has no other way to avoid foreclosure, offering a deed in lieu of foreclosure can prevent his or her credit rating from being severely damaged by a foreclosure. However, because lenders generally want cash and not real estate, there is no guarantee that a lender will accept a deed offered in lieu of foreclosure.
<P>
Most foreclosures in Minnesota are done by the bank placing an advertisement in a newspaper announcing the exact date, time, and place of the sale of property. Banks must follow precisely a declared set of laws and rules. A foreclosure is deemed legal and may not be disputed three years after the sale of the property.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Landlord/Tenant </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Under Minnesota law, whenever the owner (the landlord) of a house, apartment, room, or any other living space agrees to let someone else (the tenant) use the space for a fee, the two have entered into a legally binding rental contract. General contract principals are discussed in the <A HREF="c07.html">Contract Law</A> Chapter. Rental contracts are a special class of contracts that are governed by many unique rules. This section discusses the laws applicable to rental contracts.
<P>
<A NAME="220"><H3><STRONG>Leases </STRONG></H3></A>
The terms of any rental agreement are stated in the lease, which can be an oral agreement or a written document. There are two general types of leases-periodic leases and term leases. A periodic lease continues for a specific time period and is automatically renewed at the end of the period for an indefinite time without a specific end date. For example, parties may agree on a month-to-month lease without specifying how many months the renter will stay and the lease continues until one party terminates it. Most periodic leases will state the timing of a termination notice and the form the notice must take. If the periodic lease does not specify when or how notice is to be given, state law requires that notice be given at least one full rental period plus one day before the lease ends.
<P>
A term lease is a rental agreement specifying a definite time period. For example, a lease for one year is a term lease. Term leases are almost always written. If they are for more than one year, the law requires that they be in writing. If the parties to the lease do not state when and what kind of termination notice is required, the lease automatically ends on the last day of the time period.
<P>
<A NAME="230"><H3><STRONG>Security Deposits </STRONG></H3></A>
Landlords have a right to insist that renters pay a security deposit before moving in. The security deposit is used to pay for any damage beyond ordinary wear and tear that the tenant might do to the rental property, or to satisfy any debts between the tenant and landlord under an agreement or any unpaid rent. The deposit cannot be used by the renter to pay rent. There is no limit to how much the landlord can require for a security deposit. The landlord can increase the security deposit at any time during a periodic lease if the tenant is given proper notice-generally, one rental period plus one day. If the lease is a term lease, no changes can be made to the deposit until the lease comes up for renewal or the parties agree otherwise. At the end of the tenancy, the landlord must return the deposit to the renter with interest (four percent non-compounded per year). The landlord is allowed to keep the amount necessary to repair damages, or to pay off debts owed to the landlord as part of the lease. If the landlord fails to return all or part of the security deposit, he or she must give the tenant, within 21 days after the tenancy ends and the tenant has given the landlord a forwarding address, a written explanation as to why money is being withheld.
<P>
<A NAME="240"><H3><STRONG>Repairs </STRONG></H3></A>
Owners of rental property are required to keep the property in reasonable repair. This requirement cannot be waived by the parties, but the tenant can agree to make repairs or perform maintenance if the arrangement is in writing and the tenant receives compensation in return. For example, a renter might agree to make routine plumbing repairs in return for a reduction in rent or payment from the owner. If the owner refuses to make repairs, the renter has five options.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="250"><H4><STRONG>Calling an Inspector </STRONG></H4></A>
The renter can call local fire, health, housing, or energy inspectors to investigate whether there is a code violation in the unit. If an inspector finds a code violation in the unit, the inspector has authority to summon the owner to appear in court. The law provides protection for a renter if the owner attempts to evict the renter in retaliation for calling an inspector. Often, an inspector's report of a code violation is enough to convince a landlord to correct problems. Calling an inspector is a necessary first step to several of the other options described in the following sections. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="260"><H4><STRONG>Rent Escrow </STRONG></H4></A>
A renter may pay rent into a court escrow account and ask the court to order the owner to make repairs. The procedures for using the rent escrow option are complex and must be strictly followed. Typically, the renter must have contacted a housing inspector, as described above, and received a written report of housing violations. If there is neither a housing code nor an inspector in the area but the unit has so many serious problems that it is unlivable, the tenant must notify the landlord in writing and give the landlord 14 days to correct the problem. If the landlord fails to fix problems, the tenant can file a rent escrow action along with the inspector's report or a copy of written notice to the landlord. Once the rent is deposited with the court, the court schedules a hearing within 10 to 14 days. The landlord can begin eviction proceedings if the tenant does not deposit the full amount in escrow. After the hearing, if the court finds that a violation does exist, it has a variety of options, including ordering the landlord to fix the problem, allowing the renter to fix the problem and deduct the cost from rent, fining the landlord, and returning all, none, or part of the rent to the tenant.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="270"><H4><STRONG>Withholding Rent </STRONG></H4></A>
If there is a serious problem in a unit, the renter can withhold rent. Before withholding rent, the renter should notify the owner, in writing, of the needed repairs and give the owner an opportunity to make repairs. If the landlord does not make repairs, the tenant should notify local inspectors, as described above, and get a written copy of the inspector's report. If repairs are still not made, the tenant should notify the landlord, in writing, that all or part of the rent will be withheld until repairs are made. Withholding rent is a drastic step that should only be taken if the tenant has a strong case against the landlord. It is very likely that the landlord will sue to get the rent or begin eviction proceedings against the renter. If the court agrees with the renter, it has a number of options it can pursue against the owner, including reducing the rent. If the tenant loses, he or she can be made to pay all of the rent withheld and court costs. In some cases, the renter may have to pay the landlord's attorney fees to avoid being evicted, but only if the lease allows this.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="280"><H4><STRONG>Tenant's Remedies Act </STRONG></H4></A>
Under the Minnesota Tenant's Remedies Act, a tenant can sue a landlord for a health or housing code violation, a violation of the landlord's obligation to keep the unit in reasonable repair, or a violation of an agreement or term of the lease. Before going to court, the tenant should talk to the landlord and give him or her an opportunity to correct the problem. If the landlord does not correct the problem and there are local inspectors, the tenant should contact them, as described above. A written report from an inspector will describe the problem and give the landlord a number of days to fix it. If there are no inspectors, the tenant should give the landlord written notice of the problem at least 14 days before filing a lawsuit. If the required amount of time passes and repairs have not begun, the renter can bring an action in state district court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="290"><H4><STRONG>Rent Abatement </STRONG></H4></A>
A rent abatement action is a lawsuit that a tenant can bring to get his or her rent lowered. Before bringing a rent abatement action, the tenant should try to work with the landlord to have problems fixed. In court, a tenant must prove that a serious problem exists that affects the safety, health, or fitness of the dwelling as a place to live. Minnesota law is unclear on how much the tenant has a right to recover, but he or she may recover the difference in value between the unit if the landlord had made repairs and the present value or the extent to which the tenant's enjoyment of the unit is decreased by the problem. A rent rebatement action may be brought in conciliation court if the tenant's claim is for less than $7500.
<P>
<A NAME="300"><H3><STRONG>Eviction </STRONG></H3></A>
Under no circumstances can a landlord forcibly remove a tenant from rental property. In order to get a tenant out of a rental unit, the landlord must bring an unlawful detainer action against the tenant in state district court. Legitimate grounds for bringing an unlawful detainer action include nonpayment of rent, breach of a lease, or refusal to leave a unit after the tenancy expires.
<P>
The landlord must file a complaint against the tenant in district court and have someone serve the tenant with a summons at least seven days before the court date ordering the tenant to appear in court. The landlord cannot personally serve the summons. A hearing takes place within 7 to 14 days after the court issues the summons. At the hearing, each side has an opportunity to present its side of the story and the judge delivers an opinion. If the tenant does not show up to the court on time, the judge can order the tenant to move immediately. If the judge decides the tenant has no legal reason for refusing to leave the property, the judge orders the tenant to leave and can order the sheriff to force the tenant out.
<P>
If the sheriff has to perform the eviction, the tenant's property can be stored on-site or in a warehouse. If the property is stored on-site, the landlord must prepare an inventory of the items and mail it to the former tenant at his or her last known address. The tenant has 60 days to request the return of the items in writing. The tenant then has 48 hours to retrieve the items without any fee or charges. If the items are stored off-site in a warehouse, the former tenant is responsible for all transfer and storage fees. In either case, after 60 days, the landlord can sell the tenant's personal possessions. Regardless of where the items are stored, the former tenant does not have to pay back rent, security deposit, or late charges as a pre-condition to getting the items back.
<P>
<A NAME="310"><H3><STRONG>Tenant's Rights </STRONG></H3></A>
Tenants enjoy a number of rights, even if those rights are not specified in the rental contract.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="320"><H4><STRONG>Privacy </STRONG></H4></A>
Generally, landlords may enter a tenant's unit only with the tenant's consent, except in an emergency. Landlords also may enter for a "reasonable business purpose," such as maintenance, only after giving the tenant reasonable notice. If a landlord fails to get permission or give notice, the landlord is trespassing and can be sued in court. The tenant whose privacy rights have been violated may recover damages. 
<P>
As of July 1, 1995, owners must have a criminal history check conducted on any applicant for a position as a building manager, as well as persons already employed in such positions. Convictions for certain serious crimes will prevent an applicant from being hired. Managers hired before July 1, 1995 who have been convicted of serious crimes may keep their jobs, but the tenants must be informed of the criminal record.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="330"><H4><STRONG>Access </STRONG></H4></A>
Tenants have a right of access to the property they rent. It is a misdemeanor for a landlord to lock a tenant out of his or her unit without a court order. A tenant who is unlawfully locked out may petition the court to get back in. The court has authority to order law enforcement officers to help the tenant get back in. If the court finds that the landlord knew or should have known that the lockout was illegal, it can order the landlord to pay triple damages or $500, whichever is greater.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="340"><H4><STRONG>Use of Personal Property </STRONG></H4></A>
A landlord cannot confiscate a tenant's personal property for nonpayment of rent or other charges. If a landlord takes personal property, the tenant can demand its return within 24 hours (48 hours if it is off the premises). If the landlord refuses to return the property, he or she can be sued in conciliation court for actual damages, punitive damages of up to $300, and attorney's fees.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="350"><H4><STRONG>Tax Refund </STRONG></H4></A>
Minnesota provides some tenants a partial refund for property taxes they pay through their rent. To claim the refund, the tenant must file a property tax refund form with the Minnesota Department of Revenue along with a certificate of rent paid that the landlord must provide to the tenant by January 31 of every year.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="360"><H4><STRONG>Sublease </STRONG></H4></A>
Subleasing is having someone else take over a tenant's rights and obligations under a lease before the original lease expires. The tenant has a right to sublet a unit if the lease does not prohibit doing so. If the new tenant does not pay rent, damages the unit, leaves before the lease expires, or breaches another condition of the lease, the landlord can hold the original tenant responsible. The original tenant can then sue the new tenant for those costs.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="370"><H2><STRONG>Cold Weather Utility Rule</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Regulated utility companies can not shut off service to any residence, whether rented or owner-occupied, between October 15 and April 15 if:
<UL>
<LI>Disconnection will affect the primary heat source;
<LI>Customer is unable to pay the bill;
<LI>Customer has no overdue bill from the previous winter or, if there is an overdue bill, the customer has made arrangements to repay it; and
<LI>Customer is willing to pay off the bill in amount agreed between the customer and the utility.
</UL>
Rules adopted by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission forbid shut-off by a regulated utility if the customer pays ten percent of his or her monthly income or ten percent of his or her utility bill, whichever is less. 
<CENTER><A NAME="380"><H2><STRONG>Discrimination in Housing</STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Federal and Minnesota law prohibits home sellers and landlords from discriminating on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, disability, or reliance on public assistance. Some areas have local laws that provide additional protection from discrimination. For example, Minneapolis has a city ordinance forbidding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
<P>
Landlords generally cannot discriminate against children unless a unit is in an owner-occupied duplex, triplex, or fourplex, or the building is intended to provide housing for elderly persons. In order to qualify as a building for elderly persons, the building must meet additional requirements, such as operating under a state or federal program specifically designed to assist the elderly or offering significant facilities or services designed to meet the needs of the elderly.

<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Understanding Tax Law </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There is a saying that the only two sure things in life are death and taxes. Tax laws affect all people and touch most areas of life, so it would be helpful if tax laws were simple, clear, and easy to understand. Unfortunately, the tax system that exists has none of these characteristics. Many tax laws are unclear from the time they are written. Often, writing tax legislation involves so much compromise and redrafting, that by the time a tax bill becomes law, even its author and sponsors do not fully understand what they have created. Other tax laws might be perfectly clear as written, but it may be difficult to know how to apply the law to a particular taxpayer. Finally, different courts in different jurisdictions can apply the same law to similar fact situations and reach completely different interpretations, each interpretation valid in that particular jurisdiction. Tax collectors have an important task because they collect taxes and help ensure that everyone pays his or her fair share. One of the most effective ways to discourage people from paying their fair share of taxes is for them to have the impression that cheating goes unnoticed or unpunished. Simply put, the system would not work if the threat of a possible audit did not hang over every tax return submitted.
<P>
Given the complexity of tax law, this chapter cannot describe all aspects of tax law. Instead, this chapter details how consumers can manage tax disputes with the federal or state government.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>Avoidance Versus Evasion </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
There simply are not enough resources for the government to calculate everyone's taxes or to audit every return filed. The tax collection system assumes that most taxpayers will be honest when reporting their income and calculating their tax obligations. The government has many ways of checking the accuracy of information the taxpayer provides. Employers provide the IRS with information on how much employees earn and financial institutions report the interest income their investors and depositors receive. Still, there is a tension built into the system. Taxpayers want to pay as little tax as legally possible but tax collectors want to ensure that taxpayers pay as much as they are legally obligated to pay. The terms "tax evasion" and "tax avoidance" are frequently used interchangeably to describe this tension, but the terms have different meanings.
<P>
To avoid taxes is to use legal means to limit one's tax liability. It is perfectly acceptable for a taxpayer to try to avoid taxes. Federal and state tax codes describe many ways a taxpayer can lower his or her tax burden. There are many ways to structure income to pay a minimum of taxes. There is nothing illegal in taking advantage of loopholes or shelters to avoid paying taxes. Tax evasion is using illegal means to get around paying one's taxes. It is illegal to evade paying legitimately owed taxes. Most taxpayers are tax avoiders. It is the job of tax collectors to find the tax evaders.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Federal Tax Disputes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the arm of the federal government charged with collecting federal income taxes. For most consumers, the federal income tax is the largest federal tax paid. The federal government collects taxes on a variety of different items including telephone calls, airplane tickets, cigarettes, and imported goods, but most consumers never challenge these taxes. For this reason, this section focuses on disputes with the IRS over the federal income tax.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>IRS Audit </STRONG></H3></A>
Pity the poor IRS agent. It is a safe bet that no one looks forward to being audited. Even if a taxpayer does nothing wrong, an audit, also called an examination by the IRS, can be confusing, frustrating, disruptive, and time-consuming. IRS employees know their task is not a popular one, and they do not try to aggravate taxpayers on purpose. They too struggle with a huge bureaucracy and must make do with outdated computers and a complex tax code with many gray areas of law.
<P>
The IRS audits approximately three million returns annually. About two million of those taxpayers end up paying more taxes to the IRS. So, getting an audit letter from the IRS is not an indication that the IRS believes the taxpayer is a cheater; it usually means that there is some irregularity in the return or that the taxpayer has been selected for a random audit. The taxpayer usually winds up paying Uncle Sam more money.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Who Is Audited </STRONG></H3></A>
The IRS has three primary methods of selecting which returns to audit. The first method is random selection. By choosing to audit some returns at random, the IRS promotes better voluntary compliance with the tax code. Because every return has a chance of being selected for an audit, taxpayers are more likely to be honest. Relatively few of the returns selected this way contain significant errors, but the IRS uses the results of the random audits to measure compliance with the law and to update and improve the overall tax collection system.
<P>
The second method is a computerized process whereby the IRS separates out returns that it believes may contain errors or be fraudulent. The computer program is fine-tuned each year based on the experience IRS gains from applying the tax code. Most of the returns selected this way have some unusual characteristic that raises a red flag for auditors. For example, if the IRS determines that many taxpayers claiming very large deductions for entertainment expenses are trying to defraud the government, the computer can be programmed to separate out returns with unusually large entertainment deductions. If the IRS learns from its random audits that many people misunderstand a particular application of the tax code, the computer can be programmed to separate out all returns relying on that application. 
<P>
An important point to know about this second method of selecting returns is that it is completely impersonal -- any return raising a particular red flag is tagged by the computer. Thus, if a taxpayer has an unusual circumstance that gives him or her an unusually large, yet legitimate deduction, the computer will select the return for audit every year. IRS auditors try to avoid repeat examinations for the same issue. Thus, if IRS examined a taxpayer's return for the same issue in either of the previous two years and found in favor of the taxpayer, the taxpayer should call this to the attention of the IRS. Often in these cases, the audit is terminated without further investigation.
<P>
The third method for selecting returns for audit compares information provided by the taxpayer with information from other sources. For example, if someone reports less income on his or her return than is reported on the W2 form provided by the taxpayer's employer, the IRS can seek to clarify the discrepancy.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Audit Process </STRONG></H3></A>
The audit process begins as soon as the taxpayer receives a letter from the IRS stating that his or her return has been selected for further examination. The audit may be done entirely by mail if the IRS has only a few questions, or it may be at an IRS office or at the taxpayer's home or business if the IRS has more substantial questions. The taxpayer can request that the audit interview be transferred to another IRS district if a different location is more convenient for the taxpayer.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="80"><H4><STRONG>Time Limits </STRONG></H4></A>
Under normal circumstances, the IRS cannot audit tax returns filed more than three years ago. For example, the deadline for the IRS to audit a 1994 tax return, filed at the latest on April 15, 1995, is April 15, 1998. Under certain circumstances, the three-year limit is extended. The IRS can demand records as far back as six years if an audit reveals that the amount of income the taxpayer failed to report on his or her latest return exceeds by 25 percent or more the income reported. Also, the IRS has no time limit if the taxpayer fails to file a return or if it determines that the taxpayer deliberately filed a false or fraudulent return.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="90"><H4><STRONG>Records </STRONG></H4></A>
IRS auditors almost always want to see financial records that relate to the return they are examining. This raises a commonly asked question: How long does a taxpayer need to keep records relating to income tax filings? The answer is generally three and a half years because after that time, the IRS typically cannot audit the taxpayer. A taxpayer should keep financial documents longer than three and a half years if they might affect any future returns. Thus, a person should keep records of any stocks purchased until they are sold, because only then can profit or loss be determined and reported on the next income tax return.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="100"><H4><STRONG>Taxpayer Rights in an IRS Audit </STRONG></H4></A>
Some taxpayers claim they are made to feel like criminals in IRS audits. In fact, the audit procedure differs significantly from a criminal proceeding and may provide fewer procedural safeguards for the taxpayer. Unlike a criminal trial where a defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty, in an IRS audit the taxpayer must prove to the IRS's satisfaction that the information on a return is correct and legal. For example, if the IRS questions a deduction for business related travel expenses, the IRS does not have to show that the travel was entirely for pleasure or that the taxpayer never traveled during the year of the return. The burden is on the taxpayer to show that he or she really did incur the amount of travel expenses claimed. If he or she cannot document the expenses, the IRS can disallow the deduction without offering any evidence at all.
<P>
A person has the right to ask the IRS to cancel a penalty if he or she can show his or her actions were the result of bad advice from the IRS. Thus, if someone pays less tax than owed, and the IRS discovers and penalizes the taxpayer for it, the taxpayer might have the fine canceled if he or she reasonably followed IRS advice in calculating taxes. 
<P>
The first step in proving that bad advice from the IRS caused a mistake is to document what an IRS employee said in person, over the telephone, or by letter. It is important to write down any tax advice received over the telephone or in person, and to note the time, the date and the name of the IRS employee giving the advice. The second step is to show that reliance on that advice was reasonable. Just because someone says what the taxpayer wants to hear is not sufficient reason for the taxpayer to rely on that information; reliance must be reasonable. Determining reasonableness is tricky, but the taxpayer should be aware that if a piece of advice seems too good to be true, it may not be true. If a reasonable person would seek a second opinion, then the taxpayer should also seek another opinion. Although the IRS may cancel a penalty for relying on bad advice, it is not obligated to cancel the interest accumulated on any additional tax the taxpayer may owe. 
<P>
The taxpayer need answer only the questions that the auditor asks. The taxpayer should not commit perjury, but he or she need not make the auditor's job easier by volunteering damaging information. If the taxpayer is instructed by the IRS to make documents available during an audit, it is best to have all these documents available for inspection in an organized and logical manner. In an audit conducted at home or at a place of business, called a field audit by the IRS, the taxpayer need not give the auditor access to a copying machine or allow the auditor to take original documents back to IRS offices. The taxpayer should, however, make copies of the documents that the auditor specifically requests and make a note of which documents the auditor gets copies of. If an audit is by mail, the taxpayer should send to the IRS only copies of those items specifically requested. Documentation should always be sent to the IRS via certified mail with a return receipt requested. 
<P>
Many taxpayers are concerned about the privacy of information they provide on a tax return or in an audit. The government is obligated to respect the confidentiality of information a taxpayer provides in the tax collection process, and anyone who prepares a return or represents the taxpayer is also obligated to respect the client's privacy. In limited circumstances, the IRS is allowed to share some taxpayer information with state tax agencies, the Department of Justice, or other federal agencies. During an audit or at any time the IRS asks for information, the taxpayer has the right to know why the agency wants the information, how the information will be used, and what may happen if the taxpayer chooses not to give the information.
<P>
The taxpayer has the right to take someone along to an IRS audit interview. This could be an attorney, a certified public accountant, the person who filled out the tax forms, or an enrolled agent. Another person may represent the taxpayer in his or her absence during an audit interview, so as long as the taxpayer files with the IRS a power of attorney form or a similar document.
<P>
The taxpayer has the right to tape record the audit interview. To do so, the taxpayer must inform the IRS in writing of the intention to tape the interview at least ten days in advance, and must supply the tape recorder. If the IRS decides to tape record an interview, it must inform the taxpayer at least ten days in advance. The taxpayer has a right to a copy of the IRS tape, but must pay for the copying expenses.
<P>
If at any point in the appeals process the taxpayer feels that the proceeding is not going well, he or she always has three options. First, the taxpayer can agree with the IRS, pay additional taxes, and vow to be more careful when filing future tax returns. Second, the taxpayer can ask the IRS for a notice of deficiency and take the case to a federal tax court. Third, the taxpayer can pay the disputed amount, file a claim for a refund, and then take the case to the federal district court, the federal tax court, or the federal claims court. 
<P>
<DD><A NAME="110"><H4><STRONG>Result of an Audit </STRONG></H4></A>
A minority of taxpayers who are audited receive from the IRS a no-change report, a letter stating that the IRS accepts an audited return without changes. Only about 30 percent of the people audited get a no-change letter. In even rarer situations, the IRS owes the taxpayer money after an audit. However, in most cases, the IRS determines that the taxpayer owes more money. 
<P>
If the taxpayer owes more money, the IRS sends the taxpayer a 30-day letter and a copy of the audit report outlining the additional taxes owed. If the taxpayer agrees to the changes detailed in the audit report, he or she can sign the enclosed form and send it back within 30 days to the IRS with a check. If the taxpayer sends a signed form back without a check, the IRS sends the taxpayer a bill, which must be paid within ten days. Either way, the taxpayer pays interest on the extra tax, calculated from the due date of the audited return to the billing date.
<P>
Another option outlined in the 30-day letter is the IRS's internal appeals process, which can be initiated by submitting, within 30 days, a written protest to the IRS requesting a conference with an appeals officer. If the amount of the additional tax is less than $2500, the protest does not need to be in written form. 
<P>
If the taxpayer ignores the 30-day letter, the IRS sends a notice of deficiency, sometimes called a 90-day letter, because it notifies the taxpayer that he or she has 90 days to either settle the matter with the IRS or to file suit in one of three federal courts. 
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Appealing an Audit </STRONG></H3></A>
If a taxpayer disputes the results of an audit, he or she can appeal the auditor's decision to a regional IRS appeals office or directly to a federal court. Appealing within the IRS is relatively straightforward and generally less expensive and time-consuming than going to court. If taxpayers go to federal court and win there, they can sometimes recover from the IRS some or all of their administrative and litigation costs, but only if they first use the IRS appeals process.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="130"><H4><STRONG>Appealing Within the IRS </STRONG></H4></A>
A taxpayer can start the IRS appeals process by requesting a conference through the IRS's local district director. The district director then arranges a meeting with one of the IRS's appeals officers, located in most major cities. The request for an appeals conference should state the exact elements in the auditor's report with which the taxpayer disagrees, the elements of tax law that support the taxpayer's case, and any facts that support the taxpayer's position. 
<P>
As in any dealings with the IRS, the taxpayer can be represented or advised by an attorney during the appeals conference and can bring along witnesses to support statements of facts. These conferences are informal, and they represent a last chance to resolve a dispute before going to court. There is no guarantee what will happen, but quite often the IRS officers make some concessions at this point in order to avoid going to court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="140"><H4><STRONG>Going to Court </STRONG></H4></A>
If a taxpayer decides that the IRS's decision is unfair, unjust, or unreasonable, he or she can take the dispute to one of three federal courts, all of which operate independently of the IRS. Deciding whether to file suit in tax court, claims court, or district court depends on a number of legal and personal factors. Each court is guided by the previous cases that it has decided. As a result, a taxpayer's odds of success may be better in one court than in another. Most cases, no matter which court first hears them, can ultimately be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The only exception to this rule is for cases heard under the small tax case procedure in tax court.
<P>
A taxpayer may go to any one of three courts without first going through the IRS appeals process, but quite often a tax court judge will not hear a case unless it has been considered for settlement by a regional IRS appeals office. If a taxpayer goes to tax court without first going through the IRS appeals process and loses his or her court case, the tax court judge may fine the taxpayer up to $5000 if he or she determines that the lawsuit was a tactic to delay paying the IRS or that the suit was otherwise frivolous. In all three courts, the taxpayer has the burden of proving that the IRS is wrong. In other words, the court assumes that the IRS correctly interpreted the tax laws as they apply to a case, and the taxpayer does not win unless he or she convinces the court otherwise.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="150"><H4><STRONG><EM>U.S. Tax Court </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Tax court hears only tax cases. In order to go to tax court, a taxpayer need not pay the disputed tax amount first, unlike the other two courts where he or she must pay the disputed amount before filing suit. In tax court the taxpayer does not have a right to trial by jury, so cases are heard by a judge who is experienced in tax law, rather than by a group of peers who might be swayed by emotion. If a taxpayer wants to take a case to tax court, he or she must file suit within 90 days after the IRS mails a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer's last known address. In general, tax court rules are less strict than those used in the other two courts. 
<P>
If a dispute with the IRS is for an amount under $10,000, the taxpayer can go through the tax court's small tax case procedure, which is generally quicker and even less formal than the court's standard procedure. However, the decision of a judge who hears cases under the small tax case procedure is final, so if a taxpayer chooses this procedure, he or she loses the right to appeal the court's decision. Because the taxpayer does not need to be represented by an attorney in this procedure, it may be a good option in a dispute regarding smaller dollar amounts in which any money won would be wiped out to pay attorney's fees.
<P>
Finally, a taxpayer should be aware of what is often called the "tax court trap," which describes the ability of the IRS to impose even more fines based on any new information that it discovers about the taxpayer during a tax court proceeding.
<P>
Tax court is the most popular route for taxpayers, in large part because it does not require that the disputed tax be paid first. But tax court can also be a very unsuccessful route. IRS statistics show that only about five percent of the taxpayers who bring their cases in tax court win. The taxpayer success rate in the other two courts, however, is only marginally better at about 11 percent.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="160"><H4><STRONG><EM>U.S. District Court </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
Of the three courts that hear taxpayer disputes with the IRS, only in federal district court is there a right to a trial by jury. To bring suit in district court, the taxpayer must first pay the disputed tax to the IRS and then claim a refund for that amount by filing the proper form with the IRS. If the IRS denies the refund request, the taxpayer can sue the IRS in district court. The taxpayer can sue for any amount of refund in district court, no matter how small. However, because the taxpayer is usually represented by an attorney in district court, going to district court may make sense only for larger monetary disputes.
<P>
If the IRS does not make a decision on a refund claim in six months, the taxpayer can file suit in district court. The taxpayer has up to two years after the IRS rejects a refund claim in which to file suit in district court.
<P>
<DD><A NAME="170"><H4><STRONG><EM>U.S. Claims Court </EM></STRONG></H4></A>
The federal claims court follows the same rules as the district court regarding filing lawsuits for refunds from the IRS. A taxpayer must first pay the disputed amount and then file a lawsuit in claims court for a refund of that amount. There is no minimum limit to the amount of a refund claim that can be litigated in claims court. However, the taxpayer cannot file suit in claims court if the claim is for a refund of a penalty relating to tax shelter abuse. Also, a taxpayer cannot file suit in claims court to recover a penalty assessed by the IRS for fraudulently preparing someone else's tax return.
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="180"><H2><STRONG>Minnesota Tax Disputes </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The State of Minnesota relies less on income taxes for revenue than does the federal government. Minnesota's income tax is far less elaborate than the federal government's and there are fewer disputes over it. When the state does audit a taxpayer's state income tax return, the procedure is nearly identical to the procedure used in IRS income tax audits. The most common Minnesota tax disputes involve property taxes. Minnesota has no state property taxes, but counties and municipalities use them as a primary way to raise revenues. Property taxes are discussed in the <A HREF="c20.html">Real Estate Law</A> Chapter.
<P>
The Minnesota Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, passed in 1990, greatly expands the rights of taxpayers when being audited by the Minnesota Department of Revenue. The rights that Minnesota taxpayers have against the Department of Revenue closely parallel the rights against the IRS. For example, the taxpayer has a right to have an attorney, accountant, or other person represent him or her at any meetings, and the taxpayer has a right to record meetings. The department must provide taxpayers with written information on their rights when they deal with the department. Minnesota taxpayers have a right to sue the department. If a taxpayer wins, he or she may be able to collect damages if a court finds that the department knowingly or recklessly disregarded a state law or knowingly or recklessly failed to release a lien.

<CENTER><A NAME="30"><H2><STRONG>The Office of the Attorney General </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Attorney General is the chief legal officer of the state of Minnesota. Elections for this post are held every four years. The current Attorney General, Hubert H. Humphrey III, was elected in 1982 and reelected in 1986, 1990, and 1994.<P>
The Attorney General represents all state agencies, boards and commissions and appears on behalf of the state in both federal and state courts. The Attorney General is included in all major questions involving systems of law and justice, and participates in shaping legislative agenda.<P>
The Attorney General's office handles a vast range of issues such as drug prevention, sexual violence and harassment prevention, environmental protection, and consumer education.<P> 
In order to deal with the large volume of disputes, the Attorney General's staff consists of more than 200 attorneys operating in 32 divisions and units. Three divisions work exclusively with the public and are described further in this section. 
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Attorney General's Office </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
The Attorney General's Office is often referred to as "The People's Lawyers." That is true, but more often than not people think of the Attorney General working for taxpayers somewhat indirectly as a lawyer on behalf of state government. The Attorney General also plays an important role as the "People's Advocate." It is in this role that the Attorney General is able to offer some direct legal services to the public and work on behalf of the "little guy."<P>
In Minnesota, Attorney General Hubert "Skip" Humphrey III has developed a vast array of consumer, environmental, and health fraud services that the public can easily access. In fact, Minnesota has become a leader and a model for many states in offering prompt and helpful customer service through the Attorney General's Office, especially in the area of consumer services.
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Consumer Division </STRONG></H3></A>
The Consumer Division of the Attorney General's Office consists of professional mediators who handle consumer complaints and consumer specialists who answer between 400 and 500 telephone calls per day. The mediators in the Consumer Division work to resolve disputes between consumers and various types of businesses, such as auto dealers, mortgage companies, landlords, and sweepstakes companies. The specialists who answer the consumer phone lines provide basic information to callers about a wide variety of consumer-related issues, including auto repair and other auto issues, landlord-tenant issues, credit and collection issues, and home repair issues, among others.<P>
The Consumer Division also publishes numerous brochures and booklets on various consumer topics. Some of the most popular are the brochures on landlord-tenant issues, the Minnesota Lemon Law, and the Used Car Warranty Law. Recently, the Consumer Division completed a series of booklets on home ownership, including <STRONG>The Home Buyer's Handbook; The Home Seller's Handbook;</STRONG> and <STRONG>The Refinancing Handbook</STRONG> These booklets are designed to help consumers understand the complexities of buying, selling, and refinancing their homes.
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Environment </STRONG></H3></A>
The Attorney General's Office is involved in a number of environmental programs. Minnesota law provides substantial criminal penalties for several serious environmental violations, particularly those that involve illegal transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes and illegal discharge of hazardous air and water pollutants.<P>
The Attorney General's Office has two environmental crimes investigators on staff to work on these types of cases. Information on suspected criminal violations of environmental laws may be reported by calling or contacting one of the environmental crimes investigators at the following address:
<P>
 Minnesota Attorney General's Office<BR>
1400 NCL Tower<BR>
445 Minnesota Street<BR>
St. Paul, MN 55101
<P>
The phone number for the environmental crimes program is (612) 296-7575 and the TDD number is (612) 297-7206. The toll free number for voice and TDD is 1-800-657-3787.<P>
The Attorney General's Office also serves as legal counsel to state environmental agencies and is frequently involved in civil enforcement activities related to violations of environmental laws. Although the Attorney General's Office cannot provide legal advice or represent individuals, the office frequently answers questions related to the legal aspects of the implementation and enforcement of environmental laws. These questions are most often answered by staff from the Environmental Protection Division at (612) 297-3471 and the Agriculture and Natural Resources Division at (612) 297-2735.
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Health Care Fraud and Overbilling </STRONG></H3></A>
The Attorney General's Office investigates and prosecutes health care providers who engage in fraudulent billing practices. If a person reviews the statement of benefits paid by the insurance company to the health care provider (such as a dentist or doctor) and sees that the payment includes services that were never provided, such as getting a tooth pulled or two office visits in one week, the consumer should contact the insurance company or the Attorney General's Office.<P>
Medicaid recipients receive a monthly statement of benefits that lists all of the providers who were paid by the state for services billed in the preceding month. This statement is attached to the MA card they receive every month. If the recipient sees a payment made for something never received, such as a filled prescription or a doctor's visit, the recipient should contact the Department of Human Services at the number listed on the bottom of the statement. The Department of Human Services looks into the matter to find out if it was a negligent error on the part of the provider, or if there is evidence of a pattern of fraud. If it appears that fraud is taking place, the matter is referred to the Attorney General's Office for further investigation.
The Attorney General's Medicaid Fraud Unit has worked with the Travelers Company and Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Minnesota to prosecute health care providers who have billed both the state Medicaid program and the insurance companies for services that were never provided, or for more expensive services than those actually provided.<P>
Although many of the cases the Attorney General's Office prosecutes come as referrals from insurance companies and the Department of Human Services, often employees or former employees who are tired of watching their bosses cheat the system contact the office. Many times they ask to keep their identity confidential so the employer will not know that the illegal practices have been reported by a person who is an employee. Other cases are reported to the Attorney General by concerned family members who feel that their sick loved one is being taken advantage of.<P>
The FBI estimates that as much as one in every ten dollars spent on health care is lost to fraud, overbilling, and abuse. This cost is passed on to consumers in increased premiums and taxes for Medicaid and Medicare. What may appear to be a single error to the consumer may in fact be a broad pattern of fraudulent billing the provider has spread around to many patients. Paying attention to the statements the insurance company or Medicaid program issues and questioning discrepancies can save the health care system and taxpayers millions of dollars each year.

<CENTER><A NAME="80"><H2><STRONG>Bar Associations </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Bar associations are professional groups for attorneys. The largest bar association in Minnesota is the Minnesota State Bar Association (MSBA), an organization with almost 14,000 members. Each member of the MSBA also belongs to one of 21 district bar associations. These associations serve their members by providing continuing legal education and a forum for discussing concerns of the legal profession. They also serve the public, providing lawyer referrals, informational booklets and pamphlets, a telephone information service, and a variety of public education programs. Most of these services are available at little or no cost. Members of the public should consider taking advantage of bar association services when they are seeking general information. Although they cannot provide legal advice, bar associations can help people decide whether to pursue a case, what actions to take, and what type of lawyer to contact. A list of state bar associations in other states appears in <A HREF="appendixb.html">Appendix B</A> of this <STRONG>Guide</STRONG> The following bar associations can provide information about the law, lawyers, and other legal resources in Minnesota.

<CENTER><A NAME="210"><H2><STRONG>Lawyer Referral Services </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER>
Persons who are unsure of how to locate an attorney may contact one of several lawyer referral services operated by bar associations and other organizations which attempt to match the client with a lawyer in his or her community. The Minnesota State Bar Association operates the Statewide Attorney Referral Service, which handles more than 30,000 consumer calls each year, and includes nearly 300 attorneys who practice throughout Minnesota. Attorneys who participate in this referral service have agreed to provide a free 30-minute consultation for each case referred to them. The referral service charges clients $20 when there is a consultation with a lawyer. If a client does not consult a lawyer, there is no referral fee. If a client decides to hire a lawyer through the service, the client and lawyer negotiate fees privately between themselves; the service does not set fees for its lawyers.<P>
Separate attorney referral services operate in Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, and Washington Counties. These services list only lawyers in the particular county. There are fees for these referrals. In addition, Minnesota Women Lawyers will refer cases involving all areas of law to the 120 women lawyers listed with that organization's referral service. Callers are given the names of up to three lawyers, and the referral is free. As with the other referral services, the consumer and the lawyer negotiate fees privately. Most of the lawyers listed in the Minnesota Women Lawyers' Service practice in the Twin Cities area.

The Minnesota State Bar Association offers free pamphlets that provide a quick overview of common legal issues. Topics include adult abuse and neglect, bankruptcy, buying a home, wills, child abuse and neglect, coming of age, getting a divorce, getting married, and being a witness. Two particularly helpful pamphlets discuss lawyers and how to work with them. The pamphlet <STRONG>Selecting a Lawyer</STRONG> offers suggestions on finding and selecting an attorney. <STRONG>Helping Your Lawyer Help You</STRONG> gives hints on working effectively with a lawyer and avoiding wasted time and money. Single copies of these pamphlets are free; there is a small charge for larger quantities. To order call: (612) 333-1183 or 1-800-882-6722, or send a self-addressed, stamped envelope to:

Other organizations offer specialized information. The Hennepin County Bar Association (HCBA) publishes two booklets that focus on the health care decisions facing senior citizens. The first is a booklet on living wills. The booklet describes how living wills are used and includes a form that the reader can use to write such a will. The second publication is a booklet on the durable power of attorney for health care decisions. The booklet describes how people can use these documents to control how health care decisions will be made for them if they become incapacitated. This booklet includes the necessary forms for making the designation. The booklets can be ordered from the HCBA for $2 each or $3.50 for a set of both.
