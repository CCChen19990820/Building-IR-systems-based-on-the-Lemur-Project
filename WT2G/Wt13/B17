<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>T</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">here are two major problem areas - the infertility itself and the infertility treatment.<p>

<I>Infertility</I><br>

It is not uncommon for couples who thought they were infertile to seek out treatment and then find they just didn't have intercourse enough or at the right time to ensure pregnancy. Doctors normally advise couples to try for a year before seeking further specialized medical treatment for infertility.<p>

The realization of infertility is one that a couple arrives at slowly and it is important that one partner does not feel resentful of the other. It is just as important they realize exactly what they are going to need to do to achieve medically-assisted conception. Counselling from experts is a real help - on the nature of the testing, on the program to be followed, on the likely success or failure rate of the techniques used.<p>

<I>Infertility Treatment</I><br>

This can sometimes be regarded as sex by a biological stopwatch. A woman may need to take her vaginal temperature every morning before she gets up and plot it on a graph to predict when she will ovulate. Blood tests and ultrasound scans have to be completed at the right time, injections have to be given at the right time and even sexual intercourse has to done at the right time - right on cue.<p>

For a working woman this can involve having a supportive employer or making the decision to leave her job. It can also involve the problem for some women - of seeing themselves as nothing other than a baby-making machine. For a man who is the source of the infertility it can be a challenge to his self-worth and his sexuality. Is he a lover, or a sperm-donor?<p>

For both partners it can often reach crisis proportions because they are facing emotional and sexual issues they had not encountered before. The outcome of the relationship often depends on how strong or supportive it was before infertility was discovered.

If this has happened to you and you think you might be pregnant, have a pregnancy test as soon as possible or visit a doctor and ask about emergency contraception like the morning after pill.<p>

The morning after pill, also known as emergency contraception or the panic pill prevents fertilization by delaying ovulation or stops implantation by changing the uterine lining. Don't put it off. The sooner you know if you are pregnant or not  the sooner you can begin to consider your options.<p>

Assuming you are pregnant and the pregnancy is unplanned and perhaps even unwanted you have a number of options. These are abortion, adoption or keeping the baby either as a single parent or by forming a permanent relationship with a partner through marriage or living together. There are moral, emotional, legal and religious issues involved with all of your options. Some options may not be suitable for you.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">If possible it is best not to make the decision alone. Find someone you trust to discuss your options. For some women, the father of the child is the first person they want to talk with, other women don't feel this is the best thing to do. A friend who might have had a similar experience, a doctor, counselor or parents should all be able to help with your decision. The ultimate decision is a big one, the effects of which can last a lifetime. <p>

Despite this fact try and make your decision early in your pregnancy, because options like abortion become more difficult as the pregnancy progresses.Before you make your decision you must consider: How will I pay to look after the baby? Where will I live? Do I have any support from the father?What are my work prospects? Do I have any support from my family or friends? Have I finished my schooling? How do my parents feel about the baby, will they provide support? Make sure you get qualified contraceptive advice so that you don't end up with more than one unplanned pregnancy.

<I>What is abortion?</I><br>

Conception consists of two parts, fertilization and implantation. Abortion is a medical procedure that terminates pregnancy by removing the implanted fetus before it can survive outside the uterus. <p>

<I>Is abortion legal?</I><br>

Abortions are generally legal but this can vary from country to country and state to state. Age limits are often placed on when you can have an abortion, so it is wise to check on the local laws before you make any decisions.	<p>

<I>Moral issues of abortion</I><br>

There are moral issues surrounding abortion. Anti-abortion lobbies exist worldwide and they continue to pressure governments and society in general against abortion. Their protests are based on the belief that the fetus is a living person from the moment of conception. These people believe  abortion is murder. 'Pro-choice' groups believe that one of a woman's most fundamental rights is to choose whether or not to have children, and when to have them. The fetus is totally dependent on the mother, it is part of her body and they say she should have the right to choose whether to continue with a pregnancy.<p>

<I>Emotional issues</I><br>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half1.GIF">If you intend to go through with an abortion you need to be sure you are will be happy with your decision.  Weigh up how you feel about the pregnancy and how you feel about abortion. The operation is not reversible and if you are not happy you will live with the consequences. Abortion has a number of advantages. If you are over the legal age you can contain the number of people who know you were pregnant and your life can go on. The procedure is relatively quick and safe.<p>

In terms of medical risks, abortion is much less dangerous than giving birth.  The main disadvantage of abortion is that some women feel guilty and depressed after the abortion and this feeling can stay with the woman for years. However, most women do not suffer from any long term consequences.<p>

<I>Methods of abortion</I><br>

There are a number of methods of abortion, which differ according to the stage of pregnancy.<p>

<I>Abortion in the first 14 days after conception:</I><br>

It is difficult to be certain of pregnancy so soon after conception, but if suspected, a menstrual extraction or menstrual regulation can be performed. This is also called interception. The procedure involves the use of a hand syringe and a plastic tube known as a `cannula', which removes the contents of the uterus. It is a quick and reasonably safe method, but as pregnancy has often not been established, some women can experience the emotional trauma associated with abortion, often unnecessarily.<p>

<I>Up to 12 weeks after conception</I><br>

Vacuum aspiration is the most common abortion procedure. A thin flexible tube is inserted into the vagina, through the cervix and into the womb. It is attached to a suction machine at the other end which draws out the contents of the uterus. This method can be carried out under local or general anesthetic.<p>

<I>12 to 16 weeks after conception</I><br>

A Dilatation and Evacuation or D &amp; E is performed at this stage. A D &amp; E involves the stretching or dilation of the cervix and the removal of the contents of the uterus. The operation is carried out under general anesthetic and an overnight stay in hospital is usually recommended.<p>

<I>After 16 weeks after conception</I><br>

Injections of salt solutions or drugs can be used to cause contractions of the womb to push out the contents. These solutions or drugs cause contractions like a mini-labour and a sedative may be given to ease the discomfort. A stay of 2 to 3 days in hospital is recommended. However, D & E is the preferred and safest method for the late termination of pregnancy. Hysterectomy may also be used to terminate a late pregnancy. This involves cutting through the abdomen and the wall of the uterus to remove the contents. This should not be confused with a hysterectomy which is the removal of the womb. The procedure leaves a scar and can only be performed at a late stage of pregnancy, if other methods are not possible. A hysterectomy is performed under a general anesthetic with a 1 week stay in hospital and 2 to 3 weeks further convalescence.<p>

<I>Recovery from abortion</I><br>

Recovery from an abortion is usually fast. Bleeding and cramping can occur for the first few days after an abortion. If the bleeding is very heavy or the cramps severe a doctor should be consulted. Also watch for other danger signs which include fever and chills, foul vaginal discharge and muscle aches and pains.<p>

<I>Other advice</I><br>

The first menstrual bleed should be about four to six weeks after the abortion. Only sanitary napkins should be used - not a tampon - for the first two weeks after an abortion as the risk of infection may increase if anything is inserted into the vagina. Intercourse, swimming and strenuous exercise should be avoided for at least two weeks. It is important to have a check up after six weeks to ensure there are no complications. Some women feel relieved after an abortion, some feel sad or
depressed.  Both reactions are normal. The hormones associated with pregnancy are still present in the body and any depression experienced is similar to post-natal depression. Whatever emotion is experienced, talk to a friend, mother, doctor or counselor for advice on how to cope.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>A</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">doption is when a child is placed with a family willing to care for and raise the child. For a women with an unwanted pregnancy offering her child for adoption is a chance to defer parenthood. To put a child up for adoption is to relinquish any legal rights as a parent. Both biological or birth parents have to consent to the adoption unless one is declared unfit or cannot be located.<p>

If the birth parents disagree about giving a child up for adoption, the court may rule on an outcome. The court usually prefers the child to stay with at least one birth  parent if sufficient indication of support can be given. For example, if the birth father can show that he could provide a good home, perhaps with the help of his mother, he may win custody.<p>

Not long ago, women intending to have their babies adopted were not even allowed to hold them after the birth. This was said to be the best way to cope with the separation. This doesn't happen today, in some instances there are 'grace' periods during which birth parents can change their decision and have the baby returned. The decision to adopt is difficult and there are both positives and negatives in giving up a child.


</font></td>


<td align=left width=300 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">Positives include the potential for the baby to have a family that wants it, that will give it love and a good home. The birth parents can get on with their lives, which is particularly important if they are young and still at school or unable to support a baby. However, the birth parents may have feelings of guilt for many years and the child will be missed. <p>

Adopted children sometimes try and find their biological parents. Women considering adoption should consider being contacted by a child in later life and how that might affect a family situation. There are a number of support groups that can be contacted either about adoption or re-establishing contact.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>I</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">f you are considering single parenthood be aware, children take an enormous amount of time and dedication. Bringing up children is expensive and the financial aspects of parenthood cannot be ignored. Finally, single parenthood involves a change of lifestyle. The freedom you enjoy as a single person will be taken away from you with a young child. On the positive side bringing up children can be an extremely rewarding and enriching experience. The love many people feel for their unborn child is impossible to ignore.<p>

Single parenthood is a hard choice to make, but having a strong network of friends and family with whom to share the responsibilities can make it easier. There is no reason why a single parent can't give love and time to a child. But the less stress in your life  the easier the task. If there is a constant struggle to pay rent, buy food or take time off when your child is sick, life becomes difficult. As a single parent you may be eligible for government benefits, which can alleviate some of the financial hardship.<p>

<td align=left width=225 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
You may feel that the responsibility will be good for you but the child's quality of life must be the first consideration. It is also important to consider the possible impact on relationships and your social life. There are support groups for those trying to make the decision and for those who have made it. If you feel you have the financial resources and family support to bring up a child, the experience can be extremely rewarding. Many older, single women are in fact choosing single parenthood. These women want the rewards of children, without the involvement of a permanent relationship.

In many families the major impact is on the grandmother. Depending on the age of the expectant parents there may be emotional and financial strain put onto the grandparents. If the mother plans to live at home and continue her education or working, her mother may be left with the task of child-minding. This is often better than putting the child in a crèche or with a baby-sitter, but it must suit  all concerned. There may also be an opportunity for other family members to share child-minding. Arrangements that suit a couple not living together should also be considered. The father may want to spend time with the child, and share responsibilities, as may his parents.

As well as normal expenses there will be medical, food, clothing, education and childcare costs. Financial assistance and national health schemes vary, so check on the level of support and eligibility requirements. Constant financial worries not only affect relationships but also lower morale, self-esteem and sometimes, hope.<p>

These factors all contribute to a decline in motivation and make it difficult to get on top of life again. A high proportion of women rely on maintenance from the child's father, which is fair, but this dependence can also cause animosity.

<td align=left width=300 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">Even in circumstances where the financial situation is not strained the costs of rearing a child are considerable. As the child grows so do the costs, including clothing, education and extra-curricular activities.<p>

With time, a second child may appear and the expenses start to multiply. The decision to have children is a long term commitment. The primary responsibility lasts for some 18 years, for each child, sometimes longer, so financial considerations are of major importance.

<td align=left width=450 valign=top>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>I</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">n Victorian times it was thought that if you stimulated your own genitals and obtained pleasure from it you were doing harm to yourself. Eventually research acknowledged that masturbation may be normal as long as it was not done "to excess". The research did not specify what "excess" was - and so doubts lingered.<p>



Now it is clear from the extensive research work of Masters and Johnson, and Kinsey that masturbation is a normal and natural release of sexual tension in women and men of any age. It is not possible to masturbate to excess - it won't cause physical or psychological harm.<p>



Masturbation is not just a solitary pursuit. It is something that can be enjoyed as a participant or as a spectator. Many people say they find it arousing to watch their partners masturbate. By watching your partner masturbate you can discover the way in which they prefer to be aroused and that can be of use in lovemaking. You can learn how to stimulate your partner the way they like best.<p>



Whether you masturbate or not is a personal choice. You are not bad if you do. You are not bad if you don't.  Recent research has indicated that 97% of men and more than 90% of women have masturbated by the age of 21. There are many myths about masturbation.  It will not, of course, make you blind, sterile or insane. It will not create acne or take your virginity. Masturbation should be seen as an opportunity for self-education. It helps develop sexual comfort, security and self-esteem.<p>



Masturbation does not mean that sex with your partner is not good enough or satisfying enough. Masturbation can be a good way for partners of different libidos to cope and masturbation before or during intercourse can be a highly stimulating part of lovemaking. <p>



Many people masturbate when their partner is sexually unavailable. It is a source of sexual pleasure that is not harmful and can enrich their sex lives with their partner. Some people believe that if they have a solid and loving relationship masturbation should be abandoned. That is not the case. Most of us have learned to masturbate very early in life and those feelings of intimacy and pleasure shape our sexual lives.  A healthy well-balanced couple knows this and is not threatened by one partner masturbating as long as it does not replace shared sexual activity.

By the age of fifteen most boys have masturbated, sometimes frequently. Girls do not masturbate as much, perhaps because the clitoris is not as easily accessible as the penis and they are not taught about the importance of the clitoris in sexual arousal. regularly.

<td align=left width=225 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">There are many words for masturbation: wanking, pulling yourself off, playing with yourself, jerking off or fingering. Even very small children masturbate.  Their hands touch their genitals by chance and because it feels good to touch and play, they continue the activity. Masturbation is not harmful. It is normal and people of all ages - men and women, young and old - masturbate regularly.

By masturbating you learn about the shape and feel of your body and the pleasurable sensations caused by different kinds of touching. It is not harmful in any way even though many parents punish children if they find them masturbating or make them feel guilty about this behavior.

<td align=left width=225 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"> Here are some facts about masturbation. Recent research has indicated that 97% of men and more than 90% of women have masturbated by the age of 21. Most people masturbate at some stage during their lives.  Masturbation will not do you physical harm. Masturbation is not self-abuse. Masturbation will not make you blind, stunt your growth or weaken your brain.

(figures 1&2) Uncircumcised boys can also move the foreskin up and down over the head of their penis. <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">As their hand action becomes faster the sexual excitement increases until it peaks in a feeling of very strong pleasure - the orgasm. At this point boys ejaculate, and semen spurts from the tip of their penis. Soon after this the penis becomes limp and the body relaxed. Many young men can begin masturbation again almost immediately, but as they get older this ability disappears and men need longer breaks between orgasms.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>A</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">s long as you are not physically damaging yourself there is no such thing as excessive masturbation. Some people masturbate once or twice a month, others three or four times a day. Neither should be concerned that their own pattern of masturbation is excessive.  There is no medical evidence whatsoever that masturbation causes mental illness and the expert opinion is that it can have a positive effect, because it creates more sensuality, more pleasure and more control.

A woman will nearly always have her first orgasm from masturbation. In fact it appears that masturbation plays an important part in shaping a women's sexual response. For older women, with or without a partner, masturbation is useful. It eases vaginal pain caused by dryness and increases lubrication.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>A</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"> boy reaches puberty between the ages of 13 and 16 years. His first ejaculation is seen as an indication that he has reached puberty. Ejaculation may occur as a result of self stimulation or "masturbation" which is an extension of "genital play" that is common in childhood.  Ejaculation can also occur during sleeping hours. This is known as a "wet dream". Unaware of his ability to ejaculate a boy may have a wet dream which apart from being messy, can cause concern and embarrassment. Many young men use masturbation for pleasure, to manage their sexual tension and sexual arousal. Masturbation and ejaculation reduce the incidence of "wet dreams".<p>

With puberty comes an interest in sex and feelings of sexual arousal. A young man is faced with moral, social and personal dilemmas and this raises questions such as:

<ul>
<li>if and when is he going to have sexual intercourse and with whom; <p>
<li>coping with infatuations and love; <p>
<li>if he has feelings of affection toward his male friends does this mean that he is "gay" or homosexual;<p>
<li>doubts as to his attractiveness;<p>
<li>health and hygiene;<p>
<li>is his body developing into the "right" shape;<p>
<li>is his penis big enough;<p>
<li>is his penis the same as every other boy's or does it look unusual because of circumcision or the absence of circumcision;<p>
<li>will he be able to control his erections;<p>
<li>when he has sexual intercourse will he ejaculate too soon;<p>
<li>is masturbation bad for him and can it effect his health;<p>
<li>will he be "good" at having sex;<p>
<li>when and how can he buy condoms with minimum embarrassment;<p>
<li>will he get a sexually transmitted disease if he has sex with a girl;<p>
<li>who can he talk to about contraception, sexual assault and other issues and;<p>
<li>what if his sexual performance isn't perfect;<p>
</ul>

The physical changes to a boy in during puberty vary from one person to another but the following development is likely to occur:
<ul>
<li>hair develops around the genitals, in the arm pits and on the face, <p>
<li>muscles develop,<p>
<li>the penis and testes "develop" or grow bigger,<p>
<li>the voice deepens,<p>
<li>a large number of boys experience breast enlargement,<p>
<li>the testes produce sperm and,<p>
<li>the penis tends to become erect more often.<p>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>I</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">t's common for a girl to reach puberty between the ages of 12 and 15 years. Her first menstrual period is seen as an indication that she has reached puberty. Big physical changes occur in a relatively short period of time and they can have an emotional effect causing unprovoked mood swings which can create tensions with family and friends.  Girls often exchange information about sex and sexual development and its important that accurate, factual information is thrown into this melting pot of knowledge.<p>



Many girls compare their development with their friends in "dressing room" situations where breast size and the presence of pubic hair may be noticed and menstrual cycles discussed. The girl who "develops" or reaches puberty late in her teens, and the girl who reaches puberty very early may need support from caring adults as young people desperately need to be the "same" but nature sometimes appears to fight against these social needs.<p>



With puberty comes an interest in sex and feelings of sexual arousal. A young woman is faced with moral,  social and personal dilemmas  raising questions such as:



<UL>

<LI>if and when is she going to have sex and with whom;<p>

<LI>coping with infatuations and love; <p>

<LI>health and hygiene;<p>

<LI>when her menstrual period occurs will it prevent her from playing sport or swimming;<p>

<LI>is masturbation bad for her;  <p>

<LI>will it hurt having sexual intercourse;<p>

<LI>will she be "good" at having sex;<p>

<LI>is she sexually attracted to boys, girls or both when and how  should she organize contraception;<p>

<LI>who can she talk to openly with about sexual matters, contraception, abortion, sexual assault and so on;<p>

<LI>what would she do if she got pregnant; and,<p>

<LI>is her body developing into the "right" shape?<p>

</UL>





<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Menstruation</b></font><br>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">

Menstrual periods commence between the ages of 12 to 14 years. In the first couple of years the menstrual cycle may be irregular but this will soon develop a regular pattern of occurrence every 28 days or so. During the menstrual period a girl will need to use a sanitary pad or a tampon to absorb menstrual discharge.



Tampons can be inserted into the vagina by women of any age provided they experience no pain or discomfort is experienced. Slim tampons are available for younger women. Tampons should be changed every 4 hours as in an extremely small number of cases women have become very ill from "toxic shock", an extremely rare condition.<p>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>A</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">dolescents want to establish 'self identity' and a sense of autonomy, they want to 'belong' to a group of like-minded young people as they develop a capacity for love and sex. Most adolescents have their basic material needs provided by their parents and they tend to focus more readily on their emotional needs, the need to belong, the need for love and affection, the need to develop ambition and the need to achieve. <p>



In adolescents and less mature adults the biological sexual urge becomes confused with the desire to love  and the desire to be loved. Its common for an adolescent to develop an affection for close friends of the same sex and, when combined with messages from active sex hormones the adolescent may believe, or suspect, that they are homosexual.<p>



Although there is a stereotype model of masculinity and of femininity in reality its not so clear cut and a young man or a young woman shouldn't feel extreme concern for their sexuality if they don't 'measure up' to that fictional stereotype. Fewer than ten per cent of people have strong homosexual tendencies and even fewer choose a homosexual lifestyle. <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF"> Parents and adolescents face a wide range of issues that could bring them into conflict as the young person tries to develop a sense of their own values and their own independence. One source of tension between an adolescent and their parents is often to do with the young person's desire to explore their own sexuality.<p>



Some parents have a highly developed moral code that they would like their son or daughter to adopt, some parents simply don't want to see their children make the mistakes that they made when they were young,  other parents simply want their children to be safe and happy.<p>



<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half3.GIF">Conflict can also arise between parental values and the adolescent's behavior due to the overwhelming influence of peer group pressure.  Some parents think that media role models exercise too much of an influence over adolescent behavior. <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half4.GIF">In reality, we make our own decisions about our values and our attitude to our own sexual preferences and behavior based on all of the information and misinformation that we obtain from a wide range of sources.<p>



It is important that an adolescent become aware of his or her own body, be at ease with touching it and should see it as a unique personal possession and with this attitude he or she will be able to happily respond to another person when they are ready for such an emotional and sexual relationship. <p>



The emotional turmoil experienced by many adolescents is part of a process of sorting out what's good for the individual themselves and this process most often leads to a well balanced view of adult life but it needs to be approached in a calm and logical manner.

Very often, a person's sexual activities (who they sleep with, how they have sex) are contrary to their true feelings (who they want to sleep with and what they would like to do during sex).<p>

Many of us harbor sexual desires in the recesses of our mind - desires we may not act upon, nor even talk about with a lover or close friend.

You could consider sexuality like a fruit salad or smorgasbord - there are lots of flavors, different ingredients, a variety of tastes and appearances. One man might label himself straight, be turned on by women and not by men, but may enjoy wearing women's clothes and might also enjoy his female partner stimulating him anally with a dildo. Most of those men who consider themselves gay have no interest in wearing women's clothes.

These occasional homosexual feelings may not affect their relationship with a partner of the opposite sex.<p>

Sometimes - because of pressure from our peers or society in general - sexual desires and feelings will be suppressed as we try to will ourselves to have other, 'normal' or more accepted sexual feelings. For many, these suppressed feelings can cause pressures that become problematic - forcing some to avoid any  sexual encounters, or to lie to a partner (and themselves).  Suppressed feelings can lead to anonymous sexual relations with a person of the same sex while maintaining a relationship with someone of the opposite sex.<p>

Resolving your sexuality - deciding on who you are and what you want sexually - can be difficult for many people, particularly those who have been raised in a strict or religious family. Complex choices in life are made all the time.  Choosing a partner with whom to share a long-term relationship will not always be made on the basis of sexuality, other factors can also come into play. With the best intentions of being true to oneself and our partner, there are occasions when pressure from relatives and friends, the need to conform and the fact that you may love someone might cause you to live life as a heterosexual even when you know, deep down, you are homosexual.<p>

Often, non-judgmental counselling can be of benefit to help people discover the sexual and lifestyle choices that are best for them. Some people are good at maths, others can write, some can run fast.  Others have red hair, some are straight, some are gay - the human race is full of subtle and profound differences.  Understanding the differences and enjoying them, tolerating and acknowledging them in others and accepting them in ourselves, can be a major step in living a harmonious and fulfilling life.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>W</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">e can't positively say how any person 'becomes' heterosexual - theories have been advanced that suggest the origins of our sexuality might be genetic; alternatively, some think it may be environmental.<p>

We don't know for sure how heterosexuals 'happen' - but it obviously has something to do with the 'drive' to procreate and continue our species. We become strongly aware of our sexuality during adolescence. Many kids experiment with each other - perhaps masturbate with friends of the same sex. Gradually their sexual orientation will steer them towards someone they are attracted to. Usually, though not always, that person will be someone of the opposite sex. The 'moment' that a person starts 'being heterosexual' varies from person to person: some start early, others much later - people generally find the right time and the right person, though the first sexual experience can end up being 'wrong', uncomfortable or even traumatic.<p>

Some people take a long time to 'fire' sexually and, occasionally, may need professional counselling to resolve any apprehensions and fears. Connecting sexually with another person is an important aspect of living, but equally important is the need to connect on other levels: companionship, proximity, 'closeness' with someone else make us feel we are able to share life and living and, at the same time, feel more enriched personally. Very often, it is connecting on other levels that can lead to meaningful sexual experiences - which can then turn a one-night stand or an extended 'fling' into a significant relationship.<p>

Adolescents often feel pressured - by their peers or role models in the media - to quickly enter into a sexual relationship with another person: as if we don't really exist except through our connection with a partner. Finding our self, our individuality, can provide a foundation from which to relate to others - as colleagues, friends or lovers.<p>

Importantly, knowing when and how firmly to say no  to an invitation (or pressure) to have sex is vital - good sex can only take place when two people and share equally in the experience; both have to really want to 'do it', neither should feel under any obligation to the other to simply lie back and take it.<p>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>H</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">eterosexuality does not only refer to the sexual stimulus that may lead to procreation; people have heterosexual sex recreationally because they are attracted to or love someone: straight sex is not just about making babies. Because heterosexuality is more usual than any other sexuality, society is geared-up for it: most products are marketed to heterosexuals, most heroes, villains and role models (good and bad) in literature and the cinema and on television are straight and there is an expectation  that everyone will be straight, even though many are not.<p>

Often, it is assumed that heterosexuals will want to marry and establish families. Increasingly, this is not the case. Many heterosexuals are monogamous, marry and raise families; many do not marry but still have children and many prefer to remain single but still enjoy straight sex with one, several or many partners. Society tends to be <I>heterosexist</I>, where heterosexuality, because it is the most usual sexuality, dominates every aspect of society - particularly the law, sometimes oppressively.<p>

Many heterosexuals - particularly women - and homosexuals have rebelled against the idea of a society that is both heterosexist and family-centered: allowance is gradually being made for more forms of sexual expression. Up until about thirty years ago, heterosexual relationships had more strictly defined, traditional roles for the man and woman, but gradually that has changed.<p>

Many issues and trends affect the way individuals think about their needs today - the women's movement, more effective birth control, the prevalence of AIDS (HIV), and the need and desire for both people in a relationship to have a career or at least a life outside the 'couple'. These have changed and accented the individuals' needs, rights, aspirations and sexual expectations within a relationship.<p>

Women are re-assessing their traditional, passive or feminine roles in a one-to-one relationship: they are seeking more from their partner - more understanding, feeling, responsiveness and opportunities for sharing. Because sex is more openly discussed in society today, couples are or should be talking about what each partner expects from the sexual component of a relationship - desires, turn-ons, turn-offs, positions and stimuli. Women are being more assertive, men are becoming more sensitive - or at least that's the goal as the two sexes try to reach a power balance within a relationship.<p>

These changes in traditional roles vary from individual to individual and couple to couple and can impose strains and tensions on a relationship - any anxieties, disagreements and conflicts (which often lead to misunderstandings) should be discussed as they arise. People cannot know what their partner expects of them unless they are told. Falling back on traditional role models and patterns will not resolve sexual, emotional and general relationship problems: talking is a major path to understanding and sex therapists or relationship guidance counsellors can be of immense assistance to couples in trouble.<p>

Remember, heterosexual sex is not intercourse alone: it's not always about the penis entering the vagina, nor do both partners have to come at the same time or at all: good sex can grow from exploring each other's bodies; licking, kissing, sucking, caressing, rubbing, massaging, tickling and mutual masturbation.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How can two women have sex together when there's no penis involved?</B></font><br>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">

Sex, whether it be straight or gay, does not have to involve the penetration of a vagina by a penis: this is just one technique and, biologically, the one that is designed for the procreation of children. Many men believe that a woman will achieve an orgasm (or a 'good' orgasm) only if she has been well and truly penetrated by a full-size, erect and throbbing penis - but the majority of women orgasm through stimulation of the clitoris. Lesbians enjoy sex in very many ways: penetration of the vagina by the finger (or fingers) and tongue, caressing and hugging, licking, tickling, squeezing, massage, gentle biting, rubbing against each other's body - the ways are limited only by the imagination of the partners and their willingness to explore.<p>

As with all sex partners, lesbians will enjoy sex more if they talk to each other and find out what their partner's likes and dislikes are. But lesbian love - the love between two women - is not about sex alone; it's about two people who love each other, want to be with each other, share experiences and have sex together.</font><p>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Are gay women butch?</B></font><br>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">Lesbians vary from woman to woman: voluptuous, small, thin, big, effete, strong - there are as many lesbian 'types' as there are female types. You can't assume that anyone is homosexual or heterosexual from the way they look.</font><p>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Do lesbians hate men?</B></font><br>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">A few do, but most don't - the same could be said for heterosexual women. Many lesbians - in fact many women in general - do dislike some of the power structures that are dominated by men and the attitudes of some men which have led to sexual stereotypes that centre around the penis.  Many societies are male-dominated - men make the rules, take the best jobs and, may act aggressively towards women.  Although this is changing, it can make life for a lesbian more difficult. As a woman she can potentially be discriminated against by men for that reason alone and secondly as a lesbian, she can receive a 'double-dose' of discrimination and abuse.

In some instances this violence is perpetrated by people who themselves fear they may be homosexual and take-out their confusion on someone else. <p>

Many religions preach against the practice of homosexuality, pointing to such texts as the Bible to justify their stance - but there are some members of the clergy who accept homosexual love as being valid or, at the very least, take a 'softer' line on the issue.

<td align=left width=300 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">Young people have many role models who may inspire them; many of these role models come from literature, the cinema and, most of all, television. Most of these heroes and heroines are assumed to be straight, but gradually we are seeing more gay positive role models and their prevalence may help reduce society's homophobia.

Some of these marriages do not break up, even when one partner realises or is told the other partner is gay. There is a lot of social pressure to lead a heterosexual life and some gays and lesbians feel forced into these choices. Others, of course, are open about their sexuality from an early age and only have relationships with people of the same sex.  Many gay people have children - in and out of traditional marriages.

Sometimes, during adolescence and early adult years. But these ideas are being challenged. We can't positively say how any person 'becomes' heterosexual (straight) or homosexual (gay) - theories have been advanced that suggest the origins of our sexuality might be genetic; there is now talk of a 'gay gene'.

<td align=left width=300 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">We don't know for sure how homosexuals 'happen', nor do we know how heterosexuals 'happen'. What is known is that most children whose father or mother is gay will be heterosexual and there are very many instances where children have been raised by a lesbian mother and her female partner or by a gay father and his male partner and have not turned gay. This might indicate that the environment in which the child is raised does not necessarily determine their sexual preference.

'Coming out' can be very difficult and may mean losing contact with close friends and family, even with one or both parents and children - if the gay person is a parent - if those people can't accept the person's homosexuality. Some societies' attitudes have changed radically in recent years. Better sex education, more information and exposure to gays - many of whom are very famous - it is becoming a little easier for gay people to come out. Gay support networks, counselling services and social groups are found in most large population centres and the gay community can be very supportive - it is now much easier for  people to discuss their fears and anxieties that arise from talking about homosexuality.
</font></td>



<td align=left width=300 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
For many gay people, coming out would not be difficult if they could feel sure they will not be discriminated against - particularly in their work. For this reason, many people come out to friends and family, but not 'professionally', that is, not at the office, factory, school, or other place of employment. For very many gay men and women, coming out can be an intensely liberating, moving and exhilarating experience. Though it is sometimes accompanied by fears and anxieties, even trauma, it can be a positive move nevertheless.

<td align=left width=450 valign=top>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Does gay sex mean 'taking it up the bum'?</B></font><br>



<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">

If that's what you like - yes.  If you don't - no. It's just the same as with heterosexual sex - many heterosexuals enjoy anal sex, many don't. Some gay men enjoy entering another man's anus with their penis (being the so-called active' partner); others enjoy being entered (the so-called 'passive' partner) others don't like either and others like both.<p>



Gay men have sex in many other ways: oral sex, mutual masturbation; caressing, hugging and rubbing against each other's body, using dildos and vibrators on (or in) each other.  The accent does not have to be on penetration - there are lots of variations. The important thing is for both partners to agree about and enjoy the sex they <I>share</I>.</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Precautions</B></font><br>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">

As with all sex, both partners need to consider what they are doing and any precautions they should take. Care should also be taken when using dildos, vibrators or other objects - these should not be inserted too far into the anus, because it and the intestine are very sensitive organs and can be easily damaged. Water-based lubricating gels and creams should always be used.</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Do gay men have limp wrists?</B></font><br>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">

Only if they want to! Some gay men appear effeminate (have so-called female characteristics) - as do some straight men; others are muscular and well built - most are somewhere in between, looking and behaving like any other man.</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Do gay men meet for sex in toilets?</B></font><br>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">

It is a fact that a few men - not just men who call themselves gay, but men who regard themselves as straight and who, often, are married - meet for anonymous sex with other men in public toilets, parks, beaches and other (usually secluded) places, sometimes called beats.</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Do gay men hate women or straight men?</B></font><br>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">

Gay men often enjoy the company of and close friendships with women, but they prefer to have sex with other men. There are quite a few instances where gay men have remained happily married to women (gay or straight) and the couples have shared a wide range of interests and feelings - except sex. Some gay men have close non-sexual friendships with straight men but, as is the case with many women, some gay men resent the stereotyping and strictures that are imposed by some straight men on gays, women and society in general.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>S</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">ociety is often rigid in its attitude to sex - difference is akin to abnormal in the minds of many people and bisexuals have to overcome the same prejudices directed at homosexuals and, occasionally, at sexually-active heterosexuals. Additionally, bisexuals are sometimes regarded with suspicion by some homosexual men and women who believe that people who call themselves bisexual are in fact homosexuals who have not fully resolved their sexual identity and hide behind the heterosexual facet of their sexuality.<p>

A lot of people believe that bisexuals are more promiscuous than heterosexuals or homosexuals and 'cheat' on their gay or straight partners, assuming that bisexuals flit from a female partner to a male partner in order to satisfy their sexual appetite. This assumes, incorrectly, that gays and straights don't have the same propensity to move from partner to partner, albeit always a member of the same sex, for gays, or the opposite sex, for straights. Many who condemn or mistrust bisexuals are afraid of the nature of their own sexuality and the feeling that they too might be attracted to a person of the same sex as well as someone of the opposite sex.<p>

There are others whose view of sex is so rigid that it does not permit them to consider that the sexual 'playing field' can change throughout a person's life and is different from person to person. In every bisexual person there is a potential for that person to remain monogamous within a relationship. If the partner is male and the relationship ends, the next partner may be male or female, and the new relationship may also be monogamous.<p>

There are people who do not wish to enter long-term, monogamous relationships. They may not necessarily want children, but they do want to enjoy sex and demonstrate strong feelings and love for particular individuals - the difference between bisexuals, homosexuals and heterosexuals in this instance is that bisexuals happen to be attracted to both sexes.<p>

Deciding to acknowledge and accept one's bisexuality requires a particular strength and personal honesty, that honesty should also be there when the bisexual person begins a relationship. Provided the bisexual's partner is aware of their partner's sexuality and their desire or lack of desire for a long-term commitment, there need not necessarily be a problem - and this honesty and openness within a relationship must also be true for heterosexuals and homosexuals.<p>

Because of STDs, and HIV, all  sexual partners - straight, gay or bi - should be aware of each others sexual history and sexuality. But remember the risk of catching HIV comes from unsafe sexual practices, not from your sexual orientation.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>T</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">he basic problem most transsexuals and transvestites grapple with involves acceptance. Until very recently, western society offered little understanding of transsexuals or transvestites, rarely understanding the differences between the two and often categorizing them as homosexuals. With the increasing power of gay liberation and the gradual acceptance and understanding of homosexuality, there has been a slight 'flow-through' of understanding about transsexualism and transvestitism.<p>

There is still, however, mainstream indifference and often hostility directed at these people.




</font></td>



<td align=left width=300 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"> This hostility is sometimes found in the homosexual and lesbian community and amongst some feminists as well as heterosexuals. Transsexuals' problems are complicated by the need for and cost of surgery and hormone therapy as well as the delays often experienced in the waiting period for the physical 'changeover'. During this waiting period they would undergo extensive counseling and assessment to determine if their desire to change gender physically is 'genuine'.

If you enjoy cross-dressing, are sexually aroused by it, don't feel bothered by it and are not repressing the need to cross-dress, then the chances are, that you already accept this particular aspect of your sexuality. A problem for a person who accepts that they are a transvestite can often occur when the person's partner is unable to accept the situation. In such cases, both partners should seek counseling, most often from a sex therapist. It is possible for two partners to enjoy a sexual relationship that incorporates cross-dressing.

<td align=left width=300 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"> If you feel that you are 'trapped' in the wrong body - that your true gender is not your biological one - you should seek counseling, perhaps with a view to entering a sex-change program. Support groups and counselors who can discuss transvestitism and transsexualism are available in some centers, usually in capital cities.

A man may feel his gender is really female 'inside', and only outwardly male. Many transsexuals feel a very strong need to change their gender physically to match the sex they truly believe themselves to be. Such changes usually involve hormone therapy and surgery to change sexual organs and are often very successful. Most transsexuals are male, but female transsexuals are not uncommon.<p>

Most transsexuals are not necessarily aroused sexually by wearing clothes of the opposite sex.

 They wear the clothes to express their perceived sex. Not all transsexuals are homosexual (gay) - because they believe themselves to be the opposite of their apparent sex they are most often attracted to people they consider to be opposite to their perceived gender. After hormone therapy and operations to change or adapt sex organs, many transsexuals enjoy sexual relationships with men and/or women and are able to live a relatively normal and usually very much improved lifestyle.

<I>Genitals:</I> <p>

The male genitalia, penis and scrotum, are clearly visible as they hang outside the body.<p>

<I>Voice:</I>  </I> <p>

At puberty the 'voice breaks' and becomes deeper, and the cartilage in the neck called the 'Adam's apple', enlarges.<p>

<I>Breasts:  </I> <p>

The male breasts do not develop except in muscle tone.<p>

<I>Muscles and Fat:  </I> <p>

The thighs, calves, shoulders and upper arms grow broader during adolescence. Strength also increases. A man's body is 10-20% fat, distributed on the upper body and abdomen.<p>

<I>Body Hair:  </I> <p>

Early in puberty boys start to grow body hair on the penis, scrotum and anus. Later, under the armpits, the face and then on the arms, chest, thighs and lower legs.<p>

<I>Pelvis size:  </I> <p>

The male pelvis is narrow, yet large and heavy to support a heavy body weight.<p>

<I>Genitals:</I> <p>

The vulva is the outside part of a women's genitals, made up of a large and small labia (lips), the clitoris, vaginal opening and urethra.  The vagina, uterus and fallopian tubes and ovaries are inside the body.<p>

<I>Voice:</I>  </I> <p>

A girl's voice changes slightly in register as she matures.<p>

<I>Breasts:  </I> <p>

At puberty the breasts develop, the nipples and the area around them swell and enlarge.<p>

<I>Muscles and Fat:  </I> <p>

When a girl is about nine or ten fat is deposited on the breasts, hips, thighs and buttocks. More fat appears between the ages of 15 and 17 in the same areas, as the hips become rounded the waist becomes curved and more defined. A woman's body is about 20-25% fat.<p>

<I>Body Hair:  </I> <p>

Early in puberty girls start to grow body hair on the genitals as well as under the armpits.<p>

<I>Pelvis size:  </I> <p>

The female pelvis is relatively wide and shallow to accommodate a baby during pregnancy and childbirth.<p>

<I>The Fallopina Tubes</I> are narrow tubes which carry the ova or eggs.<p>

<I>The Ovaries</I> are on either side of the uterus and contain between 200,000 and 400,000 ova when a girl is born.  The ovaries also produce hormones oestrogen and progesterone.<p>

<I>The Uterus or Womb</I> is located in the middle of the pelvis between the bladder, in front, and the bowel, at the back.  If a women is not pregnant the cavity of the uterus is narrow and slit-like.  It is lined with tissue made up of glands, which is called endometrium and is shed during menstruation.  If a woman is pregnant this tissue develops into the placenta.<p>

<I>The Cervix</I> produces the mucus which changes throughout the menstrual cycle due to the effect of oestrogen and progesterone.  There are two types of cervical mucus - fertile and infertile.  The infertile mucus helps block the cervix by acting as a barrier to sperm at infertile times.  The fertile mucus allows easier entry for the sperm to the uterus and fallopian tubes at fertile times.<p>

<I>The Vagina</I> is an elastic muscle tissue lined with folds of skin.  The walls normally lie close together until they are parted by a tampon, finger or penis and also have to stretch a great deal during childbirth.  The opening of the vagina is surrounded by strong muscle and nerve endings.  The vagina ends at the cervix, (the opening to the uterus).  The vagina is self-cleansing. The normal bacteria that live inside the vagina produce lactic acid that kill contaminating germs that may enter the vagina.  The vagina is moist, with the moistness varying throughout the menstrual cycle and when a women is sexually aroused.<p>

<I>The Penis</I><p>
The glans, or head, of the penis is covered with very thin skin that contains numerous nerve-endings and is therefore very sensitive to touch. At birth the foreskin covers the glans and on its lower side it is tethered to the inner surface by the frenulum. The frenulum is the small piece of skin on the underside of the penis where the glans meets the shaft.  It is also a very sensitive area.<p>

The foreskin may be removed in a procedure known as circumcision.  Circumcision is usually performed at a young age, for religious or hygiene reasons. The skin of the penis is thin and stretchy and loosely attached to the underlying tissues. <p>





</font></td>



<td align=left width=225 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">The penis itself is composed of erectile tissue and is richly supplied with sensory nerves. It is filled with a rich network of blood vessels and three cylindrical areas of spongy tissue.  The spongy tissue remains empty when the penis is flaccid, and it fills during erection.<p>

<I>The Scrotum</I> <p>
The scrotum is the pouch of skin at the root of the penis that holds the testes. For healthy sperm to be produced the testes need to be kept at a temperature lower than the rest of the body. Under the skin of the scrotum is a muscle that contracts in response to cold or exercise, in order to maintain the ideal temperature.

<I>The Testicles</I><p>
The testicles have two functions:

<OL>
<LI>To produce sperm <p>
<LI>To produce male hormones, primarily testosterone.
</OL><p>
Production of sperm continues throughout a man's life, unless there is a problem with infertility.<p>


 <I>The Epididymis</I><p>
When the sperm have been produced they move to a large tube called the Epididymis, where they continue to mature for six weeks.
<p>

<I>The Vas Deferens</I><p>
The Vas Deferens are the tubes that carry sperm from the Epididymis to the urethra and penis.
<p>

<I>The Bladder</I><p>
The bladder holds urine.  There is a valve at the base of the bladder that closes when the penis is erect to prevent urination.
<p>

<I>The Seminal Vesicles</I><p>
The seminal vesicles produce and store semen. The sperm are supported and nourished by this sticky fluid that forms part of the ejaculate.
<p>

<I>The Prostrate Gland</I><p>
The prostate gland is situated just below the neck of the bladder. It produces secretions that form part of the seminal fluid during ejaculation, and pushes the ejaculate (semen and sperm) out of the penis when the man has an orgasm.
<p>


<I>The Cowpers' Gland</I><p>
These glands are on either side of the urethra. They contain a clear alkaline fluid that cleans the urethra of any urine before ejaculation.  This fluid also acts as a lubricant. This fluid is called pre-ejaculate (pre-cum) but may also contain a few sperm.
<p>

<I>The Urethra</I><p>
The urethra is the tube that runs from the bladder and seminal vesicles to the opening at the head of the penis. Semen, urine and pre-ejaculate pass down the urethra.

<p>The G-spot may be a little difficult to find, but some women find the search worth while. The G-spot was identified in the1940s by an obstetrician and gynecologist, Ernst Grafenburg.  The existence of the G-spot has been controversial, but it is now accepted that in some women there is an area inside the vagina that produces intense sexual feelings when stimulated. It is located about 5 cm or 2 inches up the front wall of the vagina.Once located very gentle stimulation gives a pleasant and unusual
sensation.

As a woman becomes sexually excited, her breathing and heart rate increase. Her lips become pink, her pupils dilate and her nipples become erect. If stimulation continues her skin becomes flushed and begins to sweat and the areola around her nipples swell.<p>

The vagina becomes moist with a lubricating fluid secreted from the vaginal walls. The clitoris swells with blood and may extend from underneath it's hood.  As sexual excitement increases, the shape of the vagina changes in readiness for penetration.  The vagina lengthens and swells.

Before orgasm occurs the clitoris retracts beneath the clitoral hood and the vagina contracts rhythmically about 5-10 times. These orgasmic contractions are intensely pleasurable. It may take 10-15 minutes for the color and shape of the vagina to return to normal.<p>

<B>N</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">atural methods of contraception are based on a woman understanding her body well enough to avoid intercourse at her most fertile times during the month. The Temperature, Rhythm, and Ovulation (or Billings) Methods are the most common methods, however, none are very effective and they require more motivation and discipline than other forms of contraception.<P>

The Temperature Method relies on a woman taking her oral, rectal, or vaginal temperature each morning before getting up and before eating or drinking anything. Around the time of ovulation the temperature rises by about 0.3 degrees Celsius or .05 degrees Fahrenheit and remains there for about 14 days of the cycle. There is no warning of ovulation with this method, so it is often difficult to be sure of the fertile time. Intercourse must be avoided until the temperature has been elevated for three days.<P>

The Ovulation or Billings Method is based on the variation of vaginal mucus during the menstrual cycle in parallel with hormonal changes. As ovulation approaches in most women , the cervix produces a slippery, wet mucus much like the raw white of an egg. This lubricative mucus allows the sperm to move more freely and increases the sperm survival rate. On the last day, when the mucus is clear and stretchy, fertility is at its peak. In the Billings guidelines, only half of the days in the cycle are not available for intercourse. Abstinence is required during menstruation and for seven to ten days in mid cycle.<P>

The Rhythm Method is an out-dated method  It should not be used in isolation. The Rhythm Method can be combined with The Temperature Method and The Ovulation or Billings Method. The Rhythm Method works on the fact that ovulation occurs on a single day, ten to sixteen days before menstruation and sperm can live for at least 3 days and possibly longer in fertile mucus. Even women with consistent menstrual cycles suffer from fluctuations in their cycle and so this method is quite risky.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Where to Go?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Counseling by a Doctor, Health Worker or at a Family Planning Clinic is recommended as all of these methods require a high level of motivation, commitment and good communication between partners.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Side Effects?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
There are no chemical side effects to natural contraception methods.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Advantages</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The advantage of natural methods is a better understanding of how a woman's body works. Natural methods cost nothing and are accessible.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Disadvanatges</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Restrictions on or abstinence from intercourse may cause stress or anxiety in a relationship, although other activities, such as non-penetrative sex, are an alternative. Natural methods offer no protection from STDs. There is also an increased risk of pregnancy.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>A</B></font> <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">condom is a fine rubber sheath, made from latex, worn on an erect penis. It prevents semen from entering another person's body and is used for contraception as well as for the prevention of STDs and HIV. Putting on a condom can be fun and could play a part in foreplay. Before using condoms, checking the use-by date on the packet is essential as latex deteriorates over time. The penis must be erect before a condom can be put on. Air must be squeezed out of the condom to allow space for semen and then gently rolled down over the penis as far as it will go. Only water-based lubricants can be used. Oil-based lubricants can weaken the latex, leading to the condom splitting or tearing. After ejaculation, the penis must be withdrawn before the erection is lost. Holding onto the rim of the condom ensures no semen escapes before withdrawal. When removing the condom, care must be taken not to spill any of the semen. Never dispose of the condom in the toilet - throw it in the bin. If used correctly, condoms are 99% effective.
</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Where to Go?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Condoms are freely available at pharmacies, Family Planning clinics, supermarkets, petrol stations, vending machines in pubs, clubs, cafes and discos and by mail order.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Side Effects?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
There are no chemical side effects with condoms - some people may have an allergy to the rubber or the lubricants, but this is rare.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Advantages</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The cost of condoms is low. Some Clinics give them away for free. Condoms allow the man to take responsibility for contraception and safer sex. They are a reliable method of contraception and provide protection from STDs.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Disadvanatges</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
There is a slight reduction in sensitivity experienced by a man when using a condom. Applying a condom can be an interruption to the spontaneity of sex.

The mini-pill or progesterone-only pill. has one hormone and works by changing the mucus at the cervix so that sperm cannot pass through and fertilize the egg. As the pills contain hormones, most women experience what appears to be a period at the end of each cycle. By not taking the pill for seven days each month bleeding occurs. This menstruation-like bleeding is caused by hormone withdrawal. The blood is usually darker in color and has a much lighter flow.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Where to Go?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
A medical check up is necessary for a prescription. The pill is available at pharmacies or Family Planning Clinics.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Side Effects?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
While there are some good and some bad side effects to the pill, many users have no bad side effects from the pill at all. Good side effects include:

<UL>
<LI>regular periods that are shorter and lighter,<p>
<LI>improvement of acne<p>
<LI>improvement or absence of premenstrual syndrome.<p>
</UL>
Bad side effects include:

<UL>
<LI>slight bleeding (called spotting) between periods during early months of use<p>
<LI>weight gain or loss<p>
<LI>brown patches on the face when exposed to sunlight, though this is rare<p>
<LI>mood changes<p>
<LI>enlargement and soreness of the breasts<p>
</UL>
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Advantages</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The combined pill is about 99.5% effective if used as directed. The mini-pill is about 96% effective but must be taken at the same time each day. As the pill is a prescribed contraceptive, a woman must visit a medical practitioner to obtain repeat prescriptions, ensuring she maintains a regular health check regime. The pill is a very easy form of contraception to use.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Disadvantges</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
One of the disadvantages with the pill is the need for safe sex is sometimes dismissed as the chance of pregnancy is decreased. The pill gives no protection against STDs. The pill should not be taken by women who are likely to develop severe vascular (or circulatory) disease, such as those who smoke or have had vascular disease in the past. Blood is much more likely to clot while taking the pill so women with high blood pressure, blood clotting disorders or liver problems should not be using it. The pill introduces chemicals into the body.

They are worn inside the vagina and provide a barrier method of contraception like condoms. Diaphragms and caps cover the cervix, the entrance to the uterus, and prevent sperm entering. There is some debate about the need to use a spermicide with a diaphragm - if spermicide is used, only a small amount is necessary. If too much is applied, the diaphragm may slip out of position.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Where to Go?</B></font><br>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Some women experience heavier periods, which usually settle down after a couple of months, cramps with periods and spotting (or slight bleeding between periods) with an IUD.

IUDs are a reliable method of contraception - Modern IUDs are 98-99% effective. They are relatively cheap, lasting five years or longer depending on the type of IUD. After removal, fertility returns immediately.

<LI>some pain on insertion.<P>
<LI>the IUD can be expelled during heavy periods or cramping<P>
<LI>increased risk of infection in the Fallopian tubes, which can spread more quickly than if not using an IUD.<P>

IUDs are not recommended for women under 25 or women who have not had children.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>A</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"> vasectomy is a surgical procedure leading to sterilization of a man. It is a simple procedure involving cutting, tying and sealing both vas definers, the tubes running from the testes to the urethra and penis. A man is still able to ejaculate but there is no sperm in the semen. Sperm is still produced, but it does not reach the penis.
</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Where to Go?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Vasectomy is a quick, easy surgical procedure carried out under local anesthetic in a doctor's office or at a Family Planning clinic.

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
A vasectomy is a permanent form of contraception. It is about 99.8% effective. Vasectomies can be reversed, but the success rate is low - around 50%. A vasectomy allows the man to take responsibility for contraception.

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Vasectomies provide no protection from STDs.
It is not immediately effective - other forms of contraception are recommended for a period of about two months following the procedure.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>T</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">he female condom, is a polyurethane sheath about 15 cm in length. It is designed to loosely line the inside of the vagina to prevent semen entering the body. At each end of the condom are two flexible rings. At the closed end one of the flexible rings is inserted into the vagina to hold the female condom in place.  A larger, fixed ring stays outside the vulva at the entrance to the vagina.  This ring acts as a guide for penetration and stops the sheath bunching up inside the vagina.
</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Where to Go?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The female condom is available in the UK and the USA, but is not yet available in Australia. It has been approved for use in Australia but has not yet been marketed.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Side Effects?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
There are no side effects to using the female condom.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Advantages</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Polyurethane transmits heat, unlike latex used in condoms, so the female condom is the same temperature as the body. Oil-based lubricants do not damage the polyurethane. The female condom can be an effective method of contraception and it reduces the risk of STDs but its reliability as a contraceptive has not yet been established. Using a female condom gives a woman a contraceptive option that also ensures safe sex. The outer ring can increase sexual pleasure as it rubs against the clitoris. The  female condoms can be inserted anytime before intercourse so that the spontaneity of sex does not need to be interrupted.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Disadvantges</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Female condoms are more expensive than male condoms. There may be a slight reduction in sensitivity and they can be a little noisy. Some people may be put off by their appearance. The female condom may be difficult to insert at first, and the inner ring can cause a little discomfort. It is important for the women to guide the penis into the female condom as it can slip into the vagina outside the condom. Extra lubrication may be necessary to make intercourse easier and more enjoyable.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>D</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">epo-Provera is a type of injectable synthetic hormone that acts as a contraceptive - prevents pregnancy - by preventing ovulation.  A dose of Depo-Provera lasts for 3 months. Injectable synthetic hormones were first used in the 1960s for the treatment of endometriosis and miscarriages.<p>
Depo-Provera is injected deep into the muscles of the back or buttocks. It works by stopping the release of an egg, by changing the cervical mucus to form a barrier to the sperm and by thinning the lining of the womb and preventing the growth of a fertilized egg. The hormone also acts on the fallopian tubes to restrict travel through them by the sperm or egg.

</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Where to Go?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
A full medical examination by a doctor is required prior to prescribing Depo-Provera. Depo-Provera has been used for more than 20 years
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Side Effects?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
In the early stages of Depo-Provera use there will be a change in the menstrual cycle. After two or three injections most women will have no periods at all. Some women may experience spotting, irregular bleeding or occasionally, heavy bleeding. Weight gain or loss may occur. Other problems can include headaches, nervousness and occasionally, depression and loss of libido.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Advantages</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Depo-Provera is a very effective form of contraception. Each injection lasts for 3 months, so there is none of the risk - as with the pill, for example - of forgetting to take it.. It is as effective as the pill and more effective than an IUD or barrier methods. Depo-Provera can reduce the risk of cancer of the ovary and womb, thrush and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) as well as relieve the symptoms of endometriosis.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Disadvantges</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
If side effects occur they generally last for the 3 month period of the injection's efficacy. When Depo-Provera use is stopped, a delay in the return of normal periods and fertility may be experienced. It gives no protection from STDs and introduces chemicals into the body.

The head of the sperm contains the chromosomes, the middle piece supplies the energy, and the tail propels the sperm.  Sperm undergo several changes before they are ready to be ejaculated and take part in the conception process.<P>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">The sperm travel from the testes through the testicular duct system to the 'Epididymis' where they mature. When mature, sperm move from the 'Epididymis' to the ejaculatory duct, remaining there until ejaculation.  Prior to ejaculation, a man's penis becomes erect or 'stiff'. When the penis is placed inside a woman's vagina, it is stimulated. This stimulation most often leads to orgasm in a man.<P>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half3.GIF">At the point of orgasm, a man experiences contraction of the muscles in the base of the penis, lower abdomen and upper thighs and usually 'ejaculates'; or ejects semen from the penis  into the vagina. Ejaculation releases several hundred million sperm of which only one will successfully complete the journey to fertilize the ovum or egg.

<td align=left width=225 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">When the sperm moves from the ejaculatory duct it mixes with the secretions, known as semen, of the seminal vesicles and the prostrate gland. Semen nourishes the sperm and helps to lubricate their movement. Ejaculation most often places the sperm in the vagina near the opening of the uterus (the cervix).  For conception to occur, sperm must travel through the opening of the cervix, into the uterus and then into the fallopian tubes where the sperm is likely to encounter an ovum or egg.<P>

Sperm make this journey by swimming - lashing their tails to propel themselves and moving at a rate of about one or two centimeters per hour. The journey from the cervix to the ovum takes several hours for the sperm to complete. Once a sperm is in the uterus or fallopian tubes, it can live for 5-7 days.  Conception could occur any time during this period, if an ovum is present. The survival rate of sperm throughout the journey to the uterus is extremely low.<P>

Of the hundreds of millions of sperm ejaculated only a few thousand move into the uterus and of these only about fifty reach the ovum.

The eggs are designed to ripen progressively over thirty to forty years, through puberty until menopause. <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">The menstrual cycle lasts for about a month and begins when a hormone released by the pituitary gland stimulates an ovary to start ripening an egg. A woman has two ovaries and its most common for the production of ovum or eggs to alternate from one ovary to the other. <p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half3.GIF">Each cell ripening into an egg is nourished by 5000 other cells that will themselves never ripen. The single-cell becomes a follicle and is released by the ovary as a fully mature egg or 'ovum'.  It is usual for only one cell to become a fully developed ovum for release in one particular menstrual cycle.<p>

<td align=left width=225 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
At the time of ovulation, the follicle, filled with fluid under pressure which causes its wall to become thin, protrudes from the surface of the ovaries. The egg becomes detached within the follicle and floats freely in the fluid.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half4.GIF">At ovulation, the follicle wall breaks through the ovary's surface and the ovum or egg is released into the fallopian tube in a stream of fluid. Once the egg has entered the fallopian tube it begins its migration to the uterus.  The ovum takes three days to migrate a distance of between eight and thirteen centimeters from the fallopian tube to the uterus. The ovum has no means of self propulsion. It is moved along by the stream of fluid within the fallopian tube and the waving of branch like arms in the wall of the fallopian tubes. If the egg is not fertilized it will be expelled from the body in the subsequent menstrual flow.  The egg only lives for 12 to 24 hours after release from the ovary.

This is not always a sure sign because some women have irregular periods. Some other early signs of pregnancy may be unexpected tiredness, a prickling feeling in the breasts or passing urine more often. Feelings of nausea in the morning or late afternoon are also a good indication of pregnancy but  nausea can occur at any time during the day.

So when a woman misses a menstrual period she cannot be sure she's pregnant.  She should confirm this by having a  pregnancy test. The tests work on the fact that after conception, hormone levels increase and as early as ten days after missing a period these increased hormone levels can be detected in the urine and the blood of the mother to be.<p>

There are three ways to test for pregnancy.  Urine tests are simple and are available in a do it yourself kit or can be done by a doctor.



</font></td>



<td align=left width=225 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">Blood Tests are more accurate and the results have a ninety-eight per cent accuracy rate as early as two weeks after missing a period. Ultrasound is the external examination of the woman's abdomen using sound waves to detect any changes in shapes inside the body. Ultrasound is most commonly used to examine the health and formation of the embryo or fetus and is also capable of detecting pregnancy after ten days of missing a period.  Ultrasound can detect twins after three weeks and detect the  baby's organs after eight weeks. <p>

Ultrasound is not usually a test for pregnancy, and is only used in difficult diagnostic circumstances.  Ultrasound except in unusual circumstances is not recommended  until 16 weeks of pregnancy to detect abnormalities.

During the first eight weeks of pregnancy the growing organism is known as an &quot;embryo&quot;.  From the beginning of the ninth week until birth it is known as a &quot;fetus&quot;.  In the first two weeks following fertilization, the egg burrows into the uterine lining reaching the blood vessels and nutrients below. A layer of cells forms across the cavity left by the burrowing egg and this forms  the &quot;embryonic disk&quot; in which the embryo will grow.<p>

The cells surrounding the "embryonic disk&quot; will develop into the fetal membranes and the placenta, which becomes the  embryos lifeline to the mother. The fetal membranes form a sac filled with fluid in which the fetus will float and be protected until birth. The placenta sustains the life of the embryo and fetus by providing nutrients and oxygen and by carrying away fetal waste.<p>

As the embryo develops, the flow of nutrients and oxygen takes place through the umbilical cord which connects the fetal circulatory system to the placenta. The blood of the mother and the fetus are separated by the placental membrane.  The placental membrane also prevents some harmful substances from being transferred to the fetus. <p>

This barrier is NOT effective against drugs and many infectious agents such as syphilis and HIV. In the third week, the embryonic disk forms three distinct layers  These layers will develop into:

<OL>
<LI>the internal organs;<p>
<LI>the muscles, skeleton and blood; and<p>
<LI>the brain, nerves, skin and other tissues.<p>
</OL>
The head of the embryo develops faster than the rest of the body and by the end of the third week the eyes and the ears are developing and the brain and other portions of the central nervous system are beginning to form. <p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">By the end of the first month the embryo has a basic heart and the beginnings of a digestive system. In the fifth week, arms and legs begin to form.  Between weeks six and eight fingers and toes develop and  bones begin to harden with calcium. <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half3.GIF">By the end of eight weeks the beginnings of all essential structures are in place and by four months the major organs are well formed.<p>

<I>The Mother in the First Trimester</I><br>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half4.GIF">The effects of pregnancy may vary in intensity from woman to woman.  However, in the early stages, fatigue and drowsiness are common, along with occasional nausea. A woman may also be prone to mood swings from delight, satisfaction and anticipation to worry, anger and depression, depending on her desire to have a baby.

<I>Life as a Fetus</I><p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half1.GIF">During the second trimester, internal organ systems mature and there is a significant increase in the size of the fetus. By the end of the sixth month, the fetus weighs about two pounds or nearly one kilogram and is about fourteen inches or thirty-five centimeters long.  <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">Among other changes, the fetus has developed a fine coat of hair on the body.  By the end of this trimester the facial and bodily features are well formed.  At this stage, the fetus now has periods of waking and sleeping and it will react to sudden movement by the Mother and to loud noises outside the Mother's body.<p>

<I>The Mother in the Second Trimester</I><p>

The pregnant woman may also experience some discomfort during second trimester. Pressure from the expanding uterus may lead to indigestion, constipation; and varicose veins and hemorrhoids may appear or worsen.  This is however more common in the third trimester. Many women gain weight at this time and may also experience fluid retention causing swelling of the feet and ankles.

<I>The Fetus Matures</I><p>



<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half1.GIF">The third trimester is a period of further development and growth for the fetus. The fetus is developing well enough to survive on its own and the baby born by the middle of the final trimester or six weeks early has a seventy to eighty per cent chance of survival.<p>



<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">Early in the third trimester the fetus is in an upright or "breech" position and will most likely assume a  "head down" position ready for birth by the end of the trimester. During the final month of the pregnancy the fetus develops the lungs in readiness for outside life, unsupported by the Mother's body. Although size and weight varies significantly, at birth  the "average" baby weighs seven and a half pounds or nearly three and a half kilos and is twenty inches or about fifty centimeters in length.

.<p>



<I>The Mother in the Third Trimester</I><p>



<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half3.GIF">A woman feels many discomforts in the third trimester and most of these are due to the increased size of the fetus which displaces and presses on the mother's organs. The occasional fetal movement or "kicking" of the second trimester has now changed into constant kicking, tossing and turning which can leads to discomfort and sleepless nights for the mother. By the ninth month of pregnancy some women may become anxious about many things including the sex and health of the baby through to the delivery process and associated pain and trauma.

only one possibility in a whole range of sexual positions. No one position is
better than another. It is simply a matter of personal choice for each partner.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>A</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"> man's capacity to get and maintain an erection decreases gradually as he ages. The penis shape and erection angle vary from man to man: there is no normal shape or size and the average erection is roughly horizontal from the body.<p>

Most men cannot reach orgasm more than once in about an hour and most have between 1 and 4 orgasms per week, depending on their age.  Men don't 'come in buckets' - usually they ejaculate about a teaspoon-full upon climax.<p>

Most women require more than penile penetration to reach orgasm - 'thrusting' alone is usually not enough: clitoral stimulation and foreplay are usually more important.<p>

A woman's natural lubrication cannot be turned on like a tap - it needs desire, stimulation and a little time, and on those occasions when the woman is 'drier' than usual, a water-based artificial lubricant is a normal adjunct to enjoyable lovemaking.<p>

Some of the most important discoveries sexual partners can make about each other during sex is through talking - finding out what excites and arouses them, what are turn-offs, what are fears and anxieties, what are fantasies, how vigorous their sex could be.<p>

Find out about each other and take sex further by having a shared knowledge about the kind of sensual lovemaking that appeals to you both. Sexual and emotional needs vary from person to person: some people are happy in monogamous relationships, others have a desire for more than one partner.<p>

Masturbation in front of your partner (with her/his agreement and encouragement) or together (mutual masturbation) can be a turn-on for both partners and is a valid and very enjoyable part of lovemaking.<p>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>M</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">any of our sexual problems and hang-ups that aren't caused physically (For example, through illness or injury) come from social conditioning - interaction with our peers as they talk about their sexual exploits, and exposure to sexual myths and fantasies in the media.<p>

With better education, our expectations about many things in our lives - including sex - increase. Our partner expects more from us, we expect more from our partner; we see and read about sexual role models on billboards, television, cinema screens and in magazines and popular novels.<p>

We talk and hear more about sex - we know things about our friends and the famous, that we would never have contemplated hearing about even 20 years ago.
This exposure to information is not necessarily a bad thing.  It demonstrates that our society is feeling more relaxed about sex as a natural and enjoyable part of life.
But having this information becomes a problem if we feel we can't compete with the sexual 'standards' that now abound.<p>

There have been many changes over the last 2 decades in the way men and women relate to each other: women, quite rightly, expect more from men, women are encouraged to be more 'up-front' and men are encouraged to discover the 'feminine' side of their character.

Both sexes find themselves conforming to or reacting against these new sets of standards. Gay activism has made it easier for homosexual and bisexual men and women to express their sexuality. The question is raised however - 'where do I fit in?'<p>

Many causes of sexual problems can be traced back to when we were young. A strict or deeply religious home life can make us feel embarrassed, shy or even afraid of thinking about or exploring sex and our bodies. Some people believe, mistakenly, that it is 'dirty' to derive pleasure from touching and feeling your own body, let alone someone else's. Others, particularly those who have been sexually abused, suppress sexual feelings or think about sex in a non-pleasurable way.<p>

People whose sexual self-esteem is low approach sex with the feeling that they will not be good at it, or will not be able to give, or even experience, sexual pleasure. Many of us <B>think</B>  too much during sex, rather than 'going with the flow' and allowing true sexual feelings to take over.<p>

Sometimes our problems involve unresolved or pent-up anger, suspicions or guilt - are we sleeping with the right person? Are we cheating? Is our partner cheating? Am I good enough? Is he/she good enough?<p>

Sexual problems within a relationship may also have non-sexual causes: worries about finance, children, problems at work - these difficulties need to be worked out before any sexual problems can be dealt with.<p>

Some partners have non-complementary libidos - she 'wants it' all the time, he wants it occasionally - or vice versa. Some partners place unachievable expectations on the other partner: to come quickly and often; to enjoy every position, to 'lie there and take it', to do it at any hour, to do it better. Some people draw inappropriate comparisons between their partner and the sexual prowess of ex-lovers or even fantasy characters depicted in fiction or pornography.<p>

There are some people whose sexual problem is that they think they have no sexual problems. They regard themselves as studs, good in bed; yet often they don't take the time to make sure their partner is enjoying the sexual experience, sex for them is a one-way street.<p>

Nearly everyone experiences some form of sexual problem at some stage, but unresolved sexual problems and hang-ups can compound - one bad sexual encounter can amplify and affect another, until finally we may have fears about every potential sexual encounter and this fear can become a pattern.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Chlamydia is a bacterial infection of the genitals, anus or throat. It is similar to, but often more serious than gonorrhea.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Symptoms can occur within 2-14 days after the infection, however most people show no signs for months or years. If a woman has symptoms they may include a change in her vaginal secretions, lower abdominal pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Men may have a urethral discharge, pain when urinating or urethral irritation. Inflammation of the male urethra caused by chlamydia is known as non-specific urethritis, NSU or more recently as non-gonoccocal urethrititis, NGU. Inflammation of a woman's cervix is known as cervicitis.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diagnosis in women requires analysis of a cervical smear and in men, an examination of the discharge from the penis under a microscope.

If left untreated in women, CHLAMYDIA may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease or PID, an inflammation of the fallopian tubes. PID may cause an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, infertility or chronic pelvic pain. Men may develop epididymitis, an inflammation in the scrotum, chronic urethral irritation, or chronic testicular discomfort. It may also cause infertility in men.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Genital warts are caused by a group of viruses called the human papilloma viruses or HPV. The warts form on, in  or around the genitals and anus. There are over 60 different types of HPV - so far only 14 have been found to cause warts in the genital area.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The only symptoms of infection are the warts themselves. Genital warts vary in size and shape and are similar in appearance to plantar warts. They are typically hard and yellow-gray when formed on dry skin and tend to be pink, soft and take on a cauliflower appearance in moist areas like the lower vagina.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diagnosis of genital warts is generally made by a clinical inspection of the warts.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Freezing the warts (cryotherapy) with liquid nitrogen is the preferred choice of removal. One alternative treatment involves painting the warts with a special  alcohol-based solution over a period of several days, causing them to dry up and fall off. The solution is not recommended for warts that form on the cervix or during pregnancy. The warts may also be surgically removed or burnt off by a doctor using electrodes or laser. Although the warts can be physically removed, treatment does not eliminate the virus from the body, so the warts may recur.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
HPV, the virus that causes genital warts, is generally transmitted by sexual contact. The incubation period may vary from a few weeks to a couple of years. The virus can be passed to infants from their mother during birth.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Genital warts in themselves are not dangerous, but different forms of the HPV virus have been linked with cervical and penile cancers. HPV has been found in the reproductive tract of at least 85% of women with pre cancerous lesions of the cervix and also in women with abnormalities of the cervix.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
No vaccine for Human papilloma  or HPV exists. The use of condoms may reduce the risk of transmission but much depends on where the warts are located. For safety, it is best to avoid all sexual contact until the warts are removed and the area has healed.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection. It is one of the most common types of STD that affects both men and women. Once infected, gonorrhea grows and multiplies quickly in the moist, warm areas of the cervix, urinary tract, mouth or rectum.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Occasionally there are no symptoms.<p>

If symptoms do develop, they usually appear within 2 - 10 days of intimate sexual contact and are often mild. The initial symptoms in women include a painful or burning sensation when urinating, or a yellowish vaginal discharge. More advanced symptoms include abdominal pain, bleeding between periods, vomiting or fever. Men usually have a discharge from the penis and experience a burning sensation, sometimes severe, during urination. Symptoms of rectal infection include discharge, anal itching and in some cases, painful bowel movements.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diagnosis involves normal bacterial testing under laboratory conditions. The tests are more accurate for men than for women. The accuracy in male diagnosis is more than 90%, falling to about 66% for women.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Antibiotics are recommended for the treatment of Gonorrhea. The patient must take the full course and revisit their doctor or clinic for a follow-up examination. All sexual partners should be tested and treated, even if they show no signs of the infection.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Gonorrhea is transmitted by vaginal, anal or oral sex. It can also pass from an infected mother to her newborn baby during childbirth causing eye infection.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
If left untreated, gonorrhea will seriously affect the bloodstream, joints, heart valves or the brain. In women there is threat of pelvic inflammatory disease or PID, which can cause scarring of the fallopian tubes and infertility.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The use of condoms during sexual activities is an effective method of preventing infection. Diaphragms and spermicidal foams, creams and jellies containing Nonoxynol-9 may also reduce the risk, but they are best used in conjunction with a condom. There is no build-up of immunity to gonorrhea - it can be acquired more than once.</font></td>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Pediculosis pubis, pubic lice or crabs are tiny crab-like creatures that live in pubic hair and, sometimes, in other hair below the neck. Pubic lice feed on blood. The crab fixes its mouth against the skin and stabs an opening through which to feed. Its saliva stops the blood from clotting and, as the victim's heart pumps, blood is pumped into the crab's stomach.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The main symptom of pubic lice is an itch caused by an allergic reaction to the bites. Blue marks may appear on the skin from the feeding lice and black spots of digested blood in lice excreta become evident in underwear.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diagnosis is usually visual.  In the adult stage, pubic lice are large enough to be seen by the naked eye.


</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Shaving or the use of insecticides do not kill the eggs of pubic lice. The best treatments are medically prescribed and applied to all hairy areas below the neck and washed off 12 hours later.  Treatments may be available over the counter from chemist shops. Some treatments are not recommended for pregnant or breast-feeding women. All clothes and bedclothes must be washed on the hot cycle and dried on the hot cycle or dry cleaned to ensure the eggs are destroyed.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Pubic lice are generally spread sexually but may also be transmitted by contact with an infested towel, bedding or, in rare cases, a toilet seat. While 'crabs' can only survive for about 24 hours without a host, the eggs may lay in bedding or towels and can take up to seven days to hatch.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
'Crabs' are more a nuisance than a disease. Because the body has no natural defense against such parasites, the infestation will not disappear on its own, so appropriate treatment should be sought.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
A person with crabs should ensure that people with whom they have been in close contact, particularly sexual contact, are treated to avoid infestation.

Syphilis is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection. It can also be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her unborn child.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Syphilis progresses through several stages, each of which has characteristic symptoms. In the first or primary stage, a painless ulcer appears at the site of infection 2-4 weeks after contact. In women, the ulcer usually forms on the vaginal walls or on the cervix. It may also appear on the labia. In men, the ulcer usually forms on the tip of the penis or sometimes on the scrotum or the penile shaft. If the mode of transmission is oral, the ulcer may appear on the lips or tongue. If infected during anal sex, the rectum may become the site for the ulcer. The ulcer disappears after a few weeks. If the infection is not treated, syphilis will remain within the body. The secondary stage begins a few weeks to a few months later. It is indicated by the appearance of a skin rash consisting of painless, reddish raised bumps that later darken and burst, oozing a discharge.<p>

Other symptoms include sores in the mouth, painful swelling of the joints, sore throat, headache and fever - much like flu. The infection is contagious during the primary stage and for several years into the secondary stage. When the symptoms disappear and the infection enters a latent stage, it may lie dormant for 1 to 40 years. The offending bacteria continue to multiply during this stage and burrow into the circulatory system, central nervous system and bones.<p>

The disease often progresses to a late or tertiary stage causing large ulcers to form on the digestive organs, liver, lungs, skin, muscle tissue or other organs. While this ulcer can be destructive, it can be successfully treated. Serious damage can occur when the infection attacks the cardiovascular system or the central nervous system. The damage to the central nervous system can cause brain damage and result in paralysis or a form of deteriorating mental illness.<p>

Often the primary and secondary symptoms disappear so patients assume, incorrectly, they are no longer infected. If diagnosed at either the primary or secondary stages, there is time to treat the disease. Once it reaches the tertiary stage  the consequences can be dire if the disease remains untreated.

Broad spectrum antibiotic treatments are recommended. Pregnant women should be treated with specific antibiotics. Periodic repeat blood tests are recommended to ensure the infection has been arrested. Like gonorrhea, successful treatment does not prevent re infection. All sex partners should be told of an infection and seek the advice of a doctor.

If untreated, syphilis lapses into a latent phase during which the patient is no longer contagious. Many people will suffer no more consequences of the disease. However, 15% to 40% of people infected with Syphilis go on to develop the complications of tertiary syphilis where the bacteria damages the heart, eyes, brain, nervous system, bones and joints. The final stage can lead to mental illness, blindness, heart disease and death.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Thrush or Candidiasis is caused by a yeast usually present in the mouth or bowel of men and women called Candida albicans. Yeasts thrive in  warm, moist environments. Mostly, thrush is harmless. Occasionally it multiplies and causes an infection. Thrush is not considered  a sexually transmitted infection.  About  25% of women carry Candida in the vagina generally without symptoms.  Semen can affect the pH in the vagina and trigger an infection. In men, the infection often takes the form of an infection of the genital skin.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
When symptoms occur in women, they usually affect the vulva and vagina, causing itching and a thick white discharge. There may also be swelling of the vulva and pain when passing urine. 'Thrush' is one of the commonest causes of an abnormal vaginal discharge. When symptoms occur in men, they involve itching and burning during urination, or a reddening of the penis.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diagnosis is usually made on the basis of symptoms. A microscopic examination of vaginal or penile fluids may be used to detect the presence of yeast cells.

</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Vaginal tablets or cream containing anti fungal agents inserted into the vagina are an effective treatment. An anti fungal cream should also be applied to the vulva. A tampon dipped in cold unflavoured yogurt and inserted into the vagina can relieve the itching. The yogurt must contain live lactobacilli to balance the acidity within the vagina. The treatment for men with thrush is the application of a cream rubbed into the penis after showering.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Most infections are believed to be caused by an overgrowth of the 'yeast' normally found in the vagina, and not usually by sexual transmission. The fungus may be transmitted sexually - but this is unusual. The fungus can also be transmitted by sharing a moist towel or washcloth. The use of antibiotics  pregnancy, diabetes, stress, wearing tight clothing or nylon underwear may also increase the risk of thrush. Basically anything that keeps the genitals warm and moist will increase the risk of thrush.

</font><p>







<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Women should avoid products which can irritate the skin such as perfumed and non-perfumed soaps, vaginal deodorants and disinfectants. Always wash and wipe from front to back to avoid contaminating the vulva with yeasts that may be present in the bowel.<p>

Recurrence is common, so sexual partners must be told if their partner suffers from thrush as the infection can be passed back and forth, either sexually or by sharing towels.<p>

Some people believe that eating yogurt with live lactobacilli may reduce the recurrence of yeast infections.  Tablets containing lactobacilli are also available.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Vaginitis is a general term that refers to any form of vaginal inflammation. Different types of vaginitis are caused by different micro-organisms. There are three types of vaginitis:

<UL>
<LI>Bacterial vaginosis<p>
<LI>Candidiasis or thrush	and<p>
<LI>Trichomonias, caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis <p>
</UL>
Bacterial vaginosis or BV is the most common form of vaginitis, followed by Candidiasis and Trichomoniasis.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Most women have no symptoms. The most prominent symptom is a thin foul-smelling discharge from the vagina, often described as fishy or musty. The smell can be worse after sexual intercourse. A small number of women also experience soreness of the vulva.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diagnosis is usually on clinical symptoms and microscopic examination of the discharge or an accurate diagnosis can be determined by growing cultures from vaginal secretions.

</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
There are many treatments, but a single dose of antibiotics is usually given for bacterial vaginosis.  Anti-bacterial creams or vaginal tablets, are also available for  these infections

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Vaginitis is not always sexually transmitted. Sexually active women are at no greater risk than women who have not had sex at all. The infections are generally the result of an imbalance in the bacteria occurring naturally in the vagina. This imbalance can be brought about by stress, allergic reactions or semen. Yeast infections can also be passed from one woman to another through sex or by sharing damp towels and washcloths.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
While only women can have vaginal infections, the microbes causing them may also cause problems for men.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Trichomoniasis or 'trich' is a sexually transmitted disease caused by a single-celled parasite.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Like many STDs, trich often occurs without symptoms. When symptoms do occur they invariably do so within 4 to 20 days of exposure. They may also occur years after infection. In women, symptoms can include a heavy, yellow-green or gray vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, discomfort during sexual intercourse and painful urination. Sometimes, itching of the external genital area also occurs. In men, there may be a whitish discharge from the penis and painful or difficult urination. Most infections in men cause no symptoms at all.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Trich in women is usually diagnosed by microscopic examination of a small amount of vaginal fluid. It can also be diagnosed by a cervical smear. The most accurate diagnosis in men is made by growing a culture from a sample of fluid from the penis.

</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Most men recover from Trichomoniasis without treatment within a few weeks. There are medically prescribed drugs available. As the infection may have been transmitted to a partner, the prescribed medication should be taken by both partners. The prescribed medication  should not be taken during the first three months of pregnancy.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Trichomoniasis is mainly spread by sexual intercourse. The organism can survive for a few hours in vaginal fluid, semen or urine, on damp towels, washcloths or bed clothes. It is rarely passed onto babies during birth.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Although Trichomoniasis poses no great threat to health, it often occurs along with other STDs such as gonorrhea. It is important for a person with trich to be checked out for other infections.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Most  men and women, experience no symptoms when infected with Trichomoniasis, so the infection is easily passed back and forth. A condom is recommended during sexual intercourse.

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, has a number of causes including alcohol, chemicals, drugs and infection by one of four viruses: Hepatitis A, B, C and D. Hepatitis A is found in the saliva, blood, faeces and urine. Hepatitis B and C are passed by sexual contact, including anal or oral sex and can be passed non-sexually by blood transfusion, shared razors, toothbrushes, needles or similar personal effects. Hepatitis D is transmitted through the transfusion of contaminated blood, blood products or through sexual contact.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
<I>Hepatitis A:
</I><br>
The virus can take from 10 to 50 days before any symptoms are obvious. Not everyone becomes ill. When symptoms appear they include nausea, a slight increase in temperature, some loss of weight and a yellow coloring. The yellow is most noticeable in the eyes. There may be some tenderness just below the ribs on the right side of the body where the liver is.<p>

<I>Hepatitis B:
</I><br>
As with A, there may be no symptoms. Some people show symptoms in six weeks, others six months after being infected. The Symptoms are similar to hepatitis A - nausea, a slight increase in temperature, some loss of weight and a yellow coloring.<p>

<I>Hepatitis C and D: </I><br>

These two viruses take up to 50 days after infection to show any symptoms. If there are any symptoms, they are similar to those for Hepatitis A and B.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
All of the hepatitis viruses are diagnosed through blood tests.
</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
There is no medical treatment for hepatitis A, B, C, or D. Rest, good diet, avoidance of alcohol and other substances that affect the liver helps speed recovery. Some cases of chronic hepatitis B and C can be treated with frequent injections of alpha interferon over several months. Vaccine immunization is available.

Hepatitis A is most commonly spread in food or water  contaminated with infected human faeces. It is common in countries without sophisticated sewerage systems. Hepatitis is spread from person to person by contact with faeces and urine. This can happen in sexual activities where infected secretions come in contact with the mouth. The virus may also be present on a used condom, so it is important to wash your hands after its removal. Eating uncooked infested shellfish is another means of transmission. Hepatitis B is spread the same way as HIV - by sex, blood or from mother to baby. Unlike HIV, hepatitis B also spreads through body secretions and is much more infectious. The virus is found in blood, vaginal secretions, semen, faeces, breast milk, fluid from cuts and sores, saliva, sweat and tears. Hepatitis B can also be spread by contaminated instruments used in ear-piercing, tattooing, acupuncture or by sharing razors or needles. It is most likely to be transmitted to health workers in contact with the blood or secretions of infected patients. It can also be transmitted by sharing toothbrushes, razors or other personal items that may lead to the exchange of bodily secretions such as blood and saliva.<p>

Hepatitis C is spread through contact with contaminated blood and, in some circumstances ,by sexual intercourse with an infected person. It is a very recent form of hepatitis and blood tests to detect the virus are not conclusive. Hepatitis D is less common than B, but is also a dangerous and sexually transmissible infection. It can be spread by contaminated blood. Hepatitis D is a tiny virus with the potential to infect someone who already has hepatitis B. If both infections occur at the same time, severe illness resulting in liver failure, can occur.

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
There are no long term complications involved with Hepatitis A. Hepatitis A does not recur and sufferers do not become carriers. Hepatitis B, C, and D are not so innocuous. Not only are they highly infectious but they are damaging. About 5% of hepatitis B sufferers never recover and can become carriers who remain infectious. With Hepatitis B, C, and D, the liver bleeds profusely stopping the manufacture of proteins. Some patients die, others live with chronic liver disease. Hepatoma or cancer of the liver can also occur.<p>

Persistent hepatitis B infection can also include kidney or blood vessel disease and other chronic medical conditions. Past Hepatitis B carriers who become HIV positive may have a recurrence of Hepatitis B, and are more likely to become chronic carriers. Up to half of the people who catch hepatitis C are thought to develop liver problems. A person who has cleared Hepatitis B from their body is immune to Hepatitis D and cannot be infected by the Hepatitis D virus.

If traveling to a country where Hepatitis A is common, have a medically supervised injection of immunoglobulin prior to departure. Hepatitis B vaccines are available from doctors and Family Planning clinics. Use condoms for penetrative sex.  Always wash hands after sexual activity.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Genital Herpes is a contagious viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). While there is no cure, it is manageable. Two types of virus can cause genital herpes: HSV type 2 and type1. Type 1 more commonly causes oral herpes, known as cold sores but it can cause genital herpes as well.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Symptoms of a first episode occur within two to ten days of exposure to the virus and last an average of two to three weeks. The early symptoms can include pain in the legs, buttocks or genital area, vaginal discharge or a feeling of pressure in the abdominal region. Within a few days, sores or lesions appear on the penis, the vulva, inside the vagina or around the anus. Sores can also appear on the buttocks, thighs or internally, on the woman's cervix or male urinary passage. Over a period of days the sores become crusted and heal without scarring. Symptoms often accompanying a first infection can include fever, headache, muscle aches, painful or difficult urination and swollen glands. Some people experience no symptoms but still have the lesions and arestill infectious. <p>

A recurrent outbreak of genital herpes may be signaled by a tingling sensation in the genital area or pain in the buttocks, legs or wherever the site of infection is. Recurrent infections are usually milder and shorter than the initial episode.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The most accurate test is a viral culture. It may take several laboratory tests to distinguish the virus from other infections. The sores of genital herpes in its active stage are usually visible to the naked eye.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Anti viral agents are effective in treating an initial episode of genital herpes. Since recurrent attacks are less severe, anti viral creams can be used. There are a few important steps to speed healing and avoid the spread of infection to other sites, and to other people. To prevent the development of secondary infections, keep the infected area clean and dry. Bathe the area with warm, salty water. Use simple analgesics to relieve pain. Try to avoid touching the sores. If this is unavoidable, hands should be washed immediately. Sexual contact should be avoided from the first recognized symptom through to the sores being completely healed.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Genital herpes is usually acquired through sexual contact with someone who has an outbreak of herpes sores. People with oral herpes can transmit the infection to the genital area of a partner during oral-genital sex. In some cases it can be transmitted by a person who has no noticeable symptoms. It is unlikely the virus can be spread by contact with an object such as a toilet seat.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Genital herpes can be a risk to a newborn baby if the mother has an outbreak at the time of childbirth, particularly if this outbreak is a primary infection. If the baby is infected while passing through the birth canal, the virus may cause blindness, brain damage or even death. If a woman has a past history of the virus, she and her doctor should be aware that if herpes lesions are present at the time of delivery a Cesarean should be performed. If a woman contracts herpes for the first time during a pregnancy, she increases the risk of miscarriage or premature delivery. There is also risk of passing the virus on to the unborn child. Recurrent episodes do not appear to carry the same level of risk.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
It is wise to avoid genital contact until the sores have healed completely. The HSV-2 virus cannot pass through a condom. If you must have intercourse during an outbreak use of a condom as well as a spermicide containing Nonoxynol-9 is recommended. Nonoxynol-9 has shown to be toxic to the herpes virus in laboratory tests. There is no guarantee a condom will not break or fall off, and it may not cover all of the exposed areas. Regular sleeping habits, avoiding unnecessary stress, avoiding excessive exposure to the sun and taking good care of general health can reduce recurring outbreaks.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Pelvic inflammatory disease is one of the most serious and common complications associated with STDs. PID is an infection of the upper genital tract and can affect the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes or other related areas. It can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) and can lead to infertility, tubal pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain and other serious conditions.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The major symptoms of PID are lower abdominal pain, discharge from the cervix or vagina and fever. As with most STDs, the symptoms may not be obvious. If associated with chlamydia, there may be no symptoms at all but serious damage can occur  to the pelvic organs.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Symptoms alone are not enough to diagnose PID. Laboratory tests may aid the diagnosis but a laparoscopy is usually performed to confirm PID. Laparoscopy involves a small incision under the navel into which a lighted tube is inserted to view the internal organs. A tissue sample may be taken if necessary.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
A number of organisms can cause pelvic inflammatory disease. It is, therefore, difficult to determine which organisms cause the infection, so broad spectrum antibiotics are usually administered. Hospitalization may be necessary if the symptoms are severe and if tubal pregnancy or other abdominal problems are suspected. Pregnant patients are also hospitalized.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
PID occurs when disease-causing organisms move towards the reproductive organs from the vagina and the cervix. The cervix usually acts as a barrier to infection by producing mucus which flows down into the vagina. Abortion, miscarriage, childbirth, use of an IUD or surgical procedures such as a curette can cause infection to break through the cervical barrier. Most cases are associated with gonorrhea and chlamydia. Infections are thought to attach themselves to sperm during intercourse, enabling travel into the uterus and fallopian tubes. The organisms may also gain easier access during menstruation.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
PID can be a recurrent infection in many women. The long-term consequences include infertility, tubal pregnancy or chronic pelvic pain. Complications can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Use of condoms during sexual intercourse may reduce the risk of PID. Always  be aware of the symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease. Each recurrence of PID increases the risk of infertility.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>U</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">sing needles or fits to inject drugs means that a needle is inserted into the body. When the needle is extracted, some blood is drawn back up into the hollow core of the needle and into the syringe. If a second person uses the needle without cleaning it, blood from the first user comes in contact with the blood of the second user. Sharing uncleaned needles can result in injecting the HIV virus directly into the bloodstream.<p>

There is a misunderstanding about the way HIV is transmitted intravenously. It is not from the drugs - injecting anything, pills, smack, coke, speed, steroids or even water can transmit the virus if the needle is shared. It's not what you use, it's how you use it.<p>

The best option for safety is to use a new fit everytime. These  are available at pharmacies or needle exchange centres. Get rid of used fits safely. Do not dump them in parks, at beaches or in the street. Cap the fit and deposit it into a strong unbreakable container with a lid, like coffee jar or drink bottle and put the container in a rubbish bin. If a new needle is not available, it is possible to clean a used one. The cleaning  procedure must be followed to the letter and performed immediately before use, every time, regardless of whose needle it is. HIV is a fragile virus, easily destroyed by heat, soap, bleach and other disinfectants. It can live for up to 4 hours in blood left in a syringe, rinsing water, filter or on a spoon. The most effective way of cleaning a fit is to rinse well in clean, cold water until all traces of blood are gone, then rinse it again for safety. Draw water through the needle into the syringe making sure the barrel is full and squirt it down the drain. Repeat the process using fresh water each time. Shake the syringe with water in it to remove any blood debris. Make sure the entire needle, not just the tip, is covered in water. Completely fill the needle and syringe with full strength household bleach. Shake the syringe for at least 30 seconds before emptying - do this at least twice. Rinse the syringe at least twice with clean, cold water - more is always best. Repeat the process if there is any sign of blood in the syringe or if unsure about how effective the cleaning has been. After injecting, rinse the fit with clean, cold water immediately. Water and bleach should never be re-used - pour them down the drain. Never swallow or inject the bleach, it won't kill the HIV in the body but will cause much pain.<p>

It must be stressed that cleaning cannot be 100% guaranteed to kill HIV and Hepatitis, but it is far better to clean than not to. The best option is to always use a new needle and syringe every time you use one. The cleaning method described should only be used if new sterilized needles are unavailable.

There is no way to be 100% sure that HIV or other STDs will not be spread but safe sex practices have been shown to be highly effective in the prevention of HIV and STD transmission. Safe sex means taking precautions to stop semen or pre-ejaculate (pre-cum), blood or vaginal fluid from one person getting into the bloodstream of another person.<p>

Abstinence, or no sex at all, is obviously safe. Kissing does not involve semen, vaginal fluids or blood so is safe - unless both partners have sores, open cuts or bleeding gums. Massage, stroking and mutual masturbation are all forms of sexual enjoyment with only skin to skin contact, and will not pass on HIV. The only risks with mutual masturbation are cuts or sores on the hands, penis or vaginal area coming into contact with infected semen or vaginal fluids - latex gloves can be worn if needed or broken skin covered with plasters.

<td align=left width=300 valign=top> <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Studies show that oral sex is a low risk activity for HIV, although it is safest to avoid semen or menstrual blood in the mouth, particularly if there are cuts, sores on the lips, mouth infections or bleeding gums. Barriers such as condoms or latex 'dams' can be used. A dental dam is a thin piece of latex which is be placed over the vagina or anal area during oral sex. Rimming, or oral-anal contact, is a low-risk activity as far as HIV is concerned but is a risk for hepatitis. A 'dam', or condom split into a square is recommended.<p>

Penis-vagina and penis-anus sex are safe when condoms are used properly. Condoms offer the best protection against HIV and other STDs.

If you don't take responsibility, you could catch a sexually transmitted disease, including HIV. Taking responsibility involves communication and negotiation. At some stage most of us will be faced with a situation where the introduction of a condom may seem difficult. Just remember HIV/AIDS can affect us all - it does not discriminate.<p>

People who insist on condom use are not suggesting a partner sleeps around or is dirty. They simply want to enjoy their health and live. Don't make assumptions about your partner. Having unprotected sex with someone is having sex with every person with whom they have had unprotected sex.

<td align=left width=300 valign=top> <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
No one knows the sexual or drug-taking history of the people with whom they have had sex. There is no excuse for not using a condom. Everyone should make a conscious effort to be prepared for any situation.<p>
Women should not feel they are an 'easy lay' because they carry condoms, and men should not be seen as expecting sex because they carry them. Just be prepared.
Making the decision beforehand will ensure safer, more enjoyable sex.

Anyone who is sexually active is at risk of contracting an STD. STDs affect men and women of all backgrounds and socio-economic levels, but are most prevalent among teenagers and young adults.<p>

Nearly one third of all cases involve teenagers. The incidence of STDs in young people is rising because sexual activity is occurring at an earlier age.  Young people are also more likely to have more than one partner and frequently change partners. There is no way to tell if someone in a crowd has an STD. It won't be the most attractive or the ugliest person, not the best dressed or the sloppiest, it will have nothing to do with income or personality. A risky partner is one who has unprotected sex with other people, injects drugs, has an unknown sexual background or hasn't been fully tested for STDs.<p>

There are questions you should ask yourself about your current sexual relationships that may help to measure the level of risk.

<OL>
<LI>Is there any risk of me catching an STD?<p>
<LI>How many partners do I have?<p>
<LI>How often do I change partners?<p>
<LI>Is my partner being faithful to me?<p>
<LI>If I am not being faithful, why should my partner be faithful?<p>
<LI>What is my partner's sexual history?<p>
<LI>Am I sure that I am not carrying any infection?<p>
</OL>
Only when you can honestly answer these questions will you know what risk you are taking with sexually transmitted diseases. Keep the risks of STD transmission to a minimum by taking all possible precautions.

<UL>
<LI>Abstinence or self-masturbation are the only totally safe options<p>
<LI>Non-penetrative sex is the safest form of sex with a partner.<p>
<LI>Sex toys can be safe if treated properly but wash them well and use a condom if they are shared.<p>
<LI>If you have multiple partners, have regular STD checks.<p>
<LI>Condoms provide good protection - always use one.<p>
<LI>Talk to your partner before you start having sex, so you can assess the risk.<p>
<LI>If there is any doubt, you both should be fully tested.<p>
<LI>It is best to use condoms for the first six months of a relationship just to be sure.<p>
<LI>Use a dental dam or condom for oral genital contact.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>C</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">ountless myths surround diseases that are not fully understood - and HIV is one of those diseases. The idea that being infected with HIV is the same as having AIDS is perhaps the most prevalent myth.<p>

Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV is the virus which results in Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS. Once a person is infected with HIV, the virus slowly attacks the white blood cells which fight off infection within the body. When the immune system is damaged, the body's ability to fight off infection and disease is reduced. The later stage of HIV infection is called AIDS. People may be infected with HIV for years without developing AIDS.<p>

<I>You'd know if you were infected with HIV.</I><br>

Many people have no symptoms of HIV infection, and no knowledge that a sexual or drug-using partner is carrying the virus. A blood test is the only way to know.<p>

<I>You can always tell if someone is infected with HIV.</I><br>

People with HIV don't necessarily have visible symptoms. Dramatic images of people in the final stages of AIDS represent only a small percentage of people with HIV.<p>

<I>Employers have a right to know if an employee has HIV.</I><br>

There is no legal requirement to notify an employer.
People with HIV have the same rights and responsibilities as other members of the workforce.<p>

<I>AIDS is transmitted via toilet seats, silverware, shaking hands or kissing a person with AIDS</I>.<br>

One of the biggest myths regarding AIDS is that it is easy to contract.<p>

Unlike other viruses AIDS cannot live in air, food or water. You can't contract HIV from a swimming pool or from sharing food or drink with an infected person. You cannot be infected by using the same bathroom, silverware, shaking hands or kissing an HIV positive person.<p>

<I>Only people in certain "risk groups" get AIDS.</I><br>

In the first few years of the epidemic it was thought that only certain groups acquired HIV. Today we know that HIV can be contracted by anyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual preference or race. We know that there are "high risk behaviors". These are any activity involving the exchange of body fluids like semen or blood<p>


<I>You can't get  HIV the first time you have sex</I>.<br>

It is possible to become infected with HIV through a single exposure. Like pregnancy, HIV can follow just one instance of sexual intercourse.<p>

<I>You can get  HIV from performing CPR on an infected person</I>.<br>

While the HIV has been found to be present in saliva, it is not in sufficient quantities to be infectious. However, lifeguards, paramedics, police officers and firefighters often wear protective masks when performing CPR in case there is blood in the victim's mouth.<p>

<I>Mosquitoes, ticks or other biting insects can transmit the virus.</I><br>

Mosquitoes and ticks can only take blood out of the body.
They are not able to inject it. Were they capable of sucking one and injecting another, the amount of blood removed would not be enough to contain sufficient quantities of the virus to cause an infection. HIV cannot be transmitted or contracted by animals.<p>

<I>HIV can be transmitted on the sports field.</I><br>

While the virus may be found in an infected person's sweat, it is in such small quantities that it poses no risk to other athletes. Although blood is prevalent during some contact sports it is not possible to contract HIV  by having infected blood splashed on unbroken skin. First Aid precautions are taken in most major sports today, including covering open cuts and abrasions.<p>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>T</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">here is no conclusive evidence about where or how HIV started. There are a few theories but most agree that it has probably been around for decades, unrecognized. Although the virus was only identified in the 1980s, it has been around
since at least the early 1950s. HIV was found to have caused the death of a seaman in 1959. It is believed that, like many human viruses, HIV developed from an animal virus. Several viruses similar to HIV have been found in animals, and some of them have been around for 50­150 years. Another theory is that related strains of the virus may have originated in monkeys and chimpanzees in West Africa.<p>

Some scientists suspect the virus was introduced to humans as the unintended result of malaria experiments dating from the 1920s to the 1950s. The experiments were intended to find whether malaria parasites in the primates would infect people. Humans were injected with the blood from the monkeys, which may have been infected with the viral forebears of HIV.<p>

Michael Gottlieb of UCLA was the first physician to describe the effects of AIDS in medical journals. His investigations began in 1981 when a number of his male patients were suffering from a rare type of pneumonia This pneumonia is typically associated with cancer patients whose immune systems are suppressed by chemotherapy. Some of Gottlieb's patients also suffered other ailments associated with suppressed immune systems. While patients normally recovered from these complaints, these men all died.<p>

A benign form of cancer, usually striking aging Jewish and Italian men, started presenting itself in young men, and killing them. The only clear connection that Gottlieb could find was that all of the younger men were gay. The syndrome became known as GRID or Gay Related Immune Deficiency. When it became known that the syndrome also affected heterosexuals the name was changed to AIDS.<p>

Since the first known death in 1959, HIV has spread to every continent throughout the world and almost every country reports cases of AIDS in all genders, regardless of sexual preference.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>T</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">o understand the effects that HIV has on a body requires an understanding of the immune system. There are two kinds of cells in the immune system - B cells and CD cells. B cells travel the body in search of foreign particles and substances to destroy. They are large and can attack bacteria and other germs but they are so big that they can't attack viruses, which are minute. The CD cells are smaller and can attack viruses, but they are also the part of the immune system that HIV attacks. CD cells are also known as T cells. There are four types of CD cells. These combine to rid the body of viruses and other foreign substances. T helper cells, or CD4 cells, recognize viruses or irregular cells like cancer, and send messages to T killer cells. T killer cells exist only to attack and kill viruses and irregular cells identified by T helper cells as unwanted. T suppressor cells, on the other hand, stop the T killer cells from increasing and ultimately attacking one's own body.<p>

Antibodies are created following a message from a T helper cell to recognize a virus should it re-enter the body. The antibody attempts to neutralize the virus. The T helper cell  keeps the immune process operating. It is also the cell that HIV destroys. If there is no T helper cell, all the other functions disappear and the result is immune deficiency. When HIV enters the bloodstream it attaches to a T helper cell, sheds its outside skin and injects its own genetic material into the cell.<p>

Once the HIV has hidden in the T helper cell, the immune system no longer recognizes it as foreign and therefore cannot make an antibody to fight it. The virus can remain dormant for several years. It will then start to multiply. At this point the T helper cell becomes the host to produce more HIV particles. The T helper cell ultimately explodes and new viruses are released into the bloodstream where they find other T helper cells to invade. After the invasion, the multiplication begins again. When the T helper cells are destroyed faster than new ones can be made, the result is immune deficiency.<p>

The most difficult aspect of treating HIV is the destruction of the virus necessitates destruction of its host, the T helper cells. But the virus also kills the T helper cells, so it is a medical "Catch 22". The body attempts to build up antibodies to fight the HIV, but unfortunately the antibodies can't neutralize the virus.<p>

To find out if someone has HIV in their body, a blood test checks for the presence of antibodies to the virus. If there are signs of the HIV antibody, it indicates that the virus is in the bloodstream. If the test result is positive, the person has the virus.  If it is negative, they do not have the virus.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>A</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"> boy reaches puberty between the ages of 13 and 16 years. His first ejaculation is seen as an indication that he has reached puberty. Ejaculation may occur as a result of self stimulation or "masturbation" which is an extension of "genital play" that is common in childhood.  Ejaculation can also occur during sleeping hours. This is known as a "wet dream". Unaware of his ability to ejaculate a boy may have a wet dream which apart from being messy, can cause concern and embarrassment. Many young men use masturbation for pleasure, to manage their sexual tension and sexual arousal. Masturbation and ejaculation reduce the incidence of "wet dreams".<p>

With puberty comes an interest in sex and feelings of sexual arousal. A young man is faced with moral, social and personal dilemmas and this raises questions such as:

<ul>
<li>if and when is he going to have sexual intercourse and with whom; <p>
<li>coping with infatuations and love; <p>
<li>if he has feelings of affection toward his male friends does this mean that he is "gay" or homosexual;<p>
<li>doubts as to his attractiveness;<p>
<li>health and hygiene;<p>
<li>is his body developing into the "right" shape;<p>
<li>is his penis big enough;<p>
<li>is his penis the same as every other boy's or does it look unusual because of circumcision or the absence of circumcision;<p>
<li>will he be able to control his erections;<p>
<li>when he has sexual intercourse will he ejaculate too soon;<p>
<li>is masturbation bad for him and can it effect his health;<p>
<li>will he be "good" at having sex;<p>
<li>when and how can he buy condoms with minimum embarrassment;<p>
<li>will he get a sexually transmitted disease if he has sex with a girl;<p>
<li>who can he talk to about contraception, sexual assault and other issues and;<p>
<li>what if his sexual performance isn't perfect;<p>
</ul>

The physical changes to a boy in during puberty vary from one person to another but the following development is likely to occur:
<ul>
<li>hair develops around the genitals, in the arm pits and on the face, <p>
<li>muscles develop,<p>
<li>the penis and testes "develop" or grow bigger,<p>
<li>the voice deepens,<p>
<li>a large number of boys experience breast enlargement,<p>
<li>the testes produce sperm and,<p>
<li>the penis tends to become erect more often.<p>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>I</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">t's common for a girl to reach puberty between the ages of 12 and 15 years. Her first menstrual period is seen as an indication that she has reached puberty. Big physical changes occur in a relatively short period of time and they can have an emotional effect causing unprovoked mood swings which can create tensions with family and friends.  Girls often exchange information about sex and sexual development and its important that accurate, factual information is thrown into this melting pot of knowledge.<p>

Many girls compare their development with their friends in "dressing room" situations where breast size and the presence of pubic hair may be noticed and menstrual cycles discussed. The girl who "develops" or reaches puberty late in her teens, and the girl who reaches puberty very early may need support from caring adults as young people desperately need to be the "same" but nature sometimes appears to fight against these social needs.<p>

With puberty comes an interest in sex and feelings of sexual arousal. A young woman is faced with moral,  social and personal dilemmas  raising questions such as:

<UL>
<LI>if and when is she going to have sex and with whom;<p>
<LI>coping with infatuations and love; <p>
<LI>health and hygiene;<p>
<LI>when her menstrual period occurs will it prevent her from playing sport or swimming;<p>
<LI>is masturbation bad for her;  <p>
<LI>will it hurt having sexual intercourse;<p>
<LI>will she be "good" at having sex;<p>
<LI>is she sexually attracted to boys, girls or both when and how  should she organize contraception;<p>
<LI>who can she talk to openly with about sexual matters, contraception, abortion, sexual assault and so on;<p>
<LI>what would she do if she got pregnant; and,<p>
<LI>is her body developing into the "right" shape?<p>
</UL>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Menstruation</b></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Menstrual periods commence between the ages of 12 to 14 years. In the first couple of years the menstrual cycle may be irregular but this will soon develop a regular pattern of occurrence every 28 days or so. During the menstrual period a girl will need to use a sanitary pad or a tampon to absorb menstrual discharge.

Tampons can be inserted into the vagina by women of any age provided they experience no pain or discomfort is experienced. Slim tampons are available for younger women. Tampons should be changed every 4 hours as in an extremely small number of cases women have become very ill from "toxic shock", an extremely rare condition.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>A</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">dolescents want to establish 'self identity' and a sense of autonomy, they want to 'belong' to a group of like-minded young people as they develop a capacity for love and sex. Most adolescents have their basic material needs provided by their parents and they tend to focus more readily on their emotional needs, the need to belong, the need for love and affection, the need to develop ambition and the need to achieve. <p>

In adolescents and less mature adults the biological sexual urge becomes confused with the desire to love  and the desire to be loved. Its common for an adolescent to develop an affection for close friends of the same sex and, when combined with messages from active sex hormones the adolescent may believe, or suspect, that they are homosexual.<p>

Although there is a stereotype model of masculinity and of femininity in reality its not so clear cut and a young man or a young woman shouldn't feel extreme concern for their sexuality if they don't 'measure up' to that fictional stereotype. Fewer than ten per cent of people have strong homosexual tendencies and even fewer choose a homosexual lifestyle. <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF"> Parents and adolescents face a wide range of issues that could bring them into conflict as the young person tries to develop a sense of their own values and their own independence. One source of tension between an adolescent and their parents is often to do with the young person's desire to explore their own sexuality.<p>

Some parents have a highly developed moral code that they would like their son or daughter to adopt, some parents simply don't want to see their children make the mistakes that they made when they were young,  other parents simply want their children to be safe and happy.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half3.GIF">Conflict can also arise between parental values and the adolescent's behavior due to the overwhelming influence of peer group pressure.  Some parents think that media role models exercise too much of an influence over adolescent behavior. <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half4.GIF">In reality, we make our own decisions about our values and our attitude to our own sexual preferences and behavior based on all of the information and misinformation that we obtain from a wide range of sources.<p>

It is important that an adolescent become aware of his or her own body, be at ease with touching it and should see it as a unique personal possession and with this attitude he or she will be able to happily respond to another person when they are ready for such an emotional and sexual relationship. <p>

The emotional turmoil experienced by many adolescents is part of a process of sorting out what's good for the individual themselves and this process most often leads to a well balanced view of adult life but it needs to be approached in a calm and logical manner.

After about the age of 40, the average man can expect 5 prominent changes to his sexuality. The first is that his desire for intercourse may decline as it takes him longer and longer to re-establish an erection after each ejaculation.<p>

Some men may notice their erections may lose some rigidity.  The penis may not become erect enough for penetration.  He may need direct and prolonged stimulation by hand or mouth to become erect. The amount of seminal fluid in his ejaculate will likely reduce in quantity.  He will climax less forcefully than when he was younger.  A man may find he can prolong the time from penetration to orgasm and improve the pleasure for his partner. Once ejaculation has taken place, his penis will become flaccid more quickly than in the past.  <p>

Many sexual disorders in older men result from a lack of awareness of the facts.
</font></td>



<td align=left width=300 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">Many men become anxious about changes to their sexual patterns despite the fact that many of these changes are quite natural and normal. It is important for older men to understand that they can have a fulfilling sex life until the day they die.  If a man does experience a problem with his sex life it is important not to assume that the problem is a normal part of aging.  While it may be, it could equally be a medical problem that is easily treated and resolved.<p>

There are some drugs which may affect a man's sexual function or interest.  Some high blood pressure medications can prevent erections in men.  Diabetes can also make erections difficult, but not enough study has been done to understand how if affects the sexuality of women.  The drug L-dopa which is prescribed for Parkinson's disease may increase sexual interest.  To be certain, always ask your doctor about the effects on sexual interest or arousal of any drug prescribed for you or your partner.

Older women face changes too. Changed estrogen levels may produce changes in the vagina.  The vaginal walls thin and loose elasticity.  The vagina becomes narrower and dryness can make intercourse less comfortable and even painful.  It is suggested by some specialists that regular sexual activity helps maintain vaginal lubrication.  This activity could be intercourse or masturbation. If vaginal dryness and lubrication become a problem KY jelly, or other lubricating creams intended for the purpose can relieve the problem.

<td align=left width=300 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">Studies show that women have a more stable sex drive than men.  Women over age 65 continue to seek out and respond to erotic encounters.  They have more erotic dreams than men and continue to be capable of orgasms, even multiple orgasms. Most of the aspects of arousal that a woman had when younger remain intact as she gets older.  Nipples still become erect and the clitoris remains the main organ for sexual stimulation.  The excitement generated by clitoral stimulation is exactly the same. A woman of 80 can experience the same if not more intense orgasms as she did when she was 20 years old.

It can continue until very late in life and some men have reported that they still enjoy it in their 90s.Approximately 66% of all men and nearly 50% of all women in their 50s masturbate regularly.  By the age of 70, 43% of men and 33% of women still masturbate. Some people begin to masturbate more often as they grow older, particularly if they have no partner or cannot have intercourse because of a physical incapacity.

<td align=left width=300 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">Self-stimulation is a sexual outlet for both men and women for whom other forms of sexual activity are not possible.  It releases tension and is of great benefit if you can free yourself from the idea that it is unhealthy, immoral or immature. There is absolutely no reason - for men and women - to feel guilty about a high level of masturbation.  There is no such thing as a 'normal' number of times you can masturbate. Vibrators can also be a useful aid in masturbation.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>M</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">en - because they have grown up with often unrealistic 'macho' notions of what it is to be masculine - experience psychological and physical problems with sexuality as they age.  As you grow older you will have less significant hormonal changes than women. Your hormone level remains relatively steady and your testicles continue to produce sperm as they have since puberty.<p>

Most men do have a gradual decline in testosterone production, and some organs such as the prostate and testicles may show a reduced ability to respond to testosterone. Testosterone is the hormone which produces the sperm in the ejaculate, and determines the amount of semen in each ejaculate.<p>

You may notice that you get an erection less frequently when you fantasize about sexual situations or when you see an erotic picture or object. You may find that it takes longer for you to get an erection when making love and that your penis needs a few minutes of direct stimulation by masturbation or by your partner's hand or mouth before it becomes erect. Sometimes you may even fail to get an erection.<p>

Men who are obsessed with 'performance' may see this as the end of their sexuality. But that this is not true.  You are not impotent.  These periods usually last for less than a week, and shouldn't be of a major concern. Your capacity for an erection is not caused by age, although it may be lost because you are anxious about your performance, because of alcohol , the medications you are taking or illnesses such as diabetes. <p>

You may notice that your penis is no longer as erect as it used to be, that it doesn't stand as upright, and seems not to be as eager.  Again, this should not be a cause for concern.  You will find that if you do not become anxious over this minor change it is still as effective, and you will continue to enjoy sex as much as ever.<p>

There may be periods when you lose your erection during foreplay before intercourse.  Don't worry.  This is also normal. Stimulation will restore your erection and when you penetrate your partner's vagina you will find that you last longer than when you were younger.  You will both enjoy the sensation for a longer period.<p>

Some men become overly concerned if they do not ejaculate each time they have sex.  They feel that this somehow questions their virility. Remember: you may not have to ejaculate each time.  You have both just enjoyed a mutually sensuous and pleasurable act.  You enjoyed sex.  You will ejaculate the next time, or the time after that. If - after sex - you find that you are still aroused then ask your partner to stimulate you penis again, or masturbate.<p>

Many men find they either ejaculate less forcibly, or the message from their advance warning system that they are about to climax is not as strong.  Others discover it takes longer to become erect again after intercourse.  These changes are also normal.  Don't worry.<p></font>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Prostate problems</b><br></FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
After the age of 50 your prostate gland commonly enlarges.  This is the gland which surrounds your urethra.  The urethra is the tube which carries the urine from the bladder to the eye of your penis. If the prostate enlarges, you may find that the flow of urine is restricted.  If this happens you may have to go more often, or you may have to wait for longer periods before the flow starts.  All of this is normal with aging, but let your GP know what is happening. If the prostate grows even larger, it may become impossible to pass urine because of the blockage caused by the gland pressing on the urethra.  Surgery can remedy the condition.  <p>

Prostatectomy - the procedure to correct an enlarged prostate - is a common and safe procedure. The operation should not render you impotent, as is feared by many men.  In some cases a man may no longer ejaculate sperm which instead go into his bladder.  But he still receives all the other sensations of sex and has an orgasm.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>P</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">hysical age changes in women are more dramatic than in a men and begin much earlier in life.  The brain, sex hormones, and regularity of ovulation frequently begin to change once a woman reaches her 40s and in some women as early as their 30s.
By their mid-50's most women will have had their last menstrual flow.<p>

With the end of menstruation, the production of estrogen ceases.  Although estrogen plays a major role in the reproductive cycle of a woman and is no longer needed for egg production, its absence also causes physical changes in women.  One of the reasons older women experience more broken bones than men is this loss of estrogen.  Its absence is directly linked to an older woman's inability to store calcium, which the body needs to keep bones strong.<p>

The health of women's genital and urinary systems is also dependent on estrogen.  When the estrogen level drops, the tissues, nerves, muscles, veins, and organs of the pelvic area gradually change. This in turn increases the likelihood of vaginal and urinary infections, as well as hernias of the uterus, bladder, or bowel which protrude into the vagina.<p>

The menopause, or the 'change of life' as it is known is a rich source of folklore about insanity, loss of sexual desire and attractiveness, the inevitability of depression, and masculinisation. Fortunately, most women - around 60% - experience no remarkable physical or emotional symptoms with menopause. The act of sex is complex, encompassing the body, the mind and the emotions.  It involves the hormones and the nervous system, as well as specific sexual organs.  All participate in the sexual-response cycle. This cycle includes desire, followed by excitement or erotic arousal, orgasm, then recovery from the experience.  Even a slight change in hormone level can affect the whole process for a woman. <p>

During menopause, but mostly after, some older women show signs of estrogen depletion.  Many complain of a feeling of dryness or 'loss of juices' in the vagina, especially during the sex act. Vaginal lubrication results from the blood vessels in the vaginal wall congesting near the wall surface, then secreting through the walls.  <p>

Lubrication of the walls of the vagina begins to take longer as the woman gets older.  This can be attributed to both the loss of estrogen and the changes in the structure of the vaginal wall itself.  When this occurs, the sex act may feel scratchy, rough and even painful.  Typically what happens is that the lining of the vagina begins to thin and become easily irritated.  This leads to pain during intercourse. Estrogen replacement therapy has been used for years to counter this and its use is carefully monitored. <p>

One controversial treatment is the sex act itself.  It has been suggested that women who engage in regular sexual activity help preserve vaginal functioning, especially the lubricating ability. Sexually active women also seem to have less vaginal atrophy.  This is thought to be due to the muscle contractions during sexual activity and orgasm. <p>

Masturbation can also be an effective means of preserving the lubricating ability and the muscle tone of the vagina.  In addition it can release tension, stimulate sexual appetite, and contribute to general wellbeing.  This method can be employed by women who have lost a sexual partner but is also suggested for those with partners, as a natural and ongoing supplementary activity within a relationship.<p>

Pain and discomfort of any kind in the vaginal area should be taken seriously by women since pain obviously interferes with sexual pleasure and response. With estrogen loss the usually acid vaginal secretions become less acidic.  This increases the possibility of vaginal infection and sometimes causes burning, itching and discharge. This condition is called, 'senile' vaginitis.  If the infection is left untreated and spreads to the bladder, it produces an inflammation called cystitis.  All of the symptoms are curable and should be treated by your GP. <p>

A woman shouldn't assume that all vaginal itching and discharge are caused by an estrogen deficiency, and should have a complete examination, including a pap smear. This would rule out the possibility of a more serious condition, such as a tumor of the reproductive tract.<p>

Very late in life, the clitoris may experience a slight shrinkage in size, the lips of the vagina may become less firm, and the fat pad in the hair-covered pubic area may lose some of its fatty tissue. None of these events should worry you, because they are natural and normal.  The clitoris will remain the source of intense sexual sensation and orgasm, just as it was in earlier years. <p>

Women in good health who were able to have orgasms in their younger years can continue having orgasms until very late in life.  Many women experience orgasms until well into their 80s. There are many cases where women who did not achieve orgasms earlier in life began to have them as they got older.Except for the effect of estrogen loss after menopause, the normal physical changes that accompany aging interfere little with female sexual ability, or enjoyment.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>B</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">oth men and women will benefit from a nutritionally balanced diet and a regular exercise program. Exercise becomes increasingly important in women as they age, due to a loss in bone mass which begins at around age 35. Loss of bone mass can lead to bone breakage and, left unchecked, develops into severe osteoporosis. <p>

A weight-bearing exercise such as walking, jogging or running is of more benefit to increasing bone density, than swimming. If you find that running is too demanding or boring, dancing is the perfect substitute.  It is socially acceptable and fun too. Although they are not as prone to the condition as women are.  Bone mass loss should also be of concern for men.  Activities like golf, or bowls can provide weight-bearing exercise needed to increase bone density.<p>

The benefits of exercise for older people is evident.  Any moderate activity which stimulates the respiratory system is beneficial. Exercise can lower blood pressure, may reduce atherosclerosis, risks of heart attack, and improve the body's ability to fight conditions like arthritis and emphysema. <p>

Exercise is essential for finding and keeping a comfortable weight.  It can help reduce the incidence of colds and other virus infections, which can develop into secondary infections such as sinus trouble, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Activity during the day assists your ability to fall asleep at night.  It also improves bowel functioning, often relieves depression and generally makes you feel good.  <p>

The clinical evidence suggests that after exercise, blood rushes to the skin, bringing with it extra nutrients and raising the skin's temperature. When this happens, the collagen content increases and the skin actually thickens, becomes more elastic and less wrinkled.  It is never too late to begin an exercise program and one can be worked out to meet any physical limitation.  A tip here is to start slowly.<p>

Consult with your GP before beginning any extra activity.  You will notice the improvements in your health almost from the start. What relatively healthy men and women should keep in mind is that sexual activity, in whatever form and in whatever degree they practice it, should continue to be possible, normal, pleasurable and beneficial.  Those older people with fairly common chronic ailments can also adapt their sexual desires to satisfactorily express their sensuous desires.  Neither age nor most infirmity automatically spells the end of sex.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>S</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">ome men may find that some of their emotional problems are linked with their own notions of virility, competition and winning. For them, the fear of sexual impotence heads the list of concerns.  This is because from early childhood, they have been conditioned to think of sex performance in terms of erections and ejaculations.  They have overemphasised the physical-performance aspect of sexuality all their lives focusing on thrusting and climaxing during love-making, rather than on sharing and expressing feelings.<p>  

The mere notion of impotence is naturally upsetting. For some, the fear of impotence can actually cause impotence. Temporary impotence can happen at any age, and does occur in nearly all men for a variety of reasons. It can be brought on by fatigue, tension, illness and excessive drinking.  Each occurrence usually lasts for a period of only a few days. For men who are not aware of this, as well as not being aware of the physiological changes that accompany aging, the problem becomes magnified. Another threat to men's virility is the response from his sex partner.  An unresponsive sex partner can contribute to impotency.  This is also true if he thinks that she is only perfunctorily engaging in sex. <p>


</font></td>



<td align=left width=300 valign=top>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Women who do not understand the problem may view impotence as threatening, thinking  THEY are sexually unattractive. They may react with hostility or hurt, which doesn't help the problem.<p>

Emotional and physical fatigue, boredom with routine love-making, overwork, and worries about family and finances can all be added to the list of just what can affect potency. The solution lies in a combination of things; from resolving the matters upsetting you, or a reduction in the amount of alcohol consumed, to simple relaxation. Unless there is a medical reason for the problem, your potency will return.</font></td>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>O</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">lder women are less subject to fear of sexual dysfunctioning than men. Except for the possible changes that occur during menopause, the normal physical changes of aging interfere little with female sexual ability. A woman is physically capable of having intercourse even if she does not enjoy love-making, and does not have an orgasm in such situations. This does not mean older women have no concerns about their sexuality. They may worry about their orgasmic capacity.<p>

Some women find that after menopause they are able to relax more, and orgasm for the first time. This can be attributed to not having to worry about pregnancy, or that the children have left home -  so for the first time since marriage she has only herself and her partner in the house. Other problems that women experience stem from how society has previously viewed sex.<p>

Many older men and women grew up believing the "nice" girls were not interested in sex. Further, that sex should even be distasteful to women.



</font></td>



<td align=left width=300 valign=top> <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">It was only "loose" women who gave themselves to the pleasures of sex and actually enjoyed it. Women may remember being taught that sex was a duty, to be performed only for the gratification of their husbands. To get an idea of how deeply ingrained these notions were, here is advice from a nineteenth century marriage manual: "As a general rule, a modest woman seldom desires any sexual gratification for herself.  She submits to her husband, but only to please him; and, but for the desire of maternity, would far rather be relieved from his attention."  <p>

With advice like that being the norm, it is a wonder that an orgasm was experienced by any woman during the century.  It is obvious that men were the pursuers, women were the reluctantly pursued. If this has been your experience, frank talks with your current partner can help clear up such antiquated assumptions.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>A</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">nother common emotional trap for both men and women is the "old person" trap. Even when they are physically and mentally healthy and alert, both groups in their fifties, sixties and seventies sometimes play the old-man, or old-woman role that society expects of them. They totter around as if they were on their last legs. It  is a symptom of demoralisation. Giving up.  For years, society has painted a picture of the stereotyped, desexualised image of its older members.<p>


If you buy into this image, you will decide that your sexual ability is gone and arbitrarily declare yourself sexually incapacitated. You will not be willing to openly discuss sexual issues with your partner, or to consider possible remedies. You must realise that behind this stance is an effort to avoid anxiety about sex and sexual relationships that society has imposed. Don't allow yourself to be framed by this narrow view.  Talk about everything with your partner, and be open to new experiences.




</font></td>



<td align=left width=300 valign=top> <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">Because the media uses youthful images to sell everything from homes and cars to food, it becomes easy for some older people to feel alienated, then fall into a self-hatred mode. Some decide they hate the way they look. They become obsessive about projecting a younger image, then become equally depressed over the hopelessness of significantly changing their appearance.  Sometimes older people display their distress over this social alienation by angrily lashing out at younger people.  We've all heard expressions like, "just wait until you're my age, you won't be so smart".  Instead of expending time and energy  on this, an older person would be much better to accept the realities of physical changes with aging. The sooner this occurs, the quicker you can get on with living a full life, just as you've always done.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>S</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">exual guilt and shame play a large role in may people's reaction to sex. After a lifetime of childhood feelings and family experiences, which were often confusing and disturbing, it is extremely difficult to suddenly throw off their effect.  People over the age of sixty were often brought up in households that had a Victorian-like prudery. They are likely to have been treated to more than their share of misinformation about sexual matters, and were probably made to feel guilty about their sexual stirrings.  <p>

Any questions about sexuality, if they dared ask them, would have either been treated with derision, or answered in fairytale like simplicity. Looking, feeling, talking, or touching would be rewarded with chastisement. <p>

Masturbation was viewed as one of the seven deadly sins, and strictly forbidden. There were even mechanical devices invented to make certain that children did not stimulate themselves. Scare tactics were incorporated to make sure the point was driven home.  Children were told that, they "could go blind", or it "could use up your life's juices", and shorten ones life, or that it led to feeble-mindedness, nervousness, or madness. This line of thought went on to suggest that dark circles under the eyes were a sure sign of a closet masturbator. For those who insisted on exploring their genitals, it was suggested that "your hands can wither up and fall off".  <p>

In the United States even the government became involved.  A 1937 sex hygiene manual from the Public Health Service warned youths not to "waste vital fluids". In 1945, a Boy Scout manual repeated the same warning.  There is little wonder, with this type of misinformation during their formative years, that many older men still cling to the notion that "too much" sexual activity reduces potency and lowers semen "reserves".  Any GP today will tell you how ridiculous a notion this is. Men continue to produce semen all of their lives. Generally, the amount produced naturally reduces as we age.  Younger men produce about 3-5ml, or about one teaspoon per 24-hour period, while men past the age of fifty produce about 2-3ml per day, but this has nothing whatsoever to do with whether a person masturbates, or is otherwise sexually active. <p>

Another emotional consideration for older men and women are the self-imposed, long-term constraints on sexual activity, which tend to linger and are extremely difficult to change. Because for much of the procreative years birth control techniques were not as reliable, sophisticated, or freely available as they are today  most men and women  did not spontaneously engage in sexual enjoyment for fear of pregnancy.  <p>

Similarly, there was the fear of contracting venereal diseases.  Earlier this century effective drugs for most of these diseases had not been invented. This particular concern is however once again real, given the current Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome epidemic.  Of course, "safe sex" is recommended for this reason.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>P</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">roblems in the relationship with your sexual partner will very quickly affect sexual functioning.  If either you or your partner is angry, bored, or otherwise unresponsive to sexual advances problems will arise. <p>

In men it can lead to potency problems.  A woman may also experience sexual disinterest, or fail to become aroused. In the woman's case, the lack of arousal is likely to present itself as a failure to lubricate and no orgasm, no matter how she is stimulated. Although lack of sexual desire can be a comfortable way of life for some, it is often very troubling to the other partner. Occasional and short-lived lack of desire is commonplace and reversible.  If it becomes a long-lasting problem it can be one of the most intractable of sexual problems.  In extreme cases, the only solution sometimes is a combination of sex therapy, psychotherapy, and marriage counseling over a long period of time.<p>

Sexual desire and response usually return when the underlying emotions are resolved.  The key here is recognition of the problem. The first step in self-treatment is for partners to relax and assume that sexual functioning will improve once the emotional issues are addressed.  This is a period when kindness and consideration toward each other is crucial.  <p>

Once the underlying problem has been identified,  and both parties have agreed to a resolution, space and time in which to recover is needed. It could take a matter of hours, or a number of days to recover.  It is important here to remember that sexual responsiveness can't be willed. Both partners must be relaxed, in a positive mood and feel good about each other. Physical stimulation, at first involving the whole body, then later focusing on the genitals is an important part of arousal.  Masters and Johnson initiated a three-stage method of arousal which is being used by many sex therapists. "Sensate Focus", is used to teach people to relax and slowly move each other into a state of sexual arousal.  The eventual result is the sexual climax.  <p>

The stages are:
<oL>
<LI>non-genital "pleasuring" of one's partner's body by touching and caressing.<p>
<LI>genital touching and caressing without intercourse.<p>
<LI>non-demanding sexual intercourse where the goal is pleasure rather than performance.<p>
</oL>
Special techniques are also available to stop or slow premature ejaculation. Occasional and temporary premature ejaculation happens to most men from time to time. It generally occurs when they have had infrequent sex, or when unusually aroused.  It usually disappears by itself as circumstances change.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>A</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">s they grow older, many people find themselves without partners. This is perhaps the most profound emotional and sexual adjustment for an older person to make. Although we are all aware it can happen, we are never fully prepared for the event. Through death, divorce, or separation, older women will find themselves in this situation far more than men. There are simply not enough men to go around.  <p>

In the United States in 1985 there were a total 11.5 million men over the age of sixty-five, and over 17 million women.   Of the women, 8 million were widowed and 1.5 million were divorced or single.   It is a fact that women live on average, 7 years longer than men.  Statistically, women marry men an average of three years older than themselves. <p>

Women are adapting in a number of ways:
<UL>
<LI>by challenging negative cultural stereotypes through organisations for older people<p>
<LI>by learning to take the initiative in building friendships and a social life.  Many redefine their own sexuality to include a wider range of options for satisfying intimacy and sexual release.<p>
<LI>Some develop friendships with younger men.  Other have relationships with married men who may be unable or unwilling to leave their marriages. <p>
<LI>some sublimate their sexuality by developing absorbing activities that bring them companionship and accomplishment.   <p>
</UL>
You have to take an active part in putting your life together again.  Its up to you to take charge of your life. You have to decide what it is you want, and what you should do about it.  You do not have to go out deliberately looking for the second "Mr. Right". <p>

If you do not have a job but are interested and able, consider actively looking for a part-time job. The workplace is loaded with opportunities for social interaction. Whether it is working a part-time job, or volunteering for a charity or social organization, you should do the activities that bring you pleasure. A sense of pleasure and purpose in what you are doing will  encourage you to enjoy, learn, give of yourself and make friends. Many older people are still bound by the customs that they learned as children, although many of the formalities don't make sense today. <p>

Women used to be told that it was improper to telephone a man.  If you are interested, give it a try.  You don't have to wait for an invitation.  Treat it as if you were calling a friend. He will either say yes, or no.  He has the same options that your friend would have.  If he accepts your invitation, a friendship, or relationship may develop, or it may not. What is important is that you have taken an active role in finding new friends and activities.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>U</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">nattached men tend to have fewer social difficulties. Even those who were not socially accomplished when they were younger are surprised to find how eagerly accepted and actively pursued they now are. The downside for this new-found attractiveness for some men is that you may find it annoying to be treated like community property in short supply. If this is your situation, you will have to make it clear to your pursuers, or else remove yourself from the situations where this is likely to occur.<p>

Uncertainty can also be a problem for men.  While on the one hand, you are in very much demand, this will do nothing for your confidence if you feel that you are not as sophisticated as others or you are not confident in relationships with the opposite sex. Most men have not had the many amorous adventures of Casanova. <p>

A woman on the other hand, is not accused by society as being "unwomanly" if she lacks confidence. This self-doubt in men can lead to sexual impotence. If you are troubled by what you perceive as your lack of sophistication, don't worry, you have plenty of company. Many men unnecessarily share this fear.  The women that you meet will not be comparing you to some impossible ideal and judge you as a failure. A shy man will have to make the same effort of will and initiative that a hesitant woman has to make. Without this determination to take matters into your own hands, relationships will not develop for either the man anymore than for a woman.<p>

As relationships progress and develop into sexual involvement, new anxieties may occur.  If you fall into the trap of thinking that your new sexual partner is comparing you with a previous partner, or indeed, comparing your new sex partner, it will cause performance problems.  Both partners should be concerned only with what each can give to the other.  It takes an active effort by both to make the present moments satisfying. A caring person who offers reassurance, tenderness and thoughtfulness to a less confident sexual partner will help restore that person's confidence. If the self-doubt is too deeply ingrained because of shyness and uneasiness about performance, professional help may be required.

The male breasts do not develop except in muscle tone.<p>

<I>Muscles and Fat:  </I> <p>

The thighs, calves, shoulders and upper arms grow broader during adolescence. Strength also increases. A man's body is 10-20% fat, distributed on the upper body and abdomen.<p>

<I>Body Hair:  </I> <p>

Early in puberty boys start to grow body hair on the penis, scrotum and anus. Later, under the armpits, the face and then on the arms, chest, thighs and lower legs.<p>

<I>Pelvis size:  </I> <p>

The male pelvis is narrow, yet large and heavy to support a heavy body weight.<p>

At puberty the breasts develop, the nipples and the area around them swell and enlarge.<p>

<I>Muscles and Fat:  </I> <p>

When a girl is about nine or ten fat is deposited on the breasts, hips, thighs and buttocks. More fat appears between the ages of 15 and 17 in the same areas, as the hips become rounded the waist becomes curved and more defined. A woman's body is about 20-25% fat.<p>

<I>Body Hair:  </I> <p>

Early in puberty girls start to grow body hair on the genitals as well as under the armpits.<p>

<I>The Fallopina Tubes</I> are narrow tubes which carry the ova or eggs.<p>

<I>The Ovaries</I> are on either side of the uterus and contain between 200,000 and 400,000 ova when a girl is born.  The ovaries also produce hormones oestrogen and progesterone.<p>

<I>The Uterus or Womb</I> is located in the middle of the pelvis between the bladder, in front, and the bowel, at the back.  If a women is not pregnant the cavity of the uterus is narrow and slit-like.  It is lined with tissue made up of glands, which is called endometrium and is shed during menstruation.  If a woman is pregnant this tissue develops into the placenta.<p>

<I>The Cervix</I> produces the mucus which changes throughout the menstrual cycle due to the effect of oestrogen and progesterone.  There are two types of cervical mucus - fertile and infertile.  The infertile mucus helps block the cervix by acting as a barrier to sperm at infertile times.  The fertile mucus allows easier entry for the sperm to the uterus and fallopian tubes at fertile times.<p>

<I>The Vagina</I> is an elastic muscle tissue lined with folds of skin.  The walls normally lie close together until they are parted by a tampon, finger or penis and also have to stretch a great deal during childbirth.  The opening of the vagina is surrounded by strong muscle and nerve endings.  The vagina ends at the cervix, (the opening to the uterus).  The vagina is self-cleansing. The normal bacteria that live inside the vagina produce lactic acid that kill contaminating germs that may enter the vagina.  The vagina is moist, with the moistness varying throughout the menstrual cycle and when a women is sexually aroused.<p>

<I>The Penis</I><p>
The glans, or head, of the penis is covered with very thin skin that contains numerous nerve-endings and is therefore very sensitive to touch. At birth the foreskin covers the glans and on its lower side it is tethered to the inner surface by the frenulum. The frenulum is the small piece of skin on the underside of the penis where the glans meets the shaft.  It is also a very sensitive area.<p>

The foreskin may be removed in a procedure known as circumcision.  Circumcision is usually performed at a young age, for religious or hygiene reasons. The skin of the penis is thin and stretchy and loosely attached to the underlying tissues. <p>

<td align=left width=225 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">The penis itself is composed of erectile tissue and is richly supplied with sensory nerves. It is filled with a rich network of blood vessels and three cylindrical areas of spongy tissue.  The spongy tissue remains empty when the penis is flaccid, and it fills during erection.<p>

<I>The Scrotum</I> <p>
The scrotum is the pouch of skin at the root of the penis that holds the testes. For healthy sperm to be produced the testes need to be kept at a temperature lower than the rest of the body. Under the skin of the scrotum is a muscle that contracts in response to cold or exercise, in order to maintain the ideal temperature.

<I>The Testicles</I><p>
The testicles have two functions:

<OL>
<LI>To produce sperm <p>
<LI>To produce male hormones, primarily testosterone.
</OL><p>
Production of sperm continues throughout a man's life, unless there is a problem with infertility.<p>


 <I>The Epididymis</I><p>
When the sperm have been produced they move to a large tube called the Epididymis, where they continue to mature for six weeks.
<p>

<I>The Vas Deferens</I><p>
The Vas Deferens are the tubes that carry sperm from the Epididymis to the urethra and penis.
<p>

<I>The Bladder</I><p>
The bladder holds urine.  There is a valve at the base of the bladder that closes when the penis is erect to prevent urination.
<p>

<I>The Seminal Vesicles</I><p>
The seminal vesicles produce and store semen. The sperm are supported and nourished by this sticky fluid that forms part of the ejaculate.
<p>

<I>The Prostrate Gland</I><p>
The prostate gland is situated just below the neck of the bladder. It produces secretions that form part of the seminal fluid during ejaculation, and pushes the ejaculate (semen and sperm) out of the penis when the man has an orgasm.
<p>


<I>The Cowpers' Gland</I><p>
These glands are on either side of the urethra. They contain a clear alkaline fluid that cleans the urethra of any urine before ejaculation.  This fluid also acts as a lubricant. This fluid is called pre-ejaculate (pre-cum) but may also contain a few sperm.
<p>

<I>The Urethra</I><p>
The urethra is the tube that runs from the bladder and seminal vesicles to the opening at the head of the penis. Semen, urine and pre-ejaculate pass down the urethra.

<p>The G-spot may be a little difficult to find, but some women find the search worth while. The G-spot was identified in the1940s by an obstetrician and gynecologist, Ernst Grafenburg.  The existence of the G-spot has been controversial, but it is now accepted that in some women there is an area inside the vagina that produces intense sexual feelings when stimulated. It is located about 5 cm or 2 inches up the front wall of the vagina.Once located very gentle stimulation gives a pleasant and unusual
sensation.

As a woman becomes sexually excited, her breathing and heart rate increase. Her lips become pink, her pupils dilate and her nipples become erect. If stimulation continues her skin becomes flushed and begins to sweat and the areola around her nipples swell.<p>

The vagina becomes moist with a lubricating fluid secreted from the vaginal walls. The clitoris swells with blood and may extend from underneath it's hood.  As sexual excitement increases, the shape of the vagina changes in readiness for penetration.  The vagina lengthens and swells.

Before orgasm occurs the clitoris retracts beneath the clitoral hood and the vagina contracts rhythmically about 5-10 times. These orgasmic contractions are intensely pleasurable. It may take 10-15 minutes for the color and shape of the vagina to return to normal.<p>

The clitoris returns to its normal position within 5-10 seconds after orgasmic contractions have ceased.

As arousal begins, messages from the brain shut off the flow of blood out of the penis.  The erectile tissue in the penis fills with blood and the penis becomes hard and erect.

A man's breast and nipples are also responsive to sexual stimulation, the nipples swell and become erect.  His scrotum thickens and his testes are drawn closer to his body.

<B>N</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">atural methods of contraception are based on a woman understanding her body well enough to avoid intercourse at her most fertile times during the month. The Temperature, Rhythm, and Ovulation (or Billings) Methods are the most common methods, however, none are very effective and they require more motivation and discipline than other forms of contraception.<P>

The Temperature Method relies on a woman taking her oral, rectal, or vaginal temperature each morning before getting up and before eating or drinking anything. Around the time of ovulation the temperature rises by about 0.3 degrees Celsius or .05 degrees Fahrenheit and remains there for about 14 days of the cycle. There is no warning of ovulation with this method, so it is often difficult to be sure of the fertile time. Intercourse must be avoided until the temperature has been elevated for three days.<P>

The Ovulation or Billings Method is based on the variation of vaginal mucus during the menstrual cycle in parallel with hormonal changes. As ovulation approaches in most women , the cervix produces a slippery, wet mucus much like the raw white of an egg. This lubricative mucus allows the sperm to move more freely and increases the sperm survival rate. On the last day, when the mucus is clear and stretchy, fertility is at its peak. In the Billings guidelines, only half of the days in the cycle are not available for intercourse. Abstinence is required during menstruation and for seven to ten days in mid cycle.<P>

The Rhythm Method is an out-dated method  It should not be used in isolation. The Rhythm Method can be combined with The Temperature Method and The Ovulation or Billings Method. The Rhythm Method works on the fact that ovulation occurs on a single day, ten to sixteen days before menstruation and sperm can live for at least 3 days and possibly longer in fertile mucus. Even women with consistent menstrual cycles suffer from fluctuations in their cycle and so this method is quite risky.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Where to Go?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Counseling by a Doctor, Health Worker or at a Family Planning Clinic is recommended as all of these methods require a high level of motivation, commitment and good communication between partners.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Side Effects?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Advantages</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The advantage of natural methods is a better understanding of how a woman's body works. Natural methods cost nothing and are accessible.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Disadvanatges</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Restrictions on or abstinence from intercourse may cause stress or anxiety in a relationship, although other activities, such as non-penetrative sex, are an alternative. Natural methods offer no protection from STDs. There is also an increased risk of pregnancy.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>A</B></font> <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">condom is a fine rubber sheath, made from latex, worn on an erect penis. It prevents semen from entering another person's body and is used for contraception as well as for the prevention of STDs and HIV. Putting on a condom can be fun and could play a part in foreplay. Before using condoms, checking the use-by date on the packet is essential as latex deteriorates over time. The penis must be erect before a condom can be put on. Air must be squeezed out of the condom to allow space for semen and then gently rolled down over the penis as far as it will go. Only water-based lubricants can be used. Oil-based lubricants can weaken the latex, leading to the condom splitting or tearing. After ejaculation, the penis must be withdrawn before the erection is lost. Holding onto the rim of the condom ensures no semen escapes before withdrawal. When removing the condom, care must be taken not to spill any of the semen. Never dispose of the condom in the toilet - throw it in the bin. If used correctly, condoms are 99% effective.
</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Where to Go?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Condoms are freely available at pharmacies, Family Planning clinics, supermarkets, petrol stations, vending machines in pubs, clubs, cafes and discos and by mail order.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Side Effects?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
There are no chemical side effects with condoms - some people may have an allergy to the rubber or the lubricants, but this is rare.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Advantages</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The cost of condoms is low. Some Clinics give them away for free. Condoms allow the man to take responsibility for contraception and safer sex. They are a reliable method of contraception and provide protection from STDs.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>T</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">here are two main types of oral contraceptive pill:

<UL>
<LI>The combined pill, and<p>
<LI>The Mini-pill or Progesterone Pill<p>
</UL>
The combined pill contains two hormones.<p>

<oL>
<LI>The hormones stop the ovaries releasing an egg each month and change the mucus at the entrance to the womb and cervix.<p>
<LI>The combined pill also acts to thin the lining of the womb.<p>
</oL>
The mini-pill or progesterone-only pill. has one hormone and works by changing the mucus at the cervix so that sperm cannot pass through and fertilize the egg. As the pills contain hormones, most women experience what appears to be a period at the end of each cycle. By not taking the pill for seven days each month bleeding occurs. This menstruation-like bleeding is caused by hormone withdrawal. The blood is usually darker in color and has a much lighter flow.

</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Where to Go?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
A medical check up is necessary for a prescription. The pill is available at pharmacies or Family Planning Clinics.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Side Effects?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
While there are some good and some bad side effects to the pill, many users have no bad side effects from the pill at all. Good side effects include:

<UL>
<LI>regular periods that are shorter and lighter,<p>
<LI>improvement of acne<p>
<LI>improvement or absence of premenstrual syndrome.<p>
</UL>
Bad side effects include:

<UL>
<LI>slight bleeding (called spotting) between periods during early months of use<p>
<LI>weight gain or loss<p>
<LI>brown patches on the face when exposed to sunlight, though this is rare<p>
<LI>mood changes<p>
<LI>enlargement and soreness of the breasts<p>
</UL>
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Advantages</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The combined pill is about 99.5% effective if used as directed. The mini-pill is about 96% effective but must be taken at the same time each day. As the pill is a prescribed contraceptive, a woman must visit a medical practitioner to obtain repeat prescriptions, ensuring she maintains a regular health check regime. The pill is a very easy form of contraception to use.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Disadvantges</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
One of the disadvantages with the pill is the need for safe sex is sometimes dismissed as the chance of pregnancy is decreased. The pill gives no protection against STDs. The pill should not be taken by women who are likely to develop severe vascular (or circulatory) disease, such as those who smoke or have had vascular disease in the past. Blood is much more likely to clot while taking the pill so women with high blood pressure, blood clotting disorders or liver problems should not be using it. The pill introduces chemicals into the body.

They are worn inside the vagina and provide a barrier method of contraception like condoms. Diaphragms and caps cover the cervix, the entrance to the uterus, and prevent sperm entering. There is some debate about the need to use a spermicide with a diaphragm - if spermicide is used, only a small amount is necessary. If too much is applied, the diaphragm may slip out of position.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Where to Go?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diaphragms and caps must be the correct size. They require fitting by a doctor and a woman must be instructed on how to insert and remove it.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Side Effects?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
There are no chemical side effects - some women have a rare allergy to rubber and some women can develop the bladder infection cystitis.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Advantages</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diaphragms and caps are effective contraceptives, though not as reliable as condoms or the pill. They are non-interruptive to foreplay or sex.

It is a simple procedure involving cutting, tying and sealing both vas definers, the tubes running from the testes to the urethra and penis. A man is still able to ejaculate but there is no sperm in the semen. Sperm is still produced, but it does not reach the penis.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>T</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">he female condom, is a polyurethane sheath about 15 cm in length. It is designed to loosely line the inside of the vagina to prevent semen entering the body. At each end of the condom are two flexible rings. At the closed end one of the flexible rings is inserted into the vagina to hold the female condom in place.  A larger, fixed ring stays outside the vulva at the entrance to the vagina.  This ring acts as a guide for penetration and stops the sheath bunching up inside the vagina.

The female condom is available in the UK and the USA, but is not yet available in Australia. It has been approved for use in Australia but has not yet been marketed.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Advantages</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Polyurethane transmits heat, unlike latex used in condoms, so the female condom is the same temperature as the body. Oil-based lubricants do not damage the polyurethane. The female condom can be an effective method of contraception and it reduces the risk of STDs but its reliability as a contraceptive has not yet been established. Using a female condom gives a woman a contraceptive option that also ensures safe sex. The outer ring can increase sexual pleasure as it rubs against the clitoris. The  female condoms can be inserted anytime before intercourse so that the spontaneity of sex does not need to be interrupted.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Disadvantges</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Female condoms are more expensive than male condoms. There may be a slight reduction in sensitivity and they can be a little noisy. Some people may be put off by their appearance. The female condom may be difficult to insert at first, and the inner ring can cause a little discomfort. It is important for the women to guide the penis into the female condom as it can slip into the vagina outside the condom. Extra lubrication may be necessary to make intercourse easier and more enjoyable.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>D</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">epo-Provera is a type of injectable synthetic hormone that acts as a contraceptive - prevents pregnancy - by preventing ovulation.  A dose of Depo-Provera lasts for 3 months. Injectable synthetic hormones were first used in the 1960s for the treatment of endometriosis and miscarriages.<p>
Depo-Provera is injected deep into the muscles of the back or buttocks. It works by stopping the release of an egg, by changing the cervical mucus to form a barrier to the sperm and by thinning the lining of the womb and preventing the growth of a fertilized egg. The hormone also acts on the fallopian tubes to restrict travel through them by the sperm or egg.

</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Where to Go?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
A full medical examination by a doctor is required prior to prescribing Depo-Provera. Depo-Provera has been used for more than 20 years
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Side Effects?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
In the early stages of Depo-Provera use there will be a change in the menstrual cycle. After two or three injections most women will have no periods at all. Some women may experience spotting, irregular bleeding or occasionally, heavy bleeding. Weight gain or loss may occur. Other problems can include headaches, nervousness and occasionally, depression and loss of libido.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Advantages</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Depo-Provera is a very effective form of contraception. Each injection lasts for 3 months, so there is none of the risk - as with the pill, for example - of forgetting to take it.. It is as effective as the pill and more effective than an IUD or barrier methods. Depo-Provera can reduce the risk of cancer of the ovary and womb, thrush and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) as well as relieve the symptoms of endometriosis.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Disadvantges</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
If side effects occur they generally last for the 3 month period of the injection's efficacy. When Depo-Provera use is stopped, a delay in the return of normal periods and fertility may be experienced. It gives no protection from STDs and introduces chemicals into the body.

The head of the sperm contains the chromosomes, the middle piece supplies the energy, and the tail propels the sperm.  Sperm undergo several changes before they are ready to be ejaculated and take part in the conception process.<P>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">The sperm travel from the testes through the testicular duct system to the 'Epididymis' where they mature. When mature, sperm move from the 'Epididymis' to the ejaculatory duct, remaining there until ejaculation.  Prior to ejaculation, a man's penis becomes erect or 'stiff'. When the penis is placed inside a woman's vagina, it is stimulated. This stimulation most often leads to orgasm in a man.<P>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half3.GIF">At the point of orgasm, a man experiences contraction of the muscles in the base of the penis, lower abdomen and upper thighs and usually 'ejaculates'; or ejects semen from the penis  into the vagina. Ejaculation releases several hundred million sperm of which only one will successfully complete the journey to fertilize the ovum or egg.

<td align=left width=225 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">When the sperm moves from the ejaculatory duct it mixes with the secretions, known as semen, of the seminal vesicles and the prostrate gland. Semen nourishes the sperm and helps to lubricate their movement. Ejaculation most often places the sperm in the vagina near the opening of the uterus (the cervix).  For conception to occur, sperm must travel through the opening of the cervix, into the uterus and then into the fallopian tubes where the sperm is likely to encounter an ovum or egg.<P>

Sperm make this journey by swimming - lashing their tails to propel themselves and moving at a rate of about one or two centimeters per hour. The journey from the cervix to the ovum takes several hours for the sperm to complete. Once a sperm is in the uterus or fallopian tubes, it can live for 5-7 days.  Conception could occur any time during this period, if an ovum is present. The survival rate of sperm throughout the journey to the uterus is extremely low.<P>

Of the hundreds of millions of sperm ejaculated only a few thousand move into the uterus and of these only about fifty reach the ovum.

The eggs are designed to ripen progressively over thirty to forty years, through puberty until menopause. <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">The menstrual cycle lasts for about a month and begins when a hormone released by the pituitary gland stimulates an ovary to start ripening an egg. A woman has two ovaries and its most common for the production of ovum or eggs to alternate from one ovary to the other. <p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half3.GIF">Each cell ripening into an egg is nourished by 5000 other cells that will themselves never ripen.

At the time of ovulation, the follicle, filled with fluid under pressure which causes its wall to become thin, protrudes from the surface of the ovaries. The egg becomes detached within the follicle and floats freely in the fluid.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half4.GIF">At ovulation, the follicle wall breaks through the ovary's surface and the ovum or egg is released into the fallopian tube in a stream of fluid. Once the egg has entered the fallopian tube it begins its migration to the uterus.  The ovum takes three days to migrate a distance of between eight and thirteen centimeters from the fallopian tube to the uterus. The ovum has no means of self propulsion. It is moved along by the stream of fluid within the fallopian tube and the waving of branch like arms in the wall of the fallopian tubes. If the egg is not fertilized it will be expelled from the body in the subsequent menstrual flow.  The egg only lives for 12 to 24 hours after release from the ovary.

So when a woman misses a menstrual period she cannot be sure she's pregnant.  She should confirm this by having a  pregnancy test. The tests work on the fact that after conception, hormone levels increase and as early as ten days after missing a period these increased hormone levels can be detected in the urine and the blood of the mother to be.<p>

There are three ways to test for pregnancy.  Urine tests are simple and are available in a do it yourself kit or can be done by a doctor.

<td align=left width=225 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">Blood Tests are more accurate and the results have a ninety-eight per cent accuracy rate as early as two weeks after missing a period. Ultrasound is the external examination of the woman's abdomen using sound waves to detect any changes in shapes inside the body. Ultrasound is most commonly used to examine the health and formation of the embryo or fetus and is also capable of detecting pregnancy after ten days of missing a period.  Ultrasound can detect twins after three weeks and detect the  baby's organs after eight weeks. <p>

Ultrasound is not usually a test for pregnancy, and is only used in difficult diagnostic circumstances.  Ultrasound except in unusual circumstances is not recommended  until 16 weeks of pregnancy to detect abnormalities.

<I>The Embryo Develops</I><br>

During the first eight weeks of pregnancy the growing organism is known as an &quot;embryo&quot;.  From the beginning of the ninth week until birth it is known as a &quot;fetus&quot;.  In the first two weeks following fertilization, the egg burrows into the uterine lining reaching the blood vessels and nutrients below. A layer of cells forms across the cavity left by the burrowing egg and this forms  the &quot;embryonic disk&quot; in which the embryo will grow.<p>

The cells surrounding the "embryonic disk&quot; will develop into the fetal membranes and the placenta, which becomes the  embryos lifeline to the mother. The fetal membranes form a sac filled with fluid in which the fetus will float and be protected until birth. The placenta sustains the life of the embryo and fetus by providing nutrients and oxygen and by carrying away fetal waste.<p>

As the embryo develops, the flow of nutrients and oxygen takes place through the umbilical cord which connects the fetal circulatory system to the placenta. The blood of the mother and the fetus are separated by the placental membrane.  The placental membrane also prevents some harmful substances from being transferred to the fetus. <p>

This barrier is NOT effective against drugs and many infectious agents such as syphilis and HIV. In the third week, the embryonic disk forms three distinct layers  These layers will develop into:

<OL>
<LI>the internal organs;<p>
<LI>the muscles, skeleton and blood; and<p>
<LI>the brain, nerves, skin and other tissues.<p>
</OL>
The head of the embryo develops faster than the rest of the body and by the end of the third week the eyes and the ears are developing and the brain and other portions of the central nervous system are beginning to form. <p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">By the end of the first month the embryo has a basic heart and the beginnings of a digestive system. In the fifth week, arms and legs begin to form.  Between weeks six and eight fingers and toes develop and  bones begin to harden with calcium. <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half3.GIF">By the end of eight weeks the beginnings of all essential structures are in place and by four months the major organs are well formed.<p>

<I>The Mother in the First Trimester</I><br>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half4.GIF">The effects of pregnancy may vary in intensity from woman to woman.  However, in the early stages, fatigue and drowsiness are common, along with occasional nausea. A woman may also be prone to mood swings from delight, satisfaction and anticipation to worry, anger and depression, depending on her desire to have a baby.

<I>Life as a Fetus</I><p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half1.GIF">During the second trimester, internal organ systems mature and there is a significant increase in the size of the fetus. By the end of the sixth month, the fetus weighs about two pounds or nearly one kilogram and is about fourteen inches or thirty-five centimeters long.  <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">Among other changes, the fetus has developed a fine coat of hair on the body.  By the end of this trimester the facial and bodily features are well formed.  At this stage, the fetus now has periods of waking and sleeping and it will react to sudden movement by the Mother and to loud noises outside the Mother's body.<p>

<I>The Mother in the Second Trimester</I><p>

The pregnant woman may also experience some discomfort during second trimester. Pressure from the expanding uterus may lead to indigestion, constipation; and varicose veins and hemorrhoids may appear or worsen.  This is however more common in the third trimester. Many women gain weight at this time and may also experience fluid retention causing swelling of the feet and ankles.

<I>The Fetus Matures</I><p>



<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half1.GIF">The third trimester is a period of further development and growth for the fetus. The fetus is developing well enough to survive on its own and the baby born by the middle of the final trimester or six weeks early has a seventy to eighty per cent chance of survival.<p>



<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">Early in the third trimester the fetus is in an upright or "breech" position and will most likely assume a  "head down" position ready for birth by the end of the trimester. During the final month of the pregnancy the fetus develops the lungs in readiness for outside life, unsupported by the Mother's body. Although size and weight varies significantly, at birth  the "average" baby weighs seven and a half pounds or nearly three and a half kilos and is twenty inches or about fifty centimeters in length.

.<p>



<I>The Mother in the Third Trimester</I><p>



<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half3.GIF">A woman feels many discomforts in the third trimester and most of these are due to the increased size of the fetus which displaces and presses on the mother's organs. The occasional fetal movement or "kicking" of the second trimester has now changed into constant kicking, tossing and turning which can leads to discomfort and sleepless nights for the mother. By the ninth month of pregnancy some women may become anxious about many things including the sex and health of the baby through to the delivery process and associated pain and trauma.

The woman can only move her legs to change the angle and depth of penetration. This position offers easy eye contact, kissing, deep penetration, and a high level of clitoral stimulation. The man lies on top of the woman and he guides or she guides his erect penis into the vagina. In this position he can control his thrusting, slowing down or speeding up to control when he orgasms.<IMG hspace=2 vspace=2 align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/full2.GIF"> She can spread her legs or wrap them around his buttocks for some control over his thrusting. <p>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Chlamydia is a bacterial infection of the genitals, anus or throat. It is similar to, but often more serious than gonorrhea.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Symptoms can occur within 2-14 days after the infection, however most people show no signs for months or years. If a woman has symptoms they may include a change in her vaginal secretions, lower abdominal pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding. Men may have a urethral discharge, pain when urinating or urethral irritation. Inflammation of the male urethra caused by chlamydia is known as non-specific urethritis, NSU or more recently as non-gonoccocal urethrititis, NGU. Inflammation of a woman's cervix is known as cervicitis.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diagnosis in women requires analysis of a cervical smear and in men, an examination of the discharge from the penis under a microscope.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Chlamydia is treated with an appropriate course of antibiotics taken orally. In severe cases, sufferers are treated with intravenous antibiotics in hospital. The full course, 10 to 14 days, must be completed, with a follow-up test to ensure the infection has passed.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Chlamydia can only be transmitted through sexual intercourse. As the Bacteria cannot live outside the body,  it cannot be caught from toilet seats, swimming pools, spas or normal social contact.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
If left untreated in women, CHLAMYDIA may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease or PID, an inflammation of the fallopian tubes. PID may cause an ectopic or tubal pregnancy, infertility or chronic pelvic pain. Men may develop epididymitis, an inflammation in the scrotum, chronic urethral irritation, or chronic testicular discomfort. It may also cause infertility in men.


</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The risk of spreading Chlamydia infections is high because it frequently occurs without symptoms. Condoms used during sexual intercourse can reduce transmission of chlamydia.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Genital warts are caused by a group of viruses called the human papilloma viruses or HPV. The warts form on, in  or around the genitals and anus. There are over 60 different types of HPV - so far only 14 have been found to cause warts in the genital area.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The only symptoms of infection are the warts themselves. Genital warts vary in size and shape and are similar in appearance to plantar warts. They are typically hard and yellow-gray when formed on dry skin and tend to be pink, soft and take on a cauliflower appearance in moist areas like the lower vagina.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diagnosis of genital warts is generally made by a clinical inspection of the warts.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Freezing the warts (cryotherapy) with liquid nitrogen is the preferred choice of removal. One alternative treatment involves painting the warts with a special  alcohol-based solution over a period of several days, causing them to dry up and fall off. The solution is not recommended for warts that form on the cervix or during pregnancy. The warts may also be surgically removed or burnt off by a doctor using electrodes or laser. Although the warts can be physically removed, treatment does not eliminate the virus from the body, so the warts may recur.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
HPV, the virus that causes genital warts, is generally transmitted by sexual contact. The incubation period may vary from a few weeks to a couple of years. The virus can be passed to infants from their mother during birth.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Genital warts in themselves are not dangerous, but different forms of the HPV virus have been linked with cervical and penile cancers. HPV has been found in the reproductive tract of at least 85% of women with pre cancerous lesions of the cervix and also in women with abnormalities of the cervix.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
No vaccine for Human papilloma  or HPV exists. The use of condoms may reduce the risk of transmission but much depends on where the warts are located. For safety, it is best to avoid all sexual contact until the warts are removed and the area has healed.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection. It is one of the most common types of STD that affects both men and women. Once infected, gonorrhea grows and multiplies quickly in the moist, warm areas of the cervix, urinary tract, mouth or rectum.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Occasionally there are no symptoms.<p>

If symptoms do develop, they usually appear within 2 - 10 days of intimate sexual contact and are often mild. The initial symptoms in women include a painful or burning sensation when urinating, or a yellowish vaginal discharge. More advanced symptoms include abdominal pain, bleeding between periods, vomiting or fever. Men usually have a discharge from the penis and experience a burning sensation, sometimes severe, during urination. Symptoms of rectal infection include discharge, anal itching and in some cases, painful bowel movements.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diagnosis involves normal bacterial testing under laboratory conditions. The tests are more accurate for men than for women. The accuracy in male diagnosis is more than 90%, falling to about 66% for women.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Antibiotics are recommended for the treatment of Gonorrhea. The patient must take the full course and revisit their doctor or clinic for a follow-up examination. All sexual partners should be tested and treated, even if they show no signs of the infection.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Gonorrhea is transmitted by vaginal, anal or oral sex. It can also pass from an infected mother to her newborn baby during childbirth causing eye infection.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
If left untreated, gonorrhea will seriously affect the bloodstream, joints, heart valves or the brain. In women there is threat of pelvic inflammatory disease or PID, which can cause scarring of the fallopian tubes and infertility.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The use of condoms during sexual activities is an effective method of preventing infection. Diaphragms and spermicidal foams, creams and jellies containing Nonoxynol-9 may also reduce the risk, but they are best used in conjunction with a condom. There is no build-up of immunity to gonorrhea - it can be acquired more than once.</font></td>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Pediculosis pubis, pubic lice or crabs are tiny crab-like creatures that live in pubic hair and, sometimes, in other hair below the neck. Pubic lice feed on blood. The crab fixes its mouth against the skin and stabs an opening through which to feed. Its saliva stops the blood from clotting and, as the victim's heart pumps, blood is pumped into the crab's stomach.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The main symptom of pubic lice is an itch caused by an allergic reaction to the bites. Blue marks may appear on the skin from the feeding lice and black spots of digested blood in lice excreta become evident in underwear.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diagnosis is usually visual.  In the adult stage, pubic lice are large enough to be seen by the naked eye.


</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Shaving or the use of insecticides do not kill the eggs of pubic lice. The best treatments are medically prescribed and applied to all hairy areas below the neck and washed off 12 hours later.  Treatments may be available over the counter from chemist shops. Some treatments are not recommended for pregnant or breast-feeding women. All clothes and bedclothes must be washed on the hot cycle and dried on the hot cycle or dry cleaned to ensure the eggs are destroyed.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Pubic lice are generally spread sexually but may also be transmitted by contact with an infested towel, bedding or, in rare cases, a toilet seat. While 'crabs' can only survive for about 24 hours without a host, the eggs may lay in bedding or towels and can take up to seven days to hatch.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
'Crabs' are more a nuisance than a disease. Because the body has no natural defense against such parasites, the infestation will not disappear on its own, so appropriate treatment should be sought.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
A person with crabs should ensure that people with whom they have been in close contact, particularly sexual contact, are treated to avoid infestation.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Syphilis is a sexually transmitted bacterial infection. It can also be transmitted from a pregnant woman to her unborn child.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Syphilis progresses through several stages, each of which has characteristic symptoms. In the first or primary stage, a painless ulcer appears at the site of infection 2-4 weeks after contact. In women, the ulcer usually forms on the vaginal walls or on the cervix. It may also appear on the labia. In men, the ulcer usually forms on the tip of the penis or sometimes on the scrotum or the penile shaft. If the mode of transmission is oral, the ulcer may appear on the lips or tongue. If infected during anal sex, the rectum may become the site for the ulcer. The ulcer disappears after a few weeks. If the infection is not treated, syphilis will remain within the body. The secondary stage begins a few weeks to a few months later. It is indicated by the appearance of a skin rash consisting of painless, reddish raised bumps that later darken and burst, oozing a discharge.<p>

Other symptoms include sores in the mouth, painful swelling of the joints, sore throat, headache and fever - much like flu. The infection is contagious during the primary stage and for several years into the secondary stage. When the symptoms disappear and the infection enters a latent stage, it may lie dormant for 1 to 40 years. The offending bacteria continue to multiply during this stage and burrow into the circulatory system, central nervous system and bones.<p>

The disease often progresses to a late or tertiary stage causing large ulcers to form on the digestive organs, liver, lungs, skin, muscle tissue or other organs. While this ulcer can be destructive, it can be successfully treated. Serious damage can occur when the infection attacks the cardiovascular system or the central nervous system. The damage to the central nervous system can cause brain damage and result in paralysis or a form of deteriorating mental illness.<p>

Often the primary and secondary symptoms disappear so patients assume, incorrectly, they are no longer infected. If diagnosed at either the primary or secondary stages, there is time to treat the disease. Once it reaches the tertiary stage  the consequences can be dire if the disease remains untreated.

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Broad spectrum antibiotic treatments are recommended. Pregnant women should be treated with specific antibiotics. Periodic repeat blood tests are recommended to ensure the infection has been arrested. Like gonorrhea, successful treatment does not prevent re infection. All sex partners should be told of an infection and seek the advice of a doctor.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
You can get Syphilis through vaginal or anal intercourse, oral-genital contact or by touching an infectious sore or ulcer.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
If untreated, syphilis lapses into a latent phase during which the patient is no longer contagious. Many people will suffer no more consequences of the disease. However, 15% to 40% of people infected with Syphilis go on to develop the complications of tertiary syphilis where the bacteria damages the heart, eyes, brain, nervous system, bones and joints. The final stage can lead to mental illness, blindness, heart disease and death.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Thrush or Candidiasis is caused by a yeast usually present in the mouth or bowel of men and women called Candida albicans. Yeasts thrive in  warm, moist environments. Mostly, thrush is harmless. Occasionally it multiplies and causes an infection. Thrush is not considered  a sexually transmitted infection.  About  25% of women carry Candida in the vagina generally without symptoms.  Semen can affect the pH in the vagina and trigger an infection. In men, the infection often takes the form of an infection of the genital skin.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
When symptoms occur in women, they usually affect the vulva and vagina, causing itching and a thick white discharge. There may also be swelling of the vulva and pain when passing urine. 'Thrush' is one of the commonest causes of an abnormal vaginal discharge. When symptoms occur in men, they involve itching and burning during urination, or a reddening of the penis.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diagnosis is usually made on the basis of symptoms. A microscopic examination of vaginal or penile fluids may be used to detect the presence of yeast cells.

</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Vaginal tablets or cream containing anti fungal agents inserted into the vagina are an effective treatment. An anti fungal cream should also be applied to the vulva. A tampon dipped in cold unflavoured yogurt and inserted into the vagina can relieve the itching. The yogurt must contain live lactobacilli to balance the acidity within the vagina. The treatment for men with thrush is the application of a cream rubbed into the penis after showering.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Most infections are believed to be caused by an overgrowth of the 'yeast' normally found in the vagina, and not usually by sexual transmission. The fungus may be transmitted sexually - but this is unusual. The fungus can also be transmitted by sharing a moist towel or washcloth. The use of antibiotics  pregnancy, diabetes, stress, wearing tight clothing or nylon underwear may also increase the risk of thrush. Basically anything that keeps the genitals warm and moist will increase the risk of thrush.

</font><p>







<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Women should avoid products which can irritate the skin such as perfumed and non-perfumed soaps, vaginal deodorants and disinfectants. Always wash and wipe from front to back to avoid contaminating the vulva with yeasts that may be present in the bowel.<p>

Recurrence is common, so sexual partners must be told if their partner suffers from thrush as the infection can be passed back and forth, either sexually or by sharing towels.<p>

Some people believe that eating yogurt with live lactobacilli may reduce the recurrence of yeast infections.  Tablets containing lactobacilli are also available.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Vaginitis is a general term that refers to any form of vaginal inflammation. Different types of vaginitis are caused by different micro-organisms. There are three types of vaginitis:

<UL>
<LI>Bacterial vaginosis<p>
<LI>Candidiasis or thrush	and<p>
<LI>Trichomonias, caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis <p>
</UL>
Bacterial vaginosis or BV is the most common form of vaginitis, followed by Candidiasis and Trichomoniasis.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Most women have no symptoms. The most prominent symptom is a thin foul-smelling discharge from the vagina, often described as fishy or musty. The smell can be worse after sexual intercourse. A small number of women also experience soreness of the vulva.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Diagnosis is usually on clinical symptoms and microscopic examination of the discharge or an accurate diagnosis can be determined by growing cultures from vaginal secretions.

</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
There are many treatments, but a single dose of antibiotics is usually given for bacterial vaginosis.  Anti-bacterial creams or vaginal tablets, are also available for  these infections

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Vaginitis is not always sexually transmitted. Sexually active women are at no greater risk than women who have not had sex at all. The infections are generally the result of an imbalance in the bacteria occurring naturally in the vagina. This imbalance can be brought about by stress, allergic reactions or semen. Yeast infections can also be passed from one woman to another through sex or by sharing damp towels and washcloths.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
While only women can have vaginal infections, the microbes causing them may also cause problems for men.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Trichomoniasis or 'trich' is a sexually transmitted disease caused by a single-celled parasite.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Like many STDs, trich often occurs without symptoms. When symptoms do occur they invariably do so within 4 to 20 days of exposure. They may also occur years after infection. In women, symptoms can include a heavy, yellow-green or gray vaginal discharge, abdominal pain, discomfort during sexual intercourse and painful urination. Sometimes, itching of the external genital area also occurs. In men, there may be a whitish discharge from the penis and painful or difficult urination. Most infections in men cause no symptoms at all.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Trich in women is usually diagnosed by microscopic examination of a small amount of vaginal fluid. It can also be diagnosed by a cervical smear. The most accurate diagnosis in men is made by growing a culture from a sample of fluid from the penis.

</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Most men recover from Trichomoniasis without treatment within a few weeks. There are medically prescribed drugs available. As the infection may have been transmitted to a partner, the prescribed medication should be taken by both partners. The prescribed medication  should not be taken during the first three months of pregnancy.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Trichomoniasis is mainly spread by sexual intercourse. The organism can survive for a few hours in vaginal fluid, semen or urine, on damp towels, washcloths or bed clothes. It is rarely passed onto babies during birth.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Although Trichomoniasis poses no great threat to health, it often occurs along with other STDs such as gonorrhea. It is important for a person with trich to be checked out for other infections.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Most  men and women, experience no symptoms when infected with Trichomoniasis, so the infection is easily passed back and forth. A condom is recommended during sexual intercourse.

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Hepatitis, or inflammation of the liver, has a number of causes including alcohol, chemicals, drugs and infection by one of four viruses: Hepatitis A, B, C and D. Hepatitis A is found in the saliva, blood, faeces and urine. Hepatitis B and C are passed by sexual contact, including anal or oral sex and can be passed non-sexually by blood transfusion, shared razors, toothbrushes, needles or similar personal effects. Hepatitis D is transmitted through the transfusion of contaminated blood, blood products or through sexual contact.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
<I>Hepatitis A:
</I><br>
The virus can take from 10 to 50 days before any symptoms are obvious. Not everyone becomes ill. When symptoms appear they include nausea, a slight increase in temperature, some loss of weight and a yellow coloring. The yellow is most noticeable in the eyes. There may be some tenderness just below the ribs on the right side of the body where the liver is.<p>

<I>Hepatitis B:
</I><br>
As with A, there may be no symptoms. Some people show symptoms in six weeks, others six months after being infected. The Symptoms are similar to hepatitis A - nausea, a slight increase in temperature, some loss of weight and a yellow coloring.<p>

<I>Hepatitis C and D: </I><br>

These two viruses take up to 50 days after infection to show any symptoms. If there are any symptoms, they are similar to those for Hepatitis A and B.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
All of the hepatitis viruses are diagnosed through blood tests.
</font><p>


<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
There is no medical treatment for hepatitis A, B, C, or D. Rest, good diet, avoidance of alcohol and other substances that affect the liver helps speed recovery. Some cases of chronic hepatitis B and C can be treated with frequent injections of alpha interferon over several months. Vaccine immunization is available.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Hepatitis A is most commonly spread in food or water  contaminated with infected human faeces. It is common in countries without sophisticated sewerage systems. Hepatitis is spread from person to person by contact with faeces and urine. This can happen in sexual activities where infected secretions come in contact with the mouth. The virus may also be present on a used condom, so it is important to wash your hands after its removal. Eating uncooked infested shellfish is another means of transmission. Hepatitis B is spread the same way as HIV - by sex, blood or from mother to baby. Unlike HIV, hepatitis B also spreads through body secretions and is much more infectious. The virus is found in blood, vaginal secretions, semen, faeces, breast milk, fluid from cuts and sores, saliva, sweat and tears. Hepatitis B can also be spread by contaminated instruments used in ear-piercing, tattooing, acupuncture or by sharing razors or needles. It is most likely to be transmitted to health workers in contact with the blood or secretions of infected patients. It can also be transmitted by sharing toothbrushes, razors or other personal items that may lead to the exchange of bodily secretions such as blood and saliva.<p>

Hepatitis C is spread through contact with contaminated blood and, in some circumstances ,by sexual intercourse with an infected person. It is a very recent form of hepatitis and blood tests to detect the virus are not conclusive. Hepatitis D is less common than B, but is also a dangerous and sexually transmissible infection. It can be spread by contaminated blood. Hepatitis D is a tiny virus with the potential to infect someone who already has hepatitis B. If both infections occur at the same time, severe illness resulting in liver failure, can occur.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
There are no long term complications involved with Hepatitis A. Hepatitis A does not recur and sufferers do not become carriers. Hepatitis B, C, and D are not so innocuous. Not only are they highly infectious but they are damaging. About 5% of hepatitis B sufferers never recover and can become carriers who remain infectious. With Hepatitis B, C, and D, the liver bleeds profusely stopping the manufacture of proteins. Some patients die, others live with chronic liver disease. Hepatoma or cancer of the liver can also occur.<p>

Persistent hepatitis B infection can also include kidney or blood vessel disease and other chronic medical conditions. Past Hepatitis B carriers who become HIV positive may have a recurrence of Hepatitis B, and are more likely to become chronic carriers. Up to half of the people who catch hepatitis C are thought to develop liver problems. A person who has cleared Hepatitis B from their body is immune to Hepatitis D and cannot be infected by the Hepatitis D virus.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
If traveling to a country where Hepatitis A is common, have a medically supervised injection of immunoglobulin prior to departure. Hepatitis B vaccines are available from doctors and Family Planning clinics. Use condoms for penetrative sex.  Always wash hands after sexual activity.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Genital Herpes is a contagious viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). While there is no cure, it is manageable. Two types of virus can cause genital herpes: HSV type 2 and type1. Type 1 more commonly causes oral herpes, known as cold sores but it can cause genital herpes as well.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Symptoms of a first episode occur within two to ten days of exposure to the virus and last an average of two to three weeks. The early symptoms can include pain in the legs, buttocks or genital area, vaginal discharge or a feeling of pressure in the abdominal region. Within a few days, sores or lesions appear on the penis, the vulva, inside the vagina or around the anus. Sores can also appear on the buttocks, thighs or internally, on the woman's cervix or male urinary passage. Over a period of days the sores become crusted and heal without scarring. Symptoms often accompanying a first infection can include fever, headache, muscle aches, painful or difficult urination and swollen glands. Some people experience no symptoms but still have the lesions and arestill infectious. <p>

A recurrent outbreak of genital herpes may be signaled by a tingling sensation in the genital area or pain in the buttocks, legs or wherever the site of infection is. Recurrent infections are usually milder and shorter than the initial episode.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The most accurate test is a viral culture. It may take several laboratory tests to distinguish the virus from other infections. The sores of genital herpes in its active stage are usually visible to the naked eye.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Anti viral agents are effective in treating an initial episode of genital herpes. Since recurrent attacks are less severe, anti viral creams can be used. There are a few important steps to speed healing and avoid the spread of infection to other sites, and to other people. To prevent the development of secondary infections, keep the infected area clean and dry. Bathe the area with warm, salty water. Use simple analgesics to relieve pain. Try to avoid touching the sores. If this is unavoidable, hands should be washed immediately. Sexual contact should be avoided from the first recognized symptom through to the sores being completely healed.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Genital herpes is usually acquired through sexual contact with someone who has an outbreak of herpes sores. People with oral herpes can transmit the infection to the genital area of a partner during oral-genital sex. In some cases it can be transmitted by a person who has no noticeable symptoms. It is unlikely the virus can be spread by contact with an object such as a toilet seat.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Genital herpes can be a risk to a newborn baby if the mother has an outbreak at the time of childbirth, particularly if this outbreak is a primary infection. If the baby is infected while passing through the birth canal, the virus may cause blindness, brain damage or even death. If a woman has a past history of the virus, she and her doctor should be aware that if herpes lesions are present at the time of delivery a Cesarean should be performed. If a woman contracts herpes for the first time during a pregnancy, she increases the risk of miscarriage or premature delivery. There is also risk of passing the virus on to the unborn child. Recurrent episodes do not appear to carry the same level of risk.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
It is wise to avoid genital contact until the sores have healed completely. The HSV-2 virus cannot pass through a condom. If you must have intercourse during an outbreak use of a condom as well as a spermicide containing Nonoxynol-9 is recommended. Nonoxynol-9 has shown to be toxic to the herpes virus in laboratory tests. There is no guarantee a condom will not break or fall off, and it may not cover all of the exposed areas. Regular sleeping habits, avoiding unnecessary stress, avoiding excessive exposure to the sun and taking good care of general health can reduce recurring outbreaks.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>What is it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Pelvic inflammatory disease is one of the most serious and common complications associated with STDs. PID is an infection of the upper genital tract and can affect the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes or other related areas. It can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term) and can lead to infertility, tubal pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain and other serious conditions.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How to recognize the symptoms?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The major symptoms of PID are lower abdominal pain, discharge from the cervix or vagina and fever. As with most STDs, the symptoms may not be obvious. If associated with chlamydia, there may be no symptoms at all but serious damage can occur  to the pelvic organs.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Diagnosis</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Symptoms alone are not enough to diagnose PID. Laboratory tests may aid the diagnosis but a laparoscopy is usually performed to confirm PID. Laparoscopy involves a small incision under the navel into which a lighted tube is inserted to view the internal organs. A tissue sample may be taken if necessary.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Treatment</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
A number of organisms can cause pelvic inflammatory disease. It is, therefore, difficult to determine which organisms cause the infection, so broad spectrum antibiotics are usually administered. Hospitalization may be necessary if the symptoms are severe and if tubal pregnancy or other abdominal problems are suspected. Pregnant patients are also hospitalized.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>How do you get it?</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
PID occurs when disease-causing organisms move towards the reproductive organs from the vagina and the cervix. The cervix usually acts as a barrier to infection by producing mucus which flows down into the vagina. Abortion, miscarriage, childbirth, use of an IUD or surgical procedures such as a curette can cause infection to break through the cervical barrier. Most cases are associated with gonorrhea and chlamydia. Infections are thought to attach themselves to sperm during intercourse, enabling travel into the uterus and fallopian tubes. The organisms may also gain easier access during menstruation.
</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Consequences</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
PID can be a recurrent infection in many women. The long-term consequences include infertility, tubal pregnancy or chronic pelvic pain. Complications can be reduced by early diagnosis and treatment.

</font><p>



<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>Health Tips</B></font><br>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Use of condoms during sexual intercourse may reduce the risk of PID. Always  be aware of the symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease. Each recurrence of PID increases the risk of infertility.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>U</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">sing needles or fits to inject drugs means that a needle is inserted into the body. When the needle is extracted, some blood is drawn back up into the hollow core of the needle and into the syringe. If a second person uses the needle without cleaning it, blood from the first user comes in contact with the blood of the second user. Sharing uncleaned needles can result in injecting the HIV virus directly into the bloodstream.<p>

There is a misunderstanding about the way HIV is transmitted intravenously. It is not from the drugs - injecting anything, pills, smack, coke, speed, steroids or even water can transmit the virus if the needle is shared. It's not what you use, it's how you use it.<p>

The best option for safety is to use a new fit everytime. These  are available at pharmacies or needle exchange centres. Get rid of used fits safely. Do not dump them in parks, at beaches or in the street. Cap the fit and deposit it into a strong unbreakable container with a lid, like coffee jar or drink bottle and put the container in a rubbish bin. If a new needle is not available, it is possible to clean a used one. The cleaning  procedure must be followed to the letter and performed immediately before use, every time, regardless of whose needle it is. HIV is a fragile virus, easily destroyed by heat, soap, bleach and other disinfectants. It can live for up to 4 hours in blood left in a syringe, rinsing water, filter or on a spoon. The most effective way of cleaning a fit is to rinse well in clean, cold water until all traces of blood are gone, then rinse it again for safety. Draw water through the needle into the syringe making sure the barrel is full and squirt it down the drain. Repeat the process using fresh water each time. Shake the syringe with water in it to remove any blood debris. Make sure the entire needle, not just the tip, is covered in water. Completely fill the needle and syringe with full strength household bleach. Shake the syringe for at least 30 seconds before emptying - do this at least twice. Rinse the syringe at least twice with clean, cold water - more is always best. Repeat the process if there is any sign of blood in the syringe or if unsure about how effective the cleaning has been. After injecting, rinse the fit with clean, cold water immediately. Water and bleach should never be re-used - pour them down the drain. Never swallow or inject the bleach, it won't kill the HIV in the body but will cause much pain.<p>

It must be stressed that cleaning cannot be 100% guaranteed to kill HIV and Hepatitis, but it is far better to clean than not to. The best option is to always use a new needle and syringe every time you use one. The cleaning method described should only be used if new sterilized needles are unavailable.

There is no way to be 100% sure that HIV or other STDs will not be spread but safe sex practices have been shown to be highly effective in the prevention of HIV and STD transmission. Safe sex means taking precautions to stop semen or pre-ejaculate (pre-cum), blood or vaginal fluid from one person getting into the bloodstream of another person.<p>

Abstinence, or no sex at all, is obviously safe. Kissing does not involve semen, vaginal fluids or blood so is safe - unless both partners have sores, open cuts or bleeding gums. Massage, stroking and mutual masturbation are all forms of sexual enjoyment with only skin to skin contact, and will not pass on HIV. The only risks with mutual masturbation are cuts or sores on the hands, penis or vaginal area coming into contact with infected semen or vaginal fluids - latex gloves can be worn if needed or broken skin covered with plasters.


</font></td>



<td align=left width=300 valign=top> <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Studies show that oral sex is a low risk activity for HIV, although it is safest to avoid semen or menstrual blood in the mouth, particularly if there are cuts, sores on the lips, mouth infections or bleeding gums. Barriers such as condoms or latex 'dams' can be used. A dental dam is a thin piece of latex which is be placed over the vagina or anal area during oral sex. Rimming, or oral-anal contact, is a low-risk activity as far as HIV is concerned but is a risk for hepatitis. A 'dam', or condom split into a square is recommended.<p>

Penis-vagina and penis-anus sex are safe when condoms are used properly. Condoms offer the best protection against HIV and other STDs.

At some stage most of us will be faced with a situation where the introduction of a condom may seem difficult. Just remember HIV/AIDS can affect us all - it does not discriminate.<p>

People who insist on condom use are not suggesting a partner sleeps around or is dirty. They simply want to enjoy their health and live. Don't make assumptions about your partner. Having unprotected sex with someone is having sex with every person with whom they have had unprotected sex.

Women should not feel they are an 'easy lay' because they carry condoms, and men should not be seen as expecting sex because they carry them. Just be prepared.
Making the decision beforehand will ensure safer, more enjoyable sex.

Anyone who is sexually active is at risk of contracting an STD. STDs affect men and women of all backgrounds and socio-economic levels, but are most prevalent among teenagers and young adults.<p>

Nearly one third of all cases involve teenagers. The incidence of STDs in young people is rising because sexual activity is occurring at an earlier age.  Young people are also more likely to have more than one partner and frequently change partners. There is no way to tell if someone in a crowd has an STD. It won't be the most attractive or the ugliest person, not the best dressed or the sloppiest, it will have nothing to do with income or personality. A risky partner is one who has unprotected sex with other people, injects drugs, has an unknown sexual background or hasn't been fully tested for STDs.<p>

There are questions you should ask yourself about your current sexual relationships that may help to measure the level of risk.

<OL>
<LI>Is there any risk of me catching an STD?<p>
<LI>How many partners do I have?<p>
<LI>How often do I change partners?<p>
<LI>Is my partner being faithful to me?<p>
<LI>If I am not being faithful, why should my partner be faithful?<p>
<LI>What is my partner's sexual history?<p>
<LI>Am I sure that I am not carrying any infection?<p>
</OL>
Only when you can honestly answer these questions will you know what risk you are taking with sexually transmitted diseases. Keep the risks of STD transmission to a minimum by taking all possible precautions.

<UL>
<LI>Abstinence or self-masturbation are the only totally safe options<p>
<LI>Non-penetrative sex is the safest form of sex with a partner.<p>
<LI>Sex toys can be safe if treated properly but wash them well and use a condom if they are shared.<p>
<LI>If you have multiple partners, have regular STD checks.<p>
<LI>Condoms provide good protection - always use one.<p>
<LI>Talk to your partner before you start having sex, so you can assess the risk.<p>
<LI>If there is any doubt, you both should be fully tested.<p>
<LI>It is best to use condoms for the first six months of a relationship just to be sure.<p>
<LI>Use a dental dam or condom for oral genital contact.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>C</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">ountless myths surround diseases that are not fully understood - and HIV is one of those diseases. The idea that being infected with HIV is the same as having AIDS is perhaps the most prevalent myth.<p>

Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV is the virus which results in Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS. Once a person is infected with HIV, the virus slowly attacks the white blood cells which fight off infection within the body. When the immune system is damaged, the body's ability to fight off infection and disease is reduced. The later stage of HIV infection is called AIDS. People may be infected with HIV for years without developing AIDS.<p>

<I>You'd know if you were infected with HIV.</I><br>

Many people have no symptoms of HIV infection, and no knowledge that a sexual or drug-using partner is carrying the virus. A blood test is the only way to know.<p>

<I>You can always tell if someone is infected with HIV.</I><br>

People with HIV don't necessarily have visible symptoms. Dramatic images of people in the final stages of AIDS represent only a small percentage of people with HIV.<p>

<I>Employers have a right to know if an employee has HIV.</I><br>

There is no legal requirement to notify an employer.
People with HIV have the same rights and responsibilities as other members of the workforce.<p>

<I>AIDS is transmitted via toilet seats, silverware, shaking hands or kissing a person with AIDS</I>.<br>

One of the biggest myths regarding AIDS is that it is easy to contract.<p>

Unlike other viruses AIDS cannot live in air, food or water. You can't contract HIV from a swimming pool or from sharing food or drink with an infected person. You cannot be infected by using the same bathroom, silverware, shaking hands or kissing an HIV positive person.<p>

<I>Only people in certain "risk groups" get AIDS.</I><br>

In the first few years of the epidemic it was thought that only certain groups acquired HIV. Today we know that HIV can be contracted by anyone, regardless of age, gender, sexual preference or race. We know that there are "high risk behaviors". These are any activity involving the exchange of body fluids like semen or blood<p>


<I>You can't get  HIV the first time you have sex</I>.<br>

It is possible to become infected with HIV through a single exposure. Like pregnancy, HIV can follow just one instance of sexual intercourse.<p>

<I>You can get  HIV from performing CPR on an infected person</I>.<br>

While the HIV has been found to be present in saliva, it is not in sufficient quantities to be infectious. However, lifeguards, paramedics, police officers and firefighters often wear protective masks when performing CPR in case there is blood in the victim's mouth.<p>

<I>Mosquitoes, ticks or other biting insects can transmit the virus.</I><br>

Mosquitoes and ticks can only take blood out of the body.
They are not able to inject it. Were they capable of sucking one and injecting another, the amount of blood removed would not be enough to contain sufficient quantities of the virus to cause an infection. HIV cannot be transmitted or contracted by animals.<p>

<I>HIV can be transmitted on the sports field.</I><br>

While the virus may be found in an infected person's sweat, it is in such small quantities that it poses no risk to other athletes. Although blood is prevalent during some contact sports it is not possible to contract HIV  by having infected blood splashed on unbroken skin. First Aid precautions are taken in most major sports today, including covering open cuts and abrasions.<p>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>T</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">here is no conclusive evidence about where or how HIV started. There are a few theories but most agree that it has probably been around for decades, unrecognized. Although the virus was only identified in the 1980s, it has been around
since at least the early 1950s. HIV was found to have caused the death of a seaman in 1959. It is believed that, like many human viruses, HIV developed from an animal virus. Several viruses similar to HIV have been found in animals, and some of them have been around for 50­150 years. Another theory is that related strains of the virus may have originated in monkeys and chimpanzees in West Africa.<p>

Some scientists suspect the virus was introduced to humans as the unintended result of malaria experiments dating from the 1920s to the 1950s. The experiments were intended to find whether malaria parasites in the primates would infect people. Humans were injected with the blood from the monkeys, which may have been infected with the viral forebears of HIV.<p>

Michael Gottlieb of UCLA was the first physician to describe the effects of AIDS in medical journals. His investigations began in 1981 when a number of his male patients were suffering from a rare type of pneumonia This pneumonia is typically associated with cancer patients whose immune systems are suppressed by chemotherapy. Some of Gottlieb's patients also suffered other ailments associated with suppressed immune systems. While patients normally recovered from these complaints, these men all died.<p>

A benign form of cancer, usually striking aging Jewish and Italian men, started presenting itself in young men, and killing them. The only clear connection that Gottlieb could find was that all of the younger men were gay. The syndrome became known as GRID or Gay Related Immune Deficiency. When it became known that the syndrome also affected heterosexuals the name was changed to AIDS.<p>

Since the first known death in 1959, HIV has spread to every continent throughout the world and almost every country reports cases of AIDS in all genders, regardless of sexual preference.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>T</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">o understand the effects that HIV has on a body requires an understanding of the immune system. There are two kinds of cells in the immune system - B cells and CD cells. B cells travel the body in search of foreign particles and substances to destroy. They are large and can attack bacteria and other germs but they are so big that they can't attack viruses, which are minute. The CD cells are smaller and can attack viruses, but they are also the part of the immune system that HIV attacks. CD cells are also known as T cells. There are four types of CD cells. These combine to rid the body of viruses and other foreign substances. T helper cells, or CD4 cells, recognize viruses or irregular cells like cancer, and send messages to T killer cells. T killer cells exist only to attack and kill viruses and irregular cells identified by T helper cells as unwanted. T suppressor cells, on the other hand, stop the T killer cells from increasing and ultimately attacking one's own body.<p>

Antibodies are created following a message from a T helper cell to recognize a virus should it re-enter the body. The antibody attempts to neutralize the virus. The T helper cell  keeps the immune process operating. It is also the cell that HIV destroys. If there is no T helper cell, all the other functions disappear and the result is immune deficiency. When HIV enters the bloodstream it attaches to a T helper cell, sheds its outside skin and injects its own genetic material into the cell.<p>

Once the HIV has hidden in the T helper cell, the immune system no longer recognizes it as foreign and therefore cannot make an antibody to fight it. The virus can remain dormant for several years. It will then start to multiply. At this point the T helper cell becomes the host to produce more HIV particles. The T helper cell ultimately explodes and new viruses are released into the bloodstream where they find other T helper cells to invade. After the invasion, the multiplication begins again. When the T helper cells are destroyed faster than new ones can be made, the result is immune deficiency.<p>

The most difficult aspect of treating HIV is the destruction of the virus necessitates destruction of its host, the T helper cells. But the virus also kills the T helper cells, so it is a medical "Catch 22". The body attempts to build up antibodies to fight the HIV, but unfortunately the antibodies can't neutralize the virus.<p>

To find out if someone has HIV in their body, a blood test checks for the presence of antibodies to the virus. If there are signs of the HIV antibody, it indicates that the virus is in the bloodstream. If the test result is positive, the person has the virus.  If it is negative, they do not have the virus.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>P</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">hysical causes of sexual unresponsiveness can include illness, disease, being overweight or underweight, some medications such as some contraceptive pills, or the recent birth of a child and in such cases a medical practitioner should be consulted.<P>

More commonly, the cause lies elsewhere. Male and female sexual responses are different - although most men occasionally lack a desire for sex, their sexual responsiveness can be more instantly 'triggered' than a woman's. Men's sexual fulfillment can also be less complex to achieve, sometimes requiring less stimulation than a woman's.<P>

A woman's sexual responsiveness can be keyed to many variables: her background and childhood experiences; her casual or formal regard for sex; her satisfaction or otherwise with her own self and self-image; her compatibility with her partner and, very particularly, her partner's capacity and willingness to arouse and stimulate her sexually.<P>

Fatigue is a common cause of female sexual unresponsiveness - particularly so if a woman has the primary responsibility for raising young children. It is very difficult today to find time to be spontaneous about anything, particularly sex. Sex within relationships may be fairly frequent when the relationship is just starting and the thrill can be pursued sometimes at the expense of other things such as work, study, other friendships, playing sport or simply going out together.<P>

Gradually though, other demands take their toll, particularly work and study, family matters, household chores. In most relationships, over time, sex can be relegated to the last thing before bed, something to do on weekends or on holiday - it can become a routine. Often, one partner feels the other partner expects sex at a particular time and the sex can become one-sided or half-hearted, the spontaneity and romance have disappeared. Worries about whether we're satisfying our partner, whether our partner is satisfying us, or about work and finances can inhibit our desire for sex. Feeling anxious about your own sexual performance can be a major factor in turning you away from sex. Some partners feel pressured into having sex because they feel the other partner always wants it.<P>

Women compare themselves and are compared with the 'superwoman' depicted in the media - ever ready to 'satisfy' their man, capable of multiple orgasms 24 hours a day, with the ability to be a mother and dynamic professional at the same time. These images are mythical. Because of media stereotyping and some people's false expectations, a lot of women are genuinely anxious about how they 'rate' in bed compared with their partner's previous partners. The mythical superwoman depicted in the media.<P>

This anxiety compounds sexual problems, with each successive sexual encounter becoming more difficult or less desirable than the last. Sexual unresponsiveness can occur when the woman is anxious about sex - it can cause her to have sex less often with her partner or not actively seek sexual partners at all. When a woman is unresponsive to sex her partner will often register their disappointment and this can make the woman even more anxious so that the woman anticipates  her own unresponsiveness each time she is about to have sex.<P>

Some women, who are not happy in a particular relationship, may be disinclined to have or enjoy sex with their partner but will masturbate or have sex with other partners. Their lack of sexual desire is not general, it is specifically related to their main partner. It may be that the woman is suppressing her true sexual self - she may be lesbian or bi-sexual and have no desire to continue having sex with her present partner.<P>

A few women, even in long term relationships, may fear becoming pregnant - this can happen even if both partners have agreed, at least on the surface, to have children. The woman may suppress her true desires about starting or extending a family and the prospect of intercourse may stifle desire and arousal.<P>

Sexual desire can decrease gradually - and naturally - as we age. Sex is not the same at 60 as it was at 25 but it can be just as fulfilling and important.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>I</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">n just about every case, it is  possible to overcome an occasional, more frequent or even long-term lack of desire for sex. It is important to rule out any physical cause. If you suspect that an illness, disease, the physical after-affects of childbirth or a medication (including a contraceptive) may be repressing your desire for sex you should consult a medical practitioner. Alternatively, you may feel you have been <B>suppressing</B>  sexual feelings for most of your life; perhaps because of a particular cultural, environmental or religious background or a traumatic incident in your childhood - if so, you should seek the assistance of a counselor.<p>

Depression and similar disorders, and grief after the death of a relative or close friend, can temporarily suppress many feelings of desire: the desire to eat or control eating, the desire to work, the desire to be involved and the desire to have sex.<p>

Some women find the idea of masturbation a turn-off, this is sometimes caused by influences from childhood where masturbation may have been regarded as 'dirty', or by the woman's lack of regard for and pleasure in her own body. Masturbation is a healthy and normal part of sexuality - it is important to learn to turn yourself on, develop erotic and sensual fantasies and feelings and prepare your body and mind for other desires, such as sex with a partner.<p>

Talking with your partner is one of the most important things you can do to overcome your lack of sexual desire - don't suppress the problem, bring it out into the open. Your partner needs to be told what you expect from them - in the home, within the relationship and in bed. If there are things you desire your partner to do with you in bed, tell or show them - partners need to respond to each other in such a way that they both know what they both like and dislike during sex. Don't lie there, 'take it' and let your partner fumble in the dark.<p>

There will be periods in your life, for example when you are very tired, over stressed by work, family and other commitments or have been ill, when you may experience a lack of sexual desire - this is a normal response. It is important to put these feelings into perspective, to understand the reasons behind them, and understand they need only be temporary- worrying about why you don't feel like sex can turn temporary feelings into a pattern of sexual anxiety.<p>

Be positive about your sexual 'self'. Don't put off sex because you think you're going to 'flunk' or not come up to your partner's expectations or your perceptions of those expectations - tell yourself you can, and will, have terrific sex with your partner. If you don't feel like 'full-on' sex, tell your partner. Don't leave them guessing. And don't let your relationship become penetration- centered, explore other aspects of your relationship: physical affection like cuddling, necking, massage, sensual touch. Feel good about discovering other kinds of sex - tickling and caressing, oral sex, mutual masturbation.<p>

'Variety is the spice of life' - to make it fresh and more exciting, it's important not to get too routine about it- the same positions, limited foreplay, no seduction, penetration only, no 'adventure.' Try to recover some sexual spontaneity- take time to have a 'quickie' occasionally, if you both feel like it, don't lock in to the same time every other night, especially when you're tired or stressed. Be true to yourself and your partner - if you are unwilling to have children, but your partner is and you are worried about getting pregnant, be honest and discuss your differing expectations.<p>

Think about how often you would <B>like</B>  to have sex - with your partner, or with someone else. If you would like to have and enjoy sex more often with your current partner, think about the reasons why you <B>don't</B> - are you put off by your partner's criticism (verbal or otherwise) of your performance.<p>

Are you turned-off by what your partner does during sex?  Are there positions and techniques you would like to try with your partner? Is there something about yourself that you believe turns your partner off? Is your partner more sexually 'driven' than you? If you would like to have less sex with your partner or more sex, but with someone else, think about the reasons why - are you no longer aroused or turned-on by your partner; are you with the 'right' partner, do you believe your partner has certain expectations of you that you feel you cannot fulfill?<p>

If you are troubled by work hassles, by finances or by family, try to resolve these problems or discuss them with your partner or at least put them at the back of your mind before taking them to bed with you. If you believe you are lesbian, unhappy with your present relationship and would prefer a lesbian lifestyle, don't suppress it, seek counseling from lesbian support agencies.<p>

Some women, who are in a heterosexual relationship and are genuinely in love with their partner and lifestyle, and who often have sexual fantasies about women when they masturbate or have sex with their partner, do not necessarily want to adopt a lesbian lifestyle or have female lovers. A problem arises for these women (and their partners) if their fantasies intrude into their relationship and affect sex with, or desire for, their partner, of if the woman pursues relationships with other women. Sometimes guilt about suppressed or concealed sexual yearnings, experimentation or extramarital affairs can lead you to be unresponsive to your present partner.<p>

Once you've thought about these issues and your needs and wants, you should discuss them with your partner or, if you feel that's not possible, with a trusted friend or professional counselor or sex  therapist.

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half1.GIF"><FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B></B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">There are exercises that individuals and couples can do to rekindle sexual desire. These exercises all involve gentle touching and caressing and  exploration of each other's bodies. To begin, talk about your sexual inhibitions, feelings, anxieties and expectations then ask your partner to agree that penetrative sex will not be an issue for a while. On your own, gently touch and stroke your naked body - lightly massage and caress yourself, perhaps in a warm shower, bath, in bed or on a soft rug, using a water-based lubricant, body lotion, soap lather or your own saliva.  Think about your sexual feelings - 'listen' with your emotions as your fingers gently touch each part of your body, concentrate on your 'self' and what feelings (emotional and physical) arouse and stimulate you.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">When you've become confident about self-stimulation and massage, try these techniques with your partner. Find the right time and place for the exploration to begin: use massage oil, lotion and lubricants if you wish - start slowly and sensuously with no goal other than relaxation, 'two-ness' and feeling good. Recall from your own self-stimulation what touches and caresses aroused or relaxed you and ask your partner to try them. Gently massage, touch and explore your partner's body - find out what stimulates or relaxes your partner, remember to go slowly. <p>

Unless you both feel so inclined, avoid touching each other's genitals, you're aiming to re-acquaint yourself with your partner's body - the pressure of sex (whether from you or your partner) must not be an issue. Don't pressure, or be pressured by, your partner to take these exercises too quickly.  When you're both ready, start to touch and caress each other's genitals, softly and in tune with what you both desire - and remember to tell each other what is and what isn't a turn-on.<p>

These exercises should continue for as long as it takes both partners to feel confident about having sex together - but remembering that penetration should not necessarily be the goal of each and every sexual encounter.

Orgasms vary from person to person - there is no 'natural' or typical orgasm; some women need direct clitoral stimulation (touching of the clitoris) during sex in order to have an orgasm, others don't.<p>

The orgasm is not the most  important part of sex, it is an  important part.<p>

Not every sexual encounter - masturbatory or with a partner - has to climax with an orgasm.<p>

'Coming together' is not as common as sexual 'gossip' would have us believe - most partners have mutual orgasms only occasionally, some couples never do.<p>

In their youth, a majority of women find reaching orgasm hard - as they get older and become more sexually experienced, it becomes easier.

Sexual intercourse alone, that is, penetration of a woman's vagina by a man's penis, may be sufficient to bring the man to climax. But it very often is not enough to make a woman reach orgasm - in fact it is very common for a woman not to have an orgasm if her only sexual stimulation is intercourse.<p>

An orgasm is much more likely to eventuate if both partners are relaxed and happy about having sex together, are 'turned-on' by each other and are able to arouse and excite each other in ways that are mutually satisfying.<p>

The inability to experience an orgasm is a common sexual problem, especially so with women. Roughly 1 in 10 women (and this could be a conservative estimate) report never having an orgasm but in most cases the problem can be overcome.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>S</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">ome people, when they are young, are discouraged from exploring their sexuality or even thinking about sex. They either don't masturbate or have guilt feelings when they do, so that an orgasm - if it happens - can be tied up with feelings of anxiety or even fear. Others, particularly those who have been sexually molested, suppress sexual feelings or think about sex in a non-pleasurable way. Some people are anxious about their sexual 'performance', believing they will not be 'good' at it - their anxiety often inhibits orgasm.<p>

Many people who are involved in relationships, even those who have overcome previous feelings of sexual inadequacy, focus on the orgasm above all other aspects of sex - it becomes the single goal of a sexual encounter, a point of obsession. By making the orgasm the primary sexual focus we risk being unable to have one at all - through fear of not having one, or our partner not having one, not coming together or not feeling 'the earth move'.<p>

By putting all your eggs in the orgasm 'basket' you can establish patterns of sexual behavior and routines that allow misapprehension, anxiety, embarrassment and fear about sexual performance to compound into recurring difficulties in achieving orgasm.<p>

Many men (and quite a few women) think, incorrectly, that a woman should be able to come 'at the drop of a hat' and several times (multiple orgasms) during just one session of sex. This is neither common, nor necessary for pleasurable sex. - women can enjoy sex without having an orgasm. There are times when most women will not be in a mood to, or will be unable to, climax. Often, when a woman doesn't reach orgasm during intercourse, it is because she has not been sufficiently stimulated or aroused by her partner - there may have been little or no foreplay, for example.<p>

Frequently, partners don't talk to each other about what arouses them during sex, what pleasures, positions and movements can lead them to a fulfilling orgasm - often, men simply don't do enough in bed to enable the woman to climax.

Don't strive for simultaneous orgasms - enjoy your partner's orgasm by watching and helping him or her come to a climax, then let them share your pleasure when you reach orgasm.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>A</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"> woman who experiences no or few orgasms can learn to bring herself to a climax, over time. Make sure you tell your partner what is or isn't happening to you during sex - work with him or her to train yourself to have an orgasm. Training for orgasm revolves around two things - masturbation and patience.<p>

Patience is needed because it will take time to unlearn repressions and anxieties; and to learn the touches, feelings and thoughts that will arouse you and continue to arouse you to the point of climax. The techniques can be practiced alone - at least at the beginning - and then with your partner. Remember, they have to learn what they can do to stimulate you, it's a two-way street.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half1.GIF">Relaxed and naked (perhaps in a warm bath), explore your body - your face and neck, breasts, nipples, stomach, thighs. Touch and stoke yourself in the way you would like to be caressed by your lover - learn and enjoy those things that really stimulate you.

</font></td>


<td align=left width=225 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">If you enjoy this - it can take as long as you like - caress your labia and clitoris, gradually stroking your fingers into your vagina.
Vibrators are often recommended by therapists to help with this process.<p>

Let these sessions take as much time as you need to reach an orgasm during masturbation - take things slowly and be relaxed. There's no pressure, no clock to watch, no instant, magic climax to reach. <p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">Eventually, you will want to share these experiences with your partner; guide them around those parts of your body that aroused you when you stimulated them - let him find other ways to arouse you too. Let your partner stimulate your clitoris - over time, when you find yourself on the brink of orgasm after your partner has touched and caressed your clitoris, move straight on to intercourse, with you or your partner continuing to stimulate your clitoris.  If at any time you find you're worried about not reaching orgasm, or you suspect there might be a physical reason preventing you, consult your medical practitioner.

Cultural and religious backgrounds are sometimes strict and can reinforce the 'ideal of the virgin'. Concepts such as penetration, intercourse and even sex can cause fear or trepidation in the mind of a young woman. Stories about painful first intercourse reinforce fears of penetration. Fear about penetration can compound and create a pattern of sexual anxiety, causing the vagina to remain dry and unrelaxed before intercourse.

Recurring or lasting vaginismus can derive from adolescent conditioning and unsatisfying early sexual experience or abuse. In some cases, vaginismus may eventuate after a history of successful and enjoyable intercourse - due to a vaginal infection, the physical after-effects of childbirth, tiredness or some other cause, which causes painful intercourse, possibly leading to a pattern of further vaginismus even though the original cause has disappeared. The anticipation of painful penetration - even though there may be no physical impediment to normal, painless intercourse - can be a common cause of vaginismus.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>I</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">t is possible to practice techniques which will prevent vaginismus, that is, to train the vaginal sphincter to relax and permit penetration. It usually takes time and practice to 'retrain' the vaginal sphincter. Until you are confident that you can master these techniques, you and your partner should avoid attempts at forced penetration and concentrate on other sexual activities... of which there are many! Make sure that any pain you have experienced during attempts at intercourse is not a result of medical problems - consult your medical practitioner. <p>

If the problem is found to be vaginismus try these techniques over time. Don't rush but set your goals: 'I will have enjoyable sex and enjoyable sex includes intercourse'; 'I will enjoy penetrative sex'.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half1.GIF">Relaxed and on your own, think about a level of discomfort you can tolerate for a short moment, deliberately let your vagina become tense. Then let it relax, use a lubricant and gradually insert your fingers or a vaginal dilator (obtainable through your doctor, or a sex therapist) into your vagina until you reach, but don't exceed, your discomfort level.  Be realistic - allow some discomfort, perhaps expect it, but don't let it become painful - just progress one step at a time.  There is no hurry, practice in the bath or shower if you prefer.<p>

Find a position that suits you - lying back, on your side, squatting.  It's your choice - allow yourself to enjoy the experience. Over time, progress further into your vagina, moving from your little finger to your index finger or perhaps using a larger dilator. Feel confident - you're not inserting anything into your vagina that won't fit; after all the vagina can expand to allow the birth of a baby! As you progress, incorporate water-based lubricants such as KY Jelly in your training - use as much or as little as you like. Gradually, you will train your vagina to expect these new feelings and larger objects.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">Now you're ready to practice with your partner.   Follow the steps again, but this time let your partner insert their finger or the dilator into your vagina - gradually. Proceed with patience - eventually your vagina will relax enough to permit your partner's penis to penetrate, perhaps a little at a time. Practice, practice, practice. Allow the experience to be enjoyable for you both - take time to discover each other's desires and turn-ons.

Allowance must be made for arousal and excitement to do their job: to stimulate both the male and female sexual organs. Foreplay and stimulation are essential to successful and pleasurable lovemaking, and they are the triggers to vaginal lubrication.  <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">A woman will usually become 'moist' during this phase of sex, making penetration easier and more enjoyable for both partners. <p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half3.GIF">'First night nerves', anxiety, moodiness, tiredness, guilt, an unwillingness to have sex at a particular moment or tension tend to suppress vaginal lubrication in just the same way they can reduce a man's capacity to have an erection - worries and fears should be discussed with your partner before sex; try to iron-out differences and irritations before you go to bed together; are you in fact in the mood for sex? <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half4.GIF"> During foreplay and intercourse, make sure you let your partner know what turns you on and stimulates you and what doesn't.  Guide each other to your arousal levels. <p>

If you feel you are sufficiently aroused and stimulated before sex but, for any of the other reasons we've listed, you still experience vaginal dryness, feel free and relaxed about using lubricating gels and creams. They're excellent and improve the sexual pleasure and thrill for both partners - and they can be fun to apply! If you use lubricating gel or cream, make sure it is water-based, not oil-based - products such as KY, Duragel, Wet Stuff are terrific. Even saliva can be good, but it loses its effectiveness quickly. Experiment with different lubricants - find one that suits you: some have different feels and consistencies, a few are even flavored and perfumed!<p>

If your partner uses a condom, you will find sex more pleasurable if you use a water-based lubricant as well. Water based lubricant reduces the chance of condoms breaking. A drop of lubricant on the penis (inside the condom) can increase sensitivity for the condom wearer.  If you practice anal sex, always use a water-based lubricant because the anus does not make its own. If you experience pain during intercourse, or if your vagina appears to be continually dry during sex, consult your medical practitioner.

Another common cause is bruising of the urethra during intercourse - the penis can rub hard against the urethra, which is adjacent to the interior of the vagina. <IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">Cystitis can also be transmitted sexually from partner to partner and there is a risk that it can cause an infection to spread to the kidneys.<p>

Women get cystitis more frequently than men because their urethra is much shorter than a man's - making it easier for germs to travel from the bowel, vagina and urethra to the bladder. After the menopause, the lining of the bladder and urethra are weaker and more susceptible to infections.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half3.GIF">During sex, particularly if the woman has not been stimulated enough to produce her natural lubricant or has not used a water-based artificial lubricant, the rubbing of the penis can aggravate and inflame her urethra.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>I</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">f you are over the age of 15 and not pregnant, try the treatments listed below.<p>

Contact a medical practitioner if the symptoms are serious (For example, pus or blood are present in the urine or the pain and/or fever are intense). The symptoms persist after 2 days or recur regularly. It's a good idea to take a fresh sample of your urine with you when you consult your medical practitioner. During treatment, drink plenty of water - as much as you are able and probably more than usual, particularly when an attack starts. Avoid alcohol, coffee, tea and other drinks containing caffeine.<p>

To reduce the acidity of your urine and the burning sensation when you urinate, take a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda dissolved in a glass of water. Repeat this a couple of times if necessary. Urinate often if you can - don't hold on to a full bladder. Try to relax and refrain from anything that might cause stress or anxiety. Avoid sexual intercourse until the symptoms have passed. Wear loose fitting garments, preferably made of a soft, natural fiber like cotton. Apply warm packs or hot water bottles to your lower back and stomach for some relief of pain.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half1.GIF">Avoid harsh soap, talcum powder, vaginal deodorant, perfumes, body and bath oils. Wash frequently, particularly your vaginal area and the entrance to the urethra, after you've been to the toilet.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">If your cystitis is caused by sexual intercourse, make sure you and your partner wash your genitals and hands with luke-warm water before intercourse and then apply a water-based lubricating lotion or gel to your sexual organs. When having sex, avoid putting pressure on the urethra. Take care with extended clitoral stimulation and rear entry intercourse. During intercourse, try sitting astride your partner and avoid too much stimulation or pressure on your anal region.  Ask your partner not to 'thrust' too roughly or hard during intercourse. Go to the toilet a little before and very soon after intercourse.<p>

Get advice from your family planning counselor or medical practitioner about different kinds of contraceptives - some types of the pill, caps, diaphragms and spermicidal creams can trigger cystitis.<p>

Vibrators and other objects inserted into the vagina for sexual stimulation can also sometimes cause or aggravate cystitis.<p>

If the symptoms persist or you suffer from recurring bouts of cystitis you will need to consult a medical practitioner again and perhaps be referred to a specialist urologist for further treatment<p>

Occasionally, some women continue to experience persistent pain when they urinate - without evidence of bacteria in their urine - that is related to bruising by the penis during intercourse, the after-effects of surgery, childbirth or an internal examination, or infection. This is known as urethral syndrome and women who suffer from it must make sure they are well-lubricated (either naturally through arousal or by the use of artificial lubricants) before intercourse. These women should also take extra care about avoiding foods and products (soaps, deodorants, perfumes and lotions) that cause allergic reactions in the genital area, and not wearing tight, irritating or ill-fitting clothes of synthetic fibers.<p>

In addition to this advice, to avoid recurring bouts of cystitis or urethral syndrome, make it a habit to drink two or more liters of water per day; eat properly; get adequate rest and exercise. Take care in the use and fitting of tampons or pads; and be scrupulous about keeping your genitals and back passage clean after urination and excretion - but dab, don't rub, your genitals after urinating.<p>

Try also to reduce the stress and anxiety in your life - learn to relax with your partner and to enjoy sex that is not always 'intercourse-centered'.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>I</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">mpotence is the inability to have or sustain an erection - it may be occasional, recurring or, less commonly, permanent. Impotence - temporary or on-going - is a very common sexual problem. It is almost impossible for a man to hide his erection problems from his partner because the problem is so physically obvious: his penis won't become, or will not stay, erect. This inability to 'fake it' can make the problem seem worse or more embarrassing for both partners.

<td align=left width=300 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Whatever the cause, impotence and erection difficulties can have a damaging effect on a man's ego, self-esteem, mental and physical wellbeing and relationship with his partner.  Steps should be taken by the man, with the assistance and understanding of his partner - and, perhaps, with guidance from a counselor or sex therapist - to overcome the problem. In almost every case, impotence and erection difficulties can be overcome.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>I</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">n many cultures, particularly western cultures - the penis has inappropriately become a focus, symbol or totem for sex; as such it is linked to sexual 'performance' or power. It can be a major cause of concern to men (and women) if a problem is associated with the penis - one of the most common problems being a man's inability to have or sustain an erection, often called impotence.<p>

Nearly every man, at some stage in his life, will have difficulty having or sustaining an erection. Temporary loss of erectile ability is called <I>secondary impotence</I>. Some men have an on-going difficulty getting and maintaining an erection - this is often described as <I>primary impotence</I>. When they reach their 50s (sometimes earlier, sometimes later) men experience fewer erections; and they find that generally their erections are not as stiff as when they were young. This is a normal part of aging.<p>

Occasionally, medical conditions can prevent a man getting and sustaining a satisfactory erection. Chemicals - such as alcohol and some drugs - can also suppress erections: a limp penis is a frequent side effect of a heavy drinking session.
Common temporary illnesses - the flu, for example or fatigue - can sometimes reduce sexual desire and, therefore, the capacity to have an erection. Tension and anxiety (about work, finances or love life, or even fear of not being able to have an erection) are very  common causes of erection difficulties.<p>

Some causes of impotence and erection difficulties are ingrained. In his youth, the man may have had a difficult or traumatic sexual experience: he may have been caught by a parent, teacher or other authority figure masturbating or having sex (with a girl or boy). He may have seen and not comprehended his parents having sex; he may have been molested. The man's early years may have been lived under the control and gaze of strict or deeply religious parents - he may have been taught that sex is 'dirty' and that masturbation is wrong. His first sexual experience may have been such a disaster that the embarrassment or shock that it caused remains with him through his adult life.<p>

From early in his life, a man may have had doubts about his sexuality, 'manliness' or capacity to 'perform' - these doubts could have built into a fear of or anxiety about sex, inhibiting the man's capacity to initiate sex with potential partners. Early sexual experiences and awakenings and the attitudes of parents, friends, relatives, teachers and clergy all have an effect on a man's sexuality. They establish patterns of attitude and behavior that resonate through the man's life. Many men think they can 'block- out' these early experiences, and influences but they are still there in the man's subconscious and they can effect strongly his sexual responses and feelings.<p>

Feeling anxious about your own sexual performance can be a major factor in reducing or preventing your capacity to have and sustain an erection. Sexual myth would have us believe in the male's 'dominance' in bed and his capacity to have sex at any time and as often as he or his partner desires. A man's self-image can be set against this incorrect stereotype. Many men are genuinely anxious about how they 'rate' in bed compared with their partner's previous partners and the mythical super-males depicted in the media. This anxiety compounds problems getting and sustaining an erection, with each successive sexual encounter becoming more difficult than the last.<p>

Erection difficulties can occur when the man fears sex - it can cause him to have sex less often with his partner or not actively seek sexual partners at all. Some men, who are not happy in a particular relationship, may be unable to get or sustain an erection in the presence of their partner but will be able to masturbate or have sex with other partners. Their problems with erections then, are not general, they are specifically related to their main partner. It may be that the man is suppressing his true sexual self - he may be gay or bi-sexual and has no desire, or is unable, to continue having sex with his present partner. <p>

A few men, even in long term relationships, may fear getting their partner pregnant - this can happen even if both partners have agreed, at least on the surface, to have children. The man may suppress his true desires about starting or extending a family and the prospect of intercourse may inhibit his capacity to get and maintain an erection.   <p>

A lack of male hormones is an extremely rare cause of erection difficulties - so rare, that it need not even be considered in the vast majority of cases. Depression and similar disorders, and grief after the death for a relative or close friend, can temporarily suppress many feelings of desire: the desire to eat or control eating, the desire to work, the desire to be involved, the desire to have sex and the capacity to get an erection. Treatment should be sought from a qualified specialist.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>T</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">hink about why you're not getting or maintaining an erection. If, you're on your own you can arouse and stimulate your penis so that it becomes erect, the problem is probably not physical. Is the problem related specifically to your partner? They no longer turn you on? Are there things you would like them to do with you in bed that you think may turn you on? Are you worried that you can't satisfy them? Do you think they are too demanding (or undemanding)?<p>

Is the problem related to someone else - are you suppressing guilt or anxiety about having sex with, or wanting to have sex with, someone else. Would you prefer to have sex with someone of your own sex? <p>

If you are unfit or overweight, tense or anxious, or a combination of all of these, make a pact with yourself to make some lifestyle changes - become more physically active, have adequate rest and sleep, eat good food moderately and sensibly, try and deal with your anxieties. A fit man is likely to have fewer erection difficulties than an unfit one.<p>

Avoid excessive consumption of alcohol and other drugs - one drink to steady your nerves (especially before a first encounter with a new partner) is probably not bad, but avoid drowning your desire with several 'stiff' drinks! <p>

If you have a continuing inability to get or sustain an erection, and suspect the reason may be physical, you should consult your medical practitioner. For those men who believe their erection difficulties are a response to problems or events that occurred during their early sexual development, counseling with a sex therapist - perhaps in the presence of a partner - may be very beneficial. Sexual problems that are deep-seated should be faced gradually and carefully. You are not alone, many men and women have similar problems which can be traced back to childhood, and counselors and sex therapists are trained to help you face the causes and eventually overcome the problem.<p>

Very often, it helps to talk over the problem with your partner - whatever the cause of your difficulty, your partner needs to know they are not excluded from the problem. After all, they will be experiencing their own frustration and may feel they are not able to arouse and stimulate you to the point of getting an erection. If the problem is not physical or related to your early sexual development, it may be attitudinal - your sex life (or your attitude) may be 'penis centered'.<p>

Sex is not something to rush (although 'quickies' can be an enjoyable part of a full sex life); it's not only about rampant erections and in/out intercourse - it's the full range of emotional and physical interplay between two people who want to be with each other. Explore other ways to satisfy yourself and your partner - sex is not intercourse alone and the penis is not your only 'tool': a woman can climax without penile penetration (intercourse) and a man can derive great pleasure from sensuous alternatives to intercourse. Massage, foreplay, oral sex, cuddling, licking, tickling, mutual bathing, are all satisfying and stimulating ways of broadening your lovemaking.<p>

An unsatisfactory relationship does not make for easy erections - problems within a relationship should be discussed and dealt with by the partners, preferably before having sex. Develop a positive mental attitude about your sex life and your penis - tell yourself you will  satisfy your partner and yourself; avoid thinking about not being able to get an erection, otherwise you could find yourself in an ever-growing pattern of erection difficulties. Remember, the problem is probably only temporary - don't compound occasional impotence by being over-anxious about it; think about a possible cause and set out to tackle that cause.<p>

When the difficulty has a physical cause, injections immediately prior to intercourse, penile implants and other devices can successfully overcome some men's erectile difficulties. These should be discussed with your medical practitioner and a sex therapist. Once you've thought about these issues and your needs and wants, you should discuss them with your partner or, if you feel that's not possible, with a trusted friend, professional counselor or sex therapist.<p>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>T</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">here are exercises that individuals and couples can do to overcome the man's erection difficulties. These exercises all involve gentle touching and caressing and the exploration of your own and each other's bodies. The exercises also involve talking over your problems and reaching an understanding with your partner - let them know that you want to help yourself overcome your difficulties, ask them to help you. Most partners will be relieved that the man is able to discuss his problem and has enough faith in his partner and their relationship to be able to involve the partner in the 'treatment'. Come to an agreement with your partner that, for the time being, intercourse will not be the focus of your sex. When you reach that agreement you're ready to begin the exercises.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half1.GIF">Firstly, you need to build up confidence about your capacity to release any pent-up feelings of anxiety or inadequacy, to arouse yourself and get and maintain an erection. On your own, and in a relaxed state of mind, gently touch and stroke your naked body - lightly massage and caress yourself, perhaps in a warm shower, bath, in bed or on a soft rug, using a water-based lubricant, body lotion, soap lather or your own saliva. Think about nothing else, except your sexual feelings - 'listen' with your emotions as your fingers gently touch each part of your body, concentrate on your 'self' and what feelings (emotional and physical) arouse and stimulate you. When you're ready, let your erotic and sensual thoughts 'translate' or transfer to your penis - gradually it will become erect; watch how stiff it can get with only your mind and erotic thoughts maintaining it.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half2.GIF">Slowly, gently, let yourself stroke, caress and squeeze your penis. Finally, masturbate, letting yourself go completely. When you've become confident about self-stimulation and masturbation, try these techniques with your partner.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half3.GIF">Find the right time and place for the 'exploration' to begin: use massage oil, lotion and lubricants if you wish - start slowly and sensuously with no goal other than relaxation, and feeling good. Recall from your own self-stimulation what touches and caresses aroused or relaxed you and ask your partner to try them. Gently massage, touch and explore your partner's body - find out what stimulates or relaxes your partner, remember to go slowly.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half4.GIF">Unless you both feel so inclined, at this stage avoid touching each other's genitals, you're aiming to re-acquaint yourself with your own body and your partner's. The pressure of sex (whether from you or your partner) must not be an issue. Don't pressure or be pressured by your partner to take these exercises too quickly: when you're both ready, start to touch and caress each other's genitals, in tune with what you both desire - and remember to tell each other what is and isn't a turn-on. Ask your partner to hand-stimulate your penis - gently at first, then more vigorously, massaging the tip of the penis, stroking the base and sides, perhaps using a water-based lubricant. At the same time you should 'let yourself go', relax and enjoy.<p>

A man's first experience of ejaculation usually occurs through masturbation, at around puberty. When a man ejaculates, a fluid called semen is released from the penis. Most men ejaculate in under 2 minutes after penetration, and this is only a problem if they ejaculate (or come) sooner or more quickly than they or their partner would prefer.

With some men the problem occurs more frequently or during each session of intercourse - in some cases as soon as the penis touches the partner's genitals or even during touching and cuddling - and is therefore of more concern. The problem may be caused by a physical condition, for example, prostate or urinary infection, in which case a medical practitioner should be consulted.<p>

The causes are complex and may be attributed to 'learned' behavior or anxiety and stress. During adolescence, many boys often masturbate quickly and vigorously and this haste can transfer to adulthood.


</font></td>


<td align=left width=300 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
Sometimes men withdraw before coming as a not very reliable method of birth control and this can cause them to lose the feel of vaginal contact. When normal intercourse is resumed, they often ejaculate very soon after penetration. Some men 'thrust' rapidly during intercourse, leading to faster stimulation and early ejaculation. Other men focus more particularly on intercourse itself, rather than foreplay and other stimuli, again possibly leading to more rapid ejaculation. The problem can increase if the man and/or his partner are anxious about coming early, sexual 'performance' generally or have other thoughts troubling them.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>W</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">hat is rapid ejaculation to one person (or couple) might not be considered rapid to another. Sex is not something that has to stretch or shrink to fit a time frame. The important thing is to be able to ejaculate when you <I>and</I> your partner feel the moment is right.<p>

Concentrating on other thoughts during intercourse for example, the working day or financial hassles is not a reliable way to curb rapid ejaculation. It is better to focus the mind on the lovemaking itself and practice a few techniques which will, in almost all cases, correct or reduce the problem.<p>

Over time, you can learn to 'control' the moment when ejaculation occurs - to recognize the sort of sexual stimulation that may lead to rapid ejaculation. You can then take steps to change your sexual pattern or routine if it presents a problem. The aim is to delay the moment of ejaculation until you and your partner decide that moment is right for you both. The 'moment' may vary from situation to situation.<p>

Your partner may or may not be aware of your problem; don't feel embarrassed about discussing it - use the situation to find ways to increase your sexual enjoyment and explore different sensations. Change positions during sex, concentrate on receiving and <I>giving</I> sexual sensations, slow down and enjoy overall pleasure rather than the stimulation that comes from intercourse alone.<p>

Controlling or preventing rapid ejaculation requires practice over a number of regular sessions.  Alone, you can masturbate to the point of ejaculation, then stop or slow down, reducing the physical stimulation but maintaining an erection. Lubricants can help by providing different or unfamiliar sensations. Changing the method of physical stimulation during masturbation is also useful - try changing hands or rubbing the penis against another surface (pillow or sheets, for example).<p>

With your partner, and on a regular basis, focus on the sexual positions and feelings that arouse and stimulate you both. Allow your partner to bring you close to ejaculation and then slow down or stop the stimulation (whether it be writhing, licking, tickling, whispering in the ear) before ejaculation occurs. Try this several times during a session of sex. Don't be vague - indicate to your partner when to slow down, speed up or change stimuli - and remember, it works both ways. Listen to your partner. As you progress, use lubricants with your partner - explore other places in which to have sex: in the shower or bath, using the lather from soap for hand stimulation. Progressing further, try having sex with your partner on top - controlling the physical movement or thrusting, with you indicating when to slow down or stop for a time.<p>

Another way of delaying ejaculation is to squeeze gently for a few seconds the top and bottom (not sides) of your penis shaft, near the head of the penis. This can also be done with your partner. During intercourse, your partner moves off the penis and squeezes its head (again, top and bottom - not sides) for 5­10 seconds, then intercourse can resume. In later sessions, with your penis still inside your partner, try the 'squeeze' further down the shaft, wait for a few seconds then resume intercourse. Practice these techniques regularly and if the problem persists ask your medical practitioner to refer you to a sex therapist.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>P</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">hysical causes can include illness, disease, being overweight or underweight. Taking some medications or a low testosterone level can diminish a desire for sex - in such cases a medical practitioner should be consulted. More commonly, the cause lies elsewhere. It is very difficult today to find time to be spontaneous about anything, particularly sex.<p>

Sex within relationships may be fairly frequent when the relationship is just starting and the thrill can be pursued sometimes at the expense of other things such as work, study, other friendships, playing sport or simply going out together. Gradually though, other demands take their toll - other commitments loom large, particularly work and study, family matters, household chores.<p>

In most relationships, over time, sex can be relegated to the last thing before bed, something to do on weekends or on holiday. It can become a routine. Often, one partner feels the other partner expects sex at a particular time and the sex can become one-sided or half-hearted, the spontaneity and romance just aren't there. Worries about whether we're satisfying our partner or, whether they are satisfying us, or about work and finances can inhibit our desire for sex. Feeling anxious about your own sexual performance can be a major factor in turning you away from sex.<p>

Some partners feel pressured into having sex because they feel the other partner always wants it. Sexual myth would have us believe in the male's 'dominance' in bed and his capacity to have sex at any time and as often as he or his partner desires - a man's self-image can be set against this incorrect stereotype. Many men are genuinely anxious about how they 'rate' in bed compared with their partner's previous partners and the mythical super-males depicted in the media - this anxiety compounds sexual problems, with each successive sexual encounter becoming more difficult or less desirable than the last.<p>

Loss of sexual desire can occur when the man fears sex - it can cause him to have sex less often with his partner or not actively seek sexual partners at all. Some men, who are not happy in a particular relationship, may be disinclined to have sex with their partner but will masturbate or have sex with other partners, so their lack of sexual desire is not general, it is specifically related to their main partner.<p>

It may be that the man is suppressing his true sexual self - he may be gay or bisexual - and has no desire to continue having sex with his present partner. A few men, even in long term relationships, may fear getting their partner pregnant - this can happen even if both partners have agreed, at least on the surface, to have children. The man may suppress his true desires about starting or extending a family and the prospect of intercourse may stifle desire and arousal.<p>

Lack of sexual desire can increase gradually - and naturally - as we age: sex is not the same at 60 as it was at 25, but it can be just as fulfilling and important. It is very difficult for a man to hide his lack of sexual desire from his partner because his lack of sexual arousal is so physically obvious - his penis may not be, or not stay, erect or he may have difficulty ejaculating.<p>

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>I</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">n just about every case, it is possible to overcome an occasional, more frequent or even long-term lack of desire for sex. If you have rarely or never experienced strong sexual feelings - arousal, desire, being 'randy' - you may have an abnormally low level of male hormones or a physical problem associated with their production, in which case you should seek the advice of a medical practitioner.<p>

Alternatively, you may feel you have been suppressing sexual feelings for most of your life; perhaps because of a particular cultural, environmental or religious background or a traumatic incident in your childhood. If so, you should seek the assistance of a counselor.<p>

Depression and similar disorders, and grief after the death of a relative or close friend, can temporarily suppress many feelings of desire: the desire to eat or control eating, the desire to work, the desire to be involved and the desire to have sex. Treatment for any such disorders should be sought from a qualified specialist. Talking with your partner is one of the most important things you can do to overcome your lack of sexual desire. Don't suppress the problem, bring it out into the open.<p>

Men sometimes believe, even today, that it is 'unmanly' to cry, be overtly tender or emotionally open within a relationship - frustration about sex can arise when a man is unable to tell his partner his innermost fears and anxieties about his so-called sexual 'performance', his needs, worries and any feelings of guilt.<p>

There will be periods in your life, for example, when you are very tired, over stressed by work and other commitments or have been ill, when you may experience a lack of sexual desire - this is a normal response. It is important to put these feelings into perspective, to understand the reasons behind them, and understand they need only be temporary - worrying about why you don't feel like sex can turn temporary feelings into a pattern of sexual anxiety. Be positive about your sexual 'self': don't put off sex because you think you're going to 'flunk' or not come up to your partner's expectations or your perceptions of those expectations.  Tell yourself you can, and will, have terrific sex with your partner. If you don't feel like 'full-on' sex, tell your partner, don't leave her guessing.<p>

And don't let your relationship become intercourse-centered, explore other aspects of your relationship: physical affection like cuddling, necking, massage, sensual touch. Feel good about discovering other kinds of sex - playful acts such as tickling and caressing, oral sex, mutual masturbation. 'Variety is the spice of life'.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half1.GIF">To lessen the routine feeling of sex, to make it feel fresh and more exciting, it's important not to lock in to familiar patterns of sex - the same positions, limited foreplay, no seduction, a focus on penetration, no 'adventure'. Try to recover some sexual spontaneity. Take time to have a 'quickie' occasionally, but don't force things, if you both feel like it, go for it; don't lock in to the same time every other night, especially when you're tired or stressed.<p>

Be true to yourself and your partner - if you are unwilling to have children, but your partner is and you are worried about getting her pregnant, be honest and discuss your differing expectations. Think about how often you would like to have sex - with your partner, or with someone else. If you would like to have sex more often with your current partner, think about the reasons why you don't - are you put off by your partner's criticism (verbal or otherwise) of your 'performance'; are you turned-off by what your partner does during sex; are there positions and techniques you would like to try with your partner; is there something about yourself that you believe turns your partner off; is your partner more sexually 'driven' than you?<p>

If you would like to have less sex with your partner or more sex, but with someone else, think about the reasons why - are you no longer aroused or turned-on by your partner; are you with the 'right' partner, do you believe your partner has certain expectations of you that you feel you cannot fulfill? If you are troubled by work hassles, by finances or by family, try to resolve these problems or discuss them with your partner or at least put them at the back of your mind before taking them to bed with you. If you believe you are gay, unhappy with your present relationship and would prefer a gay lifestyle, don't suppress it, seek counseling from gay support agencies.<p>

Some men, who are in a heterosexual relationship and are genuinely in love with their partner and lifestyle, and who often or nearly always have sexual fantasies about men when they masturbate or have sex with their partner, do not necessarily want to adopt a gay lifestyle or have male lovers.<p>

A problem arises for these men (and their partners) if their fantasies intrude into their relationship and affect sex with, or desire for, their partner, of if the man pursues relationships with other men. Sometimes guilt about suppressed or concealed sexual yearnings, experimentation or extramarital affairs can lead you to have a lack of sexual desire for your present partner.<p>

If you masturbate often, are in a relationship and experience a lack of sexual desire for your partner, you could try masturbating less, 'saving-up' your sexual desires for sex with your partner. It is very easy, especially if your lifestyle is busy, to get fast fulfillment from masturbation, making sex with your partner seem too much trouble.
Once you've thought about these issues and your needs and wants, you should discuss them with your partner or, if you feel that's not possible, with a trusted friend or professional counselor or sex therapist.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>T</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">here are exercises that individuals and couples can do to rekindle sexual desire. These exercises all involve gentle touching and caressing and the exploration of each other's bodies. First up, talk about your sexual inhibitions, feelings, anxieties and expectations then ask your partner to agree that intercourse will not be an issue for a while.<p>

On your own, gently touch and stroke your naked body - lightly massage and caress yourself, perhaps in a warm shower, bath, in bed or on a soft rug, using a water-based lubricant, body lotion, soap lather or your own saliva. Think about your sexual feelings - 'listen' with your emotions as your fingers gently touch each part of your body, concentrate on your 'self' and what feelings (emotional and physical) arouse and stimulate you.<p>

<IMG align=left WIDTH=20 HEIGHT=20 BORDER=0  SRC="../numbers/half1.GIF">When you've become confident about self-stimulation and massage, try these techniques with your partner. Find the right time and place for the exploration to begin: use massage oil, lotion and lubricants if you wish - start slowly and sensuously with no goal other than relaxation, and feeling good. Recall from your own self-stimulation what touches and caresses aroused or relaxed you and gently ask your partner to try them.  Gently massage, touch and explore your partner's body - find out what stimulates or relaxes your partner, remember to go slowly. Unless you both feel so inclined, avoid touching each other's genitals, you're aiming to re-acquaint yourself with your partner's body - the pressure of sex (whether from you or your partner) must not be an issue.<p>

Don't pressure, or be pressured by your partner to take these exercises too quickly: when you're both ready, start to touch and caress each other's genitals, softly and in tune with what you both desire - and remember to tell each other what is and what isn't a turn-on. These exercises should continue for as long as it takes both partners to feel confident about having sex together - but remembering that intercourse should not necessarily be the goal of each and every sexual encounter.

Masturbate. Don't be afraid or embarrassed to masturbate away from your partner - masturbation is a healthy and very enjoyable part of a normal sex life. When you masturbate by yourself, use such a time as a practice session. Over time try gentler, different forms of stimulation especially as you get closer to orgasm.<p>

Use lubrication when you masturbate - try to simulate the physical sensations of intercourse, perhaps using a different hand. Use erotic literature, pictures or videos to arouse you before and during masturbation.<p>

When you find it easy to masturbate to ejaculation by yourself, try masturbating with your partner - either or both of you can try to make you come. Later, perhaps days or weeks later - there's no rush - let your partner help you insert your penis, at first immediately after orgasm then, another time, just before - get used to the sensation and continue to practice.


</font></td>


<td align=left width=300 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">Involve your partner. If you have a history of withholding ejaculation, you could regularly practice masturbation to orgasm in close proximity to your partner's vulva; over time you could ejaculate on the vulva and then, later, in the vagina. Try to focus on your sensations rather than your partner's.<p>

Practice touching, feeling and other sensations - such as mutual masturbation, massage and oral sex.  Don't rush. Talk to your partner - tell them what stimulates you. Make sure you're rested and have placed other worries - business and financial, for example - to one side.<p>

It takes time to alleviate sexual problems. Don't feel embarrassed about seeking professional help if these techniques don't work for you and your partner.

<LI>The potential exists for people who are HIV positive to be punished.<p>
<LI>There is enough discrimination associated with HIV without enforcing testing and perhaps driving the "at risk" people underground, making education more difficult.

AIDS is a frightening disease - it is a life-threatening condition. The disease touches all people in the community irrespective of their sexual persuasion, their attitudes or their sexual activities. Everyone has the potential to a have a friend, a brother or sister, a parent or relative, child or associate who has AIDS.<p>

The more we know about the effect HIV/AIDS has on people's lives and how we can help, the easier it is to be tolerant and understanding. Because of ignorance, AIDS discrimination still exists, but nobody deserves to have AIDS and people with AIDS are not bad people. You don't have to be addicted to drugs to get AIDS.  You just have to use one infected needle once. You don't have to have sex with a lot of people, just having unsafe sex once is enough.


</font></td>

<td align=left width=300 valign=top> <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The community's greatest hope in the battle against AIDS lies with young people, the people who will know how to protect themselves and be able to make responsible decisions at a young age.<p>

The most powerful tool in the fight against AIDS is education.  As more people learn the facts so they will fear the disease less and start to do something about preventing the spread of HIV and supporting people with the virus.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>I</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">t is the tragic irony of HIV and AIDS that, while people discriminate, the virus does not. Although governments worldwide continue programs of HIV/AIDS education to minimize the spread of the diseases, the greater challenge lies with the community's attitudes to people who are presumed to be, or are, infected.<p>

The prejudice associated with HIV/AIDS has lead to extreme discrimination. People have been denied their human rights - including privacy, confidentiality and basic health care. Many have been subjected to violence as a result of "homophobia", or the fear of homosexuals, which dates back to the first reported cases of the virus in 1981.<p>

Then, the only common link between people with similar symptoms was that all these people were gay. The disease became known as GRID or Gay Related Immune Deficiency. When the disease spread through the heterosexual community,
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS, was recognized as being indiscriminate. Because HIV/AIDS is sexually transmitted or transmitted by intravenous drug use, it is considered a social taboo by many, and ignorance continues to be one of the enemies.<p>

Being sexually active or using intravenous drugs is not the problem. The risk of infection comes from having unprotected sex or sharing unclean injecting equipment. HIV/AIDS discrimination has its origins in fear, ignorance, prejudice and stereotypes. There are five types of discrimination - direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, reactive discrimination, proactive discrimination and passive discrimination.<p>

<I>Direct discrimination</I>  is built on a generalization made about an individual because they may share characteristics based on a stereotype. For example, a decision not to employ a gay man based on the assumption that all gay men have AIDS is direct discrimination.<p>

<I>Indirect discrimination</I>  is usually found in rules, policies or conditions which outwardly appear not to be discriminatory but make it difficult for certain groups of people to comply, such as an employer who required all prospective employees to be married, indirectly discriminating toward homosexuals.<p>

The status of marriage is irrelevant to most jobs, but a homosexual person would find it harder to comply than a heterosexual person.<p>

<I>Reactive discrimination</I>  occurs as a reaction to a person, or situation or to information which provokes an emotional and non-rational response.
It is invariably not intentional or planned. A considerable amount of HIV/AIDS related discrimination occurs when an infected person discloses their HIV positive status. It happens in medical situations, times of distress or when explaining special needs.<p>

<I>Proactive discrimination</I>  is intentional and planned. It is often found in the development of policies and rules designed to preclude certain groups. For example, a company policy where  all employees must have an HIV antibody test and must resign or be dismissed if found  positive is proactively discriminatory. Because testing applied to everyone, the company believed the policy was fair and non-discriminatory - this is not so.<p>

<I>Passive discrimination</I>  is usually a failure to act upon needs of a special group. It is often justified in terms of providing equal treatment for all but fails to meet the special needs of some. Passive discrimination is often historically based.<p>

Some believe that too much money is being given to fund AIDS research and not enough to diseases that cause more deaths, such as breast cancer. However, until recent years no resources were allocated to these groups.<p>

No one is immune to the HIV virus.  It is an equal opportunity infection that doesn't care whether you are young or old, gay or straight, male or female, black or white, brown or yellow. You have the power within you to protect yourself from infection. You also have the ability to show compassion toward those who have unfortunately already become infected with HIV.<p>

Think of how you would like to be treated if you had HIV or AIDS, and be sensitive to the needs of those living with the virus. AIDS is everyone's problem, and everyone can be part of the solution.

<LI>The potential exists for people who are HIV positive to be punished.<p>
<LI>There is enough discrimination associated with HIV without enforcing testing and perhaps driving the "at risk" people underground, making education more difficult.

In certain institutions, prison or the military, compulsory testing is practised. Testing is not the answer to this epidemic. Everyone must take responsibility for their behavior and practise safer sex and safe drug use.

AIDS is a frightening disease - it is a life-threatening condition. The disease touches all people in the community irrespective of their sexual persuasion, their attitudes or their sexual activities. Everyone has the potential to a have a friend, a brother or sister, a parent or relative, child or associate who has AIDS.<p>

The more we know about the effect HIV/AIDS has on people's lives and how we can help, the easier it is to be tolerant and understanding. Because of ignorance, AIDS discrimination still exists, but nobody deserves to have AIDS and people with AIDS are not bad people. You don't have to be addicted to drugs to get AIDS.  You just have to use one infected needle once. You don't have to have sex with a lot of people, just having unsafe sex once is enough.


</font></td>

<td align=left width=300 valign=top> <FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">
The community's greatest hope in the battle against AIDS lies with young people, the people who will know how to protect themselves and be able to make responsible decisions at a young age.<p>

The most powerful tool in the fight against AIDS is education.  As more people learn the facts so they will fear the disease less and start to do something about preventing the spread of HIV and supporting people with the virus.

<FONT SIZE=4 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL"><B>I</B></font><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">t is the tragic irony of HIV and AIDS that, while people discriminate, the virus does not. Although governments worldwide continue programs of HIV/AIDS education to minimize the spread of the diseases, the greater challenge lies with the community's attitudes to people who are presumed to be, or are, infected.<p>

The prejudice associated with HIV/AIDS has lead to extreme discrimination. People have been denied their human rights - including privacy, confidentiality and basic health care. Many have been subjected to violence as a result of "homophobia", or the fear of homosexuals, which dates back to the first reported cases of the virus in 1981.<p>

Then, the only common link between people with similar symptoms was that all these people were gay. The disease became known as GRID or Gay Related Immune Deficiency. When the disease spread through the heterosexual community,
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome or AIDS, was recognized as being indiscriminate. Because HIV/AIDS is sexually transmitted or transmitted by intravenous drug use, it is considered a social taboo by many, and ignorance continues to be one of the enemies.<p>

Being sexually active or using intravenous drugs is not the problem. The risk of infection comes from having unprotected sex or sharing unclean injecting equipment. HIV/AIDS discrimination has its origins in fear, ignorance, prejudice and stereotypes. There are five types of discrimination - direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, reactive discrimination, proactive discrimination and passive discrimination.<p>

<I>Direct discrimination</I>  is built on a generalization made about an individual because they may share characteristics based on a stereotype. For example, a decision not to employ a gay man based on the assumption that all gay men have AIDS is direct discrimination.<p>

<I>Indirect discrimination</I>  is usually found in rules, policies or conditions which outwardly appear not to be discriminatory but make it difficult for certain groups of people to comply, such as an employer who required all prospective employees to be married, indirectly discriminating toward homosexuals.<p>

The status of marriage is irrelevant to most jobs, but a homosexual person would find it harder to comply than a heterosexual person.<p>

<I>Reactive discrimination</I>  occurs as a reaction to a person, or situation or to information which provokes an emotional and non-rational response.
It is invariably not intentional or planned. A considerable amount of HIV/AIDS related discrimination occurs when an infected person discloses their HIV positive status. It happens in medical situations, times of distress or when explaining special needs.<p>

<I>Proactive discrimination</I>  is intentional and planned. It is often found in the development of policies and rules designed to preclude certain groups. For example, a company policy where  all employees must have an HIV antibody test and must resign or be dismissed if found  positive is proactively discriminatory. Because testing applied to everyone, the company believed the policy was fair and non-discriminatory - this is not so.<p>

<I>Passive discrimination</I>  is usually a failure to act upon needs of a special group. It is often justified in terms of providing equal treatment for all but fails to meet the special needs of some. Passive discrimination is often historically based.<p>

Some believe that too much money is being given to fund AIDS research and not enough to diseases that cause more deaths, such as breast cancer. However, until recent years no resources were allocated to these groups.<p>

No one is immune to the HIV virus.  It is an equal opportunity infection that doesn't care whether you are young or old, gay or straight, male or female, black or white, brown or yellow. You have the power within you to protect yourself from infection. You also have the ability to show compassion toward those who have unfortunately already become infected with HIV.<p>

Think of how you would like to be treated if you had HIV or AIDS, and be sensitive to the needs of those living with the virus. AIDS is everyone's problem, and everyone can be part of the solution.

Doctors and researchers in sex therapy clinics have found that no two people, male or female, masturbate in exactly the same way. Many women like to masturbate by direct stimulation of the clitoris. Other women are more likely to let their fingers slide around their labia and clitoris.

<td align=left width=225 valign=top><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="HELVETICA,ARIAL">Men too, have varying techniques.  Some like to grasp their penis firmly while jerking it up and down, others like to stroke it gently. It is all a matter of personal choice and you learn from experimenting with what you like best.<p>



If your genitals become sore during masturbation you may be rubbing too hard. Use an oil or body lotion as lubricant to prevent this happening.

<DD>We REALLY jazzed up the site today! We added:
<BR><IMG SRC="homepage/redbullet.GIF"> A counter at the bottom of the Homeschool World home page. This counter does not record "hits."
Rather, it counts VISITORS to the site. Each visitor is only recorded once per session, no matter how often he or she accesses our home page.
The counter is kept offsite by another company called Web-Counter.
<BR><IMG SRC="homepage/redbullet.GIF"> Cute bullets and colored lines to the Homeschool World homepage and What's New page
<BR><IMG SRC="homepage/redbullet.GIF"> About three months' worth of What's New info (this site has been growing a lot faster than it seemed!)
<BR><IMG SRC="homepage/redbullet.GIF"> A link to the Netscape home page, so you can download their latest Web browser

<A NAME="Terms"></A>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="PHSLogo.GIF"><BR>
<FONT SIZE=-2>1/97 This form supersedes all previous forms</FONT></CENTER><BR>
<TABLE CELLPADDING=2>
<TD><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Payment Terms:</B> Entire payment is due in advance of issue. You may pay by check or by major credit card. To pay by credit card, fax or mail us the Insertion Order with credit card information filled out. Credit cards will not be billed until due date.<P>
<B>Rates:</B> We may adjust rates proportionate to any significant change in the numbers of issues distributed. We will notify multiple-issue advertisers in advance of any such changes.<P>
<B>Agency Discounts:</B> Agency discount is 15% on ads from recognized ad agencies ONLY with film and proofs supplied. All ads must be paid in advance.<P>
<B>Frequency Discounts:</B> Signing up for a "multiple" rate, the 6x rate, for example, means you promise to pay for an ad in that number of issues within a 12-month period. You may cancel a multiple-issue ad, subject to the conditions below.<P>
<B>Cancellations:</B> Cancellations must be received in writing. You may cancel an ad by (1) notifying us <B>in advance</B> of the Payment Due date and (2) paying the difference between the multiple rate and the 1x rate for the ads you have already run. <B>After</B> the Payment Due date, you are responsible to pay for the space you have reserved in that issue, as we have already committed space to it in the magazine layout. If you cancel <B>after</B> a Payment Due date, the <B>next</B> ad will be canceled. Failure to pay does not constitute cancellation.<P>
<B>Extra charges:</B> Initial typesetting of your ad is free, unless claiming agency discount. This includes free scanning of your line art or photos. Extensive changes, once typeset, will incur a $50 fee. Late payment for ad will incur a $20 fee. Repeated late payment may result in us dropping your ad.<P>
<B>Typesetting Your Ad:</B>  We actually <B>prefer</B> to typeset your ad -- and we'll do it for free! Just send us either (a) the words you want typeset, plus the graphics and photos we will need to scan, plus a rough drawing of how you want your ad to look, or (b) a disk with the ad in Macintosh QuarkXpress 3.2 or 3.3 format, along with a printout of the ad showing fonts and sizes used. Be sure to include on your disk all fonts and images used in the ad. We are equipped to scan photos, line art, and logos, and can handle electronic images stored in standard TIFF format. (Ask us about other formats.) Ads may be submitted on 3.5" disks, 44MB Syquests, or 128 MB magneto-optical cartridges.<P>
<B>Color:</B> If you have paid for color in  your ad, please submit a color proof or indicate on a photocopy of your art where you want the color to fall. Some common uses of color: background tints, reversed-out text, colored text, and/or colored borders. NOTE: <B>Graphics you ask us to create must be all one color,</B> due to the cost of creating color graphics. Four-color art may be submitted on disk, laid out by us, OR submitted as film separations accompanied by a color proof.</FONT>

<TD><FONT SIZE=-1><B>Special Placement</B> may be requested, but is not guaranteed.<P>
<B>Bleeds:</B> Full-page ads may bleed to edges.<P>
<B>Editing:</B> Ads we typeset for you may be tastefully edited if necessary to fit the text into the given ad space. Ads you send in electronic form also may be edited in order to fit our graphical standards and present a professional appearance in harmony with the rest of the magazine. Such editing is an advantage, not an error, and will not result in full or partial refunds.<P>
<B>Advertiser changes:</B> to ads we create must be submitted in <B>writing</B> before the Film Due date. After that date, ads are "placed" in the issue and not subject to change. We will not be liable for errors in any verbal changes submitted to us.<P>
<B>Typographical Errors:</B> To err is human -- to forgive, divine. While we will do our utmost to type your text accurately, if we do make a typo our liability is limited to rerunning the ad for free. Trivial typos not affecting essential ad elements will not result in us running a free ad.<P>
<B>Missing an issue:</B> We will not be liable for any costs or damages if for any reason we fail to publish an accepted and paid-for advertisement, other than to run it in the next issue.<P>
<B>We reserve the right</B> to reject any ad at any time. We will not knowingly accept any ad which violates historic Christian values.<P>
<B>Waiver of Liability:</B> Ads are accepted on the representation that the advertiser and its agency have the right to publish the contents thereof. In consideration of such publication, the advertiser and the agency agree to assume all legal liability, losses, and legal fees related to their ads placed in this publication. These include but are not limited to claims and suits for plagiarism, libel, copyright infringement, trademark violations, or invasion of privacy. They indemnify and hold harmless this publication and its owners and workers from any such charges or suits.<P>
<B>Terms & Conditions:</B> We will not be liable for events beyond our control (example: a tornado hitting our printer's facility) which cause an issue to not be printed or circulated in full. We also will not be liable for any losses due to issues not being published on time. <B>Although we will do our best to meet our publication deadlines, all publication dates are estimated, not guaranteed.</B>
<B>Additional conditions:</B> No conditions other than those set forth in this rate sheet shall be binding on us unless specifically agreed to, in writing, by PHS publisher Mary Pride.<TR></FONT></TABLE>

<CENTER><H1>Top Ten Reasons You Need to Advertise in Homeschool World</H1></CENTER>
<B>10. We don't do bad things and give you surprises.</B> Many professional Web designers
charge you for every megabyte of data customers view on your site, plus extra for every graphic
they scan in for you, plus maybe even a percentage of your sales. Our prices are usually
lower than theirs, AND there are no surprises!<P>
<B>9. We have Location, Location, Location!</B> The main question for Web advertising is,
"Will the right people find your page?" Instead of a no-name page you design yourself,
stuck on the back end of an online service, you can be where the homeschool traffic is,
on www.home-school.com!<P>
<B>8. We promote our site.</B><BR>
<UL><LI>We run a full-page ad promoting Homeschool World in every magazine we print.<BR>
<LI>We're registered on over two dozen online search engines.<BR>
<LI>We've even purchased "upgrade" ads on some search engines.<BR>
<LI>And we're aggressively swapping links with other major educational and family sites
on the Web.</UL><P>
<B>7.</B> We have a <B>dedicated high-speed server,</B> not a small section of someone's
mainframe that they are renting out for extra cash or an old creaky 386 in some Web Guy's garage.<P>
<B>6.</B> Unlike fly-by-night Web Guys, <B>we can handle the traffic.</B> A T-1 line
is connected to our site. That is the fastest line available. It's equivalent to 23 ISDN
lines. (You don't have to understand all this telephone talk, by the way . . . just remember
that we've got the Best Connections Around.)<P>
<B>5.</B> Homeschool World is <B>doubling its traffic</b> every two months. Currently, we're at
200,000 hits per month.<P>
<B>4. We make you look good.</B> You don't want an ad that's just a few ugly lines of text,
do you? We have four Photoshop experts on staff. That's serious design power!<P>
<B>3. We can scan in your art</B> -- up to 10 drawings, logos, or photos -- and add it to
your ad at no extra charge (full page ads only)!<P>
<B>2. </B>If you have a cassette product, <B>we can digitize a sound clip for you,</B> for a small extra charge
(full page ads only)!<P>
<B>1.</B> If you have a video product, <B>we can even digitize a short video clip</B> for you,
for a small extra charge (full page ads only)!<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+4>Can YOUR local Web Guy do THAT?</FONT></B><BR>

<B>10.</B> With other forms of advertising, you have to pay each time you try to reach
a prospect. Postage alone can run you over 50 cents each time you reach out to a potential 
customer. But <B>on the World Wide Web, new customers come to YOU,</B> at <B>no additional cost per
customer!</B><P>
<B>9.</B> If you put your World Wide Web address on your print ads, prospects can call up your Web ad to
<B>see a full page of information about your product,</B> in full color!<P>
<B>8. You can use your World Wide Web ad for inexpensive "market testing"</B> of special 
offers or product copy. Just $20 is all we charge to change your ad copy each time!<P>
<B>7.</B> <B>It's full-color advertising</B> at black-and-white prices!<P>
<B>6. Your Web ad works for you 24 hours a day.</B> Even when you're not doing a thing, you always
have a line in the water!<P>
<B>5. You don't even need a computer to have a Web ad.</B> Customers can call your phone #, fax you,
or mail in a printable order form. To set up your ad, all we need is the art (illustrations, 
logos, and photos) you want us to scan in, and the text (the words you want on your ad).<P>
<B>4.</B> Since one site links to another site links to a third site, and so on, <B>there's
no limit to the ways people can find you . . . </B> and to the customers you will collect
who you'd never reach otherwise. (Assuming your page is on a site that is linked to lots of
other sites and search engines.)<P>
<B>3. It's inexpensive!</b> Compare our prices to the cost of design, printing, and postage for traditional direct mail or print advertising!<P>
<B>2. </B>World Wide Web traffic is <B>constantly increasing.</B> Every month your ad reaches
more customers than the month before!<P>
<B>1. Your competition will be there if you aren't!<P>

<B>A complete studio arts curriculum applying the most effective teaching techniques and highest standards in the field, combining video demonstration, manual instruction, and professional mail evaluation.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Designed to be used by parents to instruct their own children, and themselves, in the fundamentals of drawing and painting. It is also adaptable to self-study by adults and more responsible older children.<P>
<LI>The Young Masters program produces the highest performing young representational artists in the world -- far surpassing other children's (and adult) art instruction programs.<P>
<LI>The Young Masters curriculum is composed of 15 separate "levels." Each level is divided into 8 steps containing logically sequenced worksheets and projects.<P>
<LI><B>The Foundation Program</B> (containing levels 1-4) covers the most essential drawing skills: the basic hand postures and drawing motions, line positioning, shaping, and correction techniques, grid drawing and line inking strategies. It also contains an introduction to color theory. It includes materials sufficient for the training of two (2) persons: a professional teacher manual, a ring bound student art book, three instructional video tapes, two mail monitoring sessions and all necessary supplies. Depending on age and ability level, it takes students between 4 months and 4 years to complete the foundation program.<P>
<LI>The remaining programs, each covering a complete level, cover all major art media and techniques: free-hand drawing, pen and ink drawing -- including hatching and stippling techniques, pencil shading, light and shadow, linear and aerial perspective, color theory, tempera and watercolor painting, color pencil and charcoal drawing, print making, design, life drawing, and oil painting.<P>
</UL>
<B>Is this program for you?</B><P>
It is -- <STRONG>if</STRONG> you are interested in learning to draw and paint what you see with a high degree of accuracy and are willing to work at it. -- specifically to:
<UL>
<LI>faithfully follow the manual and video tape instructions,<BR>
<LI>commit yourself to meeting the program standards,<BR>
<LI>persist when the going gets tough, and<BR>
<LI>practice regularly.<P>
</UL>
<STRONG>This willingness is the only "talent" you will need.</STRONG><P>

<DT>"This is a very good resource for the homeschool family serious about art education."<DD><strong>John Nixdorf (as reviewed in Mary Pride's <I>Practical Homeschooling</I> magazine)</strong><DT>"The scope of the curriculum is remarkable; it covers all the materials normally covered in the average public school art curriculum grades one through twelve!  Not only will students study such basics as the color wheel and visual rhythm, they also learn about heraldry, book illustration, mobiles, architecture, careers in art, printing, etc."<DD><STRONG>Janice P. Campbell, <I>Richmond Regional Newsletter</I></STRONG></DL><P>
Our curriculum is user friendly.  It has many pages that can be copied to hand out to more than one child.  Thirty art prints are also included with corresponding lessons.  A time line of art history puts the prints in perspective with the movements in art throughout history.  Meets most national and state criteria for art education.  Promotes using recycling for a limited art budget.  This curriculum uses art to reinforce the core curriculum subjects.  Enhances visual and verbal communication skills.  <B>Visual Manna 2</B> is now available!<HR>

<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>ATP's materials are divided between two catalogs. <B>Academic Therapy / Ann Arbor</B> contains many useful curriculum materials and teacher resources along with the well-known Ann Arbor Tracking Materials, as well as diagnostic tests. The <B>High Noon Books</B> catalog features high interest, low level readers and language arts material for children and young adults with reading difficulties.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR>
<CENTER><H2>ACADEMIC THERAPY / ANN ARBOR</H2></CENTER>

<H3>Curriculum Materials and Parent/Teacher Resources</H3>

Our materials cover a wide range from pre-K through secondary education and encompass: teaching techniques, visual training, attention deficit disorder, dyslexia, visual perceptual training, socialization, written expression, English as a second language, auditory processing, language development, behavior, and more.</P>

Representative titles useful for homeschoolers include:</P>
<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="NoOne.GIF" BORDER=1>
<B>No One To Play With - Revised: Social Problems of LD and ADD children:</B> A compassionate, practical guide describing everyday social problems and situations, with invaluable advice on dealing with them effectively.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="Phonic.ps.GIF" BORDER=1>

<BR>
<HR SIZE=3 WIDTH=40% >
<H3>Ann Arbor Visual Tracking Programs</H3>

<P>Many children experience reading difficulties due to problems with saccadic eye movements, (the way the human eye move from left-to-right, word-to-word, across a written page). ATP's Ann Arbor division contains materials that are designed to be used as a comprehensive, integrated program for diagnosis and remediation of these perceptual skills that underlie all academic learning.</P><BR>

<H3>Tests</H3>

<P>ATP carries a wide variety of criterion and norm-referenced assessments. <blink>NOTE:</blink> We're sorry, but tests sales are restricted to qualified professionals. Orders for tests MUST be placed on official institutional purchase order forms or professional letterhead.</P>

<P>Our <B>High Noon Books</B> division features more than 35 sets (five books per set) of high interest/low level novels, written on a 1st - 3rd/4th grade reading level for those aged 10-18 with reading difficulties. They help develop reading skills by reinforcing basic sight vocabulary with emphasis on the 200 basic sight words used in everyday language. Developed for easy  recreational reading, the one-plot mystery, adventure, fiction, and non-fiction stories maintain interest and encourage new or reluctant readers to gain the satisfaction of finishing a book.</P>

<CENTER><H1>"No Regrets"</H1></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><H4>"One month before my fifth birthday, my mother began teaching me to read and write, and 
school at home became a wonderful thing. Our classes were not those of traditional mother teaching 
her small daughter letters, shapes, color in preparation for kindergarten, however. Unlike most 
mothers, mine had made a decision to educate me at home."<P>From chapter one, Decisions.</H4></BLOCKQUOTE>

<BR CLEAR="left"><P><HR>
In 1975 Joyce Swann received a dream from God directing her to begin homeschooling her children. 
In faith, she and her husband made a commitment to home education. Eleven years later, at age 
sixteen, her daughter, Alexandra, received her master's degree as a result of home study. In her 
book, <B>No Regrets</B>, Alexandra discusses the family's trials and tribulations as well as 
their successes and shares the joys of learning at home in a large family.<P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The Swanns struggled bravely as homeschooling pioneers, going so far as to move to make sure 
their children could be taught legally at home. Those of us who are tempted to so easily 
give up because of "homeschool burnout" need to see how the Swanns faced heartbreak -- and undeserved 
-- financial trials, social trials, and even health trials . . . meeting the Swann family through the 
pages of this book was a delightful experience."<P>

King Solomon is recorded in Proverbs 22:6 as saying, "Train up a child in the 
way he should go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it." Of course, we as 
homeschoolers recognize the need to apply these words to the moral and spiritual 
guidance we give to our children. But these instructions also apply to the cultivation 
of our children's unique vocational gifts, thus giving them an edge upon entering the 
world of work.<BR CLEAR=left>

Each Career Explorer Pack contains:<BR><OL>
<LI>A <U>Career Exploration System Participants</U> book designed to provide 
"real-world skill for real-world situations in exploring careers and planning 
for the world of work" (American Guidance Services)<BR>

<LI>A copy of <U>The Guide To Occupational Exploration</U><BR>
<LI>A series of Occupational Outlook Reports (up to 50 in some cases) keyed to the 
survey interpretive folder and providing detailed information on the nature of each 
occupation, working conditions, job outlook into the next century, training and

<H3><i>Cambridge Academy: Your Bridge To Success</i></H3>
Cambridge Academy provides a bridge between creative home education and the demands of today's structured world. Cambridge courses prepare students for college, further vocational training, and the workplace.<p>
To succeed in today's increasingly complex world, students must learn to be self-sufficient. They must form their own goals, and build the problem-solving  skills that  will help  equip  them  with the  tools  they need to prepare for <strong>tomorrow's world</strong>.<p>
Our curriculum is designed around an academic core of <strong>math</strong>, <strong>English</strong>, <strong>science</strong>, and <strong>social studies</strong>, as well as <strong>business and elective courses</strong>. In addition, we have developed <strong>external programs</strong> of study that involve students in self-directed learning to promote self-sufficiency.<p>
The Cambridge approach focuses on developing a students self-confidence through positive reinforcement, the building of communication skills, and the practical application of course concepts.<p>



<H1>Programs, Tuition and Services</H1>
Cambridge Academy offers programs and resources for grades 6-12 to students who are homeschooled, are unable to attend a local school, have special needs, travel, need to make-up credits, wish to finish school sooner, or simply want to earn their high school diploma.<p>
Previously earned credits  (from home study or other schools) are accepted by Cambridge when verified by transcript or notarized form. Our curriculum meets the 180 day requirement of traditional school guidelines, and enrollment is accepted year-round.<p>
Cambridge Academy students learn the basics from textbooks accompanied by our own study guides which explain, enhance, amplify, and apply course concepts. Study guides also help prepare students for tests that are graded and returned to students with teacher comments and corrections. Our portfolio assessment and external elective programs allow students choose any study, activity, or project at home and earn elective credit. With our assistance, students develop and implement their own learning plan.<p>



<H1>Courses and Credits</H1>
Cambridge Academy offers over 60 courses in the subject areas of English, mathematics, science, social studies, business, as well as electives. Each course is accompanied by our specially designed study guide. Students can earn one credit for each course, per semester.<p>
Courses are assigned by ability level, not just by chronological age or grade. The Cambridge philosophy is to identify and meet a students needs. This way, students can receive the instruction they need and, at their own pace, build the skills necessary for academic growth. Our open- book testing policy helps to build the reading and referencing skills that will benefit students in their everyday lives.<p>
Students are required to take a series of tests for each course assigned.  Credit is  awarded for  courses with a final grade of 60% or higher. Our Education Department considers a student's interests, goals, and course selections in making the final decision for course assignment.<p>
To graduate, the minimum course requirements are a total of: 4 language arts, 3 social studies, 3 math, 3 science, as well as electives. The number of courses necessary to graduate will be determined by the credits already earned and grades completed when confirmed by an official transcript, previous records, or notarized homeschool verification form. Cambridge high school graduates earn an accredited diploma, not a GED. <p>


<H2>School Information/Credentials</H2>
Cambridge Academy was founded in 1978,  is listed with the State of Floridas Department of Education as a private school. Cambridge is accredited by the Accrediting Commission of the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC) in Washington DC. The DETC is only agency that is listed by the US Department of Education as the nationally recognized accrediting agency for distance education institutions. Cambridge is also listed in the American Council on Educations Directory of Accredited Schools, is a member of The College Board, is included on the Education Testing Services list of registered high schools nationwide, and on state and county lists of approved schools.<p>

Ludi, Discere Ltd., $30. 
Vocabulary-building game of prefixes. Players are
  chariot drivers, racing around a board 
  depicting the Circus Maximus of ancient
  Rome. Each square is marked with a
  Latin prefix; players must respond with
  an English word beginning with that prefix 
  in order to advance. It's a seven-lap
  race, and words may not be used twice,
  so the game can get quite challenging in
  the last few laps. Game includes a 
  vocabulary list to settle disputes (though
  any dictionary will do). Fast and fun;
  every Mom who played this game indicated 
  she'd buy it to play with the children.

"The beauty of this program is simplicity, consistency, and efficiency. Student's can catch up on all they should have learned with this
super-efficient course. Lessons build continually so knowledge is integrated rather than taught in isolation. With "The Grammar Key", we no
longer need to have students use book after book covering essentially the same grammar material, since this one resource can be used with
students from the middle elementary grades through high school.  The instructor's manual presents the lessons in such a fashion that
students can read it on their own. After the instruction, students shift to the workbook to complete exercises. Periodically they
encounter "Writing Practice" assignments which have them identify the sentence elements that they have studied thus far within their own short
compositions. The computer program requires at least eight hours of work to cover all of the topics, but this should be spread out so that
students have time to absorb and apply the information as well as time to complete the other written assignments from the workbook. The 
computer monitors student progress, with the capability of tracking unlimited students from the same program. The program does not allow
students to progress to the next level until they pass the present level, so students cannot skip ahead."<P>

<H1>BIBLIA SACRA</H1>
<H3>A Self-Study Latin Course Based on the Bible!</H3>
developed by classicists at the<P> <B>Kalepaedeia Program for Homeschoolers</B><br>
215 Miller Road, Newfield, NY 14867 (607) 564-3614<p></CENTER>

Dissatisfied with secular Latin textbooks?<p align="left">
Based on the Bible, Biblia Sacra is a treasure that makes the study of Latin a rich devotional time for the student.<p>
Self-study format is excellent for homeschoolers aged 8+.<p>

Beautifully-illustrated workbooks and accompanying tapes give vocabulary drills, matching and translations, English derivatives, crossword puzzles, and other fun activities useful in mastering the material as well as gaining insights into the life and resurrection of Christ (Level 1) and into Genesis (Level 2).<br>
Sixty-minute tapes include the worshipful music of Bach and the voice of the personable instructor, Scott Bayer, PhD, who has taught Latin for years.<p>
Level 1 provides minimal introduction into grammar, while Level 2 offers a thorough study of grammar with many exercises and much practice.<p>
Students work with original Bible passages IN LATIN from the 4th c. Latin translation of the Bible made by the scholar Jerome, called the Vulgate.<p>
Workbooks provide answer keys to all exercises, enrichment activities, engravings and woodblock prints, helpful suggestion, and a glossary.<p>
Recommended in the <i>Issachar File</i> (Vol. 4 N. 2, Mar/Apr /94)<p>
<b>BIBLIA SACRA</b> is an exciting way to study Latin and the Bible!<p>

<title>Bible Math Labs</title>
<BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFDD>
<img src="MathLabs.GIF" align="left">What are <b>Bible Math Labs?</b><ul>
<li>A collection of math investigations (some from Bible stories, others from everyday situations) which use math as a tool
<li>Over 30 labs that integrate and emphasize various middle-school-level math skills<p><br><br></ul><p>
<BR>Why use <b>Bible Math Labs?</b><ul>
<li>Because, starting at upper elementary and continuing through middle school and high school, students experience less and less of math in the context of real world situations. Therefore, students tend to view math as an isolated course for the few "smart" people, or to prepare you for next year's math course.
<li>Because the labs use math as a <b>tool</b> (not as an isolated technique) to investigate stories and situations.
<li>Because the labs bring new understanding to some Bible stories by mathematically analyzing some of the data in the Bible.
<li>Because many of your students are cruising unchallenged through the textbook, memorizing and frustrated without understanding, or just plain bored stiff! <b>Bible Math Labs</b> and <i>Math Labs Newsletter</i> provide wonderful resources for occasionally stepping out of the textbook.</ul><p>
How do you use <b>Bible Math Labs</b> and <i>Math labs Newsletter</i>?<ul>
<li>As breaks from the text, or to bolster concepts being learned. (Check the Skills Chart included in <b>Bible Math Labs</b>.)
<li>As launch pads for discussions about how and where math can be used.
<li>As starting points for students' recognition of math in their lives and in the world around them.</ul><p>
What are some other features of these publications?<ul>
<li>Bible Math Labs, about 30 labs, charts, illustrations, specific instructions, open-ended questions, helpful <i>Skills Chart</i>, extensive <i>Notes and Solutions</i> section, and <i>Developing Your Own</i> section.
<li><i>Math Labs Newsletter:</i> More math labs, 6 issues per year, "Glad You Asked" column, FREE lab writing service, "Reader Spotlight" column.</ul><p>

<HR width=40% align=center><P>
<H3>The Program</H3>The Ball-Stick-Bird reading series derives its name from the way it teaches the
alphabet: with Balls (circles), Sticks (lines), and Birds (angles) you can make all
the letters of the alphabet. But the real fun starts with the presentation of the
fourth letter and the beginning of the goofy science fictions adventures of Vad of
Mars who has rockets for feet. These stories package principles from perceptual and 
developmental psychology to speed up the learning process. Drill (practice) is
inherent within the system. Reading principles that have to be learned, such as
different letter sounds, diphthongs, etc., are repeated and again, each time in the
context of another goofy science fiction adventure.<P>
<H3>The Books</H3>Each Ball-Stick-Bird Book, 8-1/2" by 11" in size, ranging from 100 to 150 pages long,
is on thick shiny paper so that moist little hands don't show. At present there are
ten colorful books of different but related adventures that take a student from
zero to adult reading.<P>
<H3>The Results</H3>Research has shown that with Ball-Stick-Bird there was no such thing as dyslexia. 
Preschoolers and elementary students became avid readers with astonishing speed. 
Adults with a history of learning disability, and even severely retarded students
easily learned to read with comprehension. These successes and the questions they
raised about human intelligence led to several symposia on Ball-Stick-Bird at
Annual Meetings of the American Psychological Association. They have also led to 
a new theory of cognitive organization called "the-story-as-the-engram" theory
with fascinating implications for the potential of the human mind.<P>
About Ball-Stick-Bird the <I>Journal of Developmental Education</I> said: <Q>"Dr.Fuller
provides us an unparalleled opportunity for a paradigm shift with potentially 
far-reaching consequences for education, not just in reading, but in total
intellectual development."</Q><HR>

HOME OF "DISCOVER INTENSIVE PHONICS FOR YOUR SELF"<BR>
BY CHARLOTTE F. LOCKHART</CENTER><BR></H4>
<IMG SRC="LOCKHART.GIF" ALIGN="LEFT"><P><P><BR>
The author Charlotte F. Lockhart is a dynamic and fantastic school teacher. After retiring she began to spread the word about how to teach spelling and reading. After being a reading consultant for five years she wrote the <B><U>"Discover Intensive Phonics for Yourself"</B></U> system.
<P>
<P>
<P>
The system starts with step-by-step lessons, in which children learn sound, meaning and
letter recognition. They write all the letters at the blackboard; standing at the 
blackboard is part of the multi-sensory approach. Students then go through all the
consonants and blends. In the next sequence they learn the rest of the sounds, the skills,
the decoding process, spelling rules, contractions, suffixes, and synonyms.<p>
The program comes with the teacher's manual and a cassette tape by Charlotte to teach
you how to work with your student. Reverse listening cards for reinforcement of learning
the steps, and two posters that show the sounds, blends, and special vowel combinations your 
student will be learning.<IMG SRC=FERNYSTUFF.GIF ALIGN="RIGHT"><p><br>

When a child enters the first grade he or she has a vocabulary of over 20,000 words. The
problem is not learning the meaning of words, but learning to recognize them. The English
language is made up of only 26 letters with only 44 elementary sounds. Once phonics or
"letter sounds" are learned, words can be systematically sounded out.<P>
Phonics are the actual foundation on which all words are built. So whether you are a child
beginning school or a school age student who just has difficulty reading, or even an adult
who has never learned phonics skills...<H2>VIDEO PHONICS IS FOR YOU!</H2></TABLE><TR>

<B>Why Christian Karate?</B> Urged by the Holy Spirit to encourage other Christians in their
spiritual growth, founder Mitch Freistat has created this unique defense system to equip
the believer both physically and spiritually to fight to good fight of the faith in their
daily Christian walk. Physically we learn to control our own bodies in a way that is holy and honorable for the glory of God. Spiritually
we learn to take every thought captive and bring it to the obedience of Christ.<P>
<B>Every aspect of the Totally Christian Karate class is designed to spiritually edify
the student</B> through a Scripture name, a Bible study, and a memory verse for each
technique, which are memorized by repetition as each physical technique is executed.
Practical applications of the scriptures learned are expounded upon throughout the class
by the instructor which creates a time of encouragement, excitement, and eternal value
for the student. This all happens at the same time the student is learning a compassionate,
non-aggresive, but effective form of self-defense.<TR>

<BODY BGCOLOR=#FFFFC8>
<IMG SRC="dictionary.gif" ALIGN=left><H2> 7 reasons why Noah Webster's 1828 Dictionary should be in <I>every</I> Christian home and school.</H2><P>
While contemporary dictionaries reflect the growing secularism permeating contemporary culture, the <I>original Noah Webster</I> dictionary uniquely reveals the <I>character</I>
and <I>culture</I> that gave rise to American liberty, morality and prosperity.<P>
The scholarship of this <I>national treasure</I>, republished by the <B><TT>Foundation For American Christian Education</TT></B>, reflects his <I>twenty</I> years of work and mastery
of <I>twenty-six languages.</I><P>
<B><I>The American Dictionary of the English Language</I> by Noah Webster,</B> the "father of American Christian education and scholarship," does far more
than merely define words:<BR>
<OL><LI><B><TT>It is a uniquely valuable family and school resource</TT></B> for <I>instruction</I> and <I>discipline</I>, helping parents and educators guide the
thinking, speaking, and writing of children <I>from an American Christian perspective</I>.<BR>
<LI><B><TT>It teaches and inspires</TT></B> because defining terms shapes the whole view of <I>any</I> subject.<BR>
<LI><B><TT>It builds Christian scholarship and character</TT></B> like that of America's founding generations, according to some historians the most literate in
world history.<BR>
<LI><B><TT>Its biblical definitions</TT></B> help reveal our forefathers' understanding of the principles of <I>law, government, and liberty</I> upon which
America was founded.<BR>
<LI><B><TT>It helps restore the individual and the nation</TT></B>, leading parents, students, and teachers to rediscover America's unique <I>Christian heritage of
education and government.</I><BR>
<LI><B><TT>It enhances the student's biblical vocabulary and understanding</TT></B>, citing the <I>scriptual usage of words</I> from the original biblical languages.<BR>
<LI><B><TT>Unparalleled scholarship</TT></B>: each word is researched to its <I>roots in original languages</I>. Subsequent dictionaries add more words and drop
Biblical and classical scholarship, defining by changing custom.<P></OL>

Ludi, Discere Ltd., $30. 
Vocabulary-building game of prefixes. Players are
  chariot drivers, racing around a board 
  depicting the Circus Maximus of ancient
  Rome. Each square is marked with a
  Latin prefix; players must respond with
  an English word beginning with that prefix 
  in order to advance. It's a seven-lap
  race, and words may not be used twice,
  so the game can get quite challenging in
  the last few laps. Game includes a 
  vocabulary list to settle disputes (though
  any dictionary will do). Fast and fun;
  every Mom who played this game indicated 
  she'd buy it to play with the children.

<TITLE>Homeschool Cyber-News #1</TITLE>
<BODY BGCOLOR="EEAEAE">
            <CENTER><IMG SRC="HSCN1.gif"><BR>
                         June 1995</CENTER></B><P>

It's summer!  Welcome to our first ever issue of The Homeschool Cyber-News.  Some of us are homeschooling as usual, some are preparing to slack off a while (some of us always slack off <g>), but here are some cheery announcements, brilliant ideas and zany quotes to brighten your month.  This must surely be the only newsletter ever which had a brownie recipe AND a secret passageway!<P>

If this newsletter comes into your mail less than gorgeous, try widening your window.  If you have suggestions for making it better next time, let us know.  If you'd prefer not to receive this ever again as long as you live, let us know.  If you want to write part of it next time, start writing!   Short, sweet and funny go to the head of the queue.<P>

Were you aware of the live chats for homeschoolers?  Our online chats are fun places to meet old friends to make new friends, to hang out and listen, or to get your questions answered.   They attract big, friendly groups so feel free to join any or all of these: <P>

<UL><LI><B>Thursday Evening Chat Schedule</B></LI>

<B>Kids' Chats</B> (Wednesdays, 1:00-2:00 p.m. Eastern time, The Shade Tree)<BR>
       The host is KTrautman and her assistant is Elizabyrd (Molly). <P> 

Join our new <B>Wednesday Chat!!!</B><BR>
   Wednesday, June 7 from 5:00 to 7:00 pm Eastern Time, in Homefront Hall, and all following Wednesdays until further notice!   No topic for the first chat, just getting to know each other and brainstorming topics and guests for future chats. Come join us!    <B><I>Host: Journey100</B></I><P>

<font color="ff0000" size="+2"><B>The Cyber-News CONTEST for June</FONT></B><P>

Our first contest is going to be coming up with future contests.  What could we put here that would be fun, uplifting and educational?  Things that aren't much harder for kids than parents...   The submittors of the best three suggestions will each receive an hour of AOL credit.  Next month we might have more substantial prizes (or we might have more hours of AOL credit <g>) but either way it will be fun and you can earn the praise and awe of your fellow homeschoolers.  We'll publish the winners next month!<P>

Send your ideas for contests to HS Mail before June 14.  If you'd like to be one of the judges, send a note and say that too (whether or not you enter).   The full list of entries will be mailed out to the judges June 14 and we'll have fun all summer with some great contests!   (Lest you forget to send your entry, I'll ask your neighbors to put flags out, so if you see American flags everywhere, it's to remind you of the contest deadline.  This reminder does not apply outside the U.S. and its possessions.)<P>

<B>PLACES TO GO Ñ THINGS TO SEE</B><BR>
If you've found a cool place online that others might be interested in send your ideas to HSMail.  We'll publish a selection of them each month. Here are some of our favorites:<P>

<B>Keyword: Kidsnet</B><BR>
  >>KIDSNET is the only national, non-profit computerized clearinghouse devoted to children's television, radio, audio and video programming.<<       You can search the database for programs, write in two message board areas (one for parents, one for kids), and download study guides related to programs.<P>

<B>Keyword: National Geographic</B><BR>
  Download maps, read articles like: Far Out Facts: Animal Speeds, take the Geo-quiz challenge, learn about NGS's Geography Bee, order periodicals, find out about NGS Kids' Network and about Geographic TV,  or write in the message boards. Educational, fun, resourceful - there's a lot there!<P>

<B>Keyword: Education, then Educational Software Libraries</B><BR>
  This area has >>collections of educational software developed by America Online's Computing and Software department and represent the largest collection of educational software available on any commercial online service<<  Regardless of your type of computer you can find all kinds of software for your homeschooling needs. A recent look at foreign languages found software on Spanish, Latin, Korean, German, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, French & others. You can search by area of interest (foreign languages) or by level (elementary). Have fun looking for great stuff - and be sure to let us know what you find that is good. Having trouble opening or dealing with any of the programs you download? Go to keyword Free and talk to the friendly folks at Tech Support Live!<P>

<B>LOVE NOTES/FAN MAIL</B><BR>
If you don't already know, we love getting love notes and plan to share the best unashamedly. <g><P>

"I just can't get over the nice welcome I got in my mailbox from MyCamelot and what it means to me to find other home schoolers out there.  Keep up the good communication.  I feel often like we are adventurer/explorers on a new frontier."<P>

<CENTER>  <B>*LOL*     "LAUGHING OUT LOUD"     *LOL*</CENTER></B><BR>
Homeschoolers are sometimes characterized as being just a bit on the serious side. Seriously folks, we have a great time online and our humorous moments are usually our best!<P>

<B>Language Acquisition:</B><P>

<I>This was posted by PSoroosh:</I>  <<It is always funny when kids generalize from one rule and invent their own words.  My toddler daughter ran to the front door when she heard someone knocking and yelled "Whobody is there?"  My dh was on the other side of the door and yelled back "Somebody open the door."  My little one then yelled back "Do you mean mebody?"  He yelled back "Anybody" ( he had his arms full of something heavy).  She yelled back "I'm the only body that is here."  About that time I stopped laughing long enough to go and open the door for him. <P>

<I><B>If you can't beat 'em....</I></B><P>

From:  PIZMIRE<P>

<<LOL to the day off maids  I was really frustrated with my kids making their beds.  Yes they thought their beds looked made, but I saw a pile of blankets, sheets and pillows sooooo I went to out Deseret Industries, a second hand store, and bought two sleeping bags.  Well the kids picked them out.   Now all that is on their beds is a sheet, pillow and sleeping bag.  It might sound silly but I no longer have to nag them about making their beds look like I made them.  Maybe this might help other moms with messy children's beds.<P>
                                                                             

<B><I>And about that physical education aspect...</B></I><P>

<< I took my sil and mil to the park where we usually meet on Wed. with a large homeschooling group.  It's a big, lovely park with alot of equipment that my children seem to enjoy. . . . My four year old was running around and up and over the wooden jungle gym, climbing over the monkey bars, hanging from the monkey bars, racing across the wooden "bridge," etc.  And my mil turns to me and says: "It would be so nice to get him into a gymnastics or tumbling class.  That way he'd have an outlet for all that energy."<BR>
:-)<BR>
Need I say more?<BR>
<FONT COLOR="513EC3"><B><I>(This was posted on the boards... I'm quoting it anonymously, but with the author's permission... y'never know whose mil (mother-in-law) might be reading! *bwg*</FONT></I><P></B>

<B>Overheard in the Poolside Chat: </B><BR>
Felicitas, your brownies-to-kill-for are delicious! You were right--long term storage is not a problem!;-) We're on our second batch around here! <P>

And the recipe is <FONT COLOR="6D01A1"><B><I>[drumroll, please...]:</FONT></I></B><P>

<UL><LI>In microwave, melt together 3 one-ounce squares unsweetened baking chocolate and one stick butter.*</LI>
<LI>In small bowl, beat 4 eggs.</LI>
<LI>Remove melted chocolate mixture and stir til smooth.</LI>  
<LI>Stir in one-half teaspoon salt, one tablespoon vanilla (I like alcohol free "cook's" vanilla) and 2 cups sugar.</LI>
<LI>Stir in the beaten eggs.</LI>
<LI>Stir in one cup flour.</li>
<li>Stir in 6 to 8 ounces chocolate chips (a whole 12 oz. bag is too much; plus, this way you leave some in your cupboard for surreptitious munching).</li>
<li>Pour batter into greased 13x9x2 inch baking dish.</li>
<li>Bake at 350 for one-half hour. DO NOT OVERBAKE.</LI>
<li>Test for doneness with a toothpick.</li>
<LI>Cut into squares and roll in powdered sugar, while still almost too hot to touch, then store in an airtight container.  (Extended storage isn't usually a problem.) </LI></UL>
* You may of course melt the chocolate and butter on the stovetop, or over the fire in your cave, if necessary :-)

This was my mom's recipe, 'though she used a cup of chopped walnuts instead of choc. chips.  My kids don't like nuts, and walnuts make my mouth itch, so I had to sacrifice with the substitution ;-)<BR>
Enjoy!  Felicitas.<P>

P.S. If you want to give the recipe a cutesy name (besides "Brownies to Kill For," as my friend Meg calls them), try "Felicitations."<P>

<FONT COLOR="6D01A1"><B><I>[Editorial comment:  Yum yum yum yum yum yum yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm]</FONT></I></B><P>

There's a lot more of this fun stuff in the Homeschool Connection area!  Here's the secret passageway to get there really fast.   You can keyword "homeschool" or, better yet,  make a shortcut by using "Edit Favorite Places" (for MAC folks)  or "Edit Go To Menu" (for IBM) under the "GoTo" pulldown at the top of your screen.  Open the Favorite Places editor (the maker of secret passageways) and put the keyword in one of those spaces, and from then on you can hit that as soon as you log on and voila!  Homeschool City in one easy step. <P>

<B>ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE:</b><BR>
Yes, we can be serious too. We are serious about our families, serious about our commitment to homeschooling and definitely serious about our AOL bills <g>!!! <P> 

<B>From AOL Q & A:</B><P>

"How do I log a folder?"<P>

Just go to Logging open your Session log (name it, put it where you can find it) then go to the folder you want, and start going through the messages.  You don't have to scroll through each one, just when the cursor changes back into an arrow, click on Next Message.  Skip right through them, and then go back to logging, close the Session log, and sign off.  You can open the log through your word processing program and read leisurely! :-)<P><HR><P>


And, a special piece that warmed our hearts and brought tears to our eyes:<P>

<B><U>For Elias:  Why Mommy is So Bittersweet on Your Birthday</B></U><P>

You pad into the room, your little<BR>
eyes a brown question mark.<BR>
It is your birthday. You are <BR>
two today. So<BR>
who brought you here?  I know that<BR>
a half world away a young woman<BR>
has left her work station..<BR>
maybe for the tea house and will laugh <BR>
with friends and smile <BR>
a very sad, distant smile as she<BR>
remembers<BR>
you. <BR>
Your first  flutterings in her tummy.<BR>
Your first hard kicks.<BR>
Your grandparents' faces when they learned you were <BR>
coming into an unwelcoming world.<BR>
Your first cry of life.<BR>
Did you suckle?  Did you have kisses on your sweet<BR>
face or were you whisked away and<BR>
out of sight like an empty plate <BR>
from a banquet table.<BR>
Leaving her forever hungry <BR>
for you.<BR>
You punch your mylar helium balloon...little tough guy...<BR>
ride your rocking horse and pull your new wagon.  Soon<BR>
there will be sherbet and cake and pizza and soda.<BR>
Dang, I forgot kimchee.<BR>
And a half world away I can feel a salty tear, I can hear<BR>
the beating of a hurting heart and I know<BR>
you are loved<BR>
and remembered<BR>
today.<BR>
I wish she could know<BR>
that I, too, remember<BR>
and love<BR>
her.<P>

<HR><P>

You'll hear from us again around the beginning of July.  We hope to hear from you by e-mail or on the bulletin boards between now and then.   May your June be filled with love and happiness.<P>

                                  <B> Later that same June   (1995)</B></CENTER><P>

The first issue of Cyber-News was fun to put together, and after about the ninth person said, "I can't wait for the next issue!," we couldn't either so here it is, early.  Thanks and hugs to all who helped in various ways.<P>

<B>FROM THE MOUTHS OF BABES:</b><P>

"My son was a animal in a large-scale production of Noah's Flood and we were in the dressing room the last night of rehersals.  A public school teacher,  hopefully not representative of all around here, entered the room, did not acknowledge the other adults in the room, and started screaming at the kids.  She was a teacher at _____ school and would not be embarassed by this group, a very few of her students included.  They were too loud, chewing gum, unprofessional and acting like kids!!!   Wow!  I think the oldest was 12 and the youngest about 5,  how stupid of them to act so.   Well, the kids got quiet and wide-eyed as she threatened to send them home if the didn't get serious.  She really was steamed.  My kid has never seen a classroom and didn't know to keep still.  He raised his hand and she said "What!"  He stood up and said something like, "But if you send us all home, the show can't go on because we are almost all of the people on the stage."  Her face grew red and she said in a quieter, measured voice," I could send home the bad individuals."  My innocent child looked up at her and said," Yes, but that is not what you said and anyway, no one was THAT bad."  She told him to sit down and went on to help the animals rehearse a song.  My heart burst with pride.....   I later spoke to her alone and informed her that there were several hs kids there who were not used to that kind of behavior in adults and that she perhaps would not get the desired results that way.   Needless to say, we did not go out for coffee later....   :^})"  (AUTOTELIC)<P>

<HR><BR>
                      <CENTER><B>THE CONTEST-CONTEST RESULTS</center></B><P>

Last issue we asked people to submit their ideas for contests.  Nineteen entries were received.  There were twenty judges.  The winning entries, the submittors of which each receive one hour of AOL credit, are:<P>

<B>FIRST PLACE WINNER:  BRGFB</B><BR>
DINNER PARTY:  Since getting to know interesting people is such an integral part of homeschooling/unschooling, how about having folks describe their version of the Ultimate Unschooling Dinner Party? Name, say up to four people, living today (I'm not sure dead people go to dinner parties, although they do vote in Chicago, I'm told <g>), with whom you'd like to spend an evening at your home with your kids. A brief word of biographical description (in case the rest of us don't know who they are) explaining why you'd invite them, and maybe even some ideas about menus (in case some folks you'd want to invite are vegetarians, and others might not be, etc.), and perhaps some ideas about entertainment/conversational topics after/during dinner (would you just talk all evening, play instruments, have a game of UNO?).   [ENTRIES DUE JULY 7]<P>

<B>SECOND PLACE:   Rex Head</B><BR>
COOKBOOK:  Who can submit the best kids recipes.  They should be simple enough for a early reader to read, make and serve.  The end result of the contest would be a cookbook for young children. It would encourage reading, math, and cooking skills. We have two early readers so we would be good judges for this one. <P>

<B>THIRD PLACE:   DeniV</B><BR>
AOL SCAVENGER HUNT.  Set a starting date to give everyone a chance to get their announcement of the contest.  List things found in different areas of AOL that would be somewhat educational (network news, National Geographic, etc.) have the kids list a certain piece of info found in that area.<P>

The first contest is open right now.  Try to limit your entry to one paragraph.  I'll try to rustle up some prizes between now and then (not that YOU guys do stuff like this for rewards, or prizes, or grades.  *bwg*).<P>

The second contest needs this reminder:  Please don't violate the copyright of any cookbook!  Make these original, in that they are things your family has actually tested and used, and write the instructions as you've found them to work best.  You can send recipes anytime.  If they are child-developed or -augmented recipes, please say so  Let's give these budding chefs some credit.   Send entries whenever you want to.  If we get enough for one "online cookbook" we can just start a new one!<P>                                                                     

The third contest will be prepared and presented later in the summer.<P>

If you want to judge, even if you don't want to enter, let us know.<P>

    <CENTER>*  More contests NEXT TIME!  There are many good ones still on that list! *</CENTER><P><HR><P>

                          <CENTER><B>   ON-LINE SAFETY FOR CHILDREN</CENTER></b><P>

Here are the important parts of the 6/15 chat on on-line safety for children, at which Guide RK was guest "speaker."  The full chat is in the library.<P>

Teach your child what to do if trouble occurs.<BR>
Make sure they know how to:<BR>
<UL><LI>Summon a Guide for help with Keyword: GUIDEPAGER</LI>
<LI>Use IGNORE</LI>
<LI>Report infractions to Keyword: TOS</LI>
<LI>Turn off Instant Messages</LI>
<LI>Forward unacceptable mail to TOSEmail.</LI></UL><BR>
Some children will be too young to learn all of these things.
But make sure they do know how to use GUIDEPAGER and IGNORE.<BR>
If they are too young to learn all these steps, be near at hand when they're online and make sure YOU know how to do these things, so you can jump in should the need arise.<P>
<HR><P>
Here are a list of "NEVER" rules to keep in mind, and pass along to your children:<BR>
<UL><LI>Never give out your password.</li>
<li>Never give out any personal information without express permission from your parents:   things like, full name, address, phone number, school, Dad's or Mom's place of business.</li>
<li>Never use the US Postal service to correspond with or send things to someone you have met online.... once again, not without permission from parents.  The same applies for phone conversations.</li>
<li>Never make arrangements to meet an online friend face to face without parental permission and the strictest possible supervision.</li></ul><P>

To summarize the eight suggestions I brought up tonight:<BR>
<OL><LI>Teach your child AOL's Terms of Service.</li>
<LI>Give him/her the tools to take care of some problems themselves.</li>
<LI>Use Parental Controls.</li>
<LI>Familiarize yourself with AOL and the places your child "hangs out."</li>
<LI>Get to know their online friends.</li>
<LI>Make online adventuring a "family affair".</li>
<LI>Communicate with them regularly concerning their online activities.</li>
<LI>Give them the definite No-No's!</li></OL><BR>
And one last suggestion...  Work out the rules, the contract, whatever you want to call it for the time they spend online and then see that they stick to it!<P>

[One last suggestion from the staff:  When your child goes online, we recommend that you turn on "log session" just as standard procedure.  It gives a good record for unaccompanied kids if there is a TOS violation.]<P><HR><P>

And now, without further ado:     <B>THE FUNNY STUFF!</B><P>

Do you know what you call it when a home school Mom talks to herself??? <BR>
                 (The answer's in here somewhere.)<P>

<B>MADE UP WORDS</B><P>

"My four year old was making a playdoh "cake" and needed a spatula to lift it off the plate. "Where's the skootchula?"  she asked. When I figured out what she was asking for, I agreed it was a better word since you "skootch" the food up onto the utensil, you don't spatch it on."  (CopyKatz)<P>

"The invented language of my children has always been a tremendous source of fun for us. I wish I had kept a diary of them all. My eleven year old son, when he was a baby, called anything in the shadows a scatticope (I think that's how you spell it).  My 2 1/2 year old uses words like after-the-later and lasternight. <P>
     "My nine year old daughter has always been great at it and still is. We were watching a Sherlock Holmes Mystery -- The Hound of the Baskervilles -- one Friday night (Friday night is mystery night at our house and my husbands popcorn is famous), we were coming to the part where they let the hound out of the tomb, when my Abi grabbed her friends arm and said "Oh, this is my favorite part. It is sooooooo mystitious."  What a great word. It has become a regular part of our vocabulary."   (RDoan75062)<P>

--DO you know what you call it when a home school Mom talks to herself???--<BR>
                [A parent-teacher conference...LOL     (Shar JC)]<P>

"Tonight while getting ready for bed,  my little one said, "Mommy, when I'm 30, will you come over every night and put my pull-up on for me?"  (CopyKatz)<P>

                    <CENTER><B>RESPONSES TO CYBER-NEWS #1</B></CENTER><P>

"The 'For Elias' poem was beautiful -- and brought tears to my eyes -- on a summer Sunday-wind-down-evening, as my first daughter approaches her first birthday...  Particularly timely, considering the love floating around the Baby Richard case lately.  Remember: 'Love, not blood, binds."     God bless  Elias and his loving parents." (Willawork)<P>

"Thanks for the issue.  The poem about adoption brought tears to my eyes.  I was asked to go with my cousin to meet his and his wife's new Korean baby last December.  What an incredible moment.  I felt so honored.  I thought of giving the poem to them, but I think it might be too touchy.  My brother has two adopted children.  I've learned so much in the process of sharing my relatives' adoptions with them.  It's such a complex topic with implications on so many levels for all of us."  [Naniha (Nicky)] <P> 

"Thank you so much for sending me the Cyber News!  It is a pleasure to find so many homeschoolers online.  I am having the best time with AOL.  It is a very expensive toy, but I haven't enjoyed anything so much in years."  [JaElise (Jane)]<P>

"Thanks for including me.  I am so thrilled to find you all that I am getting our support group on line asap.  Sometimes we feel alone doing this work, and it is so great to know there are so many of us and we are 'normal.'  I use the term loosely!  Will join you all Thursdays as much as possible."   [L1atin (Mary)]<P>

"Good news letter...am printing it out for our HomeSchool Charter School group. I LOL, cried too....Keep up the good work!!!!!! :) :)"   (DWell73370)<P>

<B>THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU:</B>  "Hi, I hope you can help me.  I got the June newsletter and copied it off and have deleted it.  Well, I can't find it anywhere downloaded or written.  I was hoping you could e-mail me another copy? It was a great newsletter and I really want to finish reading it."    Anyone who needs another copy needs only to ask!  It's no problem.  If you have friends who didn't get one and would like one, just have them write to HS MAIL or MyCamelot.<BR><HR><P>

"Never make a principle out of your experience; let God be as original with other people as He is with you." - Oswald Chambers.<P>

That's to keep me humble as I share with you what the Holy Spirit has revealed to me regarding "Homeschooling" vs. "Unschooling". <P> 

I started Homeschooling last year with the idea that it meant doing the school-thing at home.  Hence the name, "Homeschooling."   Because I was not homeschooled, I fell into this trap.   It didn't take long before I began to realize this was not what God had intended.   I give all praise and glory to my Heavenly Father for the change of mind He has manifested in my life!<P>

I became aware of an idea that I could homeschool my children without doing it the way the public schools do it.    Hence the name, "Unschooling."   God  revealed to me that my #1 priority in homeschooling was to Disciple my children.  "Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness..."  (Matthew 6:22).  Then, trust Him for the rest (academics, etc.) ..."and all these things shall be added to you."  God, indeed, invented education but He did not invent school.  He has made me aware of the dangers of adopting the world's agenda for education.  <P>

I have been made aware of the misconception that "Unschooling" means schooling without structure or schedules.  On the contrary,  our God is a God of order.  "For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith goodness, and to goodness, *knowledge*, and to knowledge, self-control; and to self-control, perseverence; and to perseverance, godliness; and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love." (2 Peter 1:5).  Knowledge should never come before faith.  Our curriculum should never tyrannize our homeschool.  Academics should never come before God's mandates.  "Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up." (1 Corinthians 8:1b).<P>

God put it all together for me when I had the privilege of hearing a speaker by the name of Johnathan Lindvall who has a series of tapes on Bold Parenting.  If any of you have the same feelings or misconceptions that I had, I suggest you contact Bold Parenting Seminars,  P. O. Box 820, Springville, CA 93265 or call (209) 539-0500, and request Tape #501, Homeschooling vs Discipleship.<P>

In His service,<BR>

              <CENTER><B>ONLINE HOMESCHOOLING INFORMATION<BR>
                          by Danetta Mecikalski (DAB7580)</B></CENTER><P>

Homeschoolers beware!  There is an impending crisis in the homeschool movement and it is called--information overload!<P>

Remember when it was almost impossible to find out anything about home education?  Remember when you thought that you were the only one in the world crazy enough to consider this for your child?  Remember when your library had two books about home education and they always seemed to be out?  Remember when you would have given your right eye tooth for a chance to speak with someone who had personal experience teaching their own child?<P>

Those days seem to be gone.  Rupp's "Good Stuff" is already in our library, and new home education magazines appear every few months.  Homeschool curriculum fairs are in every state, and if one is lucky enough to be online, one can hardly keep up with the homeschooling forums that seem to be popping up everywhere.<P>  

Of course, if you are reading this, you probably already know about the AOL online forums in the Parent Information Network.  Keywords PIN and HOMESCHOOL will get you to them faster.  I consider these forums as almost separate areas.  Different people log on and concerns are diffferent in the General Homeschooling, Practical Homeschooling (PHS) and Home Education Magazine (HEM) forums and I glean information from all of these areas.<P>
  
Less well-known may be the homeschool folders associated with the religion forum.  Type in keywork RELIGION and you will see a list of faiths.  Faith, or world view, family life, and home education are all intertwined, and people of different faiths try to incorporate their world view into the education of their children.<P>

For example, under Atheism is the folder Educating Our Children. Humanism/Uniterianism has the folder Other Homeschoolers, and under the Jewish Religion in the Jewish II board is the folder Jewish Homeschooling.  Those parents who are logging on to the general homeschooling boards and asking for specific information about secular or Jewish home education can find additional information and support for their home education approaches.  Even if a particular religion's folder does not discuss home education per se, they often have folders about teens or parenting.  For example, under the Pagan board is the folder Pagan Parenting, and the Islamic and Baha'i boards have similar folders.<P>

If you have access to the Internet via AOL, a slip account, or a personal commercial program for Netscape or Telnet, even more homeschool information is available.  Taking Netscape as an example, click Net Directory at the top in the control panel.  The list that appears includes art, business, economy, education and science, among many others.  Many interesting educational resources are available in these categories, and might be discussed in future articles, but, for now, assume we are interested in information specifically about homeschooling.   Click on Education.  If you then click on Alternative, you will see a list that includes alternative colleges, distance learning, and homeschooling.  Many of the areas under the homeschooling forum are new and adding new features every time I log on.  You can read about companies that cater to home educators, or read an individual family's homeschool page where they describe what they are studying and how they organize their day.  You can go into the Home Education Resource Center which accesses Web sites of interest to home educators.  You can browze through the Homespun Web of Home Education Resources, which lists upcoming events (so far only in Austin, TX!) , has program offers, offers expert help (from whom??), lists collaborative efforts (like virtual science fairs sponsored by the University of Washington), and lists organizations and homeschool suppliers.  There is a small homeschooling chat forum here, as well.  Jon's Homeschooling Resources lists, among other things, six homeschool mailing lists you can subscribe to,  Finally, there are two chat forums, Usenet-misc.education.home-school.misc and <BR>Usenet-misc.education.home-school.christian.<P>

If you use Netsearch you can scroll down to search engines and click your mouse in the white space, where I typed in "homeschooling, alternative education."  I clicked Run Query after that and got yet another list of home education information.  Another homeschooler's homepage, information about the National Homeschool Association, and Yahoo indexes (which get you back to the Net directory list that we just came from!), head the list.  Someone downloaded the Prodigy Home School Resource Guide from another online service.  Particularly nice is the K-12 and Homeschool Page.  There is an interesting list of Educational Resources and Just for Fun Kids Stuff folders here.<P>

This information does not represent any of the areas where one can go for lesson plans or for homework help.  These are specifically areas where one can find out about home education, what resources are available, and ask questions of fellow home educators..  I'm in danger of having so much help for home education that I don't have time to home educate!<BR>

              <B>  CONTINUUM PARENTING BOARD<BR>
                                 RRnFL (Francine)</B></CENTER><P>

John Holt said it best "If the world could be saved by a book, this just might be the book." The Continuum Concept by Jean Liedloff, published originally in 1975, documents her experience with a Yequanna Indian tribe in a South American jungle. Her prescriptions for humankind focus on trusting our "ancient instincts" that allow us to follow the continuum guiding our species for the past two million years. Our recent cultural departures from that continuum -- mother/baby separation, community disintegration, child neglect as well as child-centeredness -- serve to cut us off from our own well-being and true humanness. <P>

HS'ers may be interested in her view of education.  Believing in the innate sociality of our species, Liedloff writes: "If these educators base their relationship to the children upon being available, the children will be able to utilize their own efficient, natural way of educating themselves, by making use of the people,things, and events of their world, to imitate, observe, and practice upon, motivated by their own social, imitative natures. There can be no more effective way to educate."<P>

The Continuum Parenting Board was set up to explore how parents apply continuum principles in our very non-continuum culture -- after all, the Yequanna Indians didn't have to get their kids into carseats :-) For lots of interesting observations/practical ideas and more, go to Parents Information Network (Keyword: PIN).   Click on Parents Exchange, then Family Life where you'll find the Continuum Parenting Board.  Please come and share your experiences and insights.<BR>
<CENTER> ________________________________________________<BR>
                           <B>PLACES TO GO<BR>
                                   MathTeach</B></CENTER><P>

At the Teacher Information Network (Keyword: TIN), there are several message boards that may be of interest to homeschoolers. There is a folder titled "Idea Exchange."  Within the folder are separate message boards for each academic area. Parents may want to browse these folders for ideas or join in the discussions. Each academic area also has its own file library where people have uploaded some very helpful academic information.<P>

In the same area (TIN) you will find a folder titled, "Lesson Plan Library." People upload their favorite lesson plans on a wide variety of subjects and levels. Most are as appropriate for home schools as they are for public schools.  Those who upload receive free AOL credits depending on the number of people who download their lesson plan.  So, homeschoolers may be as interested in uploading as in downloading!  I personally have earned a lot of free time from that area.<BR><HR><P>

IN ISSUE #3 we hope to present the findings and beliefs of some of our readers about the effects of teaching infants and toddlers to read, pro and con.  If you have opinions on this post them on the boards, and talk to your friends, and send us the best of what comes of it.<P>

Until next time, be happy and healthy, safe and not too warm <g>--

Hello out there in homeschool land!  This newsletter is sent to all known homeschoolers on AOL, those who've posted, those who've asked to be on the list, those whose friends recommended them...if you don't want it, just hit "reply" and ask to be taken off the list.  It will hardly hurt our feelings at all.  If we missed your friend, send us the address!  If you want #1 or #2, just ask.<P>

There are homeschool chats throughout the week you might want to visit.  Chats are live, real-time, discussions with as many people as show up.  Sometimes they're slow and sweet, and sometimes they're fast-paced and confusing, but it's a way to get together with other homeschoolers and get quick ideas and just to socialize with people you don't have to explain so much to.   <P>

All chat times are Eastern time.  Check appropriate bulletin boards for topics.<P>

<B>DO-IT-YOURSELF CHATS</B><BR>
If you would like to have a chat at another time, here's how!    Decide on a time and name a private room (make up a name).  To get to a private room, go to LOBBY (under the "go to" pulldown),  and there will be a "ROOMS" icon.  Click it.  In there os another icon, "PRIVATE ROOMS."  Click it and type in the name you and your friends have decided on.  There you'll be!  These won't be "real" AOL-sponsored chats, so please don't put the name of your private room out in public anywhere.  By e-mail, you might  invite people whose posts you've enjoyed, or you could say on a bulletin board that you'd like to have a private chat about whatever subject,  and that anyone who's interested can e-mail you for the room-name.   It needs to be clearly private, and not given the appearance of sponsorship by AOL, PHS, or HEM.<BR><HR><P> 

<B>THANKS</B><P>

Thanks for your terrific information and for the time you're taking.  We're all in this together and one of the greatest benefits I've discovered from homeschooling (aside from the obvious emotional benefits, etc. to our children), is connecting with other dedicated, sharing parents who are willing to make differences in others' lives.- Spirit2L (Linda Davis)<P>

Thank you, thank you for the newsletter.  Going on AOL is probably the best investment I'll make as a new homeschooler. - KBaker614 (Kathy)<BR><HR><P>

<B>WINNING DINNER PARTY:</B><P>

Oh - to be able to invite four people of my choice to a dinner party....The first person that I would invite would be Chris Davis of the Elijah Company. Chris' tape on how to not teach like the public schools really changed our school - and I would love to have him explain to us (like he tried to tell me on the phone yesterday) - why it's ok to have a hooded snake (ok - so it's non-poisonous) living right near our front door, and how they make such good pets.  What an "education" as he tried to persuade me of this!  I would also invite Gayle Grass, the public school teacher with 20+ years teaching, who convinced us to home-school in the first place.  She's taught me more about natural teaching opportunities than anyone else I can think of.  I would also invite my mother-in-law.  She gave me a picture of what homeschooling could be like, by working with her nephews "after school" when they were growing up - and it appeared to be fun.  Finally, I would invite Bill Butterworth who wrote the book "The Peanut Butter Family Homeschool."  His sense of humor would help him appreciate the members and activities that go on here at our "Flint Funny Farm" - and he has a way of reminding us of just why we do what we do.  Our menu would be simple - make it yourself subs (after all - everyone does have different tastes) - and root beer floats or coffee.  Maybe we'd play volleyball and watch the kids shoot up their model rockets (which Chris' son gave Eric) - and we'd probably talk until 2:00 in the morning - with the kids constantly interrupting with a joke or question because they'd know it would be "safe."<P>

That's my dinner party - wish I could invite y'all to it also!  Oh yes - forgot to tell you - there would be a tornado warning in effect and we'd have to retire to the "scaredy hole/fraidy  hole" (aka storm cellar) and tell our jokes by candlelight w/ the country radio station playing in the background - so we could know when the storm passed over.   We'd watch for snakes as we ran to the shelter - and of course we would have seen the funnel cloud off in the distance.  My MIL would have picked up the kitten 'cause that's the kind of heart she has - and my dh would have been getting the dogs to come with us 'cause that's the kind of heart he has.<P>

Anyone wanna come now?<P>

<B><I>The dinner party is the artistry of HS Flints, who will be able to choose a prize from our growing store of Fine Prizes, as will Malaika1, submittor of:</I><P> 

THE WINNING RECIPE:</B><P>

This is one of my kids' favorites!  Even the 5-yr-old can help with a kitchen knife.<P>
 
<FONT COLOR="6D01A1"><B>OCTOPUS<BR>
Cut a raw hot dog in half, leaving you with two short hot dogs.  Starting 1/2" from end, cut each half in half lengthwise, turning and cutting until you have 8 "legs."  Pop into boiling water.  The legs curl up and it will look just like a little octopus!!! </FONT></B><P>

<B><I>Malaika1 and HS Flints' prize selections will be announced in "Forum Input and Announcements"  in Homeschooling Connection, in Issue #4 as well.</B></I><P><HR><P>

<B>From the SUNSHINE DRAWER</B><P>

I'd like to share an idea with all of you.  In our kitchen, which is more like an open access culinary workshop than anything traditional, I have a built-in oversized file drawer.  It contains many headings like....home finances, medical receipts, homeschool groups, homeschool portfolios, church, vet., etc., etc. My favorite file is my "Sunshine File."   Since the job of full-time homemaker/home-educator has little compensation in any material forms (paychecks, quarterly work evaluations, promotions) collecting little treasures is a way to remind oneself of the richness and value of one's life.  We all need a little pat on the back now and then.  This idea  was originally brought to my attention at a La Leche League workshop many years ago.  Some of my favorite entries are from LLL sources.  My "Sunshine File" consists mostly of personal notes or thank you's for meals brought to new moms,  for volunteering at church, touching or humorous birthday cards, special Bible verses that keep me motivated or phonetically spelled love notes from my offspring found taped to the inside of a kitchen cabinet or next to my toothbrush!   The remainder of the file contains favorite quips and quotes I've collected.  I'd like to share some of my favorites with all of the Homeschool Cybernewsians.The original source  is given credit.  When I was unsure of the source I followed the entry with a (?). <BR> Here goes....<BR>

<B>HIGH SCHOOL INFORMATION ON WWW</B><P>

Many students enter homeschooling for the first time at the high school level. There is quite a bit of information on this subject on Clonlara Schools WWW page at
        http://web.grfn.org/education/clonlara.  <P>
                                                                                         LearnTree<P>

<B>Cyberhigh</B>--it's on the net.  It's exactly what it sounds like -- all of high school over the computer.  The have a wonderful homepage -- access to all kinds of high school/adult instructional and researchy stuff.  I read the novel Flatland right off the screen a couple of days ago from their homepage. The downside is that the organizers want big $$$ for each student enrolled.... the homepage gives better access to great stuff than I've seen on most other homepages.<P>
                                                                                           CafiCohen<BR><HR><P>

<B>**Qulifications?**</B><P>

I just received a form from my local school district inquiring about my "qulifications" to homeschool. Well for one thing, we can spell!<BR>

<B>PUBLIC DOMAIN BOOKS ON LINE</B><P>

There are old books which are no longer copyrighted that can be downloaded. 
Go to the Mac Education Forum (Keyword MED),  and then look in the scrolling window for "Electronic Books."  If you are on Windows,  look for those that say "Any Text Reader."  Most are OK for any platform.   Open the files with a wordprocessor capable of handling large documents -- Word or WordPerfect or a page layout program.<P>
 
The nice thing I find is that you can make the type large enough for a young but very good reader.  My son cringes at the small type offered in some classical books.  You can get creative and leave room for illustrations, or bind them up prettily.<BR>

<B>I TAUGHT MY FOUR-YEAR-OLD TO DO ADDITION</B><P>

Honestly, this is not a clipping from a tabloid magazine!  I came up with a method to teach my daughter addition and I'd like to share it with you.  I have explained it to several friends who have tried it on their children with exciting success.<P>
 
To begin with, your child needs to be able to count and recognize numbers (at least up to 10).  To start with, write the numbers 0 through 10 in a row on a piece of paper.  Be sure to leave enough space between the numbers so that they are distinct and that you write them as "standard" as possible (mine looked like the numbers on my keyboard).<P>
 
On another piece of paper, write the addition problem.  For example,  2 + 4 .  Read the problem to the child to make sure he or she is focused on what is going on.<P>

Now tell your child to put a finger on the 2.  Tell your child that "plus four" means that your finger hops four numbers to the right.  Make sure your child is counting the hops and only hopping one number at a time.  After four hops, ask your child what number his or her finger is on.  Yes!  2 + 4 = 6!<P>

With practice your child can solve any simple addition problem you can write down.  Once your child can recognize and count to higher numbers, you can write down a bigger number line for "hopping."   When my daughter got past 20, I pulled out the soft cloth measuring tape from my sewing kit.  The inches side goes past 50 and the centimeter side goes past 150.  That should keep her busy for a while!<P>

Once your child is fully familiar with addition, you can teach subtraction:  6 - 4, for example.  Start on 6 and explain that "minus four" means hopping to the left.  Yes!  The answer is 2.<P>

I'd love any feedback, negative or positive.  Does this work for your kids?<P>
                                                                                Tracky<BR><HR><P>

<B>ABOUT THE FORUM IN GENERAL</B><P>

Hi,  Thanks for making me feel welcome!  I have been lurking for awhile now and come to the homeschooling forums when I need a dose of homeschool/mothering support.  You have a very valuable forum, which, together with PHS, has been "worth the price of admission", and the thing which, aside from the email feature of AOL, keeps me subscribing.<BR>

<B>LEARNING BY DOING</B><P>

I have read several of the Moore's books and just requested information on The Moore Formula.  They are the ones that convinced me that formal education and strict curricula could actually be deterimental to my children.   So we put away the workbooks and I am now teaching my almost-6 year old how to do her own laundry.  She loves it!  She has her own laundry soap, her own box of dryer sheets and her own Shout It Out!<BR>

Sarah (19 mo.) has been saying a word I couldn't figure out for a couple of days and today I finally "got it."   She was asking for a "stabbie" and wanted desperately to try out a fork instead of a spoon!<BR><HR><P>

Subj:  Re:<B>Deschooling ourselves</B>             From:  MsTerrE<P>

Ian and little Caleb were watching "The Magic Schoolbus" today.   Caleb asked why Ms. Frizzle didn't just tell the kids what they needed to know.  Ian said, "Ms. Frizzle is like a homeschool teacher--she wants the kids to find out for themselves."<BR><HR><P>

<B>MAKING CHORES A GAME</B><P>

We've continually tried to reinforce the thinking of all of us, as a family, working together as a team to get everything done that needs to get done in a day.  Some days, I'll fill out a paper -- similar to the "hangman" game -- with blanks.  Also on the paper are a list of "chores" that need to be completed that day.  As the "chores" are done, a letter is filled in the blanks.  This usually is a special treat/event(such a minature golfing, dairy queen, movie, etc.) that we have all worked together -- as a team -- to "earn".   I am still amazed at how well this motivates my girls -- and I never have to remind them of anything!!!<G><P>

While I realize that some days will be easier than others between hs and work, I'm really looking forward to all of it.  I mean, after all, isn't life in general the same?<BR>
                                                                  Sha8ee (Marcia)<BR><HR><P>

<B>READING LATER</B><P>     
      
I have friends who began h/s-ing a year or two before we did. Their oldest child, a boy, did not read until he was almost 11. They were patient and just kept letting him do the kinds of projects he wanted, and helped him by reading to him when necessary.  Today, he is successfully tackling chemistry and physics books on his own, as well as very advanced English literature. I know it's hard to wait when the entire Western world seems to think that all children should read at 6 or 7, but those who wait often become the *best* readers.<BR> 
                                                                    BRGFB (Barbara)<BR><HR><P>

<B>INDIAN IN THE CUPBOARD</B><P>

You've read all the books.  You may even have seen the movie.  Now, you can experience the "Indian in the Cupboard" online!  At keyword: INDIAN, you can find the magical world of Omri and his Indian.  There are adventure beginnings to spark your imagination, movie previews and pictures to download, and even a list of "neat stuff" you can get that's connected to the movie (books, etc.).   You can learn all about the actors in the movie, and find out about the making of a movie, by clicking on Movie Beat.  You can read great information about Indians from the Onondaga clans, and even read an Indian legend or two.  The area promises upcoming online events with the actors and filmakers.  Check it out....hmmm, you might even use this area, in conjunction with some other great books, to create a unit study. :-)<BR>

<B>LEARNING WITHOUT BEING TAUGHT</B><P>

In an interview in Dirty Linen (Folk and World music magazine), the Irish folk singer Maura O'Connell talks about her decision to leave an amiable relationship with Warner records to start her own record company.  She says:<BR>
     "I found out something in myself that I think is very pertinent to me and my music.  I'm a really good learner, but I'm not very good at being taught.  I have to go at my own pace to learn things.  And I think that's the way for someone like me.  It's to do it yourself and make your mistakes and learn things slowly but surely."<BR>
     Sounded familiar.<BR>
     BTW - she's got a new album called Stories coming out sometime soon with songs by people like John Gorka, Shawn Colvin, and Mary Chapin-Carpenter. <BR>

<B>HOMESCHOOLING IN AUSTRALIA</B>  (passed to us from an e-mail list)<P>

Today our city's major daily broadsheet newspaper (The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia) had a front page item about a home schooled 18-year-old boy from mid-western New South Wales being accepted for enrollment at Princeton University, USA, to undertake a dual degree in aerospace engineering and physics, plus being awarded a scholarship for four years tuition and accommodation. This story continued onto page 6 then there were another couple of articles on home schooling taking most of page 18. <P>

I've never seen such coverage given to home schooling in our mainstream press. Also stated was that for the state of New South Wales the number of registered home schoolers was up from 250 in 1991 to 1195 at present, with more families awaiting registration.  Appears the move to home schooling is not just happening in the USA.<BR>

<B>WHAT IS A LOG?</B><P>

A "log" lets you save all the text that appears on your screen while you are using AOL. You can log a chat session, instant messages (IM's) and posts from any of the folders. Logging can be a HUGE time and money saver, because it allows you to speed through screens, then read and respond to them off-line, at your leisure.  (You should see how much people's AOL bills drop once they figure out how to log!!)  Logging is also useful from a security standpoint.  If you encounter a person in a chat room who is violating the AOL Terms of Service (TOS) by using profanity, harassing members, etc., it's extremely useful to AOL staff to have a record of what was done -- and who did it!   For parents, logging your kid's sessions gives you an opportunity to observe what they're talking about and who they're spending their online time with, especially when you're not sitting there beside them.<P>

<B>HOW TO LOG</B><P>

The method used to create a log is largely the same for Windows (W) or Macintosh (M) computer users.  Where they differ, I'll indicate with (W) or (M).  Logs can be turned on at any time from within the AOL application.<P>

1.  From the FILE Menu, choose the Logs (M) or Logging (W) menu option.  An option window appears on your screen.  You can choose either System (M) or Session (W) logging (which will record most text you see on screen in AOL:  file lists and descriptions, the contents of folders -- basically anything you see on screen, except graphics) or Chat logging (which will log any conversation you have in public or private chat rooms).<P>

2.  Click on the Open button.  (Windows users can also choose to record IMs by selecting that option now; Mac users have a separate IM log option.)  The default log filename will appear on your screen.  It's a good idea (especially if you log frequently) to choose a filename other than the default to make it easier for you to locate the log later.  For chats, I like to use MMDDchat.log as a file name, where MMDD = the month and day of the chat.  For logging posts, I use a name that relates to the stuff I'm logging.<P>

3.  If necessary, change the folder (M) or directory (W) where you want to save the log file (if you don't want it saved to the default one).  Once you've done this, you can close up the Logging option window and go on your merry way to the chat and/or folders.  (BTW, you can log chats and folders at the same time by selecting both options.)  <BR>
REMINDER:  If you're logging posts in folders, DON'T sit there and read them online!!!  (I know it's SO tempting, but it kinda defeats the whole purpose of logging!!!)  Just keep clicking the mouse button on Next, and avert your eyes... :-)<P>

4.  When you're finished, go back to the File menu, select the Logs/Logging option and CLOSE the log(s) you have open.  If you don't, the AOL application will close it for you when you exit the program; but it's cleaner if you do it yourself.  (On several occasions I've left my log on only to find all sorts of junky stuff at the end that I didn't really want to log -- no big deal, just took a little time to straighten up the file.)<P>

<B>READING THE LOG OFF-LINE</B><P>

Now that you've created this wonderful log, how do you use it, you ask?  Well, you can use the Open option from the File menu in AOL (you can do this without connecting to the network), but if the log is large, it won't be able to display the whole thing.  In that case, use a word processor (WP) program (such as MS Word, WordPerfect, etc.) to open and read the file. <P>

One last bit of advice -- from time to time, clean up (delete) the log files you no longer need or use.  They can pile up quickly and eat up a lot of disk space!<P>

Well, that's the basics of logging.  If you have any questions, or if you have any suggestions for improving these directions for others to use in the future, please let the forum hosts know, and we'll do what we can to help you out.<BR>

                                                                          Anaise<P>

<B>DO YOU LET YOUR KIDS TOUCH THE COMPUTER!?</B><P>

How do you help your child (and even yourself - since many of us often know less than the kids!) learn about computers?

<B>"IT'S A BLAST!" <BR>                  LISAWOOD</B><P>

I can't believe how much the quality of  my own life has changed since learning has become a centerpiece. So many subjects that truly bored me in school (science) have become fascinating. I find it funny when people pat me on the shoulder and say "You're making a big sacrifice by keeping your daughter home." They've got to be kidding. It's a blast!<BR><HR><P>

<B>KID-WORDS  <BR>      Penny (PMcconn369)</B><P>

The other day while just finishing working in the garden our youngest, Elaine, who has just turned 4 asked us for the strangest thing...A pencil stick.  Mom and Dad assuming she wanted a "pencil" ran to the house to get her one.  When returning outside with cold drinks and a "pencil"...She proceeded to let us know that this was not what she wanted.  Completely baffled and trying everything we could think of that resembled a pencil we could not find out what she was asking for.  Disappointed in her parents, she took off up through the yard, we of course followed, when she turns around and says  "Dad...A Pencil Stick."   ...Out of the shed she pulls a tomato stake...This was the Pencil Stick.      I thought that was really interesting...she had determined that since this stake had a point it was a Pencil Stick. <P>

        from Deb (Onebzymom2):<BR>
My son told my sister, as he was tickling her behind her knees, "These are your leg-pits."<P>

        from Sandra (SandraDodd):<BR>
Holly (3) used the term "pinky-foot" for "little toe."<P>

       from TinaHart:<BR>
Just the other day my 3 yr old daughter asked me if the car was "breakily." After discussing it for awhile (assuring her that my van would not break down anytime soon), my 7-yr-old son corrected her, saying, "Lindsey, next time the correct word is "fragicle." <P> 

        from Meli:<BR>
Dan (who will be four in October): What's this called?<BR>
Mom: A Collander<BR>
Dan: How do you "colland" something?<P>

<B>IS IT ALIVE?</B><BR>                            LisaViolin<P>

My son Vince (5.5), my daughter Jocelyn (3) and myself were seated on the front steps yesterday morning discussing whether various things were plant, animal or mineral.  I would name somthing and we discussed it.  We decided that to be a plant or an animal the thing must be alive.  Being a musician I asked if my violin was alive.  Vince said he didn't know because the violin was made of wood and it came from trees, and trees were alive.  Then he decided that it wasn't alive because they had to kill the tree to make the violin.  Then he asked the question that brought tears to my eyes.  He asked me if music was alive.  I asked him what he thought.  He pondered this for a moment and then said yes it was, because music come from the inside of people and people were alive.   That is the essence of what I try to bring to all my string students--that gee it's nice to be a gymnast of the fingerboard--but it is all for nothing if the music doesn't really come from inside you.   It would seem that he has been absorbing somthing from listening to me teach my students for the last five years!   I was so pleased.  This is why I homeschool.  I would be so jealous if someone else had the pleasure of hearing that comment.<P>

One morning over breakfast, we were discussing with our two daughters, 6 and 4, the process of electing a President.  We discussed what a campaign was, why it was so important that we vote, and how the entire voting process works.  My 4-year-old thought about it a while and said, "But why don't they just do eenie-meenie-minie-moe?"   I think she has something here........   :)<P>

<B>WORD JAIL</B><BR>                         Nancy (MsTerrE)<P>

I mentioned this idea in a chat, and there was a lot of interest.  It is not original to me--I read it at about age 11 or 12 in a teacher's journal my mother, a public school  teacher, subscribed to at the time.<BR>
         Word Jail---a place for words that don't follow the phonics rules.
Love goes to jail; hate goes free.<BR>
You can have as many pals and chums as you like, but friends go to jail.
You can have fun with a clown, but no laughing--laugh goes to jail.<BR>
            What we did:  we made a word jail out of a little shoebox by cutting bars into the side.  We had words on flashcards already.  We went through our list, deciding if the word followed the rules or not.  If not, it went to jail through a slot in the top of the box.  We really hammed it up, "crying" when some word we really liked went to jail, or if a "bad" word could go free.  Words that went free went to "animal land," a part of the dining room table with stuffed toys "living" there.  It was great fun, and it let Ian (who is having trouble with reading) blow off some steam regarding "stupid" words that don't "make sense." <BR> 
             By the way, you can be "stupid" or "smart" (they follow the rules), but you can't "know" anything, because "know" goes to jail.<P>

<B>MORE MATH IDEAS </B><BR>                               QueenB95<P>

Using a cloth measuring tape, the metric side, use cuisenaire rods to do addition problems.  The blocks fit  on the cm side.  For example, if the problem is 2 + 4,  have your child figure out which blocks would end up at the six (answer, a light green and a red).  She could also see how many other ways there are to get to six using the rods.   Then she could write her own number sentences to match the problems.  For example, if she used a light green,  a light green, and a light green rod, the problem would be 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.  Or a yellow and a tan, 5 + 1 = 6.<BR> 
      If she writes the sentence that goes with the problem, then she is taking more command of her own learning.  She also is showing she truly understands what the number sentences mean.<BR>
        Another way I like to teach my kids addition and subtraction is to make up stories with those little fish crackers.  Make up a story like  "One day there were two fishies swimming in the ocean." (The ocean can be a hand or a napkin).  Have each person put two fish in their hand.  "Three more fish wanted to play."  Add three fish. "Along came a big shark and ate one of the fish."  Everyone eats one fish.   Keep going with more stories.  Kids love to make up their own stories.  After playing this game a lot of times, start writing down the number sentences as they come up.  This is a great way to introduce story problems when your child is old enough to write sentences.  Just have her write down the stories as they are made up.  Or write them down for her and she can read the stories back to you.<P>

<B>...AND FOR SLIGHTLY OLDER KIDS...</B><BR>             BrigitteE<P>

   <OL><LI>Use as many different materials to teach counting and arithmetic; it's even better if they make sense.</LI>
   <LI>Let the kids figure out problems on their own, don't do all the teaching. For instance, when your kid has two friends over, give them six pieces of candy and see how they solve the division problem themselves. Let them talk about it. They learn more that way.</LI>
   <LI>Be sure they understand the importance of the number ten. Do this by having them group objects after they get ten (e.g. put them in a cup), or bundle sticks or straws. This helps them understand our decimal system later.</LI> 
   <LI>When adding, have your child add to ten first, then add the rest. For instance in 7 + 5: 7+3 = 10, then two more make 12. This helps them understand 12 as ten plus two. It also makes learning addition facts easier, they don't have to be memorized that way.</LI>
   <LI>When your child is old enough to understand larger numbers, show that you can count tens (getting ten, twenty etc.). Use things that are organized in tens to do this -- kids' fingers and toes come in handy. Or bundle sticks, packages of gum, etc. I make bean sticks by pasting ten beans on lollypop sticks (craft stores). Again, this helps with understanding our declimal system.</LI>
   <LI>The learning of formal math -- writing number sentences like 7+5, memorizing number facts, rote counting etc. are not nearly as important as many experiences with things that make sense and involve numbers at the same time. Children who memorize too many rules first never learn to make sense out of math. You'll be amazed what kids can figure out for themselves -- and how much better they learn what they've been allowed to discover.</LI></UL><BR><HR><P>

<B>DO UNIT STUDIES EXIST IN NATURE? </B><BR> 
 (I found this in a year old file, so it's no longer "recent," but still great!)<P>

<B><I>Serendipitous Unitology...</B></I><BR>           GrDane1<BR>
        I recently invented this term, with a little help from my friends, to describe what happens when you do a THING, either reading a book or watching a movie or going somewhere, and it sparks a little interest, and then all of a sudden something ELSE Happens, as if by magic, that relates to it, and on and on.<BR>
      It's not a UNIT STUDY per se, because not much research has to get done, although it can help to get a certain book from the library or go someplace not too far away.<BR>
      Someone on the Internet suggested the "Unschool of Serendipitous Unitology"<BR><HR><P>

<B>AN INTERESTING FAMILY STORY</B><BR>                      Sherri (Sam G Hads)<P>

     My name is Sherri Best and I have homeschooled our children for 7 years.  Our oldest daughter has just completed her first year at college, with a $10,000 violin scholarship.  She maintained a high grade point average and was on the dean's list.  She earned an extra $1000 in scholarship money as a result.  She was homeschooled from 6th grade through high school. Today she is touring with Impact Productions, "The Masterpiece. A Toymaker's Dream" She will be touring for a year all over the United States and possibly South America.  She studied classical ballet for 16 years and so her part in the production is primarily dancing.  The college agreed to hold her scholarship for one year while she tours.  Homeschooling can and does work!!<BR>
     We have five other children.  Another one will be in college in just a couple weeks.  She received a $6000 scholarship in piano.  She has been apprenticing with her piano teacher for the past year.  She has won various piano competitions, top 10 in the state of Texas, and 3rd place in a composition contest for an original piece of music.<BR>
     Three of our children have had learning disabilities to overcome.  Some more severe than others.  We have used a private school here in Abilene to assist us in their education.<BR>
   Two are currently enrolled for this year but next school year I will be homeschooling a ninth grader.  We will probably continue at home through high school.  <BR>
     Our son is  a junior this year.  He attends a private Christian High School.  Homeschooling did not serve him well.  He, being the only boy in the family tends to withdraw and stay at home  avoiding social interaction outside of family.  We did homeschool him  for 5 years.  The education he is receiving there is not the best and I am disappointed with it.  It is affiliated with Abilene Christian University so I did expect more when he started.  He also plays the piano, quite well and has studied at a local University for 3 years. He has also won various competitions.<BR>
     Then there is the little one, 2 and a half years old.  She is learning a great deal from her sisters and brother.  <BR>
      I also enrolled in college again after 20 years.  I took one class last fall.  It was great!  <BR>
      Taking off from homeschooling seemed to be the right thing to do because my sister was diagnosed with cancer and she died in March.  Her last of 3 children died in December, all having birth defects, and my mother being widowed has needed more help that ever.  Juggling home, family and school has indeed been challenging but worth every bit of the struggle and sacrifice.  Our children have adjusted well to school away from home largely because of the high level of self discipline.
This is truly the key to success in all things. <BR>

<B>QUESTION AND ANSWER--WHERE IS THE HOMESCHOOL BOARD REALLY?</B><P>

"I just went into Electronic Schoolhouse, and there's our board in there too.  I didn't know this.  People who only read our board there don't have direct access to HEM or PHS.  Do we pop up anywhere else too?"<P>

Yes... it pops up through TIN (Teacher Information Network), too, and through PIN (Parent Information Network), and through others, I believe.<P>    

Dear readers:  If you're accessing the homeschool forum through ESH, TIN, or PIN, the easiest way to reach us is through keyword: HOMESCHOOL.  With that you get icons for Practical Homeschooling and Home Education Magazine.<BR><HR><P>

<B>PRIZES, WONDERFUL PRIZES</B><P>

For her prize-winning fantasy dinner party (Cyber-News #3), Peggy (HS Flints) chose "Spelling Jungle," a video game provided by  Molli ( MMOLLI227), an educational consultant with Discovery Toys.  Thank you, Molli!  Congratulations, Peggy.<P>

For her octopus recipe (well okay, it was a hotdog recipe) Malaika1 chose "Patterns in Arithmetic:  Activities to Develop Mathematical Thinking," donated by the author, Suki Glenn (AKA QueenB95@aol.com).<P>

Other prizes still in our treasury (from which the winner of the best advice for combining kids and computers may choose) are listed below.  We'd like to thank the donors for their generosity.   $15 worth of Usborne books from Susan Milden (usbornesuz), a free subscription to Home Education Magazine from Mark and Helen Hegener (Hegener) [or a book if the winner subscribes already],  and a 12-issue subscription to Bright Spark Super Learning Tools from Alison Moore Smith (GingerHead) or a book from Book'lore Club, from Shalina (KANNADA).<BR><HR><P>

<B><I>MINERAL COLLECTORS</B></I><BR>                             JanF<P>

We are getting ready to do a unit on rocks and minerals. Here in Colorado, certain types of rocks and minerals are abundant; others aren't.  I would like to propose a trade with people in various areas.  We would send you several types of rocks and/or minerals typical of Colorado; you could send us several types of rocks and/or minerals from your locale. I think a good way to do this would be to keep the weight of the rocks under two pounds.  That way they could be sent by 2-day Priority Mail for only $3 in the U.S.  (However, I would really like to participate with people in other countries, also.)<BR>
If you're interested in a rock and mineral exchange, please e-mail me (JanF).<P>

      None of us has a particularly strong background in Spanish (a year or so in high school, each, for my husband and myself) and no background at all in ASL -- so it's a real adventure for the whole family.<BR>
      Our six year old has really taken to this approach, however!  When I quiz him on signs, he answers me in Spanish!  He thus reinforces both new languages at once.  We're slightly more than halfway finished with Book 1 of the Learnables, and his ASL vocabulary is a little better than 115 words.  <BR>
      BTW, he doesn't always come joyfully to the task of learning Spanish, but he BEGS to drill ASL and completes his Spanish much more readily with the "carrot" of new signs in front of him.    <BR>                       --WheatieMom<P>

My weak point in school was alway History and Science.  Since I have been homeschooling three children (ages 8, 11, and 16) for 4 years already, I have discovered that I am learning as much as the children are, and I love it!!  I thank God that we have this option, and I thank my dear, loving husband for all of his support!    <BR>

He is spoiling it for the rest of the class.  It would be in the best interest of all if he were removed from school immediately."  <BR>

 Great newsletter!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I like the combination of practical hints, human interest stories, suggestions, etc. Now all I have to do is find time to follow up on all the good ideas!  :) ***  <BR> Thanks for another great issue of your news!!  I am thrilled to be included in this great project.  I enjoyed all the great KIDisms and was encouraged by the story from Sherri.  <P>

<FONT COLOR="513EC3"><B>LETTING INTERESTS CRYSTALLIZE</B></FONT><P>

You know, I've noticed that some of my friends who are very involved in a particular career or pursuit seem to be the first to say "Don't rush your children into this. Let them play. That's the best preparation."  I'm referring in particular to a friend of mine who is a dancer and another who is a biologist.  The dancer is really against kids taking dance lessons at an early age and the biologist says it's better for kids to muck around at the beach or woods than to hook up with some sort of class.  I suspect what they're saying is give them that opportunity for their heart to open to the thing (if it is their thing) and then the rest is easy.  It's really sad how many adults have all the technique mastered, but are struggling to get back to that source of creativity that they once had as children.  It has surprised me that my daughter didn't begin reading young  because she is so in love with books.  Instead of reading she looks at the pictures and makes up elaborate and rich stories based on them.  My husband pointed out that everyone learns to read, but how many people have that kind of imagination?  She knows what needs to be done first. <BR>                              -- LISAWOOD<P>

The source of much wisdom in my family (my 5 year old) said the other day, in the car, as we drove past a school: "Do you know what a schooler is?  That's someone who doesn't homeschool."  Don't you just love his attitude???  <BR>    --LindaWyatt (Linda)<P>

A few KIDisms from my now-7-year-old.  When she was about 5, my favorite words of hers were "stepalator" for escalator and "jumpoline" for trampoline.   But just this week we were driving across Nebraska in a rain storm and she was sitting in the front seat with us and really liked all the little trails in the rain that the "Air Force" was making from driving in the rain!      <BR>                   --CRE8IVMOM<P>

We are in the process of studying a unit on Electricity.  The other day my daughter, who is four, comes over to me and requests a tricks ta dee.   Not knowing what she wanted I asked again, a what?   She repeated a tricks ta dee, while pointing at the library books.   Still not understanding what she wanted and to avoid frustration on both parties I gave her a book about a little dinosaur.  This of course satisfied her for the rest of the day, but the next morning she started all over again.  "MOM, I WANT A Tricks-ta-dee," while gazing at the pile of books I saw it.   ELECTRICITY!!!  Gave her the book and she says "Yea! A Tricks-ta-dee."<BR>                     -- PMcconn369<P>

I so enjoyed reading Kid Words!  It reminded me of a couple of words my son coined at three years old.  We were walking through a big meadow when he pointed to a patch of small yellow and white flowers and said, "Look, mommy, daisy-lions!"  We've called dandelions "daisy-lions" ever since.   On another occasion I had turned on the shower over the bathtub to rinse it out.  He walked into the bathroom, looked up at the nozzle and said, "Mommy!  It's a shower-fall!"   I treasured these moments and am grateful to Kid Words for triggering my memory of them.   Thanks.   -- <BR>Homfires (Diane Keith)<P>

<FONT COLOR="513EC3"><B>SNACKS</B></FONT><P>

I have a great idea for keeping children entertained at lunchtime; make them peanut butter and jelly hors d'oeurves on whole wheat crackers.  And they can help too and they enjoy making a mess and having fun while doing it and at the same time enjoying a nutritutious lunch.  First you put the peanut butter on the bottom then a little dab of jelly on top and voila!  you have your snack!  Top it off with some fruit juice and an apple or some cheese and the kids will love it!    <BR>                                -- Ldw 72<P>

<FONT COLOR="513EC3"><B>WHAT EINSTEIN SAID LESS SIMPLY...</B></FONT><P>

In reference to the quotations earlier I received this from DACunefare of our staff:
The quote from Albert Einstein is a paraphrase - you probably don't have room for the original, but it is eloquent (as might be expected from someone whose education nearly ruined him.) <BR>     
"It is, in fact, nothing short of a miracle that the modern methods of instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiosity of inquiry; for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mostly in need of freedom; without this it goes to wrack and ruin without fail.  It is a very grave mistake to think that the enjoyment of seeing and searching can be promoted by means of coercion and a sense of duty.  To the contrary, I believe that it would be possible to rob even a healthy beast of prey of its voraciousness, if it were possible, with the aid of a whip, to force the beast to devour continuously, even when not hungry, especially if the food, handed out under such coercion, were to be selected accordingly." <P>

<FONT COLOR="513EC3"><B>CLOSING WORDS FROM THE EDITOR</B></FONT><P>

This is the fifth issue of Homeschool Cyber-News, and I'm enjoying its production.  Last issue was cut short in some batches because of experiments with mailing to more (i.e. TOO MANY) addresses at a time, combined with the length of that issue.  I'm sorry if yours was short.<P>

The great majority of the comments and review have been favorable, mushy, warm and sweet.  I've had a few complaints, and a few people have commented on problems they perceive on the boards.   I want to address a few of these points, and suggest some different ways of looking at the homeschooling world.  (I'll keep it brief <g>.)<P>

When a child is young, curious, not yet self-conscious and just learning a language, the odd connections they make and their interpretations are a window into their minds and souls--how they think, what they believe, what small element in a large scenario might draw their attention.  Piaget, who studied intellectual development in children, dealt with children's early questions such as:  What is thinking?  What is the relationship between a word and its meaning?  What things are alive / conscious?  What and WHERE are dreams?   By the inclusion in Cyber-News of the "kid-words" and early "cute kid phrases" I never intended merely to amuse the readers, but to give them more experience with considering how human beings take in, process, and refine their knowledge of language and the world.  I could cite long passages of hoity-toity psychologists' theories but that would be no fun, and you might learn just as much by thinking on your own.  When someone complains of space wasted when I'm trying to present something glorious for parents to think about, it makes me a little defensive, and when I get defensive I get wordy!!!  Our families are very small, as scientific samples go, but by reading of other childrens' experiences our knowledge as parents is increased.<P>

Speaking of homeschoolers learning about education, another point pops up.  If we expect our children to read, WE must read.  If we expect them to use references, they need to see US use them, in our own lives, not just to look things up for the kids.  If we expect them to love learning and learn on their own, we need to model that behavior for them.  There are, upon occasion, people who post in the forum that they want all the information it will take for them to homeschool in such-and-such a place, and people should e-mail it to them.  This is equivalent to a child sitting at a table, never getting up, and wanting the entire 6th grade spoonfed to him.  It's the equivalent, in my opinion, of my calling the library and asking them to gather up and send over to my house (for free) everything they have on George Washington (and make it snappy).<P>

Homeschool Forum and the message boards in Home Education Magazine's forum and in Practical Homeschooling's forum are FULL of the experiences, advice, and wisdom of hundreds of homeschooling families.  For the price of one tank of gasoline anyone on AOL can sit online and read for a whole afternoon!  I know of no other place where such a quantity of varied information on homeschooling can be obtained so easily.<P>

Many who are just starting to research homeschooling have family stresses, fears for their children, arguments with their spouses, and general panic about stepping off the path of least resistance.  This is understandable, but remember that the people posting on the boards are volunteers; in fact most are PAYING for the privilege of sharing with you their hard-won experience and knowledge.    All you have to do is log on and read what they've written, you don't even have to say "thank you."  Just please don't complain if they don't want to come to your house via e-mail to give you private lessons.<P>

Here's the Scoop :)<BR>
     We've been told that they're working on the message boards all over AOL to correct the problems we've been having.  The Educational Software, Unschooling, and Considering/New Homeschoolers folders are full.  We've tried deleting older posts to make room for new posts and that hasn't worked either. So... we're still waiting. Other folders are close to filling up, so don't be surprised if you try to post in a folder over the next little while and it says it's full.   We apologize for the inconvenience this has caused and just wanted you to know that we're working to get it fixed as soon as possible.<BR>

I just wanted to comment on the importance of children seeing adults read and write in daily life.  Children should see adults read for fun, read the newspaper, write letters, thank-you notes, invitations, as well as look up words in the dictionary, and use an encyclopedia for a reference.  I am not a homeschooler, I am an elementary school teacher.  As part of our curriculum, we read and write for a variety of purposes every day!  When I said" we"...that's what I meant!!  Children must see that there is a real purpose for reading and writing. Learning is an adventure, and there isn't a day that goes by that I don't learn something new from the children in my class!  I truly believe that children must see that it doesn't matter how old you are, you are NEVER too old to learn! I also wanted to let you know that I love reading the newsletter and have gotten many great ideas from it. :-) <BR>

Just when I thought we had wasted a day today, I found out differently.  I
entered my girl's room tonight, and all four kids and the cats were doing a
production of The Merchant of Venice.   It was hysterical!  Each cat had a
speaking part.  Most of them were pretty cooperative.  Each cat was being
held by a child (the child was actually doing the speaking), but the cats
were being helped to make gestures.  They hadn't gotten very far in the book,
but they were having fun (at least the kids were).  I don't think I've ever
read the Merchant of Venice (I hope it is appropriate).  I picked up a bunch
of Shakespeare books today at a used book store.  My daughter said it was boring.
That's why they decided to get the cats to help. <g>  At least they didn't
bring the dogs in to help too.<BR>
      Oh well...this is what it's all about anyway!  We can teach, teach, teach,
but they learn best by doing and experiencing.   Now if I had told them they
had to act out a Shakespeare play, they would have wanted to play instead!<BR>

My 15-month-old girl announces the "walkin' munkee," and proceeds to bob up and down the sidewalk with her hands in her armpits, chanting "ooo-ooo-ooo."  Talk about a sponge--I can't even carry on a conversation without her repeating every other word!  I was showing a friend some construction work going on in our house.  The friend saw the ripped up ceiling and exclaimed "oh god!"    Needless to say, baby now calls the ceiling..."oh god" as she points up to it!<BR>
                                                                             Willawork<P>

<B>Shobie-Stories:</B><P>

1)  My son, Shobie, got a library book about shapes and it had a page about right angles.  He looked at it for a while and said, "So to make a square, you would need two right angles and two left angles."   My husband and I giggled about it that evening... not at the time, though; Shobie was very serious.<P>

 2)  I thought you might like something my son, Shobie, said this evening.  While eating Halloween candy he asked me where the word lollipop came from.  Before I could try to answer, he said, "Oh, I think I know.  Pop is 'cause it's round like a balloon and balloons pop.  And lolly is 'cause they taste so jolly."  It sounded good to me.<BR>
                                                                  Margmom (Margaret)<P>

On the way home from church my 4 yr old nephew reciting  the Pledge to the flag that he just learning in pre-shool.  "And to the republic for which it stands, in the middle, with liberty and justice for all!"  I loved it.  It sounded familiar somehow!<BR>
                                                                   TerrO10<P>

I was doing words that begin with "e" with my children.  The three year old spotted a picture of an envelope.  Without hesitating she pointed to it and said "e-mail".<BR>
                                                                     Lesley:)<P>

Yesterday Ben was eating lunch out on the back steps and he spilled his rootbeer.  I started to get really annoyed as I was figuring out the best way to clean it up, when he said, "Look!  A sodafall!"  So we both sat watching the soda cascade down one step, then another...<BR>
                                                                      Mettaphor (Thea)<P>

Just a note to tell you how much I enjoy your newsletter.  I am preparing to homeschool my eight-year-old son who has several special needs.  I am encouraged and informed!    He has some language problems, but they can be funny at times.  My husband has had his own consulting firm for ten years.  When people ask Alex about his Dad's job he always says, "He's a computer insultant."<BR>
                                                                 Soosn1 (Susan)<P>

My eight-year-old daughter Jayme and I were going over some vocabulary words.  I asked her what "loafer" meant.  She quickly answered (without thinking), "That's easy, it is someone who makes bread."  We got a good laugh out of that one.<BR>  
                                                                   LARaab<P>

My seven-year-old asked me if every woman has subtractions. She had to elaborate. She then asked if every mommy had to hurt like that.  (Contractions!) This came on the heels of our home birth.<BR>
                                                                  JSevin<P>

One night we were all excitedly talking about going outside to view the meteor shower we had heard about on the news.  We were getting coats and chairs to go sit in the yard, and I was encouraging my then-five-year-old John to get his jacket and come out with us.<BR>
     He refused in no uncertain terms, and showed great concern that I was planning to go outside.  I tried to explain that it would be fun, that we wouldn't be out long, etc.  Still, he refused, and only grew more upset.  I was gathering that he felt it would be dangerous, and assured him that the meteors never fell all the way to the ground, etc.  Finally he said, "But mommy, I thought all the dinosaurs were extinct!"  <BR>
     Of course I said, "What? Dinosaurs?"  <BR>
     And he clued me in to his entire concern:  "Well, you said Meat-eaters would be falling..."  <BR>  
      It was cute and poignant at the same time, to glimpse the world through his eyes--strange and scary it surely must seem at times.<BR>
                                                                                           KathyThile (Kathy)<P>

I am a volunteer in ESH (manage some of the libraries) and have been downloading your newsletters, checking them out and  releasing them.  I just thought I'd drop you a note to let you know that I have really enjoyed reading them.  I'm a public school teacher who believes, as you do, that children should be encouraged to be creative.<BR>
      Here's another KIDism (from years back when I taught kindergarten):   We were having sharing time and a little boy said that he had seen on the news where a man had touched a power line that had broken in a storm and had been electrakilled.  Makes sense, huh?  I think the other children got the message.<BR>

We are having a wonderful experience working with the German American National Congress and their language school.  My son Vince is almost six and this year I decided that he study a foreign language.  I found this organization by accident.  They operate a language school for all ages on Saturday mornings.  The cost is miminal--it comes to about $5.00 per Saturday--for three hours of instruction.  He absolutely loves it!   From what I understand this organization has language schools (SprachSchulen) all over the US.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="24822B"><B>CIVIL WAR EXPERIENCE</B></FONT><P>

My family recently took a "field trip" to Gettysburgh, Pennsylvania in conclusion to our study of the Civil War.  We spent three nights at a wonderful bed and breakfast.  Part of the bed and breakfast was present during the battle of Gettysburg.  There have been additions.  The whole place was just beautiful!  Our hosts are very interested in the idea of having more home-schooled families come visit them.  I must say, they did a remarkable job of teaching us (as well as the other guests) about many facets of the Civil War.  They are Civil War re-enactors, and had all types of artifacts available for daily lessons.  We learned about harnessing horses to pull the artillary, the uniforms, supplies, games played by the soldiers, etc.  There were carriage rides daily, and we even had the opportunity to fire a musket.<BR>
      Charlie and Florence Tarbox (the owners/hosts) asked if we would spread the word about their "Battlefield Bed and Breakfast" through the homeschool world.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="24822B"><B><I>Where were you in "THE OLDEN DAYS"?</I></B></FONT>
I love the newsletter because I think that sharing with each other is where it's really at.  We all need encouragement, uplifting, new ideas (why re-invent the wheel, right?), and an occasional laugh.  So here is my contribution to the laugh part. . <P>. 

A few weeks ago my nine-year-old daughter, Karly, asked me "Mom, were you alive in the olden days?"  We were in the middle of reading "Betsy Ross, Girl of old Philadelphia," so I naturally assumed she was trying to find out if I knew her or something!  I said no, I wasn't.  She continued, "Was Gramma?"  Nope.  "How about her mom?"  Well, I don't think so.  "Well, how about HER mom?"  Well, I don't know.  I don't think so.   Maybe HER Grandmother.  She thought about this for a second, and said "Was she a hippie?"   I about died laughing!!!<BR>
                                                                 Denise VanEck<P>

When I was eight or nine I remember asking my mother whether she had ever travelled in a covered wagon.  She seemed really insulted that I would ask that, that I would think she was so OLD, and so I never asked anyone again.  Turns out two of my grandparents HAD moved in covered wagons.  I'm glad they volunteered the information on their own in the course of conversations, because I was not ABOUT to ask them.  <g><BR>
     My mom's father came from Oklahoma to Texas, and my dad's mom moved from West Texas to Lincoln County, New Mexico to homestead near Carizozo when she was twelve or so, with her six sisters and her mom pregnant with their one baby brother.<BR>
     I think covered wagons lasted longer in West Texas and New Mexico than some other places, for the same reason old cars do.  It's not wet here.  Canvas and wood can last a long, long time.  Steel is unlikely to rust.  It's common for people to have wagon wheels in their front yards here for decoration or to outline flower beds.<BR>  
                                                                        SandraDodd (Sandra)<P>

From PJADK (Pattie):  Never, never remove me from the information lists.  The newsletter, etc. are invaluable to new hser's like myself.<BR>
     What I'd like to see is something about the best, most worthwhile place to spend time on AOL for hsing.  I looked at the Web today and spent far too much time and can't remember where I was, or how I got there, etc.<BR>
     I guess I'm just looking for more of the homeschooling forum type of feel.  It's funny, when I got out of the Web and got back into "our" area, I felt like I had come home.  Now, that says something about the people who dwell here, don't you think?<BR>

I have been away from the computer for about 7 weeks--I would like to announce the birth of my daughter Daphne Elizabeth on Nov. 1, 1995!   I was on 3 weeks of bed rest and then in a daze because she was born 5 weeks premature--so I just thought I'd let the rest of the community know!  <BR>[LisaViolin (Lisa)]<P>

I have a blurb for you under "You never know where this will lead...". We have found an abandoned house in great shape for a terrific price. There is an abandoned lot next door as well, all in a historic district in Providence. The process of working on it has been made possible by home schooling, and has helped my son who is in public school, to feel valuable and we have influenced positively all our new neighbors and even the contractors. The rule we are working under... do what you love ( in this case restoring an old house to proper beauty) and the money will come. Everyone loves the idea and works to help us. I have proven the reverse paranoids of the world can easily win!
Happy Discoveries, <BR>

"You must be twins," said the teacher.<BR>
"No, we're triplets!"<P>

"Oh, I see," I said, "the other one must have been somewhere else."<P>

"Yeah," said Caleb, age 6.  "He was homeschooled!"<P>

Last Fri. night, as we were about to sit down for our evening's meal, she suddenly decided that she had to eat immediately.  I was just putting the finishing touches on the table, when the very hungry Toby declared, "Please Mommy, come already, don't you see it says right here ( she is pointing to a grape juice bottle on the table that has Serve Chilled written on the label) Serve Child!"  And then as I arrived at the table, she turned to me with a big, wide grin and said,"Now that was a good joke, wasn't it?"<P>

Warm moments:

Recovering from a horrendous virus I lay on the couch this morning, pajama clad, til almost 11. My 4 year old daughter brought me "breakfast in bed" consisting of her toy plastic food, plastic cup and spoon from her toy kitchen. "Here sweetie, drink this" she said, putting the cup to my lips. Touched by her tender caring I said " Oh, are you going to take care of me like this when I'm an old, old lady?" "Yes" she replied sweetly, "If I still have my toy kitchen." <BR>

My 2 1/2 yo daughter was standing at the front door waiting for my DH to come in from work and noticed that the spruce trees we'd trimmed a couple weeks earlier had some sap seeping from the places we'd trimmed.  It obviously concerned her more than her greeting, because as soon as my husband opened the door she told him, "Papa, the tree's crying." >>  <BR>[SSagehill]<P>

 My eight year old daughter, Toby, recently began tinkering with a Little Tykes xylophone, playing songs on it using the accompanying color-coded songbook.  Shortly afterwards, she began to transfer her mastered tunes to the piano.  Come Thanksgiving, she announced to the table that she would be giving a recital.  Her first selection was "Are You Sleeping".  My mother-in-law commented,"How beautiful, she's playing 'Frere Jacques'" - to which Toby responded, " No Grammy, I'm playing it in English!"  <BR>[Eaglefam (Ilene)]<P>

According to his 15-minute school kindergarten testing this spring, Gabe's would-have-been principal told me that he had almost no vocabulary.  That could explain why he looked at the clouds today and said "Whoa!  Imminent snow!  Most excellent!" <BR>[SheEagl]<P>

 My daughter (5) and I were swinging together on the swing where you face each other (I don't remember the name of it...), anyway...I was trying to teach her the hand rhyme "Playmate."  We had been through it once, with a few stops and starts, so she laid her head down in my lap for a minute.  I said, "Let's try it again," and she said, "Oh, Momma, I don't think I can."<BR>
     I searched for anything to get her going.  She had a hood on her shirt, so I said, "Here, let's put your hood up.  Maybe that will help you."<BR>
     After a long pause, she said, "No, Momma, that won't help...It's not my Thinking Cap!!!"
     I laughed until tears rolled down my cheeks, and have now written it in her journal for safekeeping...as if I could ever forget it!        <BR>        [Bpahern (Tina)]<P>

During our unit study on Oklahoma homesteads Grant (5) asked if there were "Indians" around. I answered that "yes" there were but could he think of a more appropriate name for them. He searched his little memory banks for a moment then said with full confidence "Oh I know, they are 'Made in Americans'."   Of course what he meant was Native Americans; it was just to much for me.  I jumped up fending a "call of nature" so that  I could have my little chuckle privately, while he settled in to look at our picture book all about "Made in Americans." <BR> [MadBallew]<P>

When my son was about 4, he asked me one day, "Mom, can we go to the liquor store?" <BR>
         I thought this a rather odd request from a 4 year old and asked him, with some trepidation, "Honey, why do you want to go to the liquor store?"  <BR>
       "So we can get some licorice," he replied.<BR>
        I thought that was one for his baby book.  [WIrishRose]<P>

My sister, her husband, and their daughter were camping a few years ago and kept my two daughters with them for a day.  My niece, Tracy, then age 7, did something that made my daughter, Jacinda, age 6, really upset.  I think she took a swing away from her or something like that.  Now, Jacinda does come up with a lot of strange things.  She has ADD and doesn't communicate quite the way most of us do.  Well, she came running up to Uncle Larry and told him about it.  I guess he didn't seem very concerned about it so to make sure he understood the gravity of the situation she said, "I'm really mad at her!"  And with a stomp of the foot, "Guaranteed!  Like a Chevrolet!!"  She was very serious.  Larry just about died laughing.  So did the rest of us when he told us later!!  :-D    <BR> [Heatheryn (Heather)]<P>

Shobie had frozen a little glass jar of colored water.  I was angry when I heard a crash and found that he'd broken the jar on the patio.  But I couldn't be mad anymore when he said, "Look, Mommy, I FREED my solid!!!"  It struck me funny.  <BR> [Margmom (Margaret)]<P>

Hi Cristy,<P>

Some things just can't be rushed.  A wise mom shared this analogy years ago: Some apple trees bear fruit in August, some in October.  The October fruit is just as good and you can't rush it no matter how hard you try.<P>

This has proven especially true for reading in our family.<P>

Our oldest b13 did not learn to read until he was 9.  I started trying to *teach* him when he was 6.  He could encode and decode logic circuits on the computer, so I knew he wasn't "learning disabled."  It just wasn't time for him.  All I did by pushing was make him miserable and self-conscious.  He spoke late (~3 1/2yo) but I protected him then.  I'd say Einstein didn't talk til he has 4, so talk to me later.  And it worked fine, he speaks well, often and with great clarity and fluency.  Just wish I'd done the same with reading.  PUSHING DAMAGES.<P>

God bless you while you protect and wait,<P>

<FONT COLOR="0D22B7"><B>MORE THAN IMAGINED</B></FONT>

During my final semester of college I had an experience I would now categorize as *unschooling*, though at the time I thought of it simply as a way to escape a notoriously dull English lit seminar.  I was sick sick sick of classrooms and had begun to regret pigeonholing myself as an English major.  While I loved reading and talking and writing about literature, I'd come to realize that all my really satisfying literary discussions happened *outside* the classroom--and besides, I had other interests that had nothing to do with literature. I wanted to get outside, to learn more about the flora and fauna of Virginia, which had fascinated me ever since I moved to Fredericksburg from Colorado.<P>

On a whim, I called a local wildlife refuge.  I'd never been there, just knew it wasn't far away.  I explained to the friendly ranger who answered that I was an English major looking for an unpaid internship; did they have any brochures that needed to be written?  There was a stunned pause, then a delighted, "Are you kidding?"  Recent cutbacks had slashed the refuge staff, and there were dozens of projects piling up which, she declared, would be *perfect* for me (whom she'd never met!).  I convinced a professor to sponsor the internship, and a week later I found myself hiking through a frost-covered forest overlooking the Potomac, scanning the riverbank for bald eagles. <P>

My four months as a "public relations intern" at Mason Neck National Wildlife Refuge provided a wider range of learning experiences than had my entire liberal arts education.  I learned to identify trees and shrubs and birds.  I gave tours and led nature walks for school groups and scouts.  I helped build a fence around a narrow strip of ground that served as a control spot in an experiment concerning the effect of white-tailed deer on the tree population.  At my supervising ranger's insistance that I could do it, I drew a poster featuring the eaglets who had just hatched on refuge land.  (Until then, I wouldn't have said I could draw anything more detailed than a smily face.) <P>

I learned to tell an eagle's cry from a red-tailed hawk's.  I reorganized the volunteer log and profile system.  I crouched at a small pond, peering at blobs of salamander eggs floating in gelatinous masses beneath a crust of ice.  I wrote poetry (for myself) about salamanders and forests and hawks.  I wrote brochures and filmstrip scripts.  I wrote handouts for self-guided tours of a nature trail. I watched several dozen filmstrips and videos and wrote a catalog describing them.<P> 

Ultimately, the internship led to an interpretive tour-guide job with a nearby state park, but that's another story.  Mostly, what it did was allow me to get out of classrooms into a fascinating chunk of the real world.  I did things I'd never dreamed of doing--and I got hooked on doing them.  The rangers I worked with couldn't understand why *I* kept thanking *them* for the work I was doing.  They were astonished and delighted to have a willing pair of hands.  I suspect those rangers aren't alone.  There must be hundreds of state parks, national wildlife refuges, nature centers, and the like, where overworked, underbudgeted rangers would turn cartwheels upon hearing a homeschooler's request to get involved. <BR>

     "0," he answered.<BR>
     "0?"<P>
     "Yes, when you erase half of 8, it's 0.   Or it could be 3," he says... <BR>

My five-year-old told me today that the broom was a giant paintbrush that we use to paint the floor.  We talked about poetry and how it was not just rhyming words, but using words to describe things in new ways.  I never really understood poetry before I had children, now I am beginning to get the idea!  And hopefully my children will understand it as they grow and create it, instead of waiting for the "writing poetry" unit in fourth grade or the "appreciating poetry" unit in high school and then being told to do something they cannot understand.<BR>

My son, when he wanted to be held, would say "Hold you me."  My husband tried desperately to teach that piece of sweetness to our daughter, but she would have none of it!  She, however says, "I can't sleep withabout you," instead of I can't sleep without you.....and that's so, so dear.<BR>

Last night the kids and I were channel hopping in order to find SOMETHING.  :)  Anyway, we landed on PBS which was showing a ballet.  I still don't know which one it was, but the prima ballerina was absolutely wonderful.  She could present a move and hold it so long *I* got tired.  My boys were exclaiming *How Does She Do That.*  I, in my infinite wisdom said  "She practices  a LOT."  My almost-four turned and looked at me and said,  "Or she could be made out of rubber."<BR>

We were in a BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) train and Shobie had been talking about something.  The people behind us found him interesting and were discussing the things he was saying.  Shobie didn't like this, and not being extremely polite (at least at this point in his life), he turned and stuck his tongue out.  I whispered to him that I'd really rather he kept his tongue in his mouth during BART train rides and he replied (very loudly), "Why?  Is our tongue one of our private parts?"  This response caused the couple behind us to laugh hysterically which made it very difficult for me to keep a straight face.<BR>

Our five-year-old son was listening in on our study of Kansas a while back and heard us talking about the composer of the song "Home on the Range."  We decided to learn the words to it and the other three caught on quickly.  Later that week, while riding in the van, our five-year-old was singing :   "Home, home on da wange.  Where the dew and de ants blow away!"     All of us got a good chuckle out of that one.<BR>

My four-year-old daughter told me that she didn't like bones in the chicken.  "I like our bones but not the chicken bones."  To which I told her that our bones help us to stand up.  She then stood up her drumstick, when it fell she said, "It didn't work." :-D<BR>

I called down to the kids to ask what the story was on Wishbone yesterday.  Brandon called back that it was Don Picante. Don Picante???  Sophie agreed.  It was Don Picante. I suggested Don Quixote.  Oh, yeah.  That was it.<P>

I told Brandon a friend was moving to Troy, Ohio.  He said why would they want to move to Troy?   It took the Greeks ten years to get home from there.<BR>

My favorite little kid words around our house are "blow flower" for dandelions gone to seed and "cooking dress" for apron, and "fence door" for gate.   Oh, yes, "lawnmower bicycle" for motorcycle  (because of the sound).<BR>

My three-year-old has always called windshield wipers  "wisher washers"
and the movie theater is called the "movie futer."   The names have stuck and we can't seem to ever say the "right"words anymore.<BR>

One winter's day, when my 11 year-old daughter, Kenna, was three, we drove past a field where hundreds of Canada geese were foraging for remnants of the corn harvest.  Kenna pointed in their direction and asked, "Mommy, what are those?"  I answered, "Canada geese."  There was a quiet pause while Kenna thought this through.  Then, triumphant that she had grasped a new concept, she exclaimed, "Kenna da geese, Mommy da geese, Daddy da geese...."  She's has had the nickname 'Kenna Da Goose' ever since!  (She also came to think that JFK was a relative at one point.......John F. KENNAdy!  She's really gotten a lot of mileage out of her name!)<P>

Another time, when Kenna was about six, she saw a commercial on TV for a geriatric facility in which the phrase "your loved ones" was used while images of elderly residents came up on the screen.  For years after this, anytime she saw an elderly person, she would tug on my sleeve and say, "Look, Mommy, one of our Loved Ones!"  I always chuckled and agreed.  The day this incredibly special endearment really hit home was when we were on a rare trip into the city.  As we walked down a typical city street, Kenna spotted an elderly homeless woman and whispered as before, "Look, Mommy, one of our Loved Ones."  Tears came to my eyes as I replied, "Loved One?  Yes, Honey, she's one of our Loved Ones, too."   Who says TV is all bad?<BR>

June 9-14 & June 16-21, 1996<BR>
Sandy Cove Christian Conference Center in North East MD <P>

Sandy Cove is pleased to announce that the increasingly popular Home School Conference has been expanded to TWO weeks.  Two separate conferences are planned, with the same central theme for both.<P> 

<B>Home School Week I </B><BR>
June 9-14, 1996 <BR>
Week I will feature Michael Farris, Esq., as the keynote speaker. Mr. Farris is President and Founder of Home School Legal Defense Association. He is a frequent speaker on college campuses and radio in debate format. He is the author of The Homeschooling Father and Where Do I Draw the Line?, and is a regular columnist for The Teaching Home. He served as General Legal Counsel for Concerned Women of America and was President of the Bill of Rights Legal Foundation.  He was the Virginia Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor in 1993, and received 46% of the vote against his Democratic incumbent.  He and his wife, Vickie, have been educating their children at home for over ten years.  Michael will focus on ways you can "Battle for Your Right to Home School," "Why Home Schooling Works," and "Top Ten Trends in Christian Home Education."  He will also present a two-part series addressing the issue of "Meeting the Needs of Your Spouse."<P>

<B>Home School Week II</B><BR>
June 16-21, 1996 <BR>
Week II will feature Cathy Duffy as the keynote speaker.  Mrs. Duffy is the author of Christian Home Educators' Curriculum Manuals (elementary and junior/senior high), Government Nannies, and has published numerous articles on home education.  She also publishes Math Mouse Games, a sideline which resulted from her interest in math curriculum and her efforts to make arithmetic more understandable and enjoyable. She has been active in local and state home schooling organizations, including board service for Christian Home Educators Association of California and coordinator of Christian Family Educators of Orange County, California.  She has helped organize science and art fairs, park days, and picnics.  One of her favorite long-term activities is hosting Mom's Night Out, where mothers can get support from other home schooling moms.  Cathy will address motivation and practical issues. How do you keep going when the going gets tough?  How do you actually teach every child and not lose your mind?  Moving beyond basics, Cathy will challenge you to consider the ultimate purpose of home education and help you consider redesigning your curriculum in light of that purpose.
      Special seminars and "hands-on" projects will be presented throughout both weeks. Plan to join in the fun of Family Olympic Games, too.  A full ClubCove (infants through teens) program will provide instruction and fun for every child in your family.<P>

Homeschool Cyber-News is the newsletter of AOL's Homeschool Forum, which is hosted by MyCamelot and Journey100.  If you wish to be removed from this mailing list, just hit "reply" and say you're not interested.<P>  

Other personnel of the Homeschool Forum are DACunefare, TinaNH, GingerHead, KWPNHorses and Elizabyrd.  You can meet them in some of the chats listed on the schedule below, and in the folders between chats.   If you've been to the Forum before and can't find your way back, use Keyword HOMESCHOOL, and you'll have access from that point to our bulletin board and library, the forum of Home Education Magazine, of Practical Homeschooling, the Academic Assistance Center, and other AOL services.<P>

<FONT COLOR="B1031C"><B>FROM THE EDITOR:</B></FONT><BR>
The combined homeschooling knowledge on AOL, and the collected resources, are phenomenal.   There is probably not as much homeschooling expertise and information in one place anywhere else in the country as we have here on AOL.  One of our participants posted recently:  "I have three on-line services and each one has a HS forum of some sort.  This one costs me the most but it is the best one and the one I want to read all the time (of course). There is a great feeling among all those who post here and I really enjoy it."   People can get answers to questions, people to help brainstorm ideas, and hard information about local laws and support groups within a day or two, in most cases (and within moments in some cases).   This wouldn't happen without the contributions of those of you who read the bulletin boards and contribute to this wealth of experience.   Thank you all for sharing your hard-earned wisdom.  <P>

<FONT COLOR="B1031C"><B>NO BAD DAYS (ONLY BAD MOMENTS)</B></FONT><P>

A friend recently gave me a  whole new outlook when I was having a "Bad Day."  She said that when something goes awry during the day (as it does frequently with a 2yo, 4yo, and 6yo), we are quick to label it "a bad day."  In fact, it is just "a bad moment."  We recover much faster now that we've labeled those moments for what they are...just tiny fractions of our day!  Thanks to all for letting me lurk around, from a still-somewhat-insecure newbie.<BR>
     I'm still LOL from earlier when 6yo was chasing loose guinea pig (which was dressed in a doll outfit complete with hat), cat was barfing on the living room carpet, and 4yo smiled and said, "It's okay, Mommy, it's just a bad moment."<BR>

<FONT COLOR="B1031C"><B>CYBER-KUDZU</B></FONT><P>

A reader in Michigan sent this, from the local paper:  "The first word to be proposed for banning in 1996 is the prefix 'cyber,' which is becoming attached to everything under the sun.  You won't find cyber defined unto itself, even in the big dictionary; but it appears that it applies to any human activity that falls within the domain of computers.  It is a kudzu word that is over-running the language as happens with so much computer-speak.  Scholars at Lake Superior State University nominated it as one of the words to be banned this year."<P>

<FONT COLOR="B1031C"><B>MATH</B></FONT><BR>
Just got a notice from Don Cohen, author of Calculus for Kids, that he's setting up a web page at http://www.shout.net/~mathman  <BR>
He says  <<It's under construction with links to student work from around the country, when we get some bugs out. The emphasis will be on PATTERNS, VISUALIZING and LEARNING TO LEARN.>>   He's a lovely man with a real love for kids and math. Should be an interesting site once it's all set up.<BR>

I just bought Cohen's video of "Infinite Series for 6 year olds."   Even though Sage is just 13,  it was a valuable tape.  I hadn't bought them before, though I had seen them advertised,  but this time I saw it in the Science Museum book store.  Next visit I bought his "Workbook."  Though we have only done a couple of exercises so far,  I am very enthusiastic about it.  It was through Cohen's suggestion to write a computer program for one of the infinite series that Sage and I both started to learn the Pascal programming language,  with Forrester,  our resident tutor.<BR>
      Anyone who wants to ask me anything about Cohen's materials,  please do so.  Cohen is doing what my husband always thought was a valuable idea:  bringing concepts usually reserved for high school into the most rudimentary levels.  For example:  exponents,  a concept usually reserved for high school,  was completely accessible to elementary kids.<BR>
      Ideally,  kids given the opportunities Cohen gives will not bomb out when they get to Calculus,  as I did.<BR>

We are near Lookout Mountain/Chattanooga.  Recently we had a ice storm that left about an inch of hard ice.  Then the next day it snowed perhaps an inch. 
I have discovered a new use of ski equipment.  My son and a couple of friends got a hold of some skis.  The would kneel down on them and using one hand to steady themselves on the ski and the other somewhat as a guide on the ice they sailed down the ice roads having lots of fun.  I decided that that was a pretty good innovation since we usually don't keep snow equipment this far south.  <BR>

My son, Shane (5), and I were recently discussing what unit he would like to do next...he tells me he wants to learn all about the whole university!  I am thinking, Gee, maybe I am not stimulating him enough?  Should he be working on a higher level?  Is he bored with his current curriculum?  So I said (we live in Louisiana) "Son, are you telling me you want to go to LSU?" and he says, "Mom! I mean the UNIVERSITY... you know, stars, planets, space ....!"<BR>
     And here I was trying to figure out how to get the boy a basketball scholarship!<BR>

Recently my girls and I were out running errands and so forth when one of the salespeople looked over the counter and said (rather rudely I thought) "Just why aren't you kids in school?"   My middle child (9) looked her up and down and announced "We are!  We're homeschooled.  We go to school everyday and every place.  We're at school now."  My jaw dropped, because I'm so used to having to explain.  Felt good to see that salespersons face when my daughter answered.<BR>

I'm trying to deschool my 7 & 8 y/o and they won't let me. They get up every morning excited, "hurry mom it's time for school," & the bell ringing starts (we have a little bell). During school time they call me Mrs. Hart.  I purchased some ABeka workbooks mainly for busy work because they love it they did 30 pages last night until 8 P.M.  (UPS delivered them yesterday).   So this morning as soon as they got up they wanted a math test.  Who ever heard of a kid wanting a test?   I have my doubts some days about this huge undertaking of homeschooling. But then I thank God for my children who never waver in their love or faith in me and my skills. <BR>

I am new to AOL and to this forum and I appreciate all the humor you all have to share.  My somewhat messy six-year-old was asked by my husband "What kind of shape is your room in?"  She replied without missing a beat, " A square."
     A year prior, I spent a whole day cleaning up her room and large closet. I mean I slaved.  When she came in she looked around and said "Thanks mom, you put carpet in my closet!"   (The closet was always carpeted.)<BR>

John and Cat went to the bakery.  The women behind the counter started talking to them and asked Cat what grade she was in and where she went to school.  When homeschooling was brought up one of the women seemed concerned and asked, "How do you know she is learning enough?"   The other woman asked Cat what she wanted to be when she grew up, Cat answered, " A paleontologist."   Both women asked at the same time, "What ?"  <BR>

I'm back in school getting my master's in education.  My daughter Billie (2 1/2) has asked why I go to school and her Dad and I have both told her it's so I can "get smart" and help her "get smart."  Billie asked where smart was and we told her it was in your head so she likes to give people "smart" by touching her head and then touching theirs.  I had to take Billie to one of my classes.  Everyone was taking notes while the professor spoke, all of a sudden, Billie asked, "Mom, are we getting smart?"  Everyone looked and then just started laughing.  I think they were all wondering the same thing, it just took a two year old to say it.<BR>

The other day I overheard my 5-year old daughter talking with her 7-year old public schooled first-grade cousin Michael.  He was trying to get her to listen to him read from a book about Egypt. "You have to listen!" he was telling her.  "I don't want to," she said. "You HAVE to! You need to learn stuff!" he implored.  "I don't want to see the book right now," she told him again.  "You have to see it so you can LEARN. You have to LEARN so you can BE SMART."   I waited to hear Hana's reply.  She thought for a moment and said, "I'm already smart."<BR>

I just thought I would tell you something my six year old daughter told me when we were working on spelling the other day.  She substituted a letter for another letter and she said "My mind is out of my head!"  Sometimes we all feels like that, don't we?!!!!  <BR>

In our first  year of homeschooling our daughter,  our son was four, and insisted on participating in school.   On the day I put a map of our solar system  on the wall to help Sarah learn the order of the planets (she had learned the names on her own when she found them in a book),  Jacob leaned against the sofa and stared intently at the map.  We had to ask if he liked the picture.  Jacob told us earnestly, "I need  to find Disneyland."  We were just short of rolling on the floor.<BR>
     On another occasion we put school aside for a little while to answer the question "What should we pray about?"   I told the children all I could think of,  when we're scared, or worried about someone, prayer for unsaved loved ones, and when we're glad about something and want to say "Thank you" to God.    <BR>                     That night I had the good fortune to be at the bedroom door and hear Jacob pray.  He went through the usual list of things a four year old thinks about, Mom, Dad, Sister, friends, toys.  He stopped as if thinking what not to leave out, then continued "... and thank you for food and drinks and water........and toilets."  I headed for the phone, Grandma likes a good laugh. <BR>

When my son was 3, I got a set of Brainquest cards.  One of the questions showed a square table with the leg from one corner missing.  I showed the picture to Dan and dutifully asked, "Whats missing from this picture?"   Without skipping a beat, he answered,  "Coffee."<BR>
     He was about the same age when my aunt decided to quiz him on his colors.  She picked up a dead leaf and asked him the color "Brown."  She picked up a green leaf and asked him the same question.  "Not brown," he replied.  <BR>

As I was driving my older daughter to gymnastics, she looked out the window at the passing businesses.  She then said,"Mom, never take your clothes to the Swiss Cleaners!" in her most serious voice.  When I asked why, she said, "Because, they'll come back full of holes!"<P>

     I was buying some party stuff for a birthday party, and Tatiana came to me, drooling over a tambourine (this is the child with the musical spoons and a harmonica).  She started pleading, "Mommy, can I pu-leeze get this tangerine!"
      How could I not buy the tangerine for my musical daughter?!?!?  :)<BR>

Ok unschool folks. You are starting to get to me. Yesterday the baby got into a big Tupperware container full of birdseed, that my daughter keeps in the pots `n pans cabinet.  She had it opened and was digging in the birdseed.  I ran into the kitchen, ready to scream at the mess (don't know why; there already was a mess even before she got the birdseed).  But then... all these unschooling posts I've been filing in my brain activated and possessed me!  I got down with her and started to dig in the birdseed.  I called my older son and daughters (10, 8 and 5) and we all started digging in the birdseed.  My son said, "This is kind of like blood. Each piece is a solid, but together it acts like a liquid."  Whadya know? Fluid mechanics. It was fun, too.   Only took a minute to clean up.<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#00CC00><B>SOFTWARE FOR GIRLS??</B></FONT><P>

Computer Life magazine is sponsoring an event on Wednesday, April 17 at 9 PM ET in the Rotunda (Keyword: Rotunda), which will feature the folks who produce the McKenzie & Company software.  The discussion will focus on whether girls are sufficiently different from boys in their software tastes and needs to warrant separate development by software companies.  Is separate development of software titles condescending or "long overdue?"    Contact Susan Proctor (ICS Sparky) for more information.<P>

<FONT COLOR=#00CC00><B>MOVING AND HOMESCHOOLING</B></FONT><P>

We began homeschooling six years ago in April.  Things had gotten so bad for my sons, then 10 and 7, that I took them out at Spring break rather than waiting until the end of the school year.  We had about 15 months of homeschooling at that location (Massachusetts), then we began to move.  We moved five times--yes, 5!--in three years, before landing in Texas, where we have been for about 20 months now.  We also had another baby during all those moves--Bethany lived in three homes before her first birthday.   A little note of explanation:  we are an Army family, but even in the Army we don't usually move quite that much!  My husband was picked up for promotion while Bethany was a baby, and that was why we kept moving, as they gave him assignments that were suited to his new rank.<P>

I suppose all of us who homeschool know that it's easier to move when you don't have to worry about switching schools, especially when you must move during the school year.  Other aspects of moving remain much the same, however.  Everyone still must say goodbye to friends and places and activities, and find new things to enjoy in the new location.  I find Mom's attitude to be the single most important factor in determining how a move will go.  When I have been glad about the move, then my kids look forward to it, too.  When I don't want to move, neither do they.  When my emotions are mixed, so are theirs.  This is true even with my eldest, who was 15 during our last move, though I'm sure he wouldn't care to hear me claim such a thing! ;)  However, it's important to allow each family member time to feel sorry over leaving the old place, even when most or all of the family is looking forward to the move.  Even if you're staying within reach of old friends, you can still expect someone to say something about how different the new house is, or how strange it is to not have a grocery store just down the block, or something of the sort.  I feel it's vitally important during a move for Mom to allow herself all these feelings, and express them appropriately.  Sometimes that means sharing those feelings with the kids, who know them anyway, probably before Mom does! ;)  Sharing these feelings openly will allow the kids (and sometimes Dad) to share their feelings freely, and this allows everyone to work through those feelings, which are often very strong, and move past them into an appreciation for the new location.<P>

The part of a move most people dread the most is having to leave old friends and find new ones.  Being in a new area brings many opportunities for finding great new friends, but reality says we may never find someone we can call on a daily basis if we need to because she understands everything we're going through.  I've been lucky; out of those half dozen places we've lived in the last six years, I've found two such friends.  That, of course, means I spent much time in places where there wasn't anyone like that.  I did still have friends--I've learned to find friends in the most unlikely of places!  But none of them were 'bosom' friends or 'kindred spirits,' they were just people I enjoyed being with occasionally.<P>

The best way for making friends that I found was to start, or join, a support group of some kind.  When Bethany was a baby, I joined La Leche League and an existing playgroup.  I thought about starting a homeschooling support group, but I found my personal need was for support in parenting a difficult baby, while my boys found plenty of friends in our immediate neighborhood.  When we moved just before her first birthday, and again when she was 20 months old, I stopped going to LLL, but started two different playgroups in order to find social support for myself.  Then I joined yet another playgroup when we moved again when she was 2 1/2.  If we hadn't had the baby, I would probably have put my energy into joining or forming a homeschooling support group in each location.  Sometimes we're fortunate enough to find good groups already in existence, but most of the time, if we want it, we've got to make it!<P>
     
Another good way to make friends is volunteering.  Many homeschooling families volunteer as families; some, like mine, volunteer piecemeal.  Volunteering is a wonderfully fast, easy way to get involved in the new community and find lots of people with similar values to choose friends from.<P>

Altogether, I can say that although frequent moves have cost me alot of emotional and physical energy over the last few years, they have also given me two life-long friends and many others I cherish the memory of, even though I will probably not keep in touch with them forever.  Now I can add a new support group to the ones I have joined in the past--all my cyber friends! :)  Speaking of whom, I welcome email from any and all who would like to write me, about any subject--my mailbox has been rather empty of late.  But it's time for me to end this article--Bethany, now 4 1/2, is climbing all over me and wants my attention! :)<BR>

My husband hates getting a haircut and his current work situation doesn't require short, neat hair, so he went a long time between haircuts. He has pretty thick hair, and when he came home from the barber, Benjamin said, "Daddy's head got little!"<BR>
     Benj is still in diapers and isn't fond of getting changed. One day recently I thought I smelled evidence that a change was in order, and suggested we change his stinky diaper. "My diaper's not stinky! It's happy!" he replied.<BR>

(Posted with the heading "TOO MUCH PBS?")   My four-year-old recently attended a party for a little friend.  The theme was "rock-n-roll" and the children were supposed to dress like rock stars.  Ashley wanted to wear a party dress, not a costume, so we put a big bow in her hair and told her she could be Olivia Newton John.  When we arrived at the party, Ashley proudly announced, "I'm Olivia Newton's Apple!"<BR>
<CENTER>Beth (DBMAK)</CENTER><P>
 
My 17-month-old is soaking up words like a sponge.  Lately we've been naming body parts: "al-bow" and (our favorite) "kneeeeeeee!"<BR>
Today, while clipping her fingernails, I pointed to her thumb and said "thumb."  She then pointed to the bent knuckle of her thumb and said "kneeeee?"<BR>
Not a bad leap of logic for someone who has only been in this world for a year and a half.<BR>

<B>THE LEOTHY MILLER OWENS HOMESCHOOL CONFERENCE</B><BR>
April 12th and 13th 1996 at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York.<BR>
<FONT COLOR=#DD0000><CENTER>**REGISTRATION DEADLINE MARCH 10**</FONT></CENTER><P>

Seeds of Many Nations is an independent homeschool parent group.  Four of us, ArtyAnn Cotten, Frances Poe, Asiba Tupahache and Kristin Cleage Williams, whose nations have historically and collectively experienced land seizure, chattel slavery, repression of indigenous languages, attacks on traditional practice of spiritual and cultural kinship, brutalization and genocide came together to talk about the development of our learning children.  <P>

It was clear that the events of our respective historic experiences were not matters of the past, but rather they persist as ongoing issues in this society's chronic condition.   The racist naming of athletic teams (in state funded public schools),  the bureacratic labeling and what's been institutionally called 'medication' of our children, the high homicide rate of our males, the question of genetic inferiority constantly surfacing in one form or another and other examples bear out the presence of society's chronic condition.   It was also observed that these issues are continually denied or rearranged to suit the needs of others who dominate the posture of homeschool discussions in the media and other formats.  It was decided that this would not continue. Out of this came a homeschool conference.   <P>

The Leothy Miller Owens Conference will take place April 12th and 13th 1996 at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, New York.  The admission is free but the registration deadline, March 10, 1996 is firm.  Send a self addressed stamped envelope for information on pre-conference seminars and registration material to: Seeds of Many Nations, PO Box 1058, Gracie Station, New York NY 10028, or call (516)877-1630, (212)860-1018 or fax (516)877-9201.

Note that these issues do not address the questions of "problem schools."  They are unrelated to questions of crime, drugs, threat of violence, time spent in forced commuting, illiterate teachers, etc.  The problems unschoolers specifically care about exist (to a greater or lesser extent) even in "good" schools.  Moreover, many educational reform proposals act to make these problems worse.  Improved security measures increase the dehumanizing aspects of school "discipline."  "Back-to-basics" programs increase the rigidity of the curriculum, and often further divorce it from context.  "Mainstreaming" programs exacerbate the effects of a one-size-fits-all curriculum, and often take up huge fractions of teachers' time and energy.  Many reformers want to increase the number of hours in a schoolday or schooldays in a year, eliminating the chance for a student to educate himself in the off hours.  The solution to the problems inherent in mass-produced education is not more of the same.<P>

Unfortunately, telling what unschooling isn't doesn't tell what it is. In some ways, all homeschooling is unschooling -- we don't isolate our kids from life, or move at the sound of a bell, or require permission slips, or neglect the individuality of our children.  Where unschoolers differ from other homeschoolers is the extent to which we let children be responsible for their own education.<P>

Unschoolers believe that the natural curiosity of a healthy child, given access to a rich environment, will lead the child to learn what he or she needs to know.  When learning comes about as a result of the child's desires, it is absorbed easily, enthusiastically, openly.  The child works harder because he is doing what he thinks is important, rather than what someone else has told him is important.  New knowledge starts with a context because it fits in with things the child already cares about.  Learning driven by real desire is so much more efficient than passive absorption that unschoolers can tolerate much more exploration, dabbling, dawdling and play than can curriculum- inflictors.  The unschooling literature abounds with stories of children who paid no attention to math or reading for their first ten years and then caught up in just a few weeks.<P>

When learning is imposed from without, there are many deleterious effects.  The child may not be ready for the material or may be beyond it; the child may resist it, either because he has something better to do or just out of general orneriness.  When you force a topic, you short-circuit precisely the volitional parts of the mind that are critical to real learning. You may produce memorization, but cannot effect understanding.  You risk the child developing a dislike for the topic, for the teacher, and even for learning itself.<P>

Child-driven learning is fundamentally active.  Children are doing things because they have taken responsibility for carrying out the actions needed to fulfill their desires.  Unschooling is centered around the idea of learning, with the student as the center of action and the source of activity, rather than on the idea of teaching (with the teacher as the center of action and the source of activity).  Not only does this make the learning more effective, but it encourages the child to develop virtues: independence, self-reliance, and a sense of responsibility.  The child learns that if he wants something to happen, he has to make it happen.<P>

As Jim Muncy pointed out in his "spectrum of unschooling" post [home-ed mailing list, summer of '94], homeschoolers unschool to varying degrees.  Unschooling families do not set up miniature classrooms, with time set aside for studying, a parent playing the role of teacher, formal lesson plans and imposed curricula.  Beyond that limit, we differ in how much order we try to lend to the learning process.  "Radical" unschoolers impose little or no structure, though books and such are available to act as guides.  Others allow children to learn what they wish, but provide strong organizational assistance to help the children reach their goals.  (Assistance can take the form of lessons, or workbooks, or even assigned projects.)  Some families use curricula for some subjects (often math) but are freer with others.  Most try to squeeze learning out of the activities of everyday life.  The common bond is acknowledging that the enthusiastic participation of the child is the most important single factor in the child's education.<BR>

Homeschool Cyber-News is a part of AOL's Homeschooling Forum, hosted by Journey100 and MyCamelot, aided and abetted by DACunefare, KWPNHorses, TinaNH, GingerHead and Elizabyrd.   The newsletter editor is SandraDodd.  If you wish to be removed from this newsletter list, just hit "reply" and let me know. <P>

<B>A message from MyCamelot (Jeri) & Journey100 (Dianna):</B><P>

We are sorry to report that there has been some technical trouble with our forum.  First we had the folders reset, so that they all opened to the beginning, even if you had selected Find New.  As it happens, we also found that we had "inherited" posts that snuck into our folders from other areas.  Those posts have been removed.  Our latest problem has been in the form of disappearing folders.  Our best guess at this point is that the system is removing folders that do not have current posts.  Every morning it is a surprise to us! ;-)  We are working with those who know about these things and trying to solve this mystery.  As soon as we have the answer, and know for certain (or as certain as one can be about these things) that things are fixed, we will share that information.  Until then, we are grateful for your patience with us.   There IS some good in this mystery, though.  Our folders seems to be working properly again, so we won't have any more full folders.  This also means we have more folders available, because we don't have to keep any in reserve for folders that fill up.  So, if there's a topic not covered by one of our folders, please e-mail Journey100 or MyCamelot, and we will do our best to get as many topics as we can available.<P>

<FONT COLOR=#CC0000><B>YET ANOTHER HOMESCHOOLING ADVANTAGE</B></FONT><P>

I am pleased to announce another opportunity brought to us by the benefits of homeschooling.  My daughter, Michelle Thomas, is a part of the Warwick, RI Figure Skating Club's "Snow Flakes" Precision Team.  They went to the competition in Delaware on February 24 and they took 1st place in the Eastern Division (of the 3 in the USA).  She and my wife went together.  My wife will now accompany Michelle to Chicago for the Precison National Championships, on March 29 and 30.  Michelle's team will compete against 11 other teams on March 29.  I understand that ESPN will cover this competition  for national broadcast.  It is a relatively new sport (15 years old) and this is the 2nd time it will be covered on TV.  It's the beauty of the Rockettes and regular figure skating combined.  So home schooling goes a long way!<BR>
Good luck to ALL the teams! Homeschooling is not unusual with this crew.  I love to watch this sport, having learned precision drill in the Marine Corps.  It is fantastic fun to see for me.<BR>

<B>Zoe, age six, went sledding</B> yesterday, and she and her friend decided it was fun to run down the hill.  Two older boys came up to them and told them, in a snotty way, that they couldn't do that.  Zoe replied, "Why not? I'm not breaking the laws of physics!"<BR>
Now I'm pretty sure she doesn't really know what physics is, but it sure worked in that sentence!<BR>
<CENTER>Paula (SJOGY)</CENTER><P>

<B>My daughters (6 and 4) were "doctoring" me</B> the other day, they asked where I hurt and they bandaged me up.   When I said my calf hurt they weren't so sure where my calf was so I showed them and then reviewed other parts of the leg and foot.  Then I pointed to my thigh and asked what part of the body this was.  They both looked at me and said..."your cow?"   Not bad for two city girls who just moved to the country!   : )<BR>
<CENTER>DLCWGA </CENTER><P>

<B>I tease my kids sometimes</B> that I am so old I had a pet dinosaur when I was their age.  They know that's  silly.  (They know a lot about dinosaurs!)<BR>
Anyway, on the way home from church today, we talked about how God was around before the earth, which He created.  The six-year-old said, "God really did have a pet dinosaur!"<BR>
<CENTER>Nancy (older than dirt, but not as old as God) (MsTerrE)</CENTER><P>

<B>When we were poor as church mice</B> (one income earner with three homeschooled daughters), our girls would spend up to four hours a day playing paper dolls on the floor of their bedroom.  Over the years, the dolls they drew changed dramatically in sophistication.  They made up characters, different locales, houses with wallpaper and furniture, families and friends that changed constantly.  And everything fit neatly into a few shoe boxes, all made of paper that they elaborately worked on.<BR>
Today, one is absolutely determined to be a fashion designer in some form.  They all collect costumes from thrift stores and garage sales which they wear to theme parties.  And all three have a love of history and can recall the style of any era.   And those paper dolls still live in the attic in their shoebox homes, waiting for the daughters of our girls.   .... Did  I mention how beautiful they are?<BR>

<B>My daughter Sarah is an advanced student</B>, reading books that many adults won't tackle.  When she read "Swiss Family Robinson" we had many distractions, as I started teaching her brother that year.  When we tried to get back on track after one distraction, she asked "Now, where was I?"  When I quoted the sentence "Fifty feet above the ground,"  she just had to laugh!<BR>

Here is an excerpt of the article that appeared in The Hartford Courant (The Country's oldest newspaper)  Saturday March 30, 1996, in the Connecticut section:
<<New Britain - Daniel L. Jafferis, 12, placed third (in the statewide geography bee sponsored by National Geographic) correctly identifying the Niger River that flows through the African country with the same name, and Islam as the religion, after Hinduism, practiced by the most people in India.  He won a check for $50, as well as games and maps.<BR>
"He's calm, he's very focused. He takes this in stride,"  Daniel's mother, Dorene, said of her son.  During the competition, Daniel received applause from the audience when he stood on his tiptoes to reach the microphone, then answered his questions in a loud, clear voice.<BR>
Dorene Jafferis said she has been schooling her son at their West Haven home for five years.  She said that when Daniel and his brother Noah,10, study  a country, they explore its culture and history and surrounding areas.<P>

This competition was held at Central Connecticut State University and the children who participated were first place winners from their schools.  My son (David Aron 7th grade age 12  was a finalist at his school (King Philip Middle School) in West Hartford.  A schoolmate  Aaron Kleinman (6th grader aged 11) won the statewide competition, and the second place winner was Larry Jabusch, 14 of Vernon CT.  The winner of the statewide competiton  wins a $100, geography games and maps, and an all expense paid trip to Washington in May for the National championship.<BR>
To my knowledge, Dorene Jafferis was the person who organized the homeschool competition here in Connecticut.   Interesting to note that of the ten children who went to the state competition, only one was a girl! (she made it to the final four)<BR>
A homeschooler came out as third place winner in the Connecticut Geography bee sponsored by National Geographic.  He is from New Haven and it made good press for homeschooling in general.   I could send you the newspaper article or give you more particulars if you are interested.   Seems these homeschoolers who have no socialization are just popping up all over the place.  Pity they are so disadvantaged. ;-)<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#00CC00><B>FIGURE SKATING COMPETITION</B></FONT>
I have the pleasure of announcing that Michelle's Team, the Snowflakes, took first place at the National Precision Figure Skating Competition at the Juvenile level (in April).  Two other more advanced teams from Warwick did well also. The Munchkins took 4th place and the Junior level team, the Superettes, took 3rd place.<BR>
      It is truly amazing that they did so well. They reached within themselves to give a great performance under very difficult conditions.  True champions.  It's nice to admire one's children!<BR>

<FONT COLOR=#00CC00><B>"PROJECT LEARNING TREE"</B></FONT><P>

I attended a seminar from the American Forest Foundation called "Project Learning Tree."  It was conducted by the Louisiana Forestry Dept.  I am sure in other states it is run by their Forestry departments, also. The seminars are for teachers including homeschool parents. It was six hours long. They show how to teach science activities from their activity book.  I really enjoyed the seminar and received a lot of booklets, posters, and nature guides.  It costs $15 and this includes the 400 page activity book!  This seminar would be great for parents who are maybe somewhat anxious about teaching science. The activities are written for the public or private classroom but can very easily be modified for the family.  The address for the American Forestry Foundation is 111 19th St. NW Washington, DC 20036 . <P>

<FONT COLOR=#00CC00><B>SHARON AND THE GACKLE</B></FONT><P>

     One day I was getting dressed, suddenly something black hit my window!  It was
sprawled out when it hit.  Immediately I knew it was a bird!<BR>
     I moved to my window to get a look, I yelled to my mom, "Quick, Mom, go
outside, a Gackle just hit my window!"<BR>
     Within minutes both of my parents were in sight of my window!<BR>
     I opened my window to say "I was just standing here & it hit my window, the
bird practically scared me to death!  Is it o.k.?"<BR>
     "I have no idea why the bird rammed into your window, there's not any sun on
your window," said my mom!<BR>
     The bird recovered over several minutes. My dad told me to `get out there if
I wanted to touch the bird before it flew away' I quickly got out there & sat
beside my mom!<BR>
     I reached out my hand gently to touch the soft feathered Gackle! My dad
picked up the Gackle & gave him a few bounces, then the Gackle flew away!<BR>
     I'm glad I'm home-schooled `cause if I had been in public school I wouldn't
have gotten to see this bird up close!<BR>

     The other day my 12-year-old son was working on origami (a favorite pasttime) and he was getting frustrated...working the same fold over and over.  I was trying to encourage him to keep on trying.  I said, "Honey, there's a right way and a wrong way to do it!"  <BR>
     Exasperated he said, "Mom, you know there's more than one wrong way to do it!"<BR>

We've been having fun,working on the preamble of the Constitution, and neither Jake or Sarah or could get very far.   We broke up every time they tried to say 'promote the general welfare,' and it came out 'prevent the general welfare.'  My favorite mistake was 'incite domestic tranquility.'   Wishful thinking!<BR>

My son who just turned three has developed a love of dinosaurs.  His favorite is, of course, the Tyrannosaurus Rex.  Last week he asked me when he would see a real Tyrannosaurus Rex.  I told him that there were no more of them living, but that we could go to a museum and see their bones.  He said that he wanted to see a real one and asked why he couldn't.  I told him that the last T Rex died long ago, before he was even born.  He immediately burst out into tears, with a red face and everything.  "But I WANT to see one.  They DIDN'T die out!" he was crying.  <BR>
     Well, he isn't potty-trained yet, so I had to change his diaper at about this time, too.  I took him in and stood him on the table (he won't lie down when he is crying because the tears run down his throat) and changed his diaper.  He was still crying and complaining.  Finally he understood that every Tyrannosaurus Rex was dead.  Then he got mad.  He stood there in his diaper and said, "Well, then, I won't even put on my pants!"<BR>
        I have been smiling about this one all week.  <BR>

We have four children, and our most energetic and flamboyant is our youngest, 3 year old Steven.<BR>
     A few days ago, Daddy said " I'm going to town...any one who wants to come, get in the car!"  All but the oldest, 11 year old John-David, chose to go along.  He stayed home with me.<BR>
     Steven was buckled into his booster seat, next to an open window.  As dh pulled out of the driveway, Steven impulsively leaned out the window and yelled to John-David, for all the nosy neighbors to hear:  "JOHN-DAVID!! You're SPECIAL!!  and you have a WONDERFUL LIFE !!!"   <BR>
     No socialization problems here.   Ain't homeschoolin' great??<BR>

My neighbour and I have trees in our front yards with rocks ringing them and yesterday my neighbour was telling us, me, my son and daughter, that she found a black widow spider underneath one around her tree. Jay asked about them and we remarked we should be careful how we turn over the rocks or kick them over. Then last night Patsy just popped out to her dad, "You gotta watch out for those black wierdo spiders!"<BR>

My friend was discussing the results of the primaries with her 8 year old son this week.  She explained that because Robert Dole was to be the Republican nominee that we would all be seeing a lot of his name in print as part of his campaign.  Her son responded, "Wow, he already is advertising his name in the grocery store on bananas!"<BR>

About a month ago, I began teaching my 4 year old the days of the week.  She would repeat them, but always ended on the same day.   ".......Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Someday".  Each time I would encourage her to say Sunday, with an "N".....and each time, she would say "Someday".  Finally, with a confused look on her face, she replied....."When is Someday?"  I tried to explain to her that "someday" was not  a day of the week....She interrupted me and said, "Yes it is....that is the day Daddy is going to buy me a pony!"<BR>

The authors are Stefania and Dominic Perring. The ISBN# is 0-02-599461-1.  It's published by MacMillan and retails for $29.95. I pick up a lot of my hardbacks at a local Barnes and Noble outlet that sells all hardbacks at 20% off - you may be able to get a discount somewhere, another store I deal with gives all educators (and yes, we're officially recognized!) 20% on all books special ordered. I hope your family enjoys it as much as ours does. Even though it's a bit small, it makes a great "coffee table" type book - great conversation piece.  <BR>

The authors of the book are Stefania Perring & Dominic Perring. I saw this book quite a while ago but it was $27.50 so I kept waiting. Last year my mother-in-law picked up for me as a gift for Christmas. It was at Waldenbooks.   My kids thought it was neat to see what famous archeological sights would have looked like before they were just piles of rock. It's a fun book.The Acropolis and Agora were two favorites we were just reading about.<BR>

One day last year my then-four-year-old daughter and me were discussing birthdays.  She thinks it is so special that she was born on her daddy's birthday, and she loves to hear me retell the story of her birth.  I told her "I couldn't decide what to buy daddy for his birthday so I had you," to which she replied "But Mom you didn't wrap me - I was born naked!"   Then in a split second she added "I know, God made you my special wrapping paper!" (It did feel like I was being ripped open!!)<BR>

One of the six finalist in the Microsoft "Imagine the Magic Contest" was a homeschooler from Florida!   He is a six year old and won for his idea regarding a computer which could make food you hate taste like food you love!  He will be getting a Gateway computer, one will be donated with software to a local library (normally this would have gone to the public school he went to) and he had a personal meeting with Bill Gates!!!!!<p>

I am so tickled about this!!! I don't know if this little chap heard about it here or from his local school, but WAY TO GO!<br>

<font color=#00CC00><b>LAW CHANGES IN SOUTH CAROLINA</b></font><p>

I have news from South Carolina -- our NEW law (passed just weeks ago) allows for legal status to be granted homeschool families by joining ANY association that meets state law criteria.  Formerly, legal status was granted granted by belonging to one approved association, SCHAIS (now South Carolina Association for Independent Home Schools:  SCAIHS). [Editor's note: SC families can also legally homeschool through their local school district. In some counties, chartering as a private school is also a legal option.] This new law allows for formation of associations that may be inclusive, as well as more affordable.  The ONLY information that must be released to the state now is the number and grades of the children in your family being homeschooled, and your public school district number.  Before now, SCAIHS wanted the names of your children, birthdates, and even a picture of the family.  This new law may allow many "underground" homeschoolers to gain legal status, since they may join associations that charge much reduced fees, and also may be granted legal status without revealing personal demographic data.  Additionally, no mandatory testing is required (as was required by SCAIHS).  [Editor's note: If homeschooling through the school districts or SCAIHS, children in grades 3-12 must be tested yearly.  No required testing for children in grades K-2.]<br>

<font color=#00CC00><b>National Women's History Project offers Free Catalog</b></font><p>

Got a great catalog. It is the National Women's History Project's catalog.  It is in celebration of the 75th Anniversary of Women's Suffrage. Filled with books, posters, banners, speeches, games, coloring books, t-shirts, vidoes & films, etc...  Covers a wide array of subjects related to women and their lives: heritage, work, biographies, careers, etc....  About a third of all the offerings were developed by the project.

Following Christine's recommendation, I too got the catalog.  It lists August 26 as Women's Equality Day, and has lots of great stuff, including a kit (designed for classrooms) about the history of quiltmaking.  This is a really interesting catalog--even just reading the catalog itself is educational and inspiring.  There are two collections of folktales which feature girls instead of boys as main characters.  They're not modern revisions, but traditional stories from various cultures.<br>

Although all persons are certainly welcome to join, and  individual differences will be respected...encouragement will often be from a Christian perspective and will include Biblical references.<p>

They come, their noses twitching fast, and I will stand until the last. <br>

It has links for curricula, fun things to do for kids, and great places to visit. <p>
 
I make a point of visiting the sites myself and adding my personal touch to moving about the web. We have a weekly newsletter and a listing of homeschoolers and their website called the Homeschooling Yellow Pages. <p>

Hello homeschoolers! :-)<P>

First, a little background about our forum and how it fits into AOL's structure.  AOL is the system, and on the system there are what AOL refers to as Channels.  Some of you may see the listing of channels on your main screen when you sign onto AOL.  The channels are really kind of subject-area breakdowns, and have names like Entertainment, Health & Fitness, Travel, etc.  The channel we "live" in is Learning & Culture.  If you click on the Learning & Culture channel on the channel screen, you get a screen with lists of that channel's subject matter, so to speak.  Those are further broken down into *areas*.  From the Learning & Culture screen, you'd choose, Educators, which would take you to the screen for Educators' Network.  From there, we are broken down into areas.  Our area is called Families, and can be accessed via keyword: Families, or following the path we've been taking thus far to reach the Homeschool Connection, at the Educators' Network you would choose Families' Education from the listbox.  This takes you to the Education section of the Families area, and from that list, you would choose Home Schooling Forum.  At this point, you'd see our "new screen" which has our About this Forum message, as well as links to the Home Ed. Resource Center, Lesson Plan Libraries, and our other favorite homeschooling forums, Home Education Magazine's forum and Practical Homeschooling's forum.  Homeschool Connection's message board can be accessed by clicking on the Message Boards bar, and the Homeschooling Library can be accessed by clicking on the Forum Libraries bar.<P>

Totally confused?  You are not alone.  There are actually many ways to reach our forum, but in some instances you will currently see a different screen for some than for others.  The reason for this is fairly simple.  AOL Families, our parent area, has been undergoing a facelift, and is really looking nice, but in the interim, there are changes to which we must adjust.  Below, I am going to list some of the available paths to our area.  As I said, sometimes you'll see a different "front screen" for our forum, but the forum itself is the same.  Soon, we hope, all paths will eventually lead to the same screen.  Should you ever have trouble finding us, or finding something you used to be able to put your finger right on, please e-mail Journey100 or myself (MyCamelot) and we will be very happy to help you locate it.<P>

In the end, what we'll have is a lovely, updated forum....and that's something we all want. In the meantime, you might find some other interesting area or forum you never knew existed.  So, try to enjoy the changes. :-)<P>

                 <CENTER>--Jeri (MyCamelot) - Homeschool Connection Co-host</CENTER><P>

stories and activities that support the stories. A myth is written in a brief fashion on one page. On the next there is a cartoon-like drawing depicting the same myth. Under each box is a short sentence, written in Latin, detailing what is presented in the picture with space for translating. A vocabulary box at the bottom of the page offers all the relevant words for help in the decoding. The next 2 pages, then, are filled with activities supporting some aspect of Latin learning: culture, vocabulary, history, etc...  Projects might include making a diorama, matching English to Latin vocabulary words or reading additional materials about the history of the Roman Empire. This is a great introduction to learning Latin for parents and children alike!<BR>

This is for all of you who, like me, get very bothered by the summer heat and humidity.... My seven recently got me a postcard with a sailboat on it whose sails change color to predict the weather. It is called a hygroscope. You have probably seen them. Well, Ethan was looking at it one day and said "Mom, the sail is Pink. That means a chance of rain and high HUMILITY." (Humidity and Humility sure do go hand in hand now don't they?)<BR>

If there were a prize for contrariness, I think my daughter would win it.  Jackson was reading to Sarah (2 1/2) a few days ago when he came to a book with a really big S in the title.  He said, "Ooh Sarah!  I see a really big squiggly S like in your name.  Do you see it?"  She thought for a second, pointed to the S (the only one on the page) and said, "Well, it's not THAT one."  Yes it is.  No it's not.  Yes it is.  No it's not.....  Gets Jackson in a tizzy every time and she loves every minute of it.  <BR>
     Sarah will not put up with being questioned.  She knows the colors, even nuances like violet, rose, blue-green, tan, etc., but if anyone tests her, she'll deliberately give the wrong answer, smile, and cheerfully insist they're wrong if they try to correct her.  I have to admit this makes me laugh, since I hate it when people quiz my kids just to see what they know, but I can see how it could begin to make her conversations with my in-laws rather painful. They've already asked about IQ testing. :::groan:::<BR>

<FONT COLOR="B1031C"> <B>ADVENTURES WITH FRIENDS AND RELATIVES</B></FONT><P>

My wife and I "unschool" our 5 kids.  Last year the 3 oldest went to a highly regarded private (parochial) school, and we carpooled with neighbors whose kids still go there.  Recently seen taped to the fridge of our neighbors' house:  a "No Homework Certificate" from Johnny's teacher, stating in essence that "I am so proud of Johnny, he did certain things in class, so he has been awarded a day off from homework!"  So, Johnny, now you understand that "homework" really has no inherent value at all becaue if you are "good" you don't have to do it for a day.  What is wrong with this picture?<BR>
     I cannot recall any time when the subject of homeschooling comes up, that the person I'm talking to doesn't say something like, "Wow, I could never do that"  or "My wife and I would go crazy" etc.  I.e., they immediately personalize the issue as though I were challenging them or the way they're educating their kids, which I don't do.  Has anyone else experienced this? <BR>
     Just last week while on vacation in Nova Scotia, when the subject came up with relatives who had all the typical questions about the sanity of home education, one of my cousins said he recalled a kid in 10th grade who insisted on being pulled out of school so he could focus on competitive swimming.  HiIs father agreed and homeschooled him.  "We then heard about him many years later," my cousin continued, "when he won a Rhodes scholarship from Indiana University." <BR>

<FONT COLOR="B1031C"> <B>_EVERYTHING IS SOMEWHERE:  The Geography Quiz Book</B></FONT><BR>
         Book review and excerpt submitted by Susan (Strandbe)<P>

When David Helgren passed out a short quiz to 128 students in his introductory geography classes at the University of Miami, the incredible results were the inspiration for _Everything is Somewhere, The Geography Quiz Book_.  More than a third (*college* students!!) did not know where France was, almost a third couldn't find the Pacific Ocean and a fifth could not locate New York City.  About 7 percent, "...with palm trees outside the door and a pencil in their hands," could not find Miami on the map on their desks.<BR>
     This is a great book for those who secretly like taking tests.    It comes complete with all the answers following each chapter, which makes it a fun book to pass around the dinner table or bring out at a party.  The first few chapters ask questions about the earth ("Geography" comes from the Greek word for earth: geo"), such as landforms, climate, plants and animals; subsequent chapters deal with people, language and world regions.  The book ends with "Maps of the Spirit", "a section of questions about places that exist, if they exist at all, at least partly in the human--or some other--mind, or take their significance from the way they are seen, felt, experienced or understood by people, or by cats, or by God, or something."<BR>
     This book is a treat.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="B1031C"> <B>UNSCHOOLING--CONFIDENCE IN THE CHILD</B></FONT><P>

We have always believed in unschooling as our method of homeschooling.  Being somewhat new, we have constantly faced the uncertainty of it all.  "Will he ever learn to read without phonics workbooks?"  "How will he learn math without paper and pencil?", etc.   Well, we have good news for you fellow pessimists.<BR>
     Our soon to be eight year old IS learning to read on his own, in his own time. He is even trying to write signs and notes.  Occasionally he writes short stories. He constantly calls out what he thinks the words on signs and packaging mean.  He voluntarily picks up a book and looks through it (and I believe he reads it).  The interest is definitely there and he takes pride in trying.<BR>
     Math is just an extension of his desire to learn things in general and spend money in particular. He constantly looks for things to spend money on. The problem for him of course is how to pay for this obsession, hence his ability to handle money. Once when friends were over, they were arguing about changing the point system for the dart game they were playing. When I noticed they were stumbling over how to count by 25's (they insisted that the center be worth 100), I looked at my son and mentioned the similarity of 100 pts. to $1.00.   A light went on and he jumped up with a solution.<BR>
     He has stumbled over subtraction, still stumbles over reading and until recently stumbled when skipping rope.  I think they are equally important in his eyes.  They are conquered when, and if, he feels able and ready to confront the issue at hand.  And that is the message.  Unschooling is about the learner.  It is their time table, their problem and their victory.  Forget the schedules, use the workbooks if requested, but always look to life as the best teacher.  It is such a relief to have our beliefs confirmed.  I hope everyone in a similar situation can relax and  watch the magic.<BR>

<FONT COLOR="B1031C"> <B>WHAT OUR KIDS REALLY NEED TO LEARN</B></FONT><P>

My daughter and I were amused by this bit in a flyer for a local dance class for children.<BR>
     "Both boys and girls learn important physical skills (skips, leaps, gallops, etc.), social skills (waiting your turn, respect for teachers, etc.)...."
     Hey!  is THAT what they mean by "socialization?"  Next time someone asks me,  I think I'll answer,  "They already know how to stand in line and are already respectful of others,  not just teachers."<BR>
     In my daughter's soccer camp,  she was one of the better ones at "making a circle" and "lining up"!  And a homeschooling boy we know who went to school was amazed at how much time in school was spent lining up.   Seems like homeschooling might not only win out in the academics,  but in the "standing in line" skills, too!<BR>
                                          <CENTER> --Naniha</CENTER><P>

At my son's tenth birthday party there were twenty kids, mostly homeschoolers.  Without being asked or told, they lined up to get ice cream.   They were very serious and careful about that line, and the parents were trying not to laugh.  "HOW will our kids learn to stand in line!?" I asked the other moms. <BR>
     A few weeks later I went to renew my driver's license.   I went 25 minutes before the office opened to find a dozen people waiting already.   "Do you have a plan, or do we just mob them?" I asked an older couple.  They smiled and said, "We'll just mob them."   When the doors opened there were about forty people and we flowed politely into a line, nobody whined or complained.  I was #25 and we were all out within half an hour.   Had it been England, we'd have been jealously guarding our places in the queue.   <BR>
     Perhaps lining up isn't the major life-skill it's sometimes made out to be.  <BR>

My two children (11 & 13) and I attended a gathering of a fledgling homeschool activity group where most of the children have just been taken out of the public schools.  The newbies behaved deplorably--pushing, shoving, jumping on furniture, whining, talking out of turn, etc, etc.  On the way home, my daughter (her 5th yr. in hsing) asked, "Mom, was that socialization?"<br>
     I answered, "Well, I guess so, why?"  <br>
     Her reply, "I think I'd rather not (pause) and Mom, thanks for being so strict.  I'm glad you taught us to behave--at least other people don't hate us."     Sad and funny!<br>

As we got packed up and were preparing to leave we were staying in a hotel for a week ( all our furniture went into storage so our house could be rented so no beds to sleep in). Jay was really unhappy about moving and the second morning got up really grumpy.  We asked him what was wrong and he replied, "I got up on the wrong bed." <br>

<i>Concerning a homeschooled girl who chose school:) </i><br>
The experience of homeschooling our daughter is greatly treasured.... I just sent my daughter off to school with a prayer and scripture reading.  She had become independent enough to choose this activity for herself and knows it is possible for her to learn on her own.  I am eager to hear of her adventures today.<br>

<i>(Concerning one who wanted school but ended up home and happy:) </i><br>
My son, Aaron, is 11 1/2. Last year, he wanted to apply to our Catholic school for the sixth grade (It was full).  Well, happy to say :+) he will be with us this following year.  I felt bad for him, but was happy for the rest of us.  I always thought that maybe he was just saying it was ok to please me.<p>
     On the way home from the beach Friday, he turned to me and said, "This girl that we met at the beach said that they have to do blah blah blah at school.  She thinks that we are lucky to be homeschooled, and you know what?  I agree."<p>
     Brightened my day!!! He is at that independent age and I thought being around me was getting to him, but not by a long shot.... Aren't we all lucky to have a chance to share our lives like this with our kids?!!!!<br>

<i>(Concerning one who went to school and came home again:) </i><br>
I wrote about my seventh grader going back to school about a month ago.  Well in three weeks he is home.  He hated it.  Tons of stupid homework, language that you would hear in a local bar, teasing, ridicule, and basically we saw a confident happy child turn into a wet wilted noodle in three weeks.  The school work was easy, he had all A's, but it was so stupid.  They spent over a week on the articles of confederation.  I explained everything he needs to know in ten minutes.  He is home for good.  The whole family is happy, and if I ever had any doubt that unschooling works, I know now that not only does it work, but it is the only way to really learn anything in the long term.  Just a thought from a happy mom. <br>

<font color = "FF0000"><b>STRUCTURED to ECLECTIC to COLLEGE</b></font><p>

Maybe this will encourage someone who wonders if her child will be accepted into college or handle life on campus well.<p>
     We recently drove Michael, who just turned 18 in August, up to college in Michigan.  I have family up there so we combined the trip with a visit to my old stomping grounds.<p>  
     Michael has been home-schooled all his life.  We started out, in first grade, with a fairly structured program under the umbrella of a local private school.  By the time he was middle-school aged we had used a variety of curriculae and programs but the eclectic approach seemed to work the best for us.  From Alpha-Omega Lifepacs to Rod and Staff to ABeka to Bob Jones to McGuffey Readers to secondhand German textbooks borrowed from his swim coach . . . we did it all!  For two years we were enrolled with Christian Liberty Academy's home school program because we were getting a little nervous about high school approaching and wondering about records, transcripts, and credits.  We realized that we were doing just fine and eventually had contact with families who had used their own records to format a high school transcript.  <p>
      Michael took the SAT twice:  once at the end of 10th grade and once again a year later.  He did above average both times but had a better score the second time.  By this time we had loosened up quite a bit in our approach to the school day.  Though not quite "unschoolers," Michael and his younger brother had more time to read on their own, enjoy Scouts and swim team, as well as start a band.  Michael helped out during his eighth grade year at a local public elementary school as a classroom assistant and tutor.  He also earned the rank of Eagle Scout at the age of 14.  He volunteered the spring of his sophomore year at a local newspaper office and the next fall secured a part time job as a page at a branch of the Dallas Public Library.  The following spring he went through life guard training and worked as a life guard and swim instructor at an area YMCA.  He took some time off last summer to travel to Europe with members of his Explorer Post.  (The 18th World Scout Jamboree was held in the Netherlands in August of 1995.)  His senior year he worked as a lifeguard at the Park Cities YMCA.  School work consisted mostly of college and scholarship research, application and essay writing, and correspondence with the four colleges he applied to.  (He graduated in May with a 3.35 average and participated in a special ceremony with other Metroplex area home school grads.)  All four schools accepted him and offered him scholarships.  He chose Hillsdale College in southern Michigan; a small private school which takes no assistance from the federal government.  <p>
       Hillsdale is a liberal arts school with a conservative campus.  Though not affiliated with any denomination, it was started in 1841 by Freewill Baptists.  Over 400 students signed up for a Bible study this semester!  There are about a dozen home schooled students in the freshman class.  Thirty-six different states and eight foreign countries are represented in the make-up of the Hillsdale graduating class of 2000.  Before I turn this report into a commercial for the school, let me just add that Hillsdale is not concerned about being "PC" (politically correct).  They weren't in the 1840's and 50's either when they graduated the first African-American man in the country to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree and the 2nd woman in the US ever to be awarded the same!   <p>
      He is now settled in his dorm and doing very well with his studies thus far.  He has made several friends and is even getting along with his roommate!  His hall is "men only" and all the guys on his floor share a bathroom.  We've heard no complaints about that or the food!  I am still getting over the fact that he passed his German placement test and got to skip first semester German.  (His two years studying the language with me here at home were not sequential and I didn't think he'd retained much at all!)  He has e-mailed me in German and says that this semester will be mostly conversational.  The professor speaks it in class and expects the students to answer in the same manner!  (Sehr gut, nicht wahr?)  He is also taking World History, English Literature, Philosophy and Theatre Production.   Last week he marvelled at how several of his teachers had tied their subjects to the Bible.  In English his first paper was on Ecclesiastes ("And a time for every purpose under heaven"); a philosophy class was somehow related to Scripture; I was encouraged and pleased.  He has a lot of reading and studying to do but at one point last week had read on ahead in his philosophy text. <p> 
       Michael seems to be choosing his friends well, finding those who have things in common with him.  He's enjoying rollerblading, practicing his bass guitar, writing letters, having other students over to listen to "Starflyer 59," "Plankeye," or "Morella's Forest," or watching "The Princess Bride" while eating pizza and drinking coffee.  He has followed up on at least one invitation to visit a local church, and is looking forward to attending a concert with a group of students next month.  He is doing laundry and budgeting his expenditures carefully.  He is starting his on-campus job soon which is (what else?) lifeguarding.  <p>
       We are starting to miss him around home.  Ninth-grader Daniel will be hitting the books (and computer) next week and it will seem strange to just have one here.  Grandma and Grandpa will see him at Thanksgiving but we plan to fly him home for the longer Christmas holiday.   He has only called a couple of times and we've refrained from calling him too often.  Each time he has sounded upbeat and positive about campus life, his classes, and the whole college experience there at Hillsdale.   Time will tell as he works toward his "undecided" major but he's off to a very good start!<p>
     A few notes:  Neither my husband nor I graduated from college.  Like many homeschooling families, we don't have a lot of money.   We are a one-income family and live in a small house in an older part of Dallas.  Michael was awarded a half tuition scholarship as well as a grant from the school.  He will also have some loan money to pay back in the next 15 years!   We live from paycheck to paycheck and homeschool one year at a time, but we trust in the Lord and know that he has a plan for Michael and for all of us!  We are excited to see what He will accomplish through Michael in the years to come!<br>

<font color = "FF0000"><b>HOMESCHOOLING:  NOT JUST FOR KIDS ANYMORE!</b></font><p>

I just have to tell you about the latest twist in the "you NEVER know where home schooling can lead" story.<p>
      My daughter, after two years of home schooling, voluntarily decided to return to public school.   At the same time, my wife, who had been the teacher, now begins "distance learning" to become a naturapathic doctor, in this case a Naparapath, which is a perfect combination of correspondence classes and hands on training after the classes for the practical experience in a local doctor's office.  I will be seeking training in Cambridge, MA for massage therapy.  Together, we will have our family business, a holistic health practice, with me running the computers and massage, and my wife having the intellectual side with the herbal remedies and both of us helping others to heal their souls.  Our daughter will be able to join us as a receptionist at first and later maybe as a doctor herself.  Neat, Huh?<br>
<center>                   --Dave T. and family (JHC INC) </center><p>

I (all by myself) upgraded my modem. I know some people would say "Oh, that is easy."  Let me tell you, one second it works and the next time..... It has been a stressful week.  Everytime I pushed that button, I expected my computer to BLOW UP. <GGG>  Now, I see the error that I was making and can't help thinking "Why didn't I think of this sooner?"   But, finally, I DID it ALL BY MYSELF.  <p>
      Guess you could say I homeschooled myself on technical computer stuff.  (pat on the back  :)))) <br>

The Catholic Encyclopedia is a fifteen-volume encyclopedia covering a broad range of topics, secular and religious, from a Catholic perspective. The version being used for this project was published in1913. (Individual volumes may bear dates ranging from 1907-1914, but it's all the same version.)<br>

<font color = "FF0000"><b>McIBURTON'S ADVENTURES IN YUGOSLAVIA</b></font><p>

Belgrade: 50% unemployment, everyone (some exaggeration here) drives a Yugo (remember them? Yugo short for Yugoslavia, I never knew that).  AOL now has local internet access in a server called EU Net.  I suppose I shouldn't be surprised but somehow having such poverty in this country with internet access seems incongruous.  There aren't any other servers (eg. AOL, Compuserve) in Belgrade but the government is really trying to get businesses to come and invest here and there's alot to gain by doing that.<p>
<< What did you take with you in the way of toys and books (kid-stuff/"school" stuff)?>><br>
     Everything. Really, we took everything except the furniture.  And some additional food and "consummables" that can't be had for love or money here like automatic dishwashing detergent (not that we have a dishwasher,but we brought the stuff in anticipation of having one since part of the job involves entertaining Serbs for business), shampoo, conditioner. they have no produce in the winter except cabbage, potatoes, onions and stuff that comes locally.<p>
     We bought a film, "A Year in Provence", which is the true story of a couple who quit their jobs and go to live in the south of France and they find adjusting a little difficult.  Jay and Patsy and I started watching it and after the first hour they said, "They're like us," so we're watching it again to check out how they adjust.  It's a good story (4 1/2 hours).<p>
     No recycling here but Gypsies go through the trash and they pull out cans, glass, heavy paper, cardboard to recycle. I guess they sell it to the companies that use those materials. Greg is presently working with an American firm which will supply Serbia with a device that will sort through trash and get the glass, cans, aluminum, etc, if they have money.  The interesting thing here to me is how will that affect the gypsies.<br>

Re the largest McDonalds in the world.  There are two big ones on Guam - we've been to both.  We lived on Guam for seven years and spent a lot of time at them both!  The largest is in the village of Harmon on Rt 16 and is two stories and totally smoke free!  The first largest is in Tamuning and has two big party rooms and space enough for, oh, about 70 people to sit and dine.  <br>
     As if you ever really wanted to know! <br>

<CENTER><H2>Dolls & Dreams
</H2></CENTER>
<P>
Childhood has a glow, when children are allowed to fill their playtime with noble thoughts. 
Brave knights and kind ladies . . . comforting grandmas and patient grandpas . . . 
a lovely dollhouse to decorate and redecorate . . . darling baby dolls to cuddle and tuck into bed. 
These beloved childhood toys inspire children to love what is good and worthy, and to 
aspire to grow up wise and good. A gentle refuge from our overstimulated modern world.<P>

<IMG SRC="DollHouse.gif" ALIGN=left><B>Pine Country Cottage, $99</B>
This dreamy dollhouse is built to take a lot of rugged play. Handcrafted from solid pine, 
ours has stood up to several years of play in our house, where our nine rough-'n-tumble 
children have already broken several less-durable dollhouses to flinders. Buttery-soft 
wood, natural finish, a romantic play environment for years of treasured memories. 16" high 
x 19" wide x 13" deep. <B>#PCC</B><BR CLEAR="left"><P>

<IMG SRC="MedFurn.gif" ALIGN=left>
<B>Pine Table and Chair Set, $25</B><BR>
Small dolls enjoy a spot of 
tea and conversation around 
this natural wood table. <B>#PTC<BR CLEAR="left"><P>

<IMG SRC="DollFurn.gif" ALIGN=left>Pine Doll Bed, $49, #PDB<BR>
Pine Doll Couch, $49, #PDC<BR>
Pine Doll Armchair, $39, #PDA</B><BR>
The perfect size for your "American Girls" or other 16" dolls. Handcrafted solid pine 
with a natural wood finish, and romantic tree shapes in the headboard and backs. Made of 
chunky doll-sized logs, very strong. 20" x 12" x 10".<P>

<B>Mattress & Pillow, $19, #DMP<BR>
Couch Cushion, $9.50, #DCC<BR>
Armchair Cushion, $7.50, #DAC</B><BR>
100 percent cotton stuffed with real feathers. Print fabric. Machine washable. <P>
<B>Pine Doll Wardrobe, $79, #PDW<BR>
Closet Hangers (pkg of 6), $6.50, #CH</B><BR>
Ample storage for treasured doll clothes in this 19" x 11" x 11" wardrobe! Wooden tree-shaped 
cutouts in door, so you can look into closet. Rod for hangers, and a bottom drawer. </DL><P>

<IMG SRC="FingPupp.gif" ALIGN=left><B>Old World Finger Puppet Kits, $15 each. Two puppets per kit.</B><BR>
We have found that finger puppets are ideal toys. They are small enough to live in houses made of blocks, or 
in our own Pine Country Cottage. Compared to full-size dolls, they are inexpensive, and without that nasty 
plastic smell. And now you can make your own beautiful finger puppets. Children prefer the Middle Ages of 
knights and damsels, and that's what you get. Each kit includes everything you need to make two character 
puppets, finished size 4" tall. <BR>Take your pick of the 
<B>King & Queen set (#FPKQ),<BR>
Prince & Princess set (#FPPP),<BR>
Knight & Dragon set (#FPKD),</B>
or collect them all!<BR>
Children ages 9 and up can make these dolls themselves. Adult assistance suggested for
younger children.<P>

<IMG SRC="HandPupp.gif" ALIGN=left><B>Old World Hand Puppet Kits, $19 each, except Baby, $7.50.</B><BR>
One puppet per kit.<BR>
<B>SAVE! Complete set of hand puppets, $99.</B><BR>
While finger puppets like to live in little worlds your child makes for them, hand puppets love the 
spotlight! You can put on complete plays with this cast of charming Old World characters, or just enjoy 
traditional "doll play." Kits come with everything you need: instruction booklet and patterns, wooden 
finger holder, wool stuffing, natural fiber fabrics, embroidery floss, and yarn for the doll's hair. 
Adult puppets, 10". Child puppet, 8". Baby puppet, 5".<BR>
<B>Grandpa (#HPGP), Grandma (#HPGM),  Mamma (#HPM), Poppa (#HPP), Child (#HPC), Baby (#HPB). Complete set (all 6 puppets), #HPX.</B><P>

    "Is your life low on
FUN, 
long on HOMEWORK
and HOUSEWORK?
    "Then you're like I used to be . . . before I discovered 
the joy of 
Juggling!"

Juggling can . . .<P>
<UL>
<LI>Unwind those tense nerves!<BR>
<LI>Increase your physical dexterity!<BR>
<LI>Improve your upper body strength and lung capacity!<BR>
<LI>Unlock "mental blocks" that interfere with those great grades Mom and Dad expect of you!<BR>
<LI>Make you COOL and POPULAR!<P>
</UL>

Juggling is the ideal homeschool sport. Just consider the alternatives. Can you play hockey, 
baseball, or basketball in your living room? Can you become an accomplished figure skater 
or skier for just pennies a day? Can you play polo or rugby in front of cheering crowds 
without having to buy a whole wardrobe of fancy shirts? And when times are tough, have you 
ever seen someone throwing a football back and forth on a street corner, with a hat on the 
ground beside him, and people throwing money into the hat? <P>

All ages can juggle alone or in teams. Unlike tiddlywinks, juggling is real cardiovascular 
exercise, too. Even kids with one hand and adults in wheelchairs can juggle! <P>

"I know what you're saying. ÔI can't learn to juggle. It's too hard.' <BR>
"Go ahead, let everyone else keep thinking that. They'll be amazed by your skills. Now 
I'm going to tell you the secret of learning to juggle. . . ."<P>

You start with <B>colorful scarves</B>. Regular scarves won't doÑyou need our special light, rip-resistant 
Juggling Scarves. They float in the air when you toss them, so you learn to juggle in slow motion. 
<B>#JSC, just $9 for a set of three scarves and instructions</B>.<P>

Next, you need our <B>Juggling Step-by-Step video</B>. Produced by award-winning juggling instructor Dave 
Finnegan, this two-hour VHS tape takes you from scarf juggling, to balls and beanbags, rings, clubs, 
rhythm sticks, diabolos, and even flaming torches! It's like one full year of personal juggling 
instruction! This video was a steal at <B>$49.</B> Now it's an even better deal at just $29. Dave sold his 
juggling company, and we don't know how long this tape will be available, so order NOW to avoid 
disappointment. <B>#JLV</B><P>

We know you're anxious to start "real" juggling with beanbags or balls. <B>Our Fancy European Beanballs</B> 
give you the best of both worlds. Super tough skin, glowing colors, perfect spheres that fly through 
the air with the greatest of ease. To squeeze them is to love them. <B>$19 for a set of 3</B>. Let us choose 
the colors for you. <B>#JBB</B><P>

You'll be ready to "join the clubs" sooner than you think with our <B>Soft & Safe Clubs!</B> Perfectly weighted 
and pretty, too! <B>$35 for a set of 3. #JCL</B><P>

SAVE with these special deals: <B>Juggling Starter Kit</B> includes scarves, video, and beanballs, <B>#JSK, $55</B>. 
<B>Deluxe Kit</B> has it all: scarves, video, beanballs, AND clubs, <B>#JDK, $89</B>.<P>

Terrific birthday giftsÑa lifetime of fun and exercise for just pennies a day!<P>

<CENTER><H1>Walt Morey Books</H1></CENTER>
People ask us all the time, "How can I get my son or daughter to LIKE reading?" We 
always tell them the same thing: "Get these books!" <P>

If your child really hates to read, start by reading one of these books aloud. Make this 
a daily habit. Be sure to leave the book where he can find it to "sneak a peek" at what 
happens next!<P>
<HR>
Eight books about strong, silent teen boys in the great outdoors -- young men building their 
character in hands-on situations. Honesty, patience, and hard work win in the end. Never 
preachy or "gritty." These wholesome and uplifting books appeal to boys and girls alike. <BR>
<B>$7.95 each</B> (see item codes for individual books), or <B>$59 for all eight books (#WMX).</B><P>

<DT><B>Home Is the North</B>
<DD>15-year-old Brad Nichols is orphaned, helps fish the salmon run, and 
makes a tough journey alone through 60 miles of wilderness. Great characters, like tough ol' 
Stampede Annie, her husband Captain Ed, and George the ex-prizefighter. <B>#HN</B><P>

<DT><B>Scrub Dog of Alaska </B>
<DD>Half-Indian David Martin saves Scrub, gets orphaned, goes to live with 
relatives in Anchorage, and sees a lot of dog races and frontier life. David has run-ins with

<DT><B>Deep Trouble </B>
<DD>My favorite! Joey Bishop's dad dies during a diving accident, and he has to convince

whales. Set during the time just before Alaska became a state. <B>#DT</B><P>

<DT><B>Angry Waters </B>
<DD>15-year-old Dan Mallory is paroled to a dairy farm, learns to appreciate farming, and 
shows his newfound grit when his old thieving buddies break out of prison and threaten his new 
family. <B>#AW</B><P>

<DT><B>Gloomy Gus </B>

<TITLE>Diapers</TITLE>

<BODY BGCOLOR=#FFF3B3>
<H1>Squeezably Soft Diapers</H1>

Hi! I'm Mary Pride. As the mother of nine children, I've tried just about every type of diaper 
over the years. Gauze. Birdseye. Flat. Folded. Padded. Lined. Velcro. Attached covers. You name it!

<H2>None of them satisfied me.</H2>

For one thing, they weren't absorbent enough. I don't know about you, but I'm tired of double- 
and triple-diapering my kids.<P>

For another thing, they weren't durable enough. A good diaper 
should last through baby after baby, not give up the ghost after a few months of laundering.<P>

And they should not require fancy care (ever try cleaning a stool off a diaper with an attached cover? Yuk!).

<H2>The Ultimate Diaper</H2>

As you may have guessed, I finally found what I was looking for. Superabsorbent. 100% cotton. 
So soft they are squeezable! The best diaper services use these diapers. Each contains as much 
cotton as two or even three cheaper diapers, so you don't need as many. These diapers are easy to 
use, easy to store, and easy to wash.<P>

And we offer a <B>ONE YEAR WEAR GUARANTEE</B> on every set of diapers 
you buy from us!<P>
Dozen small diapers, <B>#DIPES, $20</B>. Dozen large, <B>#DIPEL, $25</B>.<BR>
Sampler pak of 2 dipes (specify size), <B>$5 (#PAK).</B> Sorry, sampler paks 
are not returnable.

<center><H2><b>We Recommend the Following Web Page Design</b></H2></center><p>
<hr>
<p>
<b>At the top of the page:</b><br>
Your logo, plus your company name, address, phone, and fax numbers. We make this all into a single graphic, thus allowing us to use special fonts for your company name and other info. <p>

<b>For the body of the ad:</b><br>
<ul><li>One or more graphics illustrating your product<br>
<li>Basic sales text explaining the product's benefits and features</ul>
(<b>NOTE</b>: On the Web, layout options are somewhat limited. Also, since some people have slower modems, it's better to have a few small graphics than lots of large ones that take a long time to download)<p>

<b>At the bottom of the ad:</b><br>
A printable order form with spaces for the customer's name, address, phone, credit card information, products ordered, prices, tax, and shipping. Just tell us you want a printable order form, and what your product prices and state sales tax and shipping rates are, and we can set this up. <p>

<b>Optional extras:</b><br>
<ul><li>Additional graphics, audio clips, and video clips, not to exceed 10 items per page or .5 MB per page. (Realistically, this is more than you will ever need, or that anyone will be willing to download!)<br>
<li>Link to your email address (so customers can contact you online).<br>
<li>Links to additional pages on our site, which we will be happy to design for you! These pages can include more products and/or product photos, user testimonials, or whatever you want.</ul>
