<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I talked my doctor into prescribing testosterone for me. I’m taking a 200-mg shot of testosterone enanthate each week. After reading your book
<I>(<A HREF="../bookofrs/roid.html"> Anabolic Reference Guide</A>)</I>, I noticed that it makes sense to use an anti-estrogen compound like Nolvadex along with testosterone injections. I asked my doctor about this, but he’s clueless. Is there any information you might be able to give me that would help him understand the importance of anti-estrogens along with testosterone therapy? Also, do I have to take a shot of testosterone enanthate every single week? Not only is it literally a “pain in the ass” but I have to pay my doctor each time I go in to get a shot. Isn’t there a testosterone that lasts longer?<P></B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> I think it's a good idea to use an anti-estrogen along with testosterone injections, even if you're only taking a "therapeutic dose" of 200 mg a week.<P> 
I used to think Nolvadex was the best anti-estrogen, but I'm now quite confident that a drug called Teslac is much better. Teslac (generic name, testolactone) inhibits the aromatase activity that turns testosterone into various forms of estrogen.<P> 
Even when taking a relatively low dose of testosterone enanthate, some of the testosterone will be converted to estrogen. This leads to such side effects as gynecomastia (swelling of male breast tissue—a very unpleasant side effect from steroid use), and it also causes water retention and can even cause "female-pattern" fat distribution.<P>
Now, the difference between Nolvadex and Teslac is that Nolvadex exhibits its anti-estrogenic effects by competing with estrogen at binding sites in target tissue, such as the breast. Nolvadex does not really do much to prevent the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, which is something Teslac does well.<P>
If you wanted to really fight estrogen's side effects, you could take Teslac (250 mg 4 times a day) and Nolvadex (10 to 20 mg a day). The Teslac would help prevent the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, and the Nolvadex would help keep any circulating estrogen that "snuck past" the Teslac from binding at estrogen sites like the breast.<P>
Teslac may also be an "anti-glucocorticoid"—it may also compete with cortisol-like compounds and be somewhat "anti-catabolic," although this is not known for certain.<P>
Another reason I think Teslac is better than Nolvadex is because using Teslac, along with testosterone, can dramatically increase serum testosterone levels. Let me give you an example—in a recent study where test subjects received 200 mg of testosterone enanthate a week (just like you're taking) and also used 250 mg of Teslac 4 times a day, the testosterone enanthate plus Teslac group had an increase of serum testosterone of 105% versus only 39% when testosterone enanthate was administered, at the same dosage, <I>without</I> Teslac.<P>
This offers evidence to suggest that if you use testosterone with Teslac, you could experience a 300% greater serum testosterone level than if you used testosterone by itself! This could allow you to use a lower dose of testosterone and get <I>much</I> greater effects.<P>
What happened to all that enanthate that didn't show up as serum testosterone in the non-Teslac users? It converted to estrogen! This same study showed that the people who used enanthate only had a 47% increase in serum estradiol levels—there was <I>no</I> increase in serum estradiol levels at all in the testosterone plus Teslac users!<P>
This fascinating study is described in the <I>American Journal of Cardiology</I> (Vol. 77, June 1, 1996 : 1,244). Have your doctor read a copy of this study, and then ask him if he'll prescribe Teslac for you.<P>
Also, you might have him read an article on page 1,179 of that same journal—that study describes how the use of compounds like testosterone enanthate can decrease something called lipoprotein(a), which is a risk factor for heart disease.<P>
Some scientists are proposing that testosterone therapy be used in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) levels to reduce their risk of heart disease! This goes against the current theory that the use of anabolic steroids, including testosterone, only has a negative effect on the risk of coronary-artery disease. Interesting...<P>
Now, to answer your last question, testosterone enanthate is the longest-acting injectable testosterone available in America right now. You could probably get away with taking a shot every 10 to 14 days if taking an injection weekly is really bothersome.<P>
An interesting note related to this is that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) are seeking partners for the further development, evaluation, and commercialization of something called testosterone <I>bucyclate</I>.<P>
This new injectable testosterone was invented and patented in 1980 during a joint NIH-WHO sponsored steroid-synthesis program in which the preparation of selected steroid esters was contracted by WHO and the resulting compounds screened by the Contraceptive Development Branch (CDB) of the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development at its Biological Testing Facility. Chemically, testosterone bucyclate is testosterone 17b-(trans-4-n-butyl) cyclohexyl carboxylate. This ester of the natural hormone, testosterone, exhibits prolonged activity when administered intramuscularly as an aqueous crystalline suspension in all species studied, including man. (You may only have to take a shot of this stuff once every four to six weeks!!)<P>
Basically, what you have here is a government-sponsored and codeveloped long-acting testosterone (finally, our tax dollars being well spent!).<P>
These government organizations are looking for a pharmaceutical company like Searle, Bristol-Myers, Abbott Labs, or some other major player to step in and help fund further research and development on this product.<P>
The primary interest here is using testosterone bucyclate as a birth-control injection for males. Remember, extensive studies in Europe have shown that testosterone therapy (in doses that are definitely sufficient to accelerate muscle growth) is a very safe and effective form of birth control.<P>
I wouldn't be surprised if, within the next three or four years, testosterone bucyclate were available as a form of birth control here in the United States. But, unfortunately for now, testosterone enanthate is probably your best bet.<P>
If I were to use steroids again, any steroids, Deca, Primobolan, testosterone cypionate or enanthate, I would definitely use 1,000 mg (250 mg 4 times a day) of Teslac along with them. 
Unfortunately, even though Teslac is <B>not</B> an anabolic steroid, it was put on Schedule III in 1990, with the Anabolic Steroid Control Act, so it's a bit hard to get.



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> Which do you think is the best insulin potentiator/mimicker: vanadyl sulfate, chromium picolinate, metformin, or phenformin?</B>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> All of the compounds you mentioned have been used by bodybuilders with varying degrees of success. The reason lifters are interested in insulin-mimicking supplements and drugs is because insulin is a powerful anabolic hormone that drives glucose, amino acids, and creatine into muscle tissue.<P>
Chromium picolinate and vanadyl sulfate are both effective under certain conditions. I think vanadyl sulfate probably works better for bodybuilders than chromium picolinate, but I believe chromium works better than vanadyl on people who are extremely overweight (obese). Don't ask me why—it's just an empirical observation. <P>
I would say that out of all the oral insulin mimickers available, metformin is probably the best. This drug is available over the counter in Mexico and with a prescription in the U.S.<P> 
Metformin belongs to a class of drugs called "biguanides" as does phenformin. Both metformin and phenformin increase the transport of glucose (blood sugar) into muscle cells by directly increasing insulin sensitivity. These drugs also inhibit the formation of sugar by the liver.<P>
One of the best things about metformin and phenformin is that they don't typically cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Unfortunately, phenformin has been known to produce a nasty side effect, lactic acidosis. Because of this, phenformin will never be available in the United States.<P>
One hot "steroid-free" stack that I know some natural athletes are using includes taking metformin, creatine monohydrate, and 30 to 50 grams of glucose/simple sugars 3 times a day on an empty stomach, with one serving immediately following a workout. I hear it's awesome!<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I've read that using the supplement OKG can increase nitrogen retention and muscle growth. I'm on a very limited budget, and before I buy any OKG, I thought I'd see what you think of it. Do you think it's worth the money?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> At one time, I was relatively certain that OKG might be a beneficial bodybuilding supplement, but now I really don't think it works.<P> 
I've seen studies that show OKG, when administered to sick or traumatized people, has the ability to prevent losses of nitrogen or body protein. But, for some reason, in bodybuilders, the stuff just doesn't seem to do anything—at least that's what my personal experience and the feedback from <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> readers indicate.<P>
In terms of drug-free products that have an effect on nitrogen retention and muscle growth, I'd have to say that bodybuilding's most popular supplement, creatine monohydrate, is probably as good or better in this regard than anything else out there.<P>
Even though we have extensively discussed creatine's "cell-volumizing" effects and the ability of supplemental creatine to enhance a key energy pathway in muscle tissue, I haven't really discussed creatine's ability to promote nitrogen retention. But it definitely appears that creatine has the potential to spare protein and to increase nitrogen retention in the body. Creatine appears to selectively stimulate the rate of protein synthesis of the two major contractile proteins which make up skeletal muscle—actin and myosin. This has been documented in animal studies in which the animals were fed creatine. These studies show that on a "basal diet" (where calories consumed equal calories burned), animals gained weight and showed a positive nitrogen balance.<P>
Here's something else that's quite interesting—it takes energy for a muscle cell to build itself back up after exercise. Muscle building is an energy-requiring process. And, did you know that studies have shown that 70% of muscle-protein synthesis depends on energy from the phosphocreatine pathway—an energy system that is substantially enhanced when your muscles are holding more creatine? (By the way, the other 30% depends on energy production stimulated by insulin. Could this be why Phosphagen HP, EAS' new creatine supplement that substantially enhances the release of the anabolic hormone insulin at the same time creatine is put into the system, is producing what some call "steroid-like" gains? Humm...)<P>
As I've explained before, I think creatine monohydrate is the number one supplement out—the best drug-free bodybuilding agent that's ever been available. And, I believe it has effects on performance, muscle metabolism, etc. that go far beyond the things we've discussed previously in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. There are a lot of things I think we can still learn about how creatine might positively affect muscle growth, strength, and overall health. (A recent study which is being published in <I>Clinical Science</I> shows creatine supplementation may significantly <I>improve</I> blood-lipid profiles!)<P>
That's why EAS recently signed a deal to fund a $772,000, 3-year research project which will be headed up by Dr. Paul Greenhaff of Nottingham University in England to study creatine use. Over the course of this unprecedented research project, scientists will be examining how creatine affects protein synthesis, proteolysis, nitrogen retention, performance, health, etc.<P>
Anyway, if you're trying to decide which supplements are worth your while and which ones probably aren't, I would highly recommend that you read a copy of my <I><A HREF="../nsr/nsr96.html"> 1996 Supplement Review</A></I>. In that book, I give you the lowdown on almost every supplement available. (You can find out how to get a FREE copy of that book on page 38 of this magazine.)<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I came across a newsletter yesterday that said it was legal to order prescription drugs from other countries as long as you were only ordering a personal supply. Do you know anything about this? Is it possible to get steroids from pharmacies in other countries? </B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> It is indeed possible to order prescription drugs from mail-order houses in other countries. This "loophole" was opened up back in 1988 when AIDS activists (a very powerful political group) forced the FDA to adopt new "guidelines" that made it possible for them to attain prescription drugs from other countries that were not yet approved by the FDA. Their rationale was that the FDA is so slow in approving new drugs in the United States that many AIDS patients would die before the FDA could possibly give the okay to use certain medications that might help in the treatment of AIDS—medications that are available in other countries.<P> 
Anyway, the regulations go something like this—you can order only a 90-day personal supply of any particular medication, and, supposedly, you need to be under the care of a licensed physician in the U.S. who is responsible for your treatment with the product. So, what people have been doing is contacting pharmacies in other countries and having them ship various prescription drugs to them in the United States. It's really quite simple.<P>
Unfortunately, many drugs that bodybuilders use/abuse are on what's called an "import-alert" list. These are drugs that, for one reason or another, the FDA has decided should not be allowed under this importation regulation. This includes all kinds of things—some that don't make any sense. The import-alert list prohibits the importation of certain toothpastes, soaps, supplements, etc., as well as things you might suspect they would prohibit, such as anabolic steroids.<P>
BUT, I've heard quite a few stories about people ordering things like diuretics, beta-agonists, growth hormone, insulin, GHB, DHEA, tryptophan, birth-control pills, antibiotics, ulcer medications, thyroid drugs, cortisol blockers, etc., etc. How customs agents and/or the FDA decide to snag various packages or let them go is really hard to figure out. Since the import-alert lists aren't generally made available to the public, it's difficult to tell what they're watching for and what they're not.<P>
Although some bodybuilders regularly buy from these foreign mail-order pharmacies, the primary patrons in the U.S. who take advantage of these services are AIDS patients and those into "life-extension drugs."<P>
One company that keeps an up-to-date list of foreign pharmacies that will ship orders to people in the U.S. is called Life Enhancement Products. You might try writing to them at P.O. Box 4438, Petaluma, CA 94955, or you can fax them at 707-769-8016. They'll send you a list of reputable foreign mail-order pharmacies.<P>
In addition to a list of legit foreign mail-order pharmacies, they also provide a practitioner referral listing with the names, addresses, and phone numbers of doctors around the world who specialize in life-extension medicine, hormone-replacement therapy, growth-hormone treatment, etc. If you're interested in this type of thing, you might want to check this out.<P>
In the next issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, we're going to have a feature on this whole foreign mail-order pharmacy thing. We'll bring you the latest, up-to-date news, including interviews with customs officials, FDA agents, foreign pharmacies, medical doctors, etc.<P>
We'll fill you in on <B>all</B> the details—like what would happen if a foreign pharmacy did fill your order for clenbuterol, testosterone, etc. Would Federal agents arrest you, simply send your shipment back, or would they just ignore it? The answers will fascinate you! By the way, the next issue of <I>MM2K</I> goes on sale October 1, 1996.



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>Have you ever heard of a steroid called Maxigan? Is it real or counterfeit?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> Maxigan is a veterinarian steroid available in Mexico. It's the same thing as Equipoise, which is relatively similar to Deca-Durabolin, in that it's highly anabolic and only moderately androgenic.<P>
I've never heard of Maxigan being counterfeited, but it's impossible to say for certain with all the clandestine bogus steroid plants out there.<P>
Maxigan costs about $180 U.S. for 100 ml at veterinary-supply shops in Mexico. If you've seen it on the U.S. black market for less than that, it could be a counterfeit.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I was thinking about trying a product called IGF-1A. It's made by Squib Labs, and it's supposed to be better than IGF-1. They quote your magazine in their advertisements, so I've got the feeling this stuff is legit. What do you think?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> IGF-1A is a complete and total scam. This product is distributed by Dexter Sports Supplements.There's no such drug known as IGF-1A nor a drug company by the name of "Squib Labs." The real Squibb Labs uses two "b's" in their name, not one.<P>
In the ads for IGF-1A, they do quote <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, but this is without permission, and the statements we made were about the real IGF-1—not their scam supplement product, which contains no real IGF-1 whatsoever.<P>
This is, without question, a major, major scam! I would not recommend that anyone buy this IGF-1A crap.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> Dan Duchaine and a number of other experts have recently written in your magazine (and others) and stated on audiotape interviews that I've listened to that the concept of cycling steroids (going on and off) doesn't make sense. They don't think cycling has any merit. What do you think?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> I don't agree with Dan on this topic. What I believe Dan is focusing on most when he says that cycling steroids doesn't work is the whole concept of receptor downgrading. Let me explain... A number of steroid experts (including me) have determined that after you have been taking steroids for a while, the receptor sites, which are basically little targets on cells that receive a signal from outside the cell and transfer that signal to the inside of a cell, become downgraded. That is, when you start taking steroids, your muscle cells have a high receptor affinity—they receive and transfer the signal from the steroid molecules very efficiently. However, over a period of time, these receptors downgrade, and they just don't work as well.<P>
Now, one reason I think cycling steroids is a good idea is because it might minimize receptor attenuation or down-regulation. Dan originally agreed with the theory of cycling to try to maximize receptor affinity, but he has more recently become convinced that steroid receptors down-regulate much more quickly (within a matter of weeks, not months) than we originally believed. Thus, Dan feels trying to prevent the inevitable is illogical and ineffective.<P>
If steroid receptors, which cause the muscle cell to increase protein synthesis after receiving the steroid signal, down-regulate rapidly when you start using steroids, it's quite likely that the majority of the positive effects steroids exert on muscle metabolism occur through anti-catabolic/anti-proteolytic means—steroid molecules occupy cortisol (a catabolic hormone that breaks down muscle tissue) receptor sites, so cortisol can't break down muscle tissue.<P>
The truth is, we really don't know <I>exactly</I> how fast steroid receptor sites shut down. But, receptor down-regulation is just <B>one</B> of several reasons I believe steroids should be cycled. Another reason I think you should go on and off steroids has to do with the way these drugs affect your body's ability to naturally produce testosterone. I believe that the longer you stay on steroids, the more screwed up your body's hormone feedback mechanisms get; the continual, long-term use of steroids can almost completely shut down your body's ability to naturally produce testosterone. And I think you can avoid this problem <I>if</I>you "cycle."<P>
Another reason I think cycling is important is because of the potential toxicity involved with using anabolic/androgenic steroids. Quite often, when athletes use oral or even injectable anabolic steroids, their livers have to work overtime to remove various toxins from the blood.<P>
Steroids are definitely not the only drugs that can cause the liver to work a little harder (I've seen simple antibiotics like tetracycline raise certain liver enzyme levels by 300%), but I do believe the longer you stay on steroids, the more likely it is you'll develop some type of liver damage.<P>
Perhaps the most important reason for cycling on and off steroids is to try to minimize psychological dependence on these drugs. I know a lot of bodybuilders who are "hooked" on steroids—not necessarily because the drugs are physiologically addictive but because some guys (and even some gals) get "addicted" to being big and can't stand the thought of going off steroids and losing even a few pounds. This is a very weak "place to be."<P>
So, to summarize, I believe the longer you stay on steroids, the less they're going to work, the greater the side effects will be, the greater your chances for long-term health complications, and the harder it is to "get off," so to speak.<P>
Even if some of the theories or advantages to cycling steroids cannot be validated (like the "receptor issue"), I think, overall, it just makes sense. I still believe the proper use (not abuse) of steroids for improving muscle metabolism and performance and maybe even certain health parameters involves using moderate doses of low-androgenic steroids for cycle periods of 6 to 12 weeks, followed by at least a 6- to 12-week off period before using the drugs again.<P>
I know Dan will probably argue that my beliefs on steroid cycling are "old school" and that today's steroid kamikazes have nothing to gain by going on and off steroids, but I just can't convince myself that's the case.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I read an article by John Romano in another muscle magazine that said Muscle Media 2000 has no credibility. Why would he say that?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> John who?



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I understand that using steroids can shut down the body's production of testosterone. My question and concern pertains to the use of DHEA. I've been using this hormone for a couple of months now, and I think I really do feel better while I'm on it. I'm taking 100 mg a day. My question is, by taking extra DHEA, am I shutting down my body's natural production of DHEA or testosterone?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> That's a good question, and it's one that a lot of people should be asking as there are literally tens of thousands of people who are self-administering DHEA—this stuff is extremely popular with bodybuilders and life extensionists.<P>
You're right—the production of most steroids is controlled by a "feedback loop," which means that when hormone levels get too high, the body is "told" to make less, and when hormone levels are too low, the body is "told" to make more. Cortisol, testosterone, and estrogen are all regulated by this type of feedback loop. In other words, if you take cortisol or a similar derivative such as prednisone, your body may shut off its natural production of cortisol. (By the way, <I>this</I> is an "anti-catabolic theory" that has been overlooked for quite some time—you can read more about this in a new column in the next issue of <I>MM2K</I> called "Notes from the Underground.")<P> 
Anyway, the exogenous use of numerous hormones can cause your body to stop making them. However, DHEA appears to be an exception. According to experts, there does <B>not</B> seem to be a "negative feedback reaction" for DHEA or DHEAS, which is what DHEA becomes when it's metabolized by your body (the S stands for sulfate). In other words, taking a DHEA supplement is not likely to stop your body's own production of DHEA nor testosterone, although no long-term human studies have been conducted to confirm this.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I have been reading your magazine for the past few months, and overall, I really enjoy it, and I've definitely learned some things that have helped my own efforts to build more muscle. But one thing I can't figure out is whether you're for or against the use of drugs. On one hand, you speak very highly of certain supplements and claim that with the proper knowledge and correct training, nutrition, and supplementation program, you can make significant gains naturally, but then you've also written this book on how athletes have used steroids, and you continually discuss how effective these drugs are for building muscle mass. Just exactly where do you stand—are you for or against the use of drugs?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> I stand where I always have—firmly committed to providing the truth. As for whether I am opposed to drugs or in favor of them, I'd have to say I'm in favor of the use of many drugs and am a regular user. I take aspirin if I have a headache; I often consume caffeine early in the day; I take antibiotics if I have a bacterial infection; I take Zantac sometimes when my gut starts acting up; and I even like drugs (preservatives) in my food so it doesn't rot. Make no mistake; I use a lot of drugs. However, I'm not in favor of the use of all drugs. Obviously, certain drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and even alcohol can destroy lives and negatively impact society.<P>
I think what you meant to ask was whether I'm for or against the use of anabolic steroids. That's obviously a different question than whether I'm for or against the use of drugs altogether. (I'll assume you meant to ask whether I'm for or against the use of anabolic steroids by <I>athletes</I>.) Basically, my position on anabolic steroid use is that it's becoming more and more of a problem. Although I do admit that some (very few) athletes are able to use anabolic steroids responsibly, safely, and effectively, most users are taking more risks than could possibly be countered by the gains from using these drugs. Still, I think a steroid user's greatest enemy is <I>mis</I>information, and I strive to provide accurate, honest information that can benefit bodybuilders.<P> 
My interest in drug-free supplements stems from the fact that I'm no longer interested in using steroids. (I used them on and off for several years in the mid-'80's when I was competing in bodybuilding.) Now I'm determined to make gains without steroids.<P>
But, just because I made that decision does not mean I insist everyone else does the same. There are a lot of athletes who are going to use anabolic steroids no matter what I tell them. That decision is theirs to make, not mine.<P>
I remain convinced that if athletes have access to accurate information about steroids, like what the real side effects are, what the positive effects are, and what legal issues go hand in hand with using these drugs, etc., more people will be in a position to make a responsible decision.<P>
I think almost everyone agrees that the <I>ultimate</I> solution would be to identify compounds that are <B>not</B> illegal—things that produce major positive effects on muscle size and strength—things that are even more powerful than creatine, HMB, etc. Then the whole steroid issue would look trivial. <I>If</I> we can ever find something that works as well as steroids that's legal and safe, then the whole topic will be moot.<P>
My knee-jerk reaction is to say that's impossible, but if just a few years ago you told me people would be able to use a natural supplement and make the types of gains people are making with creatine, I would have said you were crazy. I'm skeptical, but I believe it's not at all impossible that something will come along sometime in the future that will make steroids obsolete. Then we can put an end to all this controversy.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> My present goal is to lose ten pounds of bodyfat without losing any muscle mass. I'm pretty bulky, and I think I'd have good definition if I could just get rid of this layer of fat that's covering my muscles. I'm following a high-protein, low-carb, moderately low-fat diet and am consuming less calories than my body burns off each day, but I was wondering if there are any "tricks" you could share with me that would allow me to get better results faster.</B>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> Getting that muscular, "bodybuilder-like" look definitely means having low bodyfat. I know so many guys who have built up good muscle mass over several years by weight training, but they look like crap. Guys have got to be around seven percent bodyfat or lower to have that really cool, muscular, defined, <I>respectable</I> look.<P>
Of course, to get really cut up, you simply must burn more calories than you consume. But, you don't want to go on a super-low-calorie diet; otherwise, you'll sacrifice muscle tissue.<P>
I agree with what you're doing—consuming a high-protein, low-carb, moderately low-fat diet and restricting your calorie intake.<P>
The one tip I think you might want to consider is to try conducting your weight-training exercise or even aerobic exercise immediately after you wake up, after at least a ten-hour fast. When you do this, your body burns up to 200% more stored bodyfat during your exercise session and in the hours afterwards than if you were to exercise in a "fed" state.<P>
This has been documented in several clinical studies, and additional research in this area (which I have access to) will be presented next year which confirms this effect may be even greater than what scientists have speculated.<P>
Here's an example—let's say you eat your last meal at 9:00 p.m. Then you go to bed around 11:00 p.m., get up around 7:00 a.m., and immediately do 45 minutes of exercise. (It doesn't matter if it's weight training or aerobics—your body will burn big quantities of stored bodyfat either way.) Then, right after your workout, have your biggest meal of the day—eat a lot of carbs and protein.<P>
By exercising on an empty stomach, your body will have to dip deep into fat reserves to pull fuel to get you through the workout, and if you have a high-carb, high-protein meal right after you exercise, your muscles will literally suck up amino acids and glucose like a sponge—you can literally watch your muscles swell and get fuller and rounder. Very cool! This works well! Give it a try!<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I'm a 36-year-old male bodybuilder. I've never used steroids, but my doctor says I have a low normal testosterone level. My sex drive is virtually nonexistent. He says I don't need testosterone shots, but it sure would be nice if I had some type of "urge." I heard melatonin is a sex-enhancing hormone. Do you think I should take that?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> I don't think melatonin has any effect on a person's sex drive. The whole thing about melatonin being a "sex enhancer" comes down to this twisted logic: scientists have observed that laboratory animals fed melatonin may live longer. They hypothesize that perhaps the same thing will be true of human beings—that if they use melatonin, they may be able to extend their life spans. If people live longer, they theorize, then they will have more sex. I guess that's probably true—when you're dead, you don't have sex anymore. Well, I guess that's <I>almost</I> always true—there are people called necrophiliacs, but I'll let Duchaine tell you about that...<P>
Anyway, the bottom line is that I <B>don't</B> think melatonin will add any spark to your sex life.
Because you're concerned about this, I recommend that you try to find a doctor who will prescribe testosterone for you. If you "shop around," I think you'll find a cooperative M.D. to prescribe testosterone for this <I>legitimate</I> use. Many people—both men and women—find that an elevation in their testosterone levels does cause an increase in sex drive.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I've read good things about HMB in your magazine, but I also read Muscular Development, and their writers say HMB is not that great. Should I try HMB or not?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> You should decide for yourself what to do. But, keep in mind that <I>Muscular Development</I> is Twin Laboratories' (a supplement company that's in competition with my company) magazine.<P>
If you take a look at all the bodybuilding supplements on the market and compare HMB to them, you'll see there is much, much more "science" behind HMB than there is for the vast majority of so-called "bodybuilding supplements" on the market. I have been following the science behind HMB for quite some time and worked very hard to be the first to bring this product to the market.<P>
HMB is unquestionably the hottest supplement in bodybuilding right now, and in my opinion, it may be the second most effective natural bodybuilding agent you can get. (Creatine is unquestionably number one.)<P>
The writers at <I>Muscular Development</I> have taken it upon themselves to try to convince people that HMB is not an effective product. They accuse our writers of having a financial interest in HMB, which is simply not the case. Dan Duchaine, who has written about the possible benefits of HMB use by bodybuilders on several occasions, has absolutely <I>no</I> financial interest in HMB whatsoever. He gets paid a certain dollar amount to write articles, and that's it. His compensation is <B>not</B> tied to supplements that I sell in any way, shape, or form. Anthony Almada, the Research Director for EAS, has <B>never</B> received a single dollar from HMB sales. Anthony receives the same paycheck every month, whether we sell 10,000 bottles of HMB or none at all. His pay has never been tied to HMB sales.<P>
Since I'm the main distributor of HMB, I do make money off every bottle that's sold, so I obviously have a financial interest in HMB. But, I could have a financial interest in any supplement out there. I could sell virtually any supplement anyone else sells, but I'm involved in the distribution of very few products. That's because I think there are only a few products that are worth using.<P>
Anyway, just keep in mind that <I>Muscular Development</I>/TwinLab have their agenda, and they believe it's in their best interest to do whatever they can to "slam" my reputation and the reputations of other <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> writers, etc. This is called trying to build yourself up by running others down.<P> 
For those of you who read <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> and <I>Muscular Development</I> (there aren't that many, so I won't spend a whole lot of time on this topic), if you believe the "scientific writers" for <I>Muscular Development</I> have no interests in the supplement business, then I have some great land in south Florida you might want to buy!!!<P>
One last note—I have always pushed my "stuff." Everyone who follows my work knows this. I want to sell you my books, supplements, magazines, etc. I think the main difference between what I do and what many other people in this market do is I "push good stuff." I mean, I sell some really good products, <B>and</B> I stand behind anything and everything I sell with an unconditional, lifetime, money-back guarantee! Who else does that in this industry? No one! If you (or anyone else) buy something from me and you don't like it, I'll refund your money. Needless to say, the only way I make a profit is by satisfying my customers, and that means selling <I>good stuff</I>! Makes sense... huh?



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>A guy at a health-food store I shop at told me the best way to supplement DHEA is by using wild yam extracts. Is this true?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> DHEA is made commercially from a plant of the Dioscorea family (wild yams) found in abundance in Mexico. Extracts of this plant contain a steroidal saponin which may be converted in a laboratory, by a series of six to eight chemical reactions, into DHEA. A comparable series of reactions is not known to exist in nature and certainly not in the human body.<P>
Consequently, it's very unlikely and, in my opinion, impossible, for the ingestion of extracts of the Dioscorea plant (or wild yams) to lead to the formation, by metabolic transformation of the relevant plant constituent, to DHEA.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> Bill, I love your magazine. I really think it's got the best information out there, but I sometimes get tired of reading information about the same old supplements—creatine, HMB, CLA, whey protein, etc., etc. I already know these products are good. Why do I have to read about them in every issue? Why don't you write about new supplements in each issue? And why don't you ever plug products you don't sell?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> Thanks for your positive comments. Unfortunately, new, worthwhile, exciting bodybuilding supplements only come along once in a while. There is not a new supplement discovery to write about in each issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. I'm sure you can understand that.<P>
I definitely see what you're saying—we have discussed creatine, whey protein, HMB, CLA, and such, in many issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. But, the reason we answer so many questions about these products in the magazine is because we literally get <B>hundreds and hundreds</B> of questions about these supplements. Even though some readers like yourself already know everything you care to know about these products, other people apparently don't learn as quickly as you do, or they simply want to know more about these products. And, there are new studies coming out regularly about these "same old products." I'm convinced creatine works, and I'm going to take 10 to 20 grams of this stuff a day regardless of whether I read anything exciting about it this month in the muscle magazines, and I'm sure you're the same way. But, if a new study comes out showing creatine may reduce certain risks of heart disease (which recently happened), I think that's worthy of reporting in the magazine—it's newsworthy.<P>
We definitely keep our eye out for anything new and interesting in the supplement field, and we don't focus exclusively on products I sell. For example, there's been quite a lot of news about DHEA in the past six issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. I have <B>no</B> financial interest in DHEA whatsoever—I just think it's newsworthy. It's an interesting compound.<P>
In this issue of the magazine, Dan Duchaine talks about how using various "Yohimbine-containing supplements" may help reduce bodyfat. I don't sell any Yohimbine-containing supplements and don't plan to. As a matter of fact, we gave a great plug for TwinLab (a company we're in fierce competition with), but that's cool. (Geez... I otta be about due for a "return favor" plug from Twinlab/<I>Muscular Development</I>—don't ya think? All they ever do is slam other companies' supplements. Their negativity gets old fast. Can you say "insecurity"?)<P>
In recent issues, we've talked about the possible benefits of using melatonin. I don't sell melatonin and don't plan to. We also regularly plug products like Next Nutrition's Designer Protein and TwinLab's Ripped Fuel—both are products I have no financial interest in.<P> 
I think when you look at the "big picture," you'll see that in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, we recommend quite a number of different products that we don't have any financial interest in.<P> Of course, whenever the opportunity arises, we do like to present new information on the possible benefits of products that we were first to put on the market, including creatine, HMB, CLA, etc. But, we have never contended to have a "world exclusive" on quality supplements. TwinLab now has their own version of CLA on the market (now let me see if I've got this straight... they're the <I>leaders</I> in sports nutrition... oh, I see). And, I understand Weider and TwinLab are both coming out with versions of HMB. (They are looking into getting "licensed" to sell HMB by the patent holders.)<P>
As you know, almost every supplement company sells creatine. (Unfortunately, some don't sell the highest-quality creatine products, but that's another subject altogether.)<P>
Anyway, I appreciate your input and can understand your concern—at times, the "product plugs" may seem a little extensive, but all the "muscle magazines" plug their own products. <I>Muscular Development</I> is obviously promoting their TwinLab products, <I>Muscle and Fitness</I> and <I>Flex</I> obviously promote the Weider products, which include Schiff, Tiger's Milk, American Bodybuilding (all Weider-owned companies). <I>Ironman</I> has their own supplement line called Muscle Linc, and they heavily promote their books, videos, equipment, etc., and <I>MuscleMag</I> has their MuscleTech products. (Despite what they tell you in their magazine, MuscleTech is unquestionably the "official" supplement line of <I>MuscleMag</I>. I don't know why they don't just come out and say so—it would be more straightforward to say something like, "We at <I>MuscleMag</I> believe that MuscleTech products are great, and we're proud to be associated with these products, and so on and so forth." In the long run, they'll figure that out. The truth always comes out.)<P>
Obviously, in each issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, you get much, much more than "redundant" information on the same supplement products over and over again, and it's much, much more than a vehicle to promote our products. Take a look at each issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, and really check it out. We have great articles on training, nutrition, steroids, and supplements. We have great writers like Dan Duchaine (a writer that no one in this industry would even consider letting work for their magazine before <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> was started), great young minds like Michael Mooney, expert trainers like Charles Poliquin, and TC Luoma and I pitch in some pretty novel and useful information on a regular basis.<P>
Unfortunately, the way the muscle-magazine business works, it's not possible to put out a magazine without promoting the products you sell. The economics just don't work. That's why every muscle magazine promotes products. The good news is, selling products allows us to put out very informative, helpful magazines that I think benefit a lot of readers. And, many readers pick up the various magazines specifically to shop for new bodybuilding supplements, books, equipment, and so on. Take a look at it that way and see if you don't at least agree with me "in part."

 <B>Over the last three months, I've collected the many questions I've received in the mail and on the Internet about my BODYOPUS diet. Rather than spreading the questions and answers out through a number of issues, I thought it best to devote just one column to the recurring questions. You don't need to read the <A HREF="../bookofrs/opus.html"> BODYOPUS</A> book to understand the questions, and the answers are applicable to most diets in general, especially if you're in the precontest depletion and carb-up phases. In the future, most BODYOPUS questions will be answered in my upcoming newsletter, not in this column.</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : What exactly is your BODYOPUS diet? How does it differ from other diets? And why aren't any top bodybuilders using it?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Although I describe three distinct diets in BODYOPUS, you're probably wondering about the actual BODYOPUS diet, which is a cyclic ketogenic diet. A cyclic ketogenic diet has two parts: a number of days when the dieter eats virtually no carbohydrates, followed by a shorter span, usually two days, of high-carb eating. And then the whole "cycle" is repeated.<P> 
Ketogenic diets have been around in one form or another for decades. Ketones are fats that have been reduced somewhat from the original fat structure, so the brain is able to use these fuels when glucose is not available. The brain will usually only use glucose as a fuel source, but when blood glucose falls to about 50 mg/dl, the pancreas will start secreting an anti-insulin hormone called glucagon. Glucagon will generate two major effects: it will expel any glycogen stored in the liver into the bloodstream as glucose. And it will convert fatty acids (either from body stores or dietary fats) into ketones. Usually, glucagon is considered a catabolic hormone, and the state of ketosis usually indicates either disease or starvation. But by jolting your body into short spans of ketosis, you can actually manipulate your metabolism and cause some beneficial effects.<P> 
Ketones are very inefficient fuel sources. A gram of fat converted to ketones won't yield the usual nine calories of energy. It's slightly less, about seven calories. This means more fat is needed for energy in the ketogenic state, as compared to a non-ketogenic low-calorie diet. So if a dieter needs to lose the fat in a real hurry, a ketogenic diet is the fastest way to do it. The usual math of "each pound of bodyfat lost yields 3,500 calories" doesn't work with ketones.<P>
BODYOPUS requires more discipline than other low-calorie diets, simply because the brain will send out all kinds of distress signals when blood sugar is low, hoping you'll eat some carbohydrates in response. So, if you aren't in any particular hurry to lose fat, don't bother with BODYOPUS.<P>
The cyclic ketogenic diet didn't start out as a weight-loss diet but rather as a plan to gain muscle without getting fat at the same time. And I've discovered, over the years, that many dieters found that the traditional low-calorie diets caused too much muscle-mass loss and that the cyclic ketogenic diet is the solution to preserving muscle. Granted, most of the top bodybuilders achieve a ripped condition with a low-fat, low-calorie diet. But a greater number of lesser bodybuilders never reach single-digit bodyfat percentages on the traditional diets.<P>
A cyclic ketogenic diet has additional benefits for female dieters. For some unknown reason, the BODYOPUS diet seems to better mobilize fat out of the stubborn fat areas, especially in the lower body. It might be the lack of insulin or the fat-mobilizing effects of glucagon, or an unknown mechanism may cause this benefit.<P>
I would like to point out that the most reactionary bodybuilders (a.k.a. the regular posters on the various Internet nutrition newsgroups—who hate almost anything unusual) seem to be giving the BODYOPUS diet a warm reception. The simple fact is: BODYOPUS delivers on schedule, as promised.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : What's the difference between your BODYOPUS diet and DiPasquale's Anabolic Diet?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  The diets are very similar: both are seven-day cycles of which five are "no-carb" days, so your body starts fracturing fats into another energy source—ketones. And after five days of this kind of eating, you switch over to one or two days of a high-carb diet.<P>
Both diets are based on the Rebound Training System, developed by Michael Zumpano during the late '70's. It was a melding of the popular Atkins diet (a full-time ketogenic weight-loss diet) and the glycogen supercompensation plan which was popular in the endurance sports at the same time.<P>
The Anabolic Diet is not specifically a fat-loss diet but rather a weight-gain plan. BODYOPUS is tailored for maximal fat loss, even though it could easily be modified into a weight-gain diet by simply increasing the amount of calories during the 5-day ketogenic phase by about 20% over maintenance. Actually, there's no practical upper limit of calories above maintenance, as excess fats converted to ketones can't be stored or reconverted and will be excreted in the urine.<P>
In BODYOPUS, I've tried to be very precise about the various food choices and their impact on long-range benefits. The Anabolic Diet is not at all choosy about the quality of the macronutrients and relies heavily on saturated fats in the ketogenic phase. In BODYOPUS, I suggest options that would minimize the reliance on animal fats. Although the research points out that high-fat ketogenic diets will not raise cholesterol, there are other health concerns with saturated fats, especially the highly processed ones like bacon, sausage, and Spam (which the Anabolic Diet relies on).<P>
The most precise aspects of BODYOPUS are discussed in the carbing-up (which I call Recomposition) chapters. The goal is to drive as much glucose into the muscles without spilling any over into the fat cells. Many dieters without this carb-up guidance will redeposit triglycerides and glycerol into the fat cells. Ideally, with the Recomposition carb-up, your various skin-fold millimeter readings on Friday afternoon should be almost the same on the following Monday morning, after the carb-up. The Anabolic Diet doesn't have such precision.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : If a ketogenic diet is the fastest way to lose fat, why don't I just stay in ketosis all the time, like the Atkins Diet recommends?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Glucagon is a catabolic hormone, and one of its functions is to turn amino acids into glucose. Back in the mid-'70's, I followed the Atkins Diet for my first bodybuilding contest. I got into shape, but I lost too much muscle doing it. Under continual ketosis, the muscle cells will have very little glycogen and fluids in them. Strength will be impaired because the Type II fibers need glucose and glycogen as an ATP substrate. Beyond that, we know that through an unknown mechanism, volume expansion of the muscle cell (from the storage of glycogen, fluids, electrolytes, and various substrates) will cause an anabolic stimulus. So whatever muscle is lost due to the slight catabolic effects during the 5 days of ketosis is put back on during the 48-hour carb-up.<P>
It would be interesting to find out how long a stretch of ketosis can be sustained without muscle loss after a two-day carb-up. In BODYOPUS, the dieter always maintains or increases muscle mass after the 48-hour carb-up following 5 days of ketosis. With trial and error and the use of careful weighing and skin-fold measurements, we could find the upper limit of reversible catabolism. Perhaps a dieter could double the ketosis period to 12 straight days, so the carb-up phase could reestablish initial muscle mass within 2 days. These extra days in ketosis would speed fat loss. But the dieter wouldn't be too happy going without carbs for 12 straight, no-fun days.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : In the Recomposition part of BODYOPUS, you have no recommendations on how much protein to eat at each meal. What gives?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  You're right. I seemed to have slipped up on this point. In Recomposition, I've recommended small meals every 2 hours over the first 24 hours, even waking up every 2 hours at night. Because of the secretion of both insulin and glucagon from protein consumption, more glucose will be deposited as glycogen in the muscles if you eat protein with your carb meals. The extra insulin will clear glucose out of the bloodstream faster, and the glucagon will push glycogen from the liver into the bloodstream as glucose.<P> 
If you're eating all 12 meals over the 24-hour period, simply take your bodyweight in pounds and use this as a guide for the grams of protein you'll need daily. So the typical 200-lb male dieter would need 200 grams of protein, divided into 12 portions of about 17 grams at each meal. Frankly, the one-gram-per-pound estimate is probably overkill, but hardly anybody gets fat from eating extra protein.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I'm trying to follow your BODYOPUS diet, but I can't get past the first step. I can't get into ketosis. I'm eating no carbs whatsoever. I have a glucometer, and it never drops below 70, and the Ketostix never show purple. What am I doing wrong?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  To fill in the other readers who might not know, ketosis is a metabolic state which occurs when the glucose in the blood is so low (below 50 mg/dl) that much of the fatty acids in the bloodstream (either from stored bodyfat or dietary fat) are converted into a derivative called ketones. Ketones <I>can't </I>be stored in the body. And they <I>can't</I> be reconverted to regular fats. We use two guides to see if the body is producing them. Whatever ketones can't be used as fuel are excreted in the urine. You can buy ketone-testing strips at most drugstores. These strips change in color from tan to purplish if unburned ketones are in the urine.<P>
Keep in mind that burned-up ketones will not show up as ketones in the urine. And if you're on a low-calorie diet and are moderately active during the day, most of the ketones will be used as fuel, so it might be that during the day, your Ketostix will remain tan. Usually, though, after waking up, the first urination should show some kind of purple on the Ketostix, as your activity while you're sleeping is negligible, yet your body will still produce ketones.<P>
In BODYOPUS, I recommend a daily protein percentage of 25%. At this level, most dieters will achieve a slight amount of ketosis after 48 hours, sometimes sooner if they use the over-the-counter glucose-disposal agents. But many bodybuilders try to overload the protein requirement, so they don't have to eat as much dietary fat. Bad idea. Many of the amino acids in the protein will convert to glucose. This extra glucose, along with the extra insulin secreted from the dietary protein, will stop glucagon secretion, and ketosis won't happen.<P> 
So if your Ketostix is not turning purple in the early morning, carefully look at all your food choices to be sure you aren't eating any carbohydrates whatsoever. And lower your protein to 25% or below. Actually, if you can tolerate eating virtually no protein and mostly fat (yuck!), you can establish ketosis faster and go deeper into the dark purple range in less than 48 hours. But I've yet to find a valid reason to make the state of ketosis this severe. Most of the BODYOPUS dieters seem to do best staying in the light purple, which is the "trace," range.<P>
 

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I heard about a cool trick that you can use to get into ketosis quicker than in the 48 hours you talk about in the book. I need to learn this trick because a day after I went into ketosis, I blew it and ate some carbs, and it looks like now I'm screwed for the week.<P></B>


<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  The secret to getting into ketosis is to get your blood glucose into the 50 mg/dl range. Normal blood glucose is usually between 80 mg/dl and 120 mg/dl. If you suddenly went from 80 mg to 50 mg, within a few minutes, you'd probably pass out because your brain would be starved for glucose, and the liver wouldn't have enough time to manufacture ketones. This happens when diabetics screw up their insulin injections and use too much. I've seen this happen on a number of occasions because while I was in prison, my training partner was diabetic.<P>
But in very careful moderation, tiny amounts of injectable insulin, usually the fastest-acting Humulin R, will lower blood glucose in a very controlled manner. To do this, you'll need a glucometer to keep tabs on your blood glucose, along with some Ketostix to find out when the ketones start showing up in the urine. You don't need very much insulin, only three IU's at a time. The peak activity of the insulin will happen about two hours after the injection. By using injectable insulin in this way, you should be able to descend into ketosis within eight hours.<P> 
I do know of a few BODYOPUS renegades who stay in ketosis until after the workout, then use a larger amount of insulin to drive a large amount of glucose and amino acids into the muscle and reestablish ketosis after the carb-up. And these bodybuilders do this every workout. Maybe I should change the name from BODYOPUS to DEATH-WISH DIETING.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I bought a glucometer to determine my blood glucose level. I'm on your BODYOPUS diet, and the Ketostix get into the trace range, but the glucometer has never read lower than 70. You said that ketosis starts at 50 mg. Is my glucometer broken?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  All the hand-held glucometers do point out in their instructions that there's a 10% error rate. Glucometers are mostly used by diabetics whose blood sugar is dangerously high, above 200 mg/dl. These types of diabetics would be happy to have the blood sugar stabilized to about 150 mg, give or take 20 mg or so.<P>
Everyone I know who has used a glucometer to get low readings of under 100 mg always complains about false readings. But with the 10% error, a reading of 70 mg technically means you could either have a high of 77 mg or a low of 63 mg.<P> 
This still doesn't explain your Ketostix reading of light purple. But don't knock yourself out trying to lower your blood glucose any further. We've found that as long as you reach the "trace" range on the Ketostix, all the claimed benefits of the cyclic diet will occur, even though your glucometer is telling you something else. <P>
I will mention that the first pinprick of blood used in the glucometer is not as accurate as the second drop squeezed out of the same pinprick site. And let me mention again that protein levels above 25% of your total daily calorie level will increase blood sugar from the extra glucose extracted from the protein.<P>
In most cases, the glucometer is not terribly effective on the BODYOPUS diet plan. I recommend glucometers only to dieters who are going to be experimenting with injectable insulin to hasten ketosis. It can let you know the amount of Humulin R you can tolerate at each injection.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I want to use creatine during BODYOPUS. But I've read that creatine needs insulin to work. What should I do on the no-carb days?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  I'm assuming you've previously done a loading phase of creatine, and now you're wondering about what to do with the upkeep dosage of about ten or so grams each day. I recommend that you not use creatine during the no-carb days, which would be Monday through Friday. You could use a higher amount of creatine over the two-day carb-up, and it would be doubly effective. If you add a small amount of creatine (between two or three grams) to each carb meal, within two days, I'm sure you'll more than replace any creatine lost because you didn't take it for five days. The added bonus is that this very small amount at each meal will not cause gastric upset and won't compete with the protein for transport across the intestinal wall.<P>
If you use creatine during the ketogenic phase, much of it will not get into the muscles, and you'll find that a combination of creatine and MCT oil is a most excellent laxative.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> This is a combination BODYOPUS and general carb-up question. I have Debeone from Mexico (phenformin)—the 25-mg tablets. How much should I use? When I used metformin, I used four 450-mg tablets a day. But I know Debeone is much more potent.<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Yes, we have now discovered that for non-diabetic bodybuilders, the high dosage of 1,800 mg of metformin (Glucophage) a day is effective. The estimates for phenformin have been that it's from five to ten times more potent, on a milligram-per-milligram comparison.<P>
I've found that using one 25-mg tablet 6 times a day, usually before meals, seems to instill a similar pump and vascularity to the 1,800-mg dosage of metformin. This is a total dosage of 150 mg of phenformin, which is near the 10 times greater potency predicted. If you used the time-released 50-mg Debeone capsule available in Mexico, you'd need only 3 capsules a day.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> Before the Recomposition carb-up, you recommended a whole-body depletion workout. Is this really necessary? I've tried it both ways, once with the workout and another time without it, and I seemed to get the same results from the carb-up. Why do you recommend this torture? It's a real bitch of a workout.<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  The research shows that the lower the glycogen levels in the muscles, the better the rebound into glycogen supercompensation. The measurement of glycogen in muscle is in a unit called millimoles (mml). A fully supercompensated bodybuilder can reach a very high 200 mml (per kilogram of muscle). A depleted muscle is any measurement below 75 mml, and I believe the lowest reading recorded in a healthy (endurance) athlete has been 18 mml.<P>
We could assume that after 5 days of ketosis and a few weightlifting workouts, the muscle glycogen is probably at 75 mml or below. So your question is: is the extra depletion necessary before the carb-up? Will a more depleted state pay off by boosting muscle glycogen closer to the ideal 200 mml?<P>
Frankly, I doubt very much that the size and shape of a supercompensated muscle will look all that different at the average 150 mml supercompensation compared to the top-of-the-scale 200 ml. But the real benefit of this supercompensation workout is that it's cell volumizing, triggering a mysterious anabolic stimulus. Since the whole point of a cyclic ketogenic diet is to maintain or increase muscle mass without the usual reliance on anti-catabolic drugs (including steroids), I still recommend the whole-body depletion high-rep workout in BODYOPUS, and I would say the same thing to precontest bodybuilders preparing for the traditional no carb/carb-up phase before a contest. Exhausting the muscle glycogen through exercise will intensify the enzymes that transport glucose and deposit it as glycogen. 
You don't have to make yourself sick during this whole-body workout. Shortening the rest between sets won't make the depletion any more rapid. If you don't give yourself enough time between sets to clear lactic acid out of the bloodstream, your blood pH will become acidic, and you'll throw up.<P> 


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> Your Recomposition Phase is a real pain in the ass. In the Anabolic Diet, DiPasquale tells me to eat just about anything I want—even doughnuts. Why should I bother to wake up every two hours to eat?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  The beauty of eating lots of fatty foods on a ketogenic diet is that you usually won't get fat because ketones can't be stored or reconverted to triglyceride. But during a carb-up over the weekend, you're not in ketosis, and most of the fats you eat along with your carbs have to be used as energy; otherwise they'll be stored as bodyfat. And during the weekend carb-up, you're not working out nor doing any aerobics.<P>
Some dieters can actually eat just about anything they want during the carb-up and still remain just as lean on Monday morning as they were on Friday afternoon, right before carbing up. But I've found that the majority of BODYOPUS dieters who have skin-fold readings taken on Friday afternoons changed for the worse if the dieter pigged out uncontrollably over the weekend. Remember, BODYOPUS is formulated to work like clockwork, so you can predict your fat loss on a weekly basis. If a dieter wanted to achieve a certain bodyfat percentage on a specific date, it wouldn't happen if he pigged out every weekend. Eventually, the dieter would achieve his ideal, but it wouldn't happen on schedule.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I've tried 3 times to start your BODYOPUS diet, but I always gave up and bailed out by eating some carbs within 24 hours. Can anybody follow this thing?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  If you're used to a high-carb, low-fat diet and are used to eating every two hours or so, jumping into a ketogenic diet is pure agony. This is why I discuss three distinct diets in the BODYOPUS book. To lose just a few pounds, a high-carb, low-calorie diet is more than adequate. If you have to diet for a long stretch and have a hard time sticking to the calorie amounts, the Isocaloric Diet is a nicer choice as it quells hunger better. Once you're used to a moderate-fat diet, the next step to the cyclic ketogenic diet is much easier than if you jumped from high carbs to no carbs. Try it a step at a time.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I've been doing the BODYOPUS diet for about seven weeks, and I'm stuck. The fat is coming off very slowly. My resting body temperature is 97°, down over a degree. How can I bring this back up?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  You have a catch-22 situation with BODYOPUS: the less protein and carbs you eat, the better you maintain ketosis. But dietary fat is the least oxidative of the nutrients, so your thyroid output will be impaired faster than in the other mixed-nutrient low-calorie diets. All low-calorie diets will cause thyroid attenuation eventually. In a ketogenic diet, it will happen somewhat faster. You have two choices: either use an oral thyroid medication and reestablish your previous pre-diet resting temperature or simply come off the BODYOPUS diet and eat normally for a few days until your basal body temperature returns to normal. Obviously, the two-day carb-up is not enough time to increase your thyroid levels. Let me know how long it takes to reverse this lowered body temperature. Usually, the T<FONT SIZE=-2>4</FONT>(the inactive) thyroid in the body stays fairly normal. It's the T<FONT SIZE=-2>3</FONT>, the active one, which is impaired. The cause is a lessening of the enzyme that drives the conversion: 5 deiodase. Most of this enzyme is in the liver, and it would be interesting to find out what the exact mechanism of the attenuation is. It might be glucagon or increased cortisol. With the thermogenic agents (especially DNP), the simple temperature elevation in the liver causes the impairment. But obviously, just the opposite is happening on a low-calorie diet.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I'm not gonna follow your BODYOPUS diet, but I want to use your carb-up formula for my next contest. Should I do anything different than what is suggested in the Recomposition chapters?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  In BODYOPUS, after the two-day Recomposition phase, a dieter wants to once again establish ketosis by scavenging the blood glucose until it reaches 50 mg/dl. The liver stores carbs in the form of glycogen, and as blood sugar is lowered, liver glycogen will release its stores as glucose. In a depleted state, when the whole body has very little muscle glycogen, much of the incoming carbohydrates in the form of glucose or starch will be shunted across the liver and into the bloodstream.<P> 
However, fructose, and half of sucrose (which is also part fructose) will be directly deposited as glycogen in the liver. To hasten ketosis after Recomposition, the dieter should deplete the liver of glycogen, so the extra glucose won't be leaked into the bloodstream. But when carbing-up for a bodybuilding show, you don't have to worry about reestablishing ketosis after your show, so an avoidance of fructose and sucrose wouldn't have any benefit. This means you can eat some junk food and some fruits during your carb-up.<P> 
If you aren't going to be using a diuretic, then you might want to track the carb/fluid ratio during your carb-up. The rough guide is that for every gram of carbohydrates you eat, you'll need three or four grams of fluids to store it as glycogen in the muscle. Since the Recomposition formula is a maximal supercompensation, excess fluids over your total 24-hour carbohydrate adjustment (which would be 16 grams of carbs for each pound of lean bodyweight) will spill over into the skin, making you look "smooth." Being this precise is tricky because many carb sources don't list the water content. This is why I recommend rice cakes and maltodextrin powders, as both of these high-glycemic sources have a very low moisture content, and you can drink water in controlled amounts.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>Is there any merit to doing really high-rep sets? I'm talking above 50 reps per set. By the same token, what are your thoughts on the 100-rep method?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>The 100-rep method originated in California in the late '70's. It was designed for bodybuilders who had reached a plateau in their development. The rationale behind it was to "shock" the muscles into new growth. The idea was to complete a set of 100 repetitions for every single exercise. Two to four exercises were done, and the body was trained under a split routine, divided over three or four workouts depending on the recommendations of the training guru prescribing the program. If you were able to complete less than 75 reps on your first effort, you were supposed to lighten the load and then complete the 100 reps. The proponents wanted you to be able to do at least 75 reps on your first effort and be able to complete the remaining 25 reps on your second set.<P>
I know some bodybuilders who have made tremendous gains with high reps, but they're the exception more than the rule. Take, for example, IFBB pro Nimrod King. Nimrod has been known to train his monstrous arms with plenty of sets of 25 to 35 reps. Nonetheless, most trainees would actually lose muscle mass on such a rep/set scheme.<P>
Heavyweight Mr. America, Gary Leonard, told me the story of when he saw Tom Platz full squat 225 lbs for <I>10 minutes straight!</I> Obviously, he had leg development. But Tom was also known to use a variety of rep brackets to stimulate his thigh growth.<P>
In most instances, the only people I've seen make significant gains from this type of training were people born with high levels of slow-twitch fibers and who were using plenty of androgens (you know, the Androgen Andy type who lives on testosterone suspension, Anadrol 50, and Sustanon 250).<P>
For most individuals and in most muscle groups, the weight has to be between 70% to 85% of maximum to cause gains in muscle size. When working with a load for 100 reps, you're most likely working with about 30% of your 1-rep max. Thus, the weight is too low to cause muscle growth through additional protein synthesis.<P>	
However, high-rep training (above the 20-rep mark) may stimulate low-threshold motor units, a.k.a. slow-twitch fibers, to grow. That growth may not come so much from increased protein synthesis as from increased nutrient storage (i.e., glycogen) and increased amounts of enzymes (i.e., glycogen synthetase). Unfortunately, these fibers have much less potential for growth than the fast-twitch fibers.
I think that once in a while, as a change of pace, the 100-rep method can help the mind. But I would not prescribe it as a surefire way to increase muscle size. Most trainees will get their best gains using the 6- to 12-rep range for most muscle groups.<P>
However, a good way to do a high number of reps for a single exercise is to do extended descending sets. In this method, you need a stopwatch or, preferably, someone to time you. Take a weight you can do for 20 reps maximum. Have your partner time you as soon as you start your set. Do the max amount of reps you can do, and have your partner tell you how long it took to complete the set. For example, if you did 20 reps in 70 seconds, you would rest only 70 seconds and then attempt as many reps as possible with the same load. Now, let's say on your second effort you did 16 reps in 56 seconds. You'd rest 56 seconds and again do as many reps as possible. Go on in this fashion until a total of 100 reps on that exercise have been performed. The first time, it may take you 10 sets of equal work/equal rest to complete the 100 reps. The goal is to be able to complete all 100 reps in 4 sets. When you're able to do so, increase the weight by about five percent. Try this for an occasional change of pace and to keep your workouts <I>mentally</I> as well as <I>physically</I> interesting!



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> Why do you recommend cocking the wrist back and down during curls?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>This trick was shown to me by Bill MacDonald of Fresno 13 years ago. Bill had trained a host of Mr. America contestants, including Gary Leonard. He showed this technique to me as we were discussing the effect of tempo on muscle growth. Most people unconsciously initiate the curling action by curling the wrists <I>in</I> for the entire set or when approaching fatigue. This has the effect of reducing the resistance on the arm and improving leverage. However, since some of the load is being taken by the forearm flexors, the burden on the elbow flexors (i.e., the muscles that bend your arm at the elbow—primarily the biceps muscles) diminishes.<P>
The rationale is that you prevent the use of the forearms during curls by extending the wrists down and back, and the positive consequence is that you increase the overload on the elbow flexors, which is what you really want when you do curling exercises.<P>
Your next question may be—doesn't that increase the stress on the wrists? No. In the last 13 years, none of the trainees or seminar attendees whom I've shared this tip with have ever reported wrist pain or forearm strain from it. However, you should extend the wrists down and back only in supinated (palms-up) curls. When doing reverse curls or hammer-style curls, the wrists should stay in a neutral position.
Another advantage of this style of curling is that you can extend the duration of the set simply by cocking in the wrist during the concentric action, and then lower the weight with the wrist extended down. Since you're about 15%-20% stronger with the wrist in than with it down, it'll be like having a partner apply enough pressure for a forced rep.<P>
Don't worry if your curling poundages go down. The levels of growth in your elbow flexors will overcompensate largely for the decrease in weight. Also, it's been my experience that you should be able to handle your previous weights in the new style of curling in no time.<P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>I've been taught to work one body part at a time, but it seems to make sense to me to work body parts in tandem, working, say, biceps for one exercise, then moving to triceps, and then back to biceps. What do you think? </B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>You're right. Yet, most people prefer to do standard sets in the old "I go, you go" approach. Alternating opposing muscle groups in the way you suggest is probably the most efficient way to train for the following reasons: <P>
1. 	You don't fatigue as fast. If you use the "agonist-antagonist" (e.g., bi's and tri's) alternating system, you'll drop only one rep per set (or two percent in weight) at most with each successive set. In contrast, if you use the standard set approach, you'll lose about two reps per set (or four percent of the weight). The exact physiological mechanism is yet to be determined, but one thing we know for sure is that it has a neural basis. Studies have shown that when you activate the agonists during a set, the antagonists later contract more strongly than if you had not done the agonist set first. That is why a lot of world records in the bench press are broken following a heavy set of bent-over rows performed in the warm-up room.<P>
2. 	You can double your workload within a given time frame. Let's say you want to do heavy chins for five reps per set. You know from my previous articles that if you want complete recovery between sets, you'll need to rest four to five minutes between sets. You also know that once your warm-up is over, working out longer than an hour can be very counterproductive. If it takes you 30 seconds to perform each set, you rest 5 minutes between, and you do 5 sets, almost half an hour will have gone by just doing your chins, right? But if, instead of resting 5 minutes between sets, you did 5 weighted dips after a 2.5-minute rest, then rested 2.5 minutes and went back to chins until all sets were done, you would have done twice the number of work sets within the same time period. And because of the rationale discussed in point 1, you wouldn't fatigue as quickly on your chins, thus the workload would be greater.<P>

The other benefit of the agonist-antagonist alternating principle is that it prevents injuries by ensuring that both sides of the joint receive an equal workload. In other words, you'll escape the "train-only-what-you-can-see-in-the-mirror" syndrome.<P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> How valuable are pull-ups and chin-ups in working your back? Aren't pulldowns just as good?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Chin-ups along with variations of the rowing movement make up the cornerstone of upper-back training. If you look outside of bodybuilding, the athletes with the best back development are kayakers and gymnasts. Why? Because their conditioning programs are centered around the chin-up and its variations. By the way, to make sure we're all speaking the same language, the difference between a chin-up and a pull-up is the grip. The chin-ups are done with a supinated grip; in other words, the palms are facing you. Pull-ups are done with the pronated grip; that is, the knuckles are facing you. Both are far superior to pulldowns for upper-back development for the following reasons:<P>
1.	Chin-ups or pull-ups involve more motor units than pulldowns. For any given number of reps, a chin-up will always create more demand on the motor-unit pool. Why? Because in a chin-up, you have to move around a fixed object; in pulldowns, you move a free-moving object around you. In chin-ups, you cannot use the lower back to move the load; thus, the overload on the back and upper-arm muscles is ensured.<P>
2. 	The strength gains in chin-ups and pull-ups are functional. When you improve your chin-ups, you improve your ability to do certain real-life tasks, such as climbing over a fence (which is what you may have to do after you get caught using your new-found pull-up strength to pull yourself up to peek in a window). This is one of the reasons pull-ups are preferred over pulldowns to test the functional strength of police recruits, SWAT, and Special Forces types of candidates.<P>
3.	The strength gains in chin-ups and pull-ups are transferable. If you're good at chins, you'll be good at pulldowns, too. But not vice versa. I've seen a lot of lat pulldown artists who couldn't chin to save their lives.<P> 



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> What do you think of "cheat reps"?</B> 

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>I'm adamant about proper form. Here are certain things I'd rather not see in the gym:<P>
1.	Using weights to impress other people, instead of weights to accomplish an effective overload of the muscle groups.<P>
2.	Rolling the shoulders back when doing shrugs.<P>
3.	Driving the weights with the legs when doing upright rows.<P>
4.	Spotting on the first rep of a set.<P>
5.	Spotting the eccentric portion of the lift.<P>
6.	Spotting 46% of the load during the concentric rep and hearing the geek say, "Hey man, I barely touched the bar!"<P>
7.	A guy doing the eccentric portion of the bench in 4 nanoseconds and then using the recoil force in his sunken chest to contribute 17% of the concentric force. The same guy complains that his bench hasn't gone up in three years.<P>
8.	Guys reading the sports page while doing concentration curls.<P>
9.	People carrying on a conversation during a set.<P>
10.	Guys doing alternate dumbbell curls in a form that resembles a penguin having an epileptic seizure.<P>
11.	Guys who complain they can't gain weight when they're vegetarians who do only cable curls and kickbacks.<P>
12.	Overtrained aeroba-heads who strut around like they have great bodies but actually have the limbs of Auschwitz victims and love handles reminiscent of Rush Limbaugh's.<P>
All right, so not all of them had to do with form. But I have to release my tensions somehow, don't I?

Dear Friend,<P>
Jerry Meredith of Ann Arbor, Michigan, thinks my articles just plain suck. On the other hand, Grant Tonkin of Littleton, Colorado, likes my question and answer column. He doesn't like Dan Duchaine's "Rant," though-thinks it belongs in the gutter. However, Dan's "Rant" is the first thing Mike Sedgeway of Costa Mesa, California, reads when his copy of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> finds its way to his door. Still, Mike could do with fewer articles about EAS supplements. Of course, Josh Harpster of Jamaica, New York, makes all of his decisions about what supplements to buy based on the scientific articles in <I>MM2K</I>-he thinks the magazine is perfect "as is."<P>
Editorially, Bill and I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what exactly subscribers and newsstand readers want to see. (Interestingly enough, based on our reader surveys, even those two groups have different opinions on what they like and don't 
like.) A good number of readers ask for more drug information, while an equal number of readers want to see <I>less</I>. The thing is, if we got rid of all the drug articles, we'd be, in effect, sweeping an important bodybuilding issue under the rug and pretending it didn't exist. That's what the bodybuilding-mag world was like <I>before MM2K</I> showed its sunny face. What's more, we'd only be read by choirboy types who probably took vows of celibacy years ago. On the other hand, if we published nothing but drug articles, we'd only be read by guys with sloped foreheads who just learned to walk erect this morning. Practically every topic and every area addressed in <I>MM2K</I> elicits widely varying opinions.<P>
Achieving editorial balance is extremely important, but it's also extremely difficult. It's like trying to squat 500 lbs while wearing roller blades and, at the same time, trying <I>not</I> to watch Monica Brant out of the corner of your eye while she's licking a cherry Popsicle with long strokes of her tongue... using the other hand to sensually rub suntan oil on her thong-bikini-clad, sun-kissed bee-hind... the waves lapping at her feet as she turns towards you and gives you a sultry "come-hither" look... oh, sorry, I got carried away for a minute. You get the idea-it's not an easy thing.<P>
Anyhow, that's why we have different types of writers-to achieve some sort of "editorial balance." Dan Duchaine is generally the hardcore drug guy, while Michael Mooney is the medical drug guru. Keith Klein and Will Brink are nutrition writers, while Joey Antonio and Anthony Almada are hard-science dudes, noses in test tubes, who only come up for air and to write articles for <I>MM2K</I>. Charles Poliquin and Shawn Phillips are primarily strength and training honchos, while big-daddy Bill Phillips is comfortable in all disciplines. And me? I occasionally come up with a good article, but even a <I>blind</I> stunt pilot lands a plane safely once in a while.<P>
Let me tell you what our attempts at interpreting all these mixed messages almost forced us to do. Back in 1994, we thought breifly about trying to go a little more "mainstream." After all, mainstream means lots of readers. Mainstream is where <I>Muscle & Fitness</I> lives. Moms and Pops even look at <I>Muscle & Fitness </I>while they're standing in line at the grocery store waiting to pay for a week's supply of Charmin toilet paper and bacon bits. Pop wants to look at the babes, and mom wants to know how to flatten her tummy.<P>
Luckily, like Arnold's police horse in <I>True Lies</I>, we put the brakes on that decision before we toppled off the roof of the editorial Marriott and landed on our keesters. We decided that it was wrong to try to make the whole world happy. It was wrong to go against our nature. If your heart isn't in it-if you sell out-it'll show in your work, and it'll come back to bite you on the ass. I mean, can you see Bill Phillips writing an article about "how to be more sensitive in bed" or some similar sort of drivel? I don't think so. Instead, we decided to continue to cater to the guys who had read us from day one, the hardcore guys. It's like the old saying, "<I>You dance with who brung ya to the ball.</I>"<P>
We'll never be like <I>Muscle & Fitness</I> or <I>Sports Illustrated</I> or even some jag-off magazine like <I>Penthouse</I>. We write about things that are of interest to a <I>very select</I> group of people on this earth-those people who are interested in changing the shape of their bodies, through diet, exercise, supplements, and sometimes even drugs. Our readers are people who are passionate about it and who are willing to work for it.<P>
Likewise, we don't want to turn into one of those soft, limp-wristed fitness mags. Most of the guys who read those mags don't even work out-they just think chicks (or dudes) will think they're in shape if they come over and see those mags strewn across the coffee table.<P>
Still, I gotta admit, it makes my blood boil when the local newspaper quotes <I>Fitness for Men</I> or some similarly named publication: "According to an article in <I>Fitness for Men</I>, building muscle can help old people feel more energetic." <I>Arrggghhh!</I> Somebody kill me! Help me take the dirt nap! Roll up that copy of <I>Fitness for Men</I>, shove it where the sun don't shine, fill it full of gunpowder, and strike a match. Hopefully, my charred, jet-propelled carcass will land smack dab in the middle of a manure pile. I think to myself that the pudknocker who reads <I>Fitness for Men</I> could learn as much about working out from one copy of <I>MM2K</I> as he could in a lifetime of reading his limp-wristed fitness publication! I get a little jealous about all the publicity those mags get from the general public. I sometimes wonder why the press doesn't quote us.<P>
Truth is, <I>MM2K</I> intimidates a lot of ordinary people. But, what the hell. We can't worry about the general public, and we can't make everybody happy. Bodybuilders have always been kind of an underground, secret rat-pack group that lives, breathes, and travels to the beat of a different drummer. That's you, folks, and that's who this magazine is for. If we're true to you, we'll be rewarded. Heck, we already have been. But even in our significant but small-by-global-standards fraternity of readers, we get differing viewpoints on what is or isn't a good article. When we get a number of letters telling us that <I>so and so blows</I> or that reading a particular article was equivalent to accidentally brushing your teeth with grandpa's scrotal cleansing cream and then get an equal number of letters telling us it was the best darned article they ever read... well, it gets confusing.<P> 
The point is, even in the closest family, opinions differ. Although 99% of the articles in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> are more or less related in subject matter, not everything is of interest to every reader. Obviously, some fresh-faced, hormonally charged 18-year-old bodybuilder isn't going to be overly worried about taking saw palmetto for his prostate. Likewise, some 40-year-old reader who's trying to fight off the devastating effects of some wasting disease isn't necessarily going to be interested in a diet that tells him how to get down to 5% bodyfat. And, for some reason, some readers just aren't interested in Dan Duchaine's stories about penis size or flatulence. <I>Go figure!</I><P>
Here's how we decide if an article is good enough to go into <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>: I get an article that I think is good. I give it to Bill. Bill either writes - using big, industrial-strength pencils - "This kind of blows, doesn't it?" on the top of the page, or he might write, politely, "It's not <I>entirely </I>repugnant." Then again, sometimes the big lug is really excited about an article. Nevertheless, we put aside our individual likes and dislikes and ask ourselves whether or not a significant percentage of readers would like the article. Once in awhile, we're right on. Other times, we're as far off the mark as actor/alcoholic Robert Downey, Jr. when he staggers home drunk into the wrong house. Of course, once in a while, we get an article in that everybody seems to like. When that happens, the angels sing, the birdies alight on our outstretched hands, the bunny rabbits prance around our legs, and we dance on tippie toes until the wee hours of the morning. Either that or we break open a six-pack and say, "Fuggin-A, bubba, good article." You get the picture.<P>
Of course, most of the time, an article falls right in between or maybe leans slightly to the positive side, away from the <I>sucks </I>side. It all comes down to the fact that magazines contain diverse information. A book, however, may be about one subject aimed at one particular interest group, but magazines, by their very nature, have to tackle a large number of issues. Hopefully, at least some of those articles on some of those issues appeal to all of our readers - that's what makes a successful magazine. Ultimately, it's our responsibility to provide information to all kinds of bodybuilders.<P> 
We appreciate any and all input, regardless of whether it's complimentary or scathing. Constructive criticism helps us tailor the magazine to meet your bodybuilding needs. Please keep in mind that we're looking for trends, though. For instance, if enough people think my articles suck, I'll soon be writing seafood recipes for the back page of my condo's newsletter. If, on the other hand, only a few people think I suck, then I urge those readers to just skip my articles and look for the things you do enjoy or that pertain more to your individual brand of bodybuilding. The same thing applies to the work of any writer or any particular article in <I>MM2K</I>.<P>
The bottom line is that we're absolutely, totally, and completely determined to provide you with the best damn bodybuilding magazine there ever was! A magazine that is informative, helpful, relevant, renegade, sometimes naughty, sometimes nice, but always brutally honest, straightforward, and hardcore! We don't please all the people all the time, but <B>if</B> that's what we tried to do, we wouldn't be "<I>MM2K</I>." We'd be more like some other muscle magazines... ya see?<P>
However, I think there's enough information in each and every issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> to satisfy any serious bodybuilder, and this issue is certainly no exception. If you enjoy reading about late-breaking anabolic drug developments that haven't been reported <B>anywhere</B>, take a look at our new feature entitled "Notes from the Underground" (page 108). The information it contains will soon be the topic of water-cooler discussions at gyms everywhere.<P>
If you're interested in drugs but lean more towards non-controlled bodybuilding stuff like Nolvadex, Proscar, nootropics, or any of the other non-steroidal pharmaceuticals we talk about in the pages of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, read our feature story on the overseas drug mail-order business (page 82). If you've ever wanted to get your hands on some drug that's considered to be largely harmless but don't want to contend with finding a doctor who's sympathetic to your needs who'll write a script, look no further than this article. We've uncovered the "low-down" on how people can order just about any non-controlled drug you can think of, legally, with virtually no hassle! The information in this article could change your life!<P>
There's plenty of ground-breaking nutrition and training info in this copy of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, too. Ever wonder what the hell the "homeopathic" bodybuilding supplements you see advertised are all about? Take a look at our investigative report on page 148. You'll be amazed at what some companies are getting away with. Likewise, how'd you like to be able to boost your energy levels without taking supplements... through plain old, ordinary foods? "Power Foods" (page 62) will show you how to stay energized all day long. Not one to be left out of releasing ground-breaking nutrition information, <I>MM2K</I> contributor Michael Mooney tells you how eating an everyday food that's found in just about every kitchen cupboard in America can help you heal broken-down bodybuilding joints (page 92).<P>
And, since no great issue of <I>MM2K</I> is complete without hardcore training info, read "Ab Training from Mars" (page 140) and "How to Build Awesome, 3-D Thighs in Record Time," the latter written by world-class strength guru Charles Poliquin. The tips you get from these two articles alone will propel your ab and thigh training through the roof! You'll be beggin' us to publish similar articles on other body parts so they can catch up!<P>
This issue, in my humble opinion, is so exciting, so damn good, that I could go on and on. From Bill Phillips' habitually great "Uncensored Q&A" (page 30) to the very last page, this is one exciting issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. <P>
But don't just take my word for it... turn the page, start reading, and see for yourself!<P>
Best Regards,<P>

P.S. By the way, if you don't generally like Dan Duchaine's "Rant" (page 124), you'd better skip this one. It's <I>beyond </I>crude!

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I've seen some Parabolan going around the gyms up here in New York. I heard they stopped making Parabolan-does that mean all of this stuff is counterfeit?<P></B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>I have checked with Laboratoires Negma, the French drug company that makes Parabolan, and confirmed that they do indeed still make this stuff. I also recently reviewed a test from an analytical laboratory in San Diego, conducted on August 12, 1996, which showed that a sample ampoule of a product labeled as Parabolan, lot 44, with an expiration date of Dec. 96, contained the anabolic steroid trenbolone cyclohexylmethylcarbonate, which is Parabolan.
So, this test confirms that at least some of this stuff going around is legit.
Of course, it's impossible for me to say whether or not what you've seen at your gym is real, but it's certainly possible. 
By the way, Parabolan is one powerful anabolic!<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>The manager of the health-food store where I buy supplements told me there's a new "micronized" version of DHEA available. Should I be using that instead of regular DHEA?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Micronized means the DHEA has been processed into small particles which allow it to be absorbed directly from the intestinal tract into the lymphatic system, thus bypassing the liver. Metabolism of DHEA in the liver normally converts DHEA into DHEA sulfate and also metabolizes it into androgens (such as testosterone). Thus, micro-nized DHEA might be better for women who want to avoid the excessive androgenic effects of DHEA, but it's not a better choice for bodybuilders who are using this compound in hopes of increasing testosterone levels and accelerating muscle growth.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>The company I work for has a corporate "wellness center," and there's a nutritionist who works there. I was talking to her about various supplements I use. She did something called a "hair analysis" for me, where she cut a few strands of my hair, apparently took them somewhere, analyzed them, and a couple of days later, she told me she could tell from analyzing my hair that I had no nutrient deficiencies; therefore, I'm wasting my money on supplements. She said unless there's a deficiency, there's no need to use a supplement. Is it possible I could be getting all the nutrients I need just from my diet? I do try to eat right.
</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Alrighty then... hair analysis, huh? I 
didn't know anyone was still using that-what we do in our studies is have a Ugandan witch doctor come in, take pieces of your clothing and other personal property, and make a voodoo doll which captures your spirit. From there, we can study just about anything-typically we put the voodoo dolls on a Ouija Board, and if they gravitate northward, we know we're looking at Vitamin B deficiencies, and if they gravitate in a southeasterly direction, it's obvious the body has a deficiency in glucose metabolism, and so on. It's really high-tech stuff!<P>
Seriously, the nutritionist to whom you have paid a visit probably has good intentions, but... she's an idiot. Hair analysis is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a sound, scientific way to evaluate nutrient deficiencies. Even if it were, it doesn't mean you couldn't benefit from using supplements. Let me explain-dietary supplements that are efficacious (effective) work by two general "modes of action." First, there is a metabolic basis for dietary supplementation (which means you can benefit from it) if it provides a nutrient that is normally "undersupplied" to cells or, second, if it exerts a pharmacological effect on cellular processes.<P> 
In the first case, a nutrient is required by the body, and a specific concentration of this nutrient results in optimal cell function. For a supplement to exert a positive effect under this scenario, normal availability of the supplied nutrient must be sub-optimal. (Sub-optimal is not the same as "deficient.") Let's look at the nutrient creatine for example-very few athletes have what doctors would classify as a creatine deficiency, but scientific studies have shown that there is a big difference between "normal levels" and "optimal levels." Typically, you don't provide the optimal level of the nutrient creatine through your diet for it to exert maximum effects on size, muscle strength, and endurance. In this case, consuming "extra" amounts of creatine, by using a supplement, optimizes your muscle's natural ability to perform.<P>
In the second case, a dietary supplement can exert a positive metabolic effect if it contains a constituent which is normally not required by the cell but is capable of altering normal cell function. For example, the herb ephedra is metabolized into the drug ephedrine, which alters cardiac muscle function and increases the metabolic rate.<P> 
The whole concept that supplementation is merely about making up for clinical vitamin/nutrient deficiencies and whatnot is so "old school" it's ridiculous. The realities of modern-day supplementation (and not just bodybuilding supplementation) are centered on a whole different philosophy-one that is based on sound, scientific theories I would liken to the study of medicine.  It's an absolute, 100% valid, scientific fact that supplementing the diet with extra amounts of certain nutrients produces effects which cannot be achieved with even the most "perfect" or "balanced" diet.<P>
Now, if you ever want to try that voodoo-doll test, let me know...<P> 

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I once read that antibiotics like cepha-lexin kill the effects of anabolic steroids. Is there any truth to this, or is it just a rumor?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>The normal bacteria present in the intestines (the kind that doesn't make us ill but actually helps us stay healthy) produce enzymes that the liver uses to circulate steroids throughout the body. If these enzymes are not present due to a lack of intestinal bacteria (caused by cephalexin or another antibiotic), then the steroids that pass through the liver may be broken down completely and rendered useless. So it's possible that using antibiotics could reduce the effects of exogenous (from a source outside the body) anabolic steroids, especially oral anabolic steroids since they enter the liver first, before they get into the bloodstream. 
This can be a problem for some steroid users because they get bad acne on a cycle and often treat it with antibiotics. A solution might be to use injectable rather than oral anabolics if acne becomes a problem and the use of antibiotics is necessary.

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I'm very confused about how often I should train. I know some guys get good results training each body part only once a week; others work out three times a week. I've tried working each body part once every seven days, and I just don't seem to gain strength as fast as if I train more often, and my muscles just don't stay "pumped up." Sometimes I train only after soreness goes away. What causes soreness? How often do you think I should train?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>There's a great deal of confusion on this topic, but here are some things I think you can accept as fundamental truths about training frequency: first of all, how often you can train a muscle depends a lot on how hard you train it and how you work out. For example, if you don't do a lot of eccentrics (negatives) in your workouts, then you won't have the same level of muscle damage from each workout, and therefore, you can train each body part more often than once a week. On the other hand, if you do a lot of eccentric reps which cause a high level of "disruption" to muscle fibers, then you'll need more recovery time.<P>
If you're training primarily to gain strength and not muscle size, I would suggest that you use mostly concentric (positive) reps and train each major strength move, like the bench and squat, every three or four days.<P>
On the other hand, if you're training primarily to increase mass, I think your best bet is to train each body part once every five or seven days with very intense concentric and eccentric reps.<P>
Studies have shown that following a heavy bout of eccentric exercise, a number of dramatic changes take place in muscle tissue. One of the things that happens immediately after exercise is that your muscles get swollen-they get pumped up. Approximately six hours later, that pump goes away completely, but it's very interesting to note that scientists have determined that over the next three days, the muscles will once again "swell" as a result of that heavy, eccentric workout (by as much as 10%!). That swelling can even persist for several days after the soreness goes away.<P>
Another thing that happens following an intense eccentric exercise session is that the muscles exhibit a dramatic loss of strength. For example, if you did a heavy eccentric workout for your chest today, tomorrow you would probably have 35% less strength in the chest muscles, and it could easily be a week before your strength got back up to normal, much less "greater than normal."
You can gauge the damage inflicted during a workout fairly accurately by how sore you get. This soreness is not necessarily caused by the swelling, or "pump," you get in your muscles. After all, a pump is usually not associated with a feeling of soreness but rather just a nice "tight" feeling.<P>
Soreness is caused by chemicals that are released when muscle structure is damaged. Once muscle soreness is gone, it's okay to train the muscle again.<P>
Scientists aren't exactly sure what causes the swelling that persists for over a week after an eccentric workout, but this is definitely one reason we like to train-to keep our muscles looking full and tight, instead of "flat."<P>
The bottom line is that if you're doing very heavy eccentric exercises and really getting sore, train each body part only once every five to seven days. On the other hand, if you're not really stressing the negative portion of your exercises and are focusing on building strength, such as trying to get your bench press up by 50 lbs, then it's okay to train more often; in fact, this is probably a better way to gain strength rapidly.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I read some interesting information about a supplement called pregnenolone. The information I reviewed indicated that using this supplement might help boost testosterone levels and cause greater muscle growth. Do you think it would be a good idea to try supplementing pregnenolone?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Okay, let's start at the beginning... pregnenolone is a natural hormone which is a direct oxidation product of cholesterol with a formula closely related to that of the catabolic hormone cortisone. Technically, it's a steroid hormone, but remember, that includes any chemical with four carbon-ring structures attached to each other. Cortisol, DHEA, testosterone, pregnenolone, progesterone, and estrogen are all "steroid hormones" that chemically look similar to each other. Structurally, they differ only in small ways; however, even tiny changes in the chemical makeup of a substance can make an enormous difference in how it functions and what role it plays in the chemical factories of our bodies.<P>
For instance, testosterone, the "muscle-building hormone," is only slightly different from estrogen, the female hormone. Yet that slight difference causes men to grow masculine, strong bodies with facial hair and other secondary male sexual characteristics, and it causes women to develop breasts and have other feminine characteristics.<P>
So, just because something is technically classified as a "steroid" does not mean it's an anabolic steroid-the kind that builds muscle.<P>
It's true that pregnenolone is one of a few hormones that acts as a precursor to other hormones. It can convert to DHEA which can then be converted to testosterone, but pregnenolone can also be converted to progesterone (a female hormone) quite easily, and it can also end up turning into cortisol (a catabolic steroid) or aldosterone (a hormone that causes water retention).
Whether pregnenolone ends up as cortisol, estrogen, or testosterone is basically governed by the pituitary gland which coordinates the many hormones in our bodies.<P>
The pituitary gland works through very sensitive feedback loops. When the production of hormones by the adrenals or testes is too high, it sends signals to reduce production. When amounts of adrenal hormones or androgens are too low, a normal-functioning pituitary gland would again send signals, this time to stimulate further production of hormones.<P>
This is very complicated, but suffice it to say, just because you might be taking a precursor to a hormone like testosterone does not mean your body will simply convert it to testosterone just because that's what you want it to do.<P>
I'm not convinced that pregnenolone would do anything to help a bodybuilder gain more muscle size and strength. I think it's probably more likely that using pregnenolone might have just the opposite effect.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I read a newspaper article recently that said last year there was a 41% increase in prescriptions for anabolic steroids and testosterone. Are some doctors prescribing steroids to bodybuilders and other athletes? My doctor said he won't even discuss it. Do I just have a conservative physician? I told him I want to bench press 400 lbs and need testosterone.</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>There are definitely not many (if any) doctors who will prescribe anabolic steroids or testosterone (they're really the same thing) to athletes who just want to gain muscle size and strength.
However, the information you read in the newspaper about there being a dramatic increase in the amount of anabolic steroids and testosterone being prescribed for "legitimate" purposes is definitely accurate.<P>
There are basically two reasons for this-the first is that doctors are recognizing testosterone replacement therapy as a legitimate use of androgens. Estrogen replacement therapy has been a widely accepted medical practice for many years, and it appears that before too long, the fact that men go through "andropause" (a dramatic mid-life reduction in hormone output) will be widely accepted, too.<P>
I think a lot of doctors are getting over their fear of androgens. The recent New England Journal of Medicine article on the apparent safety and efficacy of these drugs (which I reported on in the last issue of <I>MM2K</I>) is sure to convince even more doctors that these medications are not the "killer drugs" the media made them out to be several years ago with all their hype and sensationalism. (Certainly, anabolic steroids are not harmless if they are abused, and this is something I've always contended and will always try to emphasize.)<P>
I think a lot of "bodybuilders" are convincing doctors that their testosterone levels are low, hence, they "qualify" for testosterone replacement therapy. Some doctors will prescribe testosterone for men with low-normal levels of testosterone, even if they're in their 20's. This is a "roundabout" way of getting legal, medically supervised steroid therapy. (I suppose it's true that out of the hundreds of thousands of guys who "bodybuild," there are a significant number who just don't have high enough levels of testosterone to respond optimally, even when the training stimulus and the nutrition program are perfectly controlled.)<P>
The second reason for an increase in testosterone/anabolic steroid prescriptions by doctors relates to the use of these medications to help AIDS patients and others who are suffering from "wasting diseases," such as cancer. One steroid, Oxandrin, has actually been approved by the FDA for promoting weight gain in "underweight" people.<P>
I think this trend will continue-more and more doctors will be prescribing anabolic steroids for one reason or another, but don't expect a physician to prescribe these drugs simply to increase your bench press-you're going to have to get more creative than that!<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I've read and enjoyed your commentaries and perspective on how bodybuilding could and should be changed for the better by modifying the judging criteria and promoting more realistic "muscle stars" in the magazine. I've never liked the grotesquely freaky bodybuilders who win most of today's top shows-they don't inspire me. As a fanatical but noncompetitive bodybuilder, I want to let you know I'll do anything I can to help support your "cause." I was just wondering, have any of the other people in the industry begun to "see the light" as a result of your interesting and thought-provoking articles on the subject?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Thank you very much for your positive feedback and support. I'm delighted to report that there are some exciting things happening in the "inner circles" of the sport that I think will yield significant changes in bodybuilding in the not-too-distant future.<P>
This reform is certainly not all due to my articles and ideas-others in the industry are pushing for reform, too, but I think my ideas have merit and could be effective.<P>
Here's one interesting development-ESPN's show called American Muscle Magazine, which is a pretty neat bodybuilding TV program, is changing its format-they're going to "tone down" their exposure of 'roided-out bodybuilding stars and are going to start focusing more, in their feature segments and in their contest coverage, on guys who don't look like they're bloated to the gills on every bodybuilding drug under the sun.<P> 
With the growing climate of disdain surrounding the abuse of anabolic steroids and other bodybuilding drugs, they have agreed with my stance that it's no longer prudent to continue publicizing events where bodybuilders are basically "forced" to abuse drugs to look like they even belong on stage with the other competitors. Starting in 1997 (which is just around the corner), American Muscle Magazine will cover only drug-tested contests and will be dropping much of the contest coverage they have regularly featured in prior years. I think this is a change for the better and an important move forward.<P>
Some of the magazines are beginning to feature more "realistic bodies," too. Ironman magazine is certainly doing this and so is Muscular Development (a little bit). I think that's good.<P>
It's so important for people like you, who read magazines like <I>MM2K</I>, to know that it's okay if you can't build 20-inch biceps-you can still be a successful bodybuilder in your own right and have self-respect, health, and admiration from others! Even if you weigh only 175 lbs, you can still have an outstanding-looking physique-one with great shape, symmetry, and muscle definition.
My plans to continue the effort to reform bodybuilding, reduce drug abuse, and make more lifters proud to call themselves "bodybuilders" include several "action items."<P>
First, we're going to continue to give drug-free bodybuilders recognition in the magazine. For example, on this issue's cover, you'll see a kid named Bill Davey. This guy is 100% drug free-he's passed numerous steroid tests at contests over the past few years, and we even had an independent lab run tests on him ourselves before we put him on the cover and gave him our "100% drug-free seal of approval."<P>
We want to show that you can build a great-looking body (maybe not 250 lbs of rock-hard mass with 2% or 3% bodyfat but a great-looking, muscular, strong body nonetheless) through proper nutrition, exercise, and supplementation.<P>
In addition, we're going to continue to sign up drug-free spokespersons to endorse <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> and EAS supplements. So far, through our spokesperson challenge, we've signed up 6 endorsers, given away 6 Corvettes (one of the "perks" of being a spokesperson), and signed six $50,000-endorsement contracts.<P>
As far as drug testing goes, as I've explained in prior issues, that could be part of the solution, but by itself, it would only create a bigger problem. If we don't start encouraging more people to emulate physiques that can be obtained without abusing bodybuilding drugs and without changing the judging criteria of competitive bodybuilding contests, drug testing is not going to help that much. But, if TV shows like ESPN's American Muscle Magazine and magazines like <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, Ironman, and Muscular Development promote more realistic physique role models, then I think we'll start to make an impact on the core of the problem.<P> 
After this, drug testing would be an important step and would be like setting a "speed limit." You see, when you set a speed limit, you know people are going to exceed that mark. But, if you don't even set a limit, people are going to push it as far as they can. I think competitive bodybuilding now is somewhat analogous to the Autobahn-it's just too tempting to see how far you can push it, and before you know it, you've gotten yourself in over your head.<P>
If you drug test, it's like setting a ceiling-a limit. Provided other things are taken into consideration, like I mentioned above, drug testing will limit the abuse of bodybuilding pharmaceuticals. It will not eliminate their use. But, it's very likely that testing for steroids, Lasix, clenbuterol, etc. would help the situation.<P>
TwinLab/Muscular Development announced in recent issues of their magazine that they're going to withdraw all support of the IFBB next year. (They were a major sponsor of the IFBB's pro bodybuilding contests in prior years.) And they've encouraged other people to do the same.<P> 
Going back to what I said a couple of issues ago about wanting to be part of the solution, not simply someone who just points out the problem and leaves it up to someone else to take care of, what I would like to do is make sponsorship moneys available to the IFBB for major bodybuilding shows like the Arnold Classic and the Mr. Olympia but insist that the money be used for drug testing. Also, I'll offer whatever assistance I can provide in terms of how to set up this drug-testing program to make it as legitimate as possible. (As you might imagine, I have a great deal of information about what drugs are being abused by bodybuilders.)
I'll pitch in $25,000 for both the Arnold Classic and the Mr. Olympia ($50,000 total) to help get this program started.
If just a couple of other companies did the same-stepped up to the plate and decided to be part of the solution instead of just pointing fingers, then I think we could really get somewhere.<P>
If we can get these things started, then I'd like to spearhead a public-relations campaign to improve the overall image of bodybuilding and bodybuilders. I don't know whether many of you have noticed, but I'm a pretty good promoter/marketer, and if I believed that bodybuilding were headed in the right direction and I really thought it stood for what it should stand for (health, pride, physical perfection, etc.), I could do one helluva job selling bodybuilding to the general public.<P> 
I'd get the "bodybuilding stars" involved in all types of "positive-image" activities. For example, if bodybuilding "got it together," the physique stars could and should be looked at as quality role models-as heroes.<P>
Literally hundreds of bodybuilders, whether they're the middleweight winner of the Mr. Houston contest or Mr. America, should be involved in programs such as Arnold Schwarzenegger's Inner-City Games, which encourages kids to get involved in sports (like bodybuilding, which helps teach discipline, commitment, and responsibility) instead of running the streets, hanging out in gangs, etc.
Bodybuilders should also be involved in charity work, such as the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and they should be "seen" on the sidelines at major sporting events, in the "inner circles" of Hollywood parties, movie premieres, etc. Things like this would help build the "celebrity status" and "respectability" of bodybuilding for the general public.<P>
Think about this-Arnold Schwarzenegger is a major player in the Planet Hollywood restaurant chain, but you know what? I've never seen any of his Arnold Classic bodybuilding champions hanging out at any of these grand openings-and I've been to quite a few of them. You know why? Because Arnold himself is probably embarrassed by what bodybuilding is/has become! If things took a turn for the better, I'm sure Arnold could be convinced to help promote these guys-have them speak at Planet Hollywood openings, sign autographs, make cameo appearances in movies, etc. These are the types of things that bring new people into our sport/activity (whatever it is).<P>
Then, if we can get these types of things going (which I'm confident we can if we get even a little support from certain people), you're going to see a whole new growth phase in bodybuilding-more guys competing, more respectability, more magazine readers (good for me-huh?!), etc.<P>
Hopefully, we can find some "champions" who have more than just massive, muscular bodies-we need to find some guys with charisma, which is what Arnold has!<P>
To wrap it up, there have been some exciting changes in bodybuilding over the past few months, and I think things are headed in the right direction. I continue to come up with ideas and act on them, and I think in the not-too-distant future, people will be proud to call themselves "bodybuilders," and literally tens of thousands of people will be "joining our ranks" every month. (It is possible!) 
I'll keep you posted on the progress or lack thereof.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I'm 37 years old. I'm the Chief Financial Officer of a Fortune 500 company. I've been fortunate enough and have worked hard enough to achieve a relatively high level of success in my field, and I'm excited about that, but I'm not excited about the way I look. I've dabbled in bodybuilding since I was a boy, but it's getting harder and harder to stay in shape. I respect the fact that you're a successful businessman and have somehow found a way to balance that with your goals as a bodybuilder. What can I do to get my sagging muscles back in shape, so I don't end up looking like all the other frumpy, middle-aged men I work with?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>The answer to your question is actually very basic-I'm sure you understand from your business endeavors that you only get out of something what you put into it. If you want to be a great businessman, you've got to work at it-much harder than the "average Joe." Likewise, if you want to have a strong, muscular body, you've got to put in the time and effort and work towards that goal as well.<P>
As far as training goes, if you hit the weight room hard for as little as 45 minutes, 3 or 4 days a week, you can get the job done. But that's only part of it. Nutrition is very important, too.<P>
For me, it's much harder to find the time and discipline to follow the nutritional guidelines that are necessary to stay lean and build muscle than it is to find time to work out.<P>
Even if you were to train six days a week for two hours per workout, if you didn't have your nutritional program in order, you wouldn't look or feel all that much better.<P>
But, with all the high-tech supplements and meal-replacement powders that are on the market today, the whole issue of optimal nutrition is easier to master.<P>
Make sure you always plan ahead-just like you plan your business schedule-give your nutrition and exercise program that same type of priority. Use protein powders, meal-replacement drinks, or have your meals prepared for you (ask your secretary or assistant to help you with it).<P>
In my 1996 Supplement Review, I go over a very detailed nutrition and supplement program as well as a fast, super-effective exercise routine.To get a free free copy of that book, follow this link.<P>
The bottom line for success in bodybuilding is very similar to the way you've achieved success in business-find the "right things to do" and then repeat them day after day, week after week.<P>
You didn't achieve your status in the corporate world overnight, nor will you achieve the perfect physique that soon, but if you stick with it, stay focused, and are determined, you'll definitely reach your goal of having a lean, strong, muscular body. And, when you reach that goal, you'll have so much more self-esteem, you'll probably be even more successful in business!<P>
Finally, I appreciate your referring to me as a "successful businessman," but I have a hard time thinking of myself that way. Despite the amount of time I spend behind a desk putting this magazine together and running my various companies, I don't think I'll ever be a sophisticated business type.<P>
Now that we're in our new corporate headquarters, some of my managers are pushing for a dress code. (They think it's a little bit of a bad example for me to be wearing oversized cotton T-shirts that say "Train Hard" on the back, shorts, and tennis shoes to managers' meetings-hey, what can I say? If I'm not comfortable, I can't focus on my work!)<P>
Anyway, they're pushing for a rule where the "executives" (which I guess would include me) have to wear ties and slacks to work, at least Monday through Thursday. So I kind of custom designed my own "corporate-bodybuilder wear" (shown in the photo to the left). Hey... I kind of dig this style. It says, "I'm a business guy and a bodybuilder"-don't you think? Maybe there's a market for this stuff-maybe I can give that Armani guy a run for his money. Maybe you'll be my first customer!<P> 
(Don't worry-I'm just kidding.)<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I was wondering if you had tried using yohimbine as a fat burner, like Dan suggested in the last issue of <I>MM2K</I>. Do you think it works?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Dan's theories are always interesting, and this one is no exception.<P> I tried using some prescription yohimbine, 5.4 mg per tablet, just to see what it felt like, so I would be "in the know."<P> 
That stuff can really give you a "hot flash"! You can definitely feel it-at least I could. It makes you kind of flushed and makes your blood pressure go up, but as you continue to use it, you get kind of used to it, and it attenuates-it doesn't cause as much of a reaction after you've used it for a week or so. I used it for only two weeks to test the acute effects.<P>
However, I work with a woman who has been on it for about a month, and she has noticed some very positive results (loss of fat from her hips), so I'm convinced there may be something to Dan's theory that yohimbine helps burn bodyfat-especially lower-body fat in women and some men. (However, yohimbine does not elevate testosterone like some marketers claim.)<P>
If you try this stuff, make sure you're not using any other central nervous system stimulants, like Ripped Fuel, Diet Fuel, caffeine, ephedrine, clenbuterol, etc. I think using yohimbine along with a central nervous system stimulant could increase your blood pressure too much all at once and cause problems.<P>
As far as the dose, I tried one and a half tablets twice daily-once in the early morning and once in the early afternoon. The woman I work with uses one tablet first thing in the morning and another tablet in the early afternoon.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I'm a 27-year-old woman "bodybuilder," I guess you'd say. I'm not into competing, but I'd love to look like Monica Brant or even half as good. I've never really had a problem like this, but over the past month, I've developed really bad acne around my chin and along my jaw line. I recently started a supplement cycle that contains creatine, whey protein, DHEA, and glutamine powder. Do you think it could be the supplements causing this problem?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Supplement, not supplements-it's the DHEA that's causing the acne; I guarantee it. Even though DHEA is more mild than steroids like Anavar, something is happening with this stuff that is causing really bad acne in some women who use it. I think DHEA causes a profound shift or imbalance in the hormonal chemistry of some women-especially if they use more than 50 mg a day.
I haven't seen this problem in men who use DHEA-it probably doesn't cause much of a change in the whole "androgenic environment" for them.
Anyway, I'd stop taking DHEA immediately, keep using the other supplements, and if the acne doesn't clear up soon or if it's really bad (potentially causing scarring), I'd see a dermatologist as soon as possible and ask if he or she will put you on a medication called Aldactone (spironolactone). Aldactone is an effective yet "forgiving" diuretic, and it's also an "anti-androgen." Your doctor should put you on 50 mg of this stuff a day for 4 to 6 weeks. This will help get your androgen levels down and resolve the problem.
By the way, because Aldactone is an anti-androgen, male bodybuilders should not use it for more than a day or two (to cut up for a contest or photo shoot)-it can cause gynecomastia and hinder muscle growth.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I've got bitch tits. They started when I hit puberty, and then I did a few steroid cycles, and they got a lot worse. I haven't been on steroids for three months, and it's still getting worse. Is there anything I can do about this besides having surgery?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Bitch tits, or gynecomastia, is (for those who don't have it) the formation of breast tissue in men; it's the most common and most disturbing feminizing side effect of anabolic steroid use, and as you pointed out, it also happens to a lot of teenagers during puberty, as the body begins cranking out testosterone and then converting some of it to estrogen.<P>
The primary cause of gynecomastia is the testosterone/estrogen ratio getting screwed up. This can happen if testosterone levels decrease and estrogen levels remain unchanged or if testosterone levels stay the same and estrogen levels increase or if estrogen levels increase more than testosterone levels. Got that? Good.<P>
As you might imagine, when a person starts administering supra-physiological doses of androgens, all kinds of hormonal imbalances can result. (By the way, supra-physiological means "above" the level which is normally produced in the body.)<P>
Anyway, what's likely happening in your case is that your body's testosterone/estrogen ratio is out of balance. Since you stopped taking steroids several months ago, it's likely that your body's natural production of testosterone is not back up to speed yet, and even if your estrogen levels aren't elevated, they're out of balance and will probably exert a greater-than-normal function and continue to cause the gynecomastia to get worse.<P> 
Another thing that can cause or aggravate gynecomastia is the use of anti-androgens such as Aldactone, which I discussed in the previous Q&A. Another anti-androgen that is being used by a lot of people who don't even know it has anti-androgenic effects is a drug called Tagamet, which is used for upper-GI disturbances, such as ulcers and heartburn. Tagamet and Aldactone decrease the circulating level and biological effectiveness of testosterone and can subsequently increase the "power" of estrogen.<P>
Using drugs like HCG which increase testosterone production in an effort to get things back in balance is kind of a doubled-edged sword. As it turns out, HCG increases estrogen levels, too.<P>
For the time being, you might try using an estrogen antagonist such as Nolvadex, which can help block the effects of estrogen at breast tissue sites until your testosterone/estrogen ratios get back to normal.<P>
Another method for keeping gynecomastia from getting worse is to use a topical DHT preparation such as Andractim. This unique "rub-on" DHT compound, which, I believe, is made in Belgium and sold in France, gets into the tissue and "occupies" estrogen receptors which prevents estrogen from "doin' its thang." It actually works quite well in a number of cases, but unfortunately, Andractim is pretty hard to get in the States.<P>
Parenteral (injectable) DHT is also effective in treating persistent gynecomastia in many cases.<P>
Although there are technically ways to prevent gynecomastia and treat it, most of the guys I know who end up getting it (there are a lot) usually end up having surgery to get rid of it for good.

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>When I first started using caffeine, it really used to boost my workout intensity, but after a while, even when I took a lot, it didn't do anything for me. Then I tried ephedrine. It worked great. All my lifts went up, and I could work out longer and harder. But then it stopped working, too. I really liked the boost those products gave me-my workouts just aren't the same without that extra "kick." Is there anything else I can take?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>What you're experiencing is not uncommon. Drugs like caffeine and ephedrine "down-regulate" after they're used for a period of time. Thus, you've got to take more and more of them to get the same effect, and eventually, it reaches a point when, at a reasonable dosage, you can't even tell you took any "upper" at all.<P>
One way to avoid this is not to use these things habitually but rather just when you really need an extra boost. But, for those of you who've already "burned out" on caffeine and ephedrine, here's a new idea-I recently heard from some bodybuilders who have switched to Nicorette-a chewing gum that contains nicotine. This drug, which is now available over the counter, was designed for people who want to quit smoking.<P>
Nicotine is what's called an "alkaloid" of tobacco. It's not the stuff that causes lung cancer from smoking-that's tar and other crap.
Small doses of nicotine have an uplifting effect on the nervous system and actually stimulate neuromuscular junctions, which means your muscle fibers may "fire" more efficiently when you pick up a weight and start lifting it. This may mean greater strength and better workouts.<P>
I would warn anyone who is using Nicorette gum, or thinking about using it, to take note of the fact that large doses of nicotine have the opposite effect-they act as a depressant and can make you weaker!<P>
I wouldn't recommend that anyone chew more than one or two pieces of the two-milligram per piece dose of this gum before a workout. (Nicorette is also available in a strength of four milligrams of nicotine per piece.)<P>
It's not unlikely that a person could continue to receive the positive "stimulatory" effects of ephedrine, caffeine, and nicotine if they use them sparingly-perhaps using them in an alternating pattern and never using them on consecutive days.<P>
I have tried Nicorette and can vouch for the fact that one piece of this gum (2 mg of nicotine), about 30 to 40 minutes before a workout, can definitely "wire" you (at least it does me) and increase strength. I don't know how long you'd have to use this stuff before it "down-regulated," but I'm not going to use it long enough to find out. I'll save it for an occasional leg workout after a 14-hour work day. (By the way-Nicorette tastes "so-so," and it costs about 40 cents per piece.)<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I've really enjoyed some of Charles Poliquin's articles about weight training in the last few issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. I'm starting to believe most everything this guy says. Am I going to find out later that he's psycho and wish I hadn't wasted my time following his theories? Bill, I trust you. Please tell me, is Poliquin for real?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Charles Poliquin is definitely for real-I know it, TC knows it, Duchaine believes it, and so do over 120 medal-winning Olympic athletes.<P>
Recently, a pro bodybuilder and friend of mine, Milos Sarcev, had the chance to work out with Charles, and he couldn't believe how much he learned about how to destroy muscle fibers through proper weight-training techniques. Now he's a "believer," too.
I've been following Poliquin's teachings/theories for years, and I've incorporated many of his ideas into my own weight-training programs, but it wasn't until just a couple of weeks ago that I actually had the chance to work out with him "one on one."<P>
I have to tell you, reading about his weight-training theories is helpful, but actually having the chance to work out with him and see him demonstrate the unique adjustments that turn ordinary exercises into extraordinary punishment is incredible.<P>
It's like reading about David Copperfield's magic tricks versus seeing them performed right in front of you-it's truly amazing! Charles is very much like a magician-as soon as you think he's pulled every rabbit out of the hat that he possibly could, he continues to amaze you by pulling out more and more tricks.<P>
After having the chance to work out with Charles, I've made some important changes in my workout program, and I've gone from being a believer in his concepts to being a big, big believer in them!<P>
Because I think Charles is probably the top training expert in the field today, I'm going to make sure we share more and more of his ideas with you in future issues of <I>MM2K</I>. And since I have recently learned what an incredible difference there is between reading about his theories (which are helpful) and being able to see all these techniques he has developed, I'm going to put together a super-high-quality training video with Charles-a training video that is far above and beyond anything else that's been on the market in terms of quality information and production. I hope to have this video available by the end of the year, and guess what? I'm going to make this video (which I'll spend literally tens of thousands of dollars producing) available to <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> readers for FREE!!!<P>
That's right-I'm not going to try to make a profit off this project at all-what it's all about is a new business theory I'm working on which I think has a lot of merit-I think I'll call it the "Phillips Goodwill Theory of Business." I figure if I help enough people in this market get what they want (enjoyable, intense workouts; gains in muscle size and strength; etc.), then I'll be guaranteed to get what I want out of my business (more customers, more <I>MM2K</I> readers, more people who buy my books and other products).<P> 
I think too many people in business (today, especially-and in the bodybuilding business, in particular) focus on "me, me, me." They go about things all wrong. They try to grow their business and make money by taking care of themselves first and their customers second. My concept is to take care of the people who read my magazine (my customers) first. It might sound like an unusual way of doing things, but I'm convinced it's the best way. It's definitely not a get-rich-quick scheme-it's a "long-haul" business strategy. But I believe in it.<P>
Anyway, back to Charles Poliquin-this guy literally charges $2,000 a day for personal training sessions! And, you know what? He's booked solid! His "clients" include dozens of gold-medal-winning Olympic athletes, champion bodybuilders, successful businessmen, and even ROYALTY!<P>
So, my advice is to follow Charles' theories which we'll be presenting in <I>MM2K</I>, and watch for details on how to get this incredible FREE training video in future issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>!<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I want your honest opinion. I want to be a female bodybuilder, and I'd estimate that I need to put on about 30 lbs of muscle to be competitive. My training partner (a man) tells me that the top girls use a lot of androgenic steroids. What and how much are they using?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  I can't tell you what the top ten at the Ms. Olympia have been using, but I do know that plenty of amateur female bodybuilders use some damn serious androgens. This list includes the heavy hitters like injectable testosterone, Anadrol 50, and Parabolan (or home-brewed Finaplix). These three are the worst offenders for androgenic side effects, but many amateur women still use these drugs. In one sense, the more androgenic drugs aren't necessarily any more "lethal" than the less androgenic steroids. But the heavy hitters will deepen your voice, increase facial and body hair growth, and make your clitoris grow, and having these physical changes will definitely affect how strangers, friends, and family members treat you. Granted, I know some female bodybuilders who enjoy the companionship of fetishists and schmoes, but generally, most women like a broader range of people for social interaction. Women who use androgenic steroids will be ostracized from many aspects of everyday society, and this is why I criticize many female bodybuilders-much of this damage is avoidable and unnecessary.<P>
But before I continue, let's take time out for a reality check. The majority of top female bodybuilders all fall into a very narrow range in terms of height and weight. Most of the professional women are between 5'2" and 5'6", and hardly any of them weigh more than 150 lbs. Granted, we do see taller and bigger women competing, but they have yet to place very high. Yes, we see and hear about the real monsters of the sport like Tina Lockwood, Karla Nelson, and Ann-Marie Crooks, but these bigger women have not placed very high in contests. Although judges reward men for just being "big," women are actually marked down if they're "too big."<P>
There are plenty of short male bodybuilders (Lee Priest, et al.) who carry quite a bit more mass on their frames than a comparable-height female bodybuilder. So, the reality is that the judges of female bodybuilding contests expect a certain degree of muscle mass, but any more than this isn't necessary to win. Although Lenda Murray is a fabulous bodybuilder, I can recite a long list of amateurs who are the same height, hold more muscle, and outweigh her by at least 25 lbs.<P>
I've been watching the Olympics over the last few weeks, and I always look at the various physiques to see if I can find worthwhile correlations to bodybuilders. Something struck me about the male gymnasts: most of them have the same kind of bodies as female bodybuilders. Most have a maximal height of about 5'5" and weigh about 150 lbs. They all have bodybuilder-type bodies-a V-taper, and they're very lean. The amazing thing is that most gymnasts rarely train with weights, and all of them are randomly tested for steroids. Considering that male gymnasts don't do squats or biceps curls, most of them have pretty good quads and biceps.<P>
What's the point of all this? Well, female bodybuilders are screwing up their diets and training. I know this because most of the great female bodybuilders have been taking an amount of anabolic steroids which results in their having a far greater testosterone level than the natural testosterone level of a male gymnast. For example, I recently looked over the drug array that a lightweight female bodybuilder was using. It included 400 mg a week of Deca-Durabolin, 20 mg a day of Dianabol, and a few hundred milligrams of Equipoise. In the old product literature included with Dianabol, Ciba pointed out that ten milligrams a day (two tablets) would give an average man full androgen replacement. This particular female bodybuilder had the androgen level of four men. To remind you: a lightweight female competitor can weigh no more than 118 lbs.<P>
My advice to you: yes, you'll likely need some kind of anabolic steroid to put another 30 lbs of muscle onto your frame. But any trainer, or even another competing female bodybuilder, is wrong if he/she says that you need a lot of androgenic steroids to get big. One of the competitors I coach wanted to increase her muscle mass, and she asked for my personal recommendation. She used a basic combination of Primobolan Depot and insulin (after her workouts). Are there better anabolics? Of course. But remember, female bodybuilders don't need as much muscle as men do. The current winner of the USA is 4'11" and 105 lbs. An Olympic female gymnast weighs only 15 lbs less on absolutely no anabolics (with virtually no weight training).<P> 
The bottom line of all this: a female bodybuilder needs very little anabolics to attain the size that judges want. But most of the top female bodybuilders will be using more, simply because it makes up for appallingly bad dieting and training. Chicken breasts, broccoli, and MCT oil will not build an optimal body. The problem is this: the top women don't follow the advice in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. Most current competing female bodybuilders don't even use creatine, which would most likely put an easy five extra pounds on. If they all followed my Isocaloric Diet and trained the way Poliquin recommends, the amount of anabolics needed would be virtually nil. In the past, I've gotten a middleweight amateur into the Olympia lineup on two Dianabol a day for just a few months during the year. And if you're very industrious and can find some of the foreign esoteric non-steroidal anabolics, you could attain most of your goals with no steroid use whatsoever.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I must have Flavone X!!! Where can I get it?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  All of the new companies proclaiming they have Flavone X (notably Pro-Pharm in Clute, Texas) don't have it! The cheapest price for chrysin (the flavone in question) is through Acros Organics, a division of Fisher Scientific. The price is $40 for 25 grams. At 1.5 grams a day, which is the projected dose, this works out to less than $2.50 a day. However, other companies buying chrysin will be marking it up, usually at least four times their wholesale cost. Suddenly, chrysin would be $10 a day. Be patient. We've recently stumbled onto a metabolite of DHEA that has just as potent anti-aromatase properties, but it will be much cheaper to produce than chrysin.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : Once and for all: how much clenbuterol should I take each day and for how long? And another thing, why is it that all the animals in the studies gained muscle on clenbuterol, yet that doesn't happen in humans?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> It seems that after about two weeks or so, clenbuterol stops elevating body temperature, and fat loss also stops around this time. Even when you follow the suggested dosing schedule used in the animal research-14 days straight and a stagger of 2 days on and then 2 days off-it hasn't really extended clenbuterol's effects all that much. I usually give this very simple and blunt advice: use as much as you can stand until it stops working. But the devoted <I>MM2K</I> reader craves more precision than that. So the real question is: how much is too much?<P> Obviously, you're using too much when the side effects put you in danger. Clenbuterol is supposed to be a pure beta2 agonist, but some beta1 receptors are stimulated, and this will elevate the heart rate and blood pressure. Most doctors will tell you that borderline hypertension starts at a blood pressure reading of above 140/90. So how much you can take will vary from individual to individual. I've seen some men hit 140/90 with 2 tablets a day, yet I've also seen a female use 10(!) tablets a day and maintain a shockingly normal 120/80. You should be charting body-temperature elevations while using any thermogenic agent. Beta agonists like ephedrine and clenbuterol both have temperature plateaus. Above a certain dosage, there is no further temperature increase. This is generally a good thing. Dinitrophenol (DNP) has no plateau. Recently, a bodybuilder overdosed and elevated his body temperature to 107°. He's alive, but he's half deaf and has impaired kidney function.<P>
Here's the odd thing about the anti-catabolic effect seen in the animal studies. The researchers were using milligrams, not micrograms, to achieve the increase of muscle. Achieving the same results by using these dosages in humans would probably kill the human subject by either a stroke or a heart attack. But the researchers did stumble onto an interesting fact: the anti-catabolic effect was not from stimulation of either beta receptor.<P>
As I'm writing this, one of my Gonzo human lab rats is using a whopping dose of 18 mg of clenbuterol a day. To keep his heart rate and blood pressure normal, he's using a prescription beta blocker. Granted, he won't get the usual temperature elevation, but he's expecting some kind of marked anti-catabolic reaction. He'll be reporting the results in the first issue of my Dirty Dieting newsletter.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : In a past <I>MM2K </I>(September 1995), Dr. Jekot mentioned how anabolic steroids could be used to treat depression. Could you please explain this process?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  I can't explain the process. And I doubt that a psychiatrist could either. Years ago, there was a great outcry over Prozac from the Scientologists, claiming that Prozac contributed to (or outright caused) suicides of many patients. The FDA still deemed Prozac safe and stated that many suicides happened because the depression was more severe than originally diagnosed, and Prozac, which is for mild depression, was misprescribed. I relate this story because if you feel that you or a close friend or relative shows signs of depression, don't assume that it's mild and that a few shots of testosterone will cure it.<P> 
With that out of the way, I can postulate on a number of mechanisms by which testosterone use might elevate mood. Now keep in mind that there is a difference between relieving depression and elevating mood. A low testosterone level will lower the red-blood-cell count (anemia) and reduce the body's ability to transport oxygen to the brain. Low testosterone will also decrease muscle mass, which will lower thyroid secretion, and it will lower estrogen (from less aromatization). Many parts of the brain have estrogen receptors, and both intelligence and libido will be negatively affected from lowered estrogen levels. It also might be that cortisol levels will cause depression if not balanced with testosterone. Post-steroid depression is very real, as ex-steroid users have unusually low serum testosterone levels. Post-menopausal women are routinely prescribed methyltestosterone along with estrogen to reestablish libido. The East Germans did research showing that androgens (and not anabolics) improved the overall tone and recuperation of the central nervous system. So, through many mechanisms and pathways, testosterone will elevate mood and, at times, cure certain types of mild depression. But this therapy shouldn't be done as a self-remedy.<P>
 

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I got this price list from a mail-order place here in America that has cool stuff like IGF-1, Nolvadex, Clomid, and other goodies. I called the place up, and they assured me that what they are doing is legal. Is this true? And will I get my goods if I order something?<P></B>


<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  No, this isn't true (it's not legal), but, yes, you'll probably get your goods. As scams go, this appears to be a simple and relatively risk free one. The owner of this particular company you mentioned was able to make about $30,000 tax free a year when he was still in high school. You could pull the same scam. Here's how it works:<P>
The problem with many bodybuilders who want to buy prescription drugs is that they won't make the effort to find the drugs. Most of my "Ask the Guru" mail are letters asking for drug sources. As I've mentioned before, there are a number of foreign pharmacies, notably in Turkey, Greece, Mexico, and Taiwan, that will sell you prescription drugs, mostly the steroid-accessory drugs like anti-estrogens, thyroids, beta agonists, etc. The majority of these drugs are not DEA regulated, nor are they on the alert list. Payment is made by either cash or U.S. Postal money order. But the majority of potential customers isn't aware of these mail-order outfits.<P> 
What you have stumbled onto with this American mail-order company is a remailing scam. Let's say you want a box of clenbuterol. The price is $20. You mail the American company the $20, plus shipping. The owner of this company deposits your money into his account. He has a bunch of price lists from foreign pharmacies, and he picks one that sells clenbuterol for $5 a box. He goes to the post office and gets a money order for the cost of a box of clenbuterol with shipping. He mails the money order out to the foreign pharmacy but puts the order in your name. The foreign pharmacy will ship the clenbuterol to your address. Everybody's happy. The scamster has just made $15 profit. The foreign pharmacy makes money, and 90+% of the time, the American customer gets his clenbuterol.<P>
So what's wrong with this scam? It's not legal for the American company to do this. In fact, it's a felony under the fraud statutes. Some of these drugs are on the alert list (or are scheduled drugs) and might be confiscated. At the very least, the buyer will lose his/her money, or worse, postal inspectors will question the addressee. And the American company will assume hardly any risk.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I need your help. I'm 24 years old, 5'4", and 145 lbs. I'm a single mom of twin boys. I weighed 220 lbs when I gave birth, but I've lost 75 lbs. Yet I'm still at 28% bodyfat. I've tried prescription diet pills, but I'm still stuck at this weight. I go to school full-time and only make $900 a month, so I can't afford a gym membership. But I work out at home with water-filled jugs and soup cans. Is Nolvadex the solution to my problem? How much does it cost, and where can I get it?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  My business manager, Laura Moore, will be telephoning you to get you set up with a membership at Contem-porary in Buffalo, NY-a real gym which is convenient to your home and that offers child care. I'll pay for a year membership for you, along with six months of child-care costs. Also, we'll be mailing a free copy of my diet book BODYOPUS.
As to your question, I doubt Nolvadex will help with your further weight loss. But you should get some blood tests (and as a single mom, your state should have some free medical services) to check your thyroid. If prescription appetite suppressants didn't work, you might have a very slow metabolism. If your morning body temperature is less than 97.8°, you might find that you are hypothyroidal. If this is so and is confirmed by your blood tests, your doctor will have no problem writing a script for Synthroid. Between this and following any of the three diets in BODYOPUS, you should be able to get past your sticking points. All the best, and do stay in touch.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : My wife wants to use TwinLab's Male Fuel, but the warning on the back	states that it shouldn't be used by women. Why not?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> It's not the Yohimbe that's the problem in Male Fuel but the small amount of saw-palmetto extract. There's research which shows that saw palmetto affects the dihydrotestosterone in the body by interfering with the transfer of any testosterone from the outside of the cell receptor into the nucleus of the cell. In pregnancy, a male fetus needs a small amount of DHT for full fetal development. So stopping DHT's function during pregnancy could cause malformation of the child. In all actuality, the minuscule amount of saw palmetto (100 mg per day) probably wouldn't affect a pregnancy. But who's to know beforehand? Your wife could use Twin's Yohimbe Fuel, as it has no saw palmetto in it.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I've been hearing about a fairly new drug (steroid) called methyltrienolone. One of the components is Ralgro (commonly used for cattle). So what is methyltrienolone, and how is it produced? The asking price is around $100 for 10 cc's.<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Ralgro is the trade name of an estrogenic anabolic cattle implant called zeranol. It's derived from a fungus that grows on corn. Over ten years ago, Ralgro was used by powerlifters who simply ground up the pellets using a mortar and pestle and mixed the resultant fine powder with veterinary oil-based vitamins. Although there was a slight anabolic effect, a number of users did report that it caused gynecomastia. The original reason to use Ralgro was because it was an anabolic that wasn't on the banned drug list. Since that time, zeranol has been added to the list.<P>
Methyltrienolone is a black-market mixture of Finaplix (trenbolone) and Ralgro, both ground into a powder and somewhat dissolved in oil. I say "somewhat" because only part of both steroids is dissolved, as much of the binders that make up the pellets will not dissolve. You would call this an oily suspension, and the injection site will be very slow releasing, probably irritating, and not necessarily (most probably not) sterile.<P> 
Okay, it's expensive, illegal, possibly dirty, dangerous, and might show up on a drug test for up to a year after it's injected, but is it effective? Well, probably yes. We already know that adding any type of estrogen to an anabolic will increase its effectiveness. And most steroid users already know that the trenbolones (both Parabolan and Finaplix) are very potent anabolics. Some steroid users claim that trenbolone is the most potent anabolic they've ever used. I'm predicting that the Finaplix and Ralgro combination is probably very synergistic, as the Ralgro will enhance the trenbolone effect and cause a very nice growth hormone and IGF-1 boost. However, since Ralgro acts like an estrogen and Finaplix acts like a progesterone, I would expect the potential for gynecomastia to be very high. And I would imagine that using an estrogen antagonist (Nolvadex) and a progesterone antagonist (RU 486) would defeat the synergistic effects. As long as you have $4,000 in your bank account for gyno surgery, you might grow quite well on the stuff. Just don't be crying to me if you have to get a chunk of your ass removed after you get a nasty infection. For those who are interested in such things, in the first issue of the Dirty Dieting newsletter, I'll have a step-by-step synopsis of how to convert Finaplix into methyltrienolone, the most anabolic and toxic steroid on the planet.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> Your assistant who writes for MuscleMag talked about ipriflavone and how it's an anabolic. Could I use this instead of steroids? How much does it cost, and how much should I use?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Osteochin is its trade name in Hungary, and it costs only $8 for fifty 200-mg tablets. In Italy, the trade name is Osteofix, and thirty 200-mg tablets cost $32. Obviously, Hungary has the better buy. I'm predicting that the anabolic dosage will be about one gram a day. I would think that you'd find the anabolic action on a par with the milder anabolic steroids like Oxandrin, Winstrol, and Primobolan, all of which are only anabolic at very high milligram amounts. For most male bodybuilders, the more potent anabolic steroids will always be the best anabolic agents. However, in female bodybuilding and fitness, I believe it's possible to build a winning body in either sport with ipriflavone, insulin, and DNP.<P> 

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>I'm a very sexually active bodybuilder. I can usually have up to five or six orgasms before I lose my erection. Sometimes my girlfriend and I have long sessions twice a day. How does sex affect my testosterone level?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Your testosterone level is obviously more than fine. But you might want to pack a few meals so you can eat every two hours during those long sessions.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>Recently, I did two cycles of testosterone. I'm 20 years old and have looked like Don Knott's bastard son all my life. After taking the testosterone, I jumped to 170 lbs. The only problem is my nipples look like pine cones. My brother calls me "milky-nips." Recommend a steroid to make it go away.<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  You must have either a high amount of estrogen receptors in your breast tissue, or you might have too much estrogen-converting enzyme. So, stay away from testosterone, and try to use the classic non-aromatizing steroids which are listed in the World Anabolic Review. However, you might never get your nipples back to normal, and you should investigate surgery. If you have insurance, your policy should cover the cost of the surgery.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I use Winstrol three times a year, and every time I do a cycle, I lose my sex drive. I used HCG (5,000 IU every 4 days), and my testicles blew up in only 4 days. But still no sex drive. I tried Endo-Pro, and I got my libido back, but now I have gyno. What should I do?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  This is very unusual. Winstrol should affect your testosterone and estrogen levels. As a matter of fact, many people with AIDS get a libido boost from Winstrol. I have a feeling that the HCG had a delayed reaction on you-the effects probably weren't caused by the Endo-Pro. In the future, you should have a blood test done towards the end of your Winstrol cycle to determine what your serum testosterone level is. It's probably within the normal range. It might be that the various steroids are working on things that we aren't aware of, including orphan receptors or nitric-oxide production. You have stumped me on this one. Nevertheless, I recommend that you switch to Clomid rather than HCG. Clomid will give you just as much of a testosterone elevation, but it's also an anti-estrogen, which should help you avoid gyno.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>I've been trying to make my upper pecs grow. My lower pecs are well developed from years of heavy benching and dipping. I've tried using incline barbell presses, but nothing happened. I'm now doing incline dumbbell presses with a pair of 100-lb weights, and I still don't feel any soreness in the upper pecs. Any suggestions?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>I would say that using the wrong grip is the main cause of improper targeting of the clavicular pectorals (a.k.a. upper pecs). Try adjusting your grip in the following way:<P>
For incline dumbbell presses: try pressing the dumbbells with a semi-supinated grip (with the palms and dumbbells facing each other) instead of the pronated (conventional, palms and weights facing away from your body) grip. If you're using a pronated grip and you're using large dumbbells, the plates literally make contact with the front delts and prevent you from lowering the weight all the way. In other words, your pecs can't get a maximal stretch. When the palms face each other, you can go down four to six inches deeper than before, thus providing greater stimulation to the pecs.<P>
For incline flyes: you'll maximize upper-pec involvement if you meet the following three conditions:<P>
1.	Set the bench at a 75° angle.<P>
2.	Grab the dumbbells using a pronated grip (palms facing away from you), instead of the standard semi-supinated grip (palms facing each other). That means throughout the movement, your thumbs will be facing the ceiling. This will force you to drop your training weight considerably, but don't worry, the load on the pecs will increase.<P>
3.	In the bottom position of the flye movement, align your elbows with your ears. (Most people align their weights and elbows with their upper pecs in this movement.)<P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> I've been training at home for the last four years, but now I'm thinking about joining a gym. Can you give me some pointers on what to look for in a quality gym?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>It all depends on your level of training knowledge. In other words, if you're very confident about setting up your own training programs or can learn a lot on your own, then only selection and variety of equipment will matter. However, if you're inexperienced, untrained, and over the age of 30, make sure you get answers to the following questions:<P>
1. What level of education do the gym's employees have? If they're not kinesiology or sport-science graduates, are they at least certified by a recognized organization such as the National Strength and Conditioning Association or the International Sport Science Associa-tion? Nonetheless, keep in mind that formal education isn't as hot as it's reputed to be. I've seen physical-education graduates who knew the distal attachment of the anconeus muscle yet didn't know how to teach a simple triceps extension. Over the years, I've met quite a few very knowledgeable trainers who were high-school dropouts, like Pierre Roy and Louie Simmons. Regardless of their lack of formal education, they had a passion for learning how to train properly. They're probably some of the best trainers in the field, and they have a track record for increasing lean body mass and strength in all their trainees.<P> 
A note regarding personal trainers: there are a large number of incompetent ones out there. Recently, while working out in a very exclusive, well-equipped gym in the Denver area, I noticed a ratio of one personal trainer to one gym member. One of the girls working as a personal trainer was wearing spandex, but she didn't look like a personal trainer-from the waist down, the best way to describe her would be "cottage cheese in fish net." You don't have to look like Mr. or Ms. Olympia to be a good personal trainer, but you should probably look like you at least work out.<P>
Regapdless of formal education, the staff should be able to administer some basic physiological tests to correctly individualize youp training program. For example, can they interpret an ECG reading during your aerobic test (a stress test)? Please note that pepforming an ECG at rest doesn't identify much in terms of potential problems. I should know-I'm part of the 1 out of 20 people who has a normal wave pattern while I'm having a heart attack. True cardiac pathology will only show up during a stress test.<P>
2. How often will they change your program? Most health clubs are just happy to get you to sign and don't give a rat's ass about whether or not you're going to make progress. Do you have access to a personal trainer? Can you bring in your own personal trainer without feeling like you're crossing the former border into East Germany? The gym may have great equipment, but the staff may consist of a full set of dorks.<P>
3. Are they prepared to deal with a medical-emergency situation? Does the staff know at least some CPR, and do they have a medical-emergency-evacuation plan? If you're over the age of 30, these may very well be important.<P> 
4. Is the weight room supervised at all times? This relates to point three. I recently heard about a case where a health club was forced to close down after a member had a stroke on the Nautilus decline-press machine, and no one noticed for 20 minutes. Because of his reclining position, the other gym members thought he was "just resting."<P>
5. Is the gym well maintained? Are the dumbbells returned to the right spot, or are they put away randomly? Are the plate racks correctly stacked? (A pet peeve of mine. Nothing pisses me off more than people who stack the plates wherever they want.) Hunting down dumbbells and plates will make you lose valuable time. Is the upholstery clean and well maintained, or does it have a lot of rips and smell like a camel's ass?<P>
6. How clean is the air? A gym visited in the winter may smell okay, but in the summer, it may remind you of the inside of an armored tank following a bean meal. Make sure the air's recycled often.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>My wrists hurt when I do upright rows. Should I stop doing this exercise, or can I just change the way I'm doing them? </B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>There are three things you can do to alleviate the stress on the wrists when doing upright rows: 
Use an EZ-curl bar, and put your hands so they're positioned as they'd be if you were curling. The angle on the bar may permit pain-free movement.<P>
Or use a cable machine, and do the movement using a rope with bulky rubber ends (the one normally used for triceps pressdowns).<P>
If you don't have an EZ-curl bar or a rope, do the rows with a regular barbell, but don't lift the bar higher than your clavicle (collarbone).

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> What's the best time of day to train in order to get the best results from my workouts? I work flexible hours, so I can train whenever I want.</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Studies have shown that maximal strength levels reach their peak values at both 3 and 11 hours after a person wakes up. In other words, if you wake up at 7:00 a.m., you'll get optimum results if you train at 10:00 a.m. or 6:00 p.m. There are numerous reasons which could explain these strength-enhanced hours-hormonal fluctuations and neural facilitation are a couple. Another reason you might want to wait a few hours after getting up before weight training is because of the temperature fluctuation of synovial fluid. Synovial fluid is, in laymen's terms, joint lubricant. Apparently, it takes about three hours before the joints reach an optimal level of warmth, and the warmer your joints are, the more you can lift and the less likely you are to injure yourself.<P> 
However, don't be overly concerned with these findings if your schedule doesn't allow you to train at these hours. Many top bodybuilders have trained at very odd times yet displayed very impressive physiques. For example, Bill Pearl trains at 3:00 a.m., as did Boyer Coe in the late '70's and early '80's.<P> 



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> Squats hurt my lower back. Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening? Am I doing something wrong?</B> 
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Okay. If you did squats with your back at a 90° angle, you'd be squatting with a perfectly straight back. However, let's say you weigh roughly 200 lbs and you squat 300 lbs but you lean forward at about a 70° angle. Research indicates that the pressure on the lower back, 5L vertebra will be roughly 1,500 lbs. Let's say you lean forward an extra 10°. The pressure on your spine would then climb up to approximately 1,980 lbs. That extra 10° lean increases the pressure almost 500 lbs or a third more in this case!
Now, the good news. With proper stretching and technical coaching, you can squat at an 80° angle, which would reduce the load on the spine to just over 1,000 lbs. Get your back to a 90° angle, and the pressure on the 5L vertebra drops to about 500 lbs-that's one-fourth of the pressure created from a squat using the same weight with a 60° lean; i.e., 1,500 fewer pounds of pressure on your spine!<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> There seems to be a difference in attaining maximal strength and maximal size, but I'm interested in gaining both. Is it possible to achieve both goals at the same time? If so, how?</B> 
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Yes, it's quite possible. You only have to look at the weightlifters and powerlifters from the 90-kg (about 200-lb) and above weight classes. They have tremendous strength levels coupled with high degrees of muscle size. The key to achieving this dual goal is in the sequencing of the training methods. If both maximal strength and maximal size are your training goals, you should always begin your weight workouts with neural training; that is, low repetitions for multiple sets. Then, once your central nervous system is excited, use that opportunity to do hypertrophy work in this enhanced neural zone. To make this clear, let's use an example of someone who can bench press 300 lbs for a single rep. The athlete would rest 3-5 minutes between work sets and only 60 seconds between warm-up sets. Here's what a training program would look like:<P> 
Warm up<BR> 
1. Empty bar for 10 reps<BR>
2. 5 x 135 lbs<BR>
3. 3 x 185 lbs<BR>
4. 1 x 225 lbs<BR>
5. 1 x 265 lbs<BR>
Neural work<P>
Perform 3 sets of 1 rep with 285 lbs. On each subsequent chest workout, add 1 single with that weight. In other words, the next time you work chest, you'd do four sets of one rep. When you can do eight singles with that weight, increase the weight.<P>
Now, move on to some "growth" work.<P>
Hypertrophy work<P>
Perform 5 sets of 5 reps with 235 lbs. When you're able to complete all sets of five reps, increase the load by five percent.
This training system was inspired by former World Weightlifting Champion Doug Hepburn. Doug published a series of lifting courses a few years ago, and they all produce results. Even though the nutritional guidelines he prescribes aren't consistent with modern findings in some instances, the training methodology is still excellent for building size and strength.<P>
These courses can be purchased from Iron Mind Enterprises at 916-265-6725 (phone) or 916-265-4876 (fax). This company also sells a wide variety of effective strengthening devices, books, courses, and videos. Give them a call, and ask for their catalogue.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> What's your opinion of the pec-dec exercise? Is it a good exercise for the chest?</B> 
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Well, the pec-dec is not going to replace the bench press as the cornerstone movement in chest development. And I believe most of the older pec-dec machines can cause long-term damage to your shoulders. With some of the older units, it was possible to do a shoulder adduction with the arm externally rotated. This is bad news if you want to remain injury free. The prime mover in the pec-dec is the pectoralis major, but the pec major is also an internal rotator of the humerus (upper-arm bone) when your arm is externally rotated. If you're trying to do a shoulder adduction with external rotation, you're placing the joint in an unnatural position. But many of the newer machines, like the Flex pec-dec, require that you grab a handle, thus more closely mimicking dumbbell flyes. These are much safer.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> What do you think of direct neck training? What do you think of neck machines? What's the best neck exercise for neck development?</B> 
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>I'm usually wary of prescribing neck exercises in writing because, unlike the elbow, the neck can produce very complex movement patterns. I don't know of a single company that produces an ideal neck-training machine which can overload the neck muscles efficiently. Considering the present state of the art in equipment, I'd recommend manual-resistance exercises for training the neck muscles, making sure the resistance is always applied at a 90° angle to the head. For anything more specific, I suggest you ask a competent chiropractor or osteopath to teach you how to train these muscles properly.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> If I'm using the low-calorie lean-mass stimulator Phosphagain (which contains creatine monohydrate), do I need to take Phosphagen or Phosphagen HP (which also contain creatine monohydrate)?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> The three supplements you mentioned, or any supplement that contains an effective dose of creatine monohydrate, will probably help your bodybuilding efforts; however, you certainly don't have to use all three of the products you mentioned.<P>
	Each serving of Phosphagain contains about 7 grams of creatine monohydrate, and a heaping teaspoon of Phosphagen contains about 5 grams of creatine monohydrate, and a serving of Phosphagen HP also contains about 5 grams of creatine monohydrate.<P>
As long as you start with a "loading phase" of 20 to 30 grams of creatine monohydrate for 5 to 7 days and then go to a "maintenance dose" of 5 to 10 grams of creatine monohydrate a day, I don't really think it makes much difference where it comes from.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I read an article in the last issue
of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> [January 1995] about this new supplement called HMB.  I was wondering
if it's all right to use this stuff along with creatine monohydrate.  If I did "stack" these two
supplements--what type of gains do you think I would get?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I have no reason to believe it wouldn't be okay to take HMB along with creatine monohydrate--they're both naturally occurring micronutrients.  I've been using both of them for the past couple of months, and the results have been quite nice.</P>
<P>	An observation I've made about creatine monohydrate is that it seems to produce big gains in body weight the first month you use it, and then I think your muscles become pretty much "saturated" with it, and your gains kind of "level out."  However, since there is no reason to stop taking creatine monohydrate (at least no reason I know of), you don't have the same problem with it as you do with steroids.  Let me explain--any bodybuilder who is using steroids and cares at all about his or her health is, at some point, going to have to go off the drugs to let the body "normalize" and to reduce the risk of serious side effects.</P>
<P>	Now, when most bodybuilders go off steroids, they lose much of the weight and strength gains they made when they were on them.</P>
<P>	With creatine monohydrate, you can just keep taking the supplement and maintain those great gains in size and strength and perhaps make even more gains (although I doubt they would be as noticeable as they were in the first month of use). </P>
<P>	Now, with HMB use, the strength gains can be extremely noticeable in a short period of time.  The preliminary results of an HMB study that just started a few weeks ago showed that only eight days into the study, weight trainers who used three grams of HMB a day doubled their strength gains over the weight trainers who followed the same exercise and nutrition program but did not use HMB!</P>
<P>	As far as the lean-mass gains from HMB go, I think those will happen more gradually than they do with creatine monohydrate.  Remember, the initial weight gain from creatine is probably caused by a "cell-volumizing" effect--it's good solid weight that can make your muscles feel bigger and fuller, but it's not necessarily new contractile protein tissue.</P>
<P>	When I started using HMB, I put on four solid pounds the first month I was using it and noticed a significant increase in strength.  The second month I was on HMB, I gained another four pounds and continued to set new "PR's" (personal records) in lifts like the bench press and leg extension.</P>
<P>	Now, I have no evidence that my gains are "typical"--I'm certain different people will experience different results, but I believe HMB is going to be the type of supplement that produces gains over an extended period of time.</P>
<P>	In my opinion, "stacking" creatine monohydrate and HMB is a great idea!  If someone told me they were going to use only two bodybuilding supplements, those are the ones I would recommend!</P>
<P>		One last "semi-related" note--in the last issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, I reported that weight trainers who used HMB gained 55% more lean mass, in only 3 weeks, than weight trainers who did not use 3 grams of HMB.  After communicating with the doctors who performed this study, I made a very interesting discovery.  Actually, the trainers who used 3 grams of HMB a day gained anywhere between 55% and <B>300%</B> more lean mass--so when we reported "55% greater gains" in that issue, we were definitely being conservative!

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I heard testosterone injections may soon be approved in the United States as a form of male birth control. I don't understand why testosterone would be approved as a form of birth control but not approved as a muscle builder. With some of these new uses for testosterone, do you think there's any chance the laws regarding doctors prescribing steroids for bodybuilders will change?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> <P>It's been almost four years since I first wrote about the use of testosterone as a form of male birth control.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Studies have demonstrated that weekly injections of drugs like testosterone enanthate are extremely effective (similar to the birth control pill for women).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Also, the studies which evaluated testosterone's effects as a form of birth control for men have also demonstrated an extremely low incident of side effects.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Basically, researchers have determined that giving men a weekly injection of 200 mg of testosterone is pretty darn safe.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Coincidentally, 200 mg of testosterone administered each week to someone who is training with weights and consuming a nutritious diet is definitely a high enough dosage to accelerate gains in muscle size and strength in most men. I expect the FDA will approve testosterone injections as a form of birth control in the United States in the not-too-distant future. Obviously, bodybuilders will be lining up left and right to take advantage of this new opportunity to get legal testosterone injections!</P>
<P></P>
<P>But, just because the use of testosterone as a form of birth control may be approved by the FDA, this does not mean there is any hope whatsoever testosterone or other androgens (steroids) will be approved for muscle-building purposes.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I've noticed there are quite a few Phosphagain "copycat" products coming out on the market. One product in particular, distributed by Strength Systems USA, supposedly works just like Phosphagain, but it's less expensive. Do you know if these other products are as good as Phosphagain?
<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> <P>Those of you who read <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> regularly have heard all about Phosphagain by now... I don't need to go on and on about how good I think this product is and how two double-blind, placebo-controlled, university studies have demonstrated the product's powerful effects. You already know all that stuff.  But I think all of these new Phosphagain "rip-off" products are worth commenting on.<P>

<P>What's going on here is that a lot of other supplement companies are convinced Phosphagain is a powerful bodybuilding formula, and it's clear consumers are impressed with this product as well.</P>

<P>Anyway, all of these other supplement companies are coming out with products which they claim are like Phosphagain for one reason... <I>Money!</I> They're simply trying to feed off the "market" Phosphagain has created.</P>

<P>It's funny to see all of these companies coming out with "<B>low-calorie</B> mass stimulators" after they have sold literally thousands of cans of <B>high-calorie</B> mass-building products over the last few years. (Pretty hypocritical, wouldn't you say?)</P>

<P>The thing about this scenario that kind of pisses me off is that Experimental and Applied Sciences (EAS), the inventor of Phosphagain, spent a tremendous amount of time and literally tens of thousands of dollars developing, formulating, and then university testing Phosphagain. And, EAS continues to allocate a percentage of their sales towards future studies, not only on Phosphagain but on other supplements that may help bodybuilders gain size and strength faster.</P>

<P>It's obvious that only through research (which costs a lot of money!) are we going to be able to advance bodybuilding supplementation--I mean really take it to the level where you can get "drug-like" effects without using illegal and possibly dangerous pharmaceutical substances.</P>

<P>EAS is a very young supplement company, but it has already spent more money on research than most bodybuilding supplement companies that have been around for over a decade! (Call a representative of Strength Systems USA and ask how much money they've spent on university research since they were founded. I'll bet the answer is not one stinking dollar!)</P>

<P>EAS's present research portfolio calls for them to spend over a million dollars over the next 18 months. And, these studies aren't just on EAS products--there are studies planned to try to discover what aspects of the muscle-building process are sensitive to nutritional intervention. Information like this has to be known before new, even better, supplements can be developed.</P>

<P>Now, when these other companies try to take sales away from EAS, what they're really doing is taking money away from research that, in the long run, could tremendously benefit bodybuilders everywhere!  So, in effect, these rip-off companies are <I>hurting</I> bodybuilders--<I>not helping them!</I></P>

<P>Of course, EAS, like any other company, is in business to make a profit. But EAS also has a true commitment to furthering the science of bodybuilding supplementation, whereas it seems many of the other companies in this industry have making money as their <I>one and only objective.</I></P>

<P>Now--back to your question:  the one company you asked about, Strength Systems USA, is one that I don't even take seriously. My opinion is that they have an awful reputation. I personally regard this company as a desperate "bottom feeder" in the supplement business.</P>

<P>There are companies I have a lower regard for than Strength Systems, but <I>there aren't many, I assure you!</I></P>

<P>You should also keep in mind that oftentimes these "knock-off products" are not at all what they're supposed to be. As I reported in a previous issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, we recently tested one of the Phosphagain "rip-off" products that is distributed by a company in the Northeast, and <I>it only contained half as much creatine as Phosphagain!</I> (Creatine is one of the most expensive and important ingredients in Phosphagain. Without it, I can't imagine that the formula would have the same effects.)</P>

<P>Sometimes when a company advertises a lower price and "better value," what you really end up getting if you buy their product is <I>ripped off.</I></P>

<P>And, in the case of Phosphagain, remember that none of these other products have been proven to be as good as or better than Phosphagain. As a matter of fact, EAS has issued a "$30,000 bounty" to any company that can prove through legitimate, published, university studies that its' formula is as good as or better than Phosphagain's! Did you know <B>not one</B> of these Phosphagain "knock-off" products has been tested in university studies like Phosphagain has?</P>

<P>The truth is, the other companies, that are trying to ride on the coattails of Phosphagain's success, probably don't even understand the science behind the product. As a matter of fact, many of the bodybuilding supplement companies in business today don't even have scientists on their staff. They think research means going to the library and looking up words in the dictionary. They're basically <I>clueless</I>!

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I wish I could offer you some input here, but to be honest, I didn't get a very good look at the competitors in the Ms. Olympia. Yes... I was at the show and yes... I sat in the 5th row where I <I>should have</I> been able to "size up" the competitors.  Unfortunately, things didn't work out that way.<P>
Here's the story:<BR> When I'm here in Golden, I work about 70 hours a week--I really don't do anything but write, read, and move paper each day. When I go home, I try to catch a workout and just kick back.<P> 
On the rare occasion when I get out of town, I have a bad habit of going a bit "crazy." Such was the case when I went to the Olympia in Atlanta.<P>
On the day the Ms. Olympia contest was held, I ran into some old bodybuilding buddies, and we ended up hanging out at a pub drinking beer and eating Phosphagain<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP> bars all day.<P>
By the time my pals and I got to the Ms. Olympia finals and took our seats, I think we had done away with a couple of cases of Heineken, not to mention about 24 Phosphagain bars (which I think may have an effect on increasing alcohol uptake by the brain--I'm not sure--I'm going to have to ask Anthony Almada about this.)<P>
And, to make matters worse, I didn't bring my glasses (all that reading has made me nearsighted).<P>
Bottom line--<I>I couldn't tell if I was watching the damn Mr. or Ms. Olympia!</I> If you would have told me Kim Chizevsky was Dorian Yates, I would have had no good reason to argue with you!<P>
So, as far as giving you some feedback on the judging of this year's event, I'm afraid I'm about as worthless as tits on a boar.<P>
Now, if you want some feedback on the overall event--I can tell you this Olympia, like others I've attended over the past few years, was impressively well run.  I can also confirm the nightlife in Atlanta is outstanding--<I>it's a great place to party.</I><P>
Sorry I couldn't be of more help!

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> Which supplement works
better--creatine phosphate or creatine monohydrate?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> All of the studies which I have reviewed over the past few years that show increases in lean mass and strength have used creatine monohydrate.  I'm not aware of any studies that show taking creatine phosphate orally has any positive effects.  (I think creatine phosphate has to be injected to work.)<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> What do you think are the most
common mistakes bodybuilders make that keep them from gaining size and strength?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> First of all, I think most bodybuilders work out too often and for too long.  The amount of muscle size and strength you build is <B>not</B> determined by the amount of time you spend in the gym.  If it were, there would be a lot more big and strong bodybuilders around!<P>  
	I think short, intense workouts that give your body the proper "stimulus" for new muscle growth without dipping too far into its "recovery potential" are best.  I recommend that people only work out with weights three or four times a week and for no more than an hour at a time.<P>
	Another mistake I think bodybuilders make is they don't feed their bodies often enough throughout the day.  I believe that to keep your body in an optimal state for building new muscle tissue, you've got to have a constant influx of nutrients into the body and very stable insulin levels.  The best way to accomplish this is to eat a nutrient-rich carbohydrate and protein-containing meal around every three hours throughout the day.<P>
	Another mistake bodybuilders make is that they just don't "plan" well enough.  Remember that old saying, "If you fail to plan, you're really planning to fail"?  Well, when it comes to bodybuilding, that's completely true!  If you don't use an exercise and nutrition log, you might want to think about it.  It's a great way to keep track of your progress (or lack of progress), and it's a great tool for "troubleshooting" your bodybuilding program.<P>
	And, finally, I think many bodybuilders could make better gains if they learned how to use bodybuilding supplements properly. Unfortunately, in my opinion, there are more supplements on the market that <B>don't</B> work than ones that <B>do</B>.  You've got to have the knowledge about which ones to use and which ones to avoid.  Even if you're using the best supplements, you've got to know how to take them--even the best supplements, used in a haphazard way, will probably not produce the desired results.

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> What's the latest word on IGF-1? Are bodybuilders getting good results with this stuff?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I've been in touch with quite a few weight trainers who are experimenting with various forms of IGF-1, and the results are all over the board. Some guys contend the stuff is "working miracles" for them while others can't even tell they're taking it.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Of course, one of the problems you have with trying to decipher this "anecdotal" evidence is most people don't even know if the IGF-1 they're using is real or counterfeit. And, no one is still quite sure which dosages are best.</P>
<P></P>
<P>A number of human studies involving IGF-1 are in the planning stages, and I really think to figure this thing out, we're going to have to wait for the scientists to catch up with the enthusiasm of bodybuilders.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Only through detailed clinical studies will we be able to answer the most important questions about IGF-1, which are basically how much of the stuff do you have to take to promote muscle gains, and what are the side effects?</P>
<P></P>
<P>I recommend that people sit back and wait for more information on IGF-1 to become available before they bother messing with it.

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I recently came across a bottle of nandrolone decanoate (Deca) distributed by Steris Labs. I'm sending a sample of the box and an empty vial for you to take a look at. Can you tell if it's legit?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> The box you sent is definitely not counterfeit. The easiest way to tell with this box is that all of the copy which appears in green ink is indented onto the box. It's put on with a type of metal roller--not your standard printing press. All of the counterfeit forms of Steris I've seen have the ink just printed on the box, just like these words are printed on the piece of paper you're reading right now. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Also, on the empty vial of Deca you sent with this box is another sign that tells me this stuff is real. The entire label is varnished (glossy) except for about a one quarter-inch space where the lot number and expiration date are put on. I haven't seen any counterfeiters do this yet either.</P>
<P></P>
<P>So as far as I can tell, the box and label on this vial are legitimate. Of course, that means what was in the vial was probably real nandrolone decanoate.

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I've been trying to get that "cut" look forever. A guy at my gym suggested I try a new supplement called "Bromocriptine." He said it's really great for getting that super-hard look. Have you heard of this stuff?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> <P>Bromocriptine is not a supplement. It's a drug; it's available by prescription only in the United States, but I've heard some people are getting it through foreign mail-order sources.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Bromocriptine is an anti-Parkinson's disease drug which acts in a similar manner as L-dopa. In a recent study, Bromocriptine was shown to dramatically increase fat loss. However, I certainly would not recommend this drug to bodybuilders who want to get that solid, muscular look. I'd wait until more research is done on Bromocriptine before even thinking of messing with it. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The best way to get cut that I know of is to train hard with weights and consume a few hundred less calories per day than your body normally burns off. You're not going to get super-muscular overnight--I don't care what you take. Not even clenbuterol (which is probably the best "cutting-up" drug used by bodybuilders these days) will help you get shredded if you're consuming more calories than your body burns off each day.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> In the last issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, you mentioned you were experimenting with hydroxy citric acid (HCA)... a new "fat burner." I was wondering if you've noticed any positive results from using that supplement?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I've been using HCA regularly for about seven weeks now, and to be honest, I haven't really noticed a loss in bodyfat.Since I started taking HCA, I've kept my caloric intake pretty steady, so if the stuff produced "dramatic" results, I think I would have seen them by now.<P>I think HCA might be one of those fat-burning supplements that helps people who are extremely overweight more than people who are already lean.<P>Before and after I used HCA, my bodyfat was at about 7.5%. If I had it my way, my bodyfat would always be 6%. But once I get down below 8% bodyfat, my system fights like hell to hang onto what adipose tissue remains. So, my lack of results with HCA may not be typical of what the average, "overweight/overfat" person might experience.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> If I were to go steroid shopping
in Europe, what would I find as of early 1996?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> First of all, I want to make it <I>very</I> clear that if you are planning to buy steroids in another country and bring them back into the United States, you will be committing a felony.  The Feds take smuggling (especially smuggling controlled substances) <I>very seriously.</I><P>
	If you go to a European country and buy steroids where they are legal or you have a doctor prescribe them for you in another country and have the doctor administer the steroids or you self-administer the drugs, then come back to the United States, I don't think you've broken any laws.<P>
	Anyway, I like to keep up on what's happening around the world on the steroid market just for the sake of staying informed--I've followed this issue for so long I just wouldn't feel right if I let up now.<P>
	The following is the latest information I have about steroid availability in Europe which addresses your question:<P>
	<B>Germany</B>--forget it!  Steroids are regulated in this country, just like they are in the United States.  One of the best steroids that used to be available in Germany, Primobolan 50 orals, hasn't been made in years.  Primobolan S (25-mg Primobolan tabs) are still available but only with a prescription.<P>
	<B>Belgium</B>--steroids are controlled here now, too!  If you had a prescription, you could get Stromba tabs, 50 mg Strombaject, Proviron, and Sustanon.<P>
	<B>France</B>--some parts of France are just like Mexico in that they are infested with pharmacies.  Paris Norde (North Paris) is one example.  Some pharmacists here will "bend the rules" for a little extra cash.  If you get lucky in Paris Norde, you might be able to pick up some Nilevar, Dynabolon, and some 50-mg Deca vials.  (Parabolan, a once popular French steroid, was discontinued about a year ago.)<P>
	<B>Spain</B>--your best bet in Barcelona would be to hook up with an elite bodybuilder from that country and "motivate" him to help you get plugged into the Spanish black market.  There you might find Winstrol tabs, Winstrol Depot, Primobolan Depot, Testex 250, Proviron, Testoviron Depot, Primobolan S, and Oxitisona 50 (this product was discontinued four years ago and is just about gone--the final numbers of the last batch of Oxitisona 50 are lot E-5, 12-96 Exp).<P>
	<B>Italy</B>--you need a prescription to get 'roids in this country.  But if you had one you would be able to get oxandrolone, Sustanon 250, and Clomid.<P>
	<B>Andorra</B>--this little "Principality" used to be a steroid haven back in the early '90's, but now it's <I>all dried up</I>!<P>
	<B>Switzerland</B>--you need a prescription here as well--about the only anabolic steroid that's interesting at Swiss pharmacies is Plenastril.<P>
	<B>Holland</B>--no anabolics here, but lots of Heineken and the red light district--it's too cool!!<P>
	In summary, Europe is no longer an easy place to get anabolic steroids--a lot has changed over the last few years.  Mexico, which is a lot closer, offers a pretty decent variety of anabolic steroids and many (not all) pharmacies South of the Border still sell a pretty decent selection of anabolic steroids without a prescription and at relatively reasonable prices.<P>
	I hope that answers your question!<P>
	(By the way--if you don't know what all the steroids are that I mentioned in this answer, pick up a copy of my <I>Anabolic Reference Guide</I>--that book explains everything you could ever want to know about steroids and more.  It's advertised on page 71 of this issue.)<P>
(Note: A future link will be provided for ordering the <I>Anabolic Reference Guide</I>.)

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> Do you know any reliable
sources for GHB?  I used to be able to get it at a health-food store near my gym, but they recently
stopped selling it.<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> <P>I don't know of any good sources for GHB, but as long as you brought it up, I do have a warning about this substance.</P>
<P>	Over the past few months, I've heard quite a few stories about bodybuilders and other GHB users forming some type of  "addiction" to this stuff.</P>
<P>	I'm not an expert on addictive drugs, but it sure seems like some GHB users get as "hooked" on this stuff as some people do on drugs like cocaine...<I>seriously!</I></P>
<P>	I've heard enough disturbing things about this GHB stuff that I would strongly encourage anyone who is using it to stop, and I would encourage anyone who hasn't tried GHB yet not to mess with it.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I read that the supplement HMB
is a metabolite of the BCAA leucine and KIC.  Can I get the effects of HMB by just taking
leucine or KIC?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> Probably not.  Researchers currently believe only 5% of dietary leucine is converted to HMB in the body.  To make 3 grams of HMB (which is believed to be the effective dose), you would have to take <B>at least</B> 60 grams of leucine or 20-60 grams of KIC per day, which is not only expensive and impractical but could cause severe stomachaches.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I noticed that Dr. Mauro DiPasquale has come out with a new book about bodybuilding supplements. In his book, he contends he's the only "objective expert" in the industry. However, I also noticed he is working for Optimum Training Systems, and they sell supplements. How can he call himself objective?<P><HR>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I don't know why some people get so hung up on claiming to be "independent" or completely "objective." I even used to think it was a big deal, but the bottom line is that no one I know is completely objective, especially in bodybuilding! We all have opinions and egos; we all want to be right, especially those of use who call ourselves "experts."</P>
<P></P>
<P>I've always regarded Dr. DiPasquale as a good guy, and I still do. He's very knowledgeable, but if he's working for Optimum Training Systems (OTS), whether he admits it or not, he has a "vested interest" in the supplement business.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Dr. DiPasquale has a good reputation for telling bodybuilders what works and what doesn't. So does Dan Duchaine and, quite frankly, so do I! I think we've all been right more often than we've been wrong, and Dan and I, especially, like to be the first ones to tell our readers about something new and exciting.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Now, when we discover a supplement which we think may help bodybuilders, we don't see anything wrong with being involved in introducing that product to the consumer. For example, in this issue's "Alternatives" column, I tell you about a completely new supplement called HMB that legitimate scientific studies have shown may have a dramatic effect on your ability to gain size and muscle strength.</P>
<P></P>
<P>As I discussed in last issue's Q&A column, I don't make any secrets about my being involved in the supplement business. I'm proud of it, as a matter of fact! (I suppose I would try to hide my involvement in the supplement business if I distributed crappy, rip-off products like many of the other supplement companies do.)</P>
<P></P>
<P>Actually, I've discovered that the more supplements I distribute that actually work, the better my reputation gets. People count on me to come through with the real deal--the straightforward scoop on what to use and what not to use, and I take that responsibility <I>very seriously!</I></P>
<P></P>
<P>Anyway, my advice for Dr. DiPasquale is to just keep doing what he's done over the past decade--help athletes learn what works and what doesn't. Get off the "I'm the only honest guy out there" soapbox.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Now, as far as Dr. DiPasquale's new supplement book goes, I recently skimmed through it. Overall, it's not bad, but I did find it kind of confusing.</P>
<P></P>
<P>To be honest, I think my <B>new</B> <I>1996 Supplement Review</I> is better than DiPasquale's book (which was obviously inspired by the first <I>Natural Supplement Review</I> I wrote back in 1991).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Anyway, my new book only costs $3.00--and that's just to cover shipping and handling. The book itself is <B>FREE!</B> (Dr. DiPasquale's new supplement book costs $43.00!)</P>
<P></P>
<P>In my new, <I>1996 Supplement Review</I>, I cover every possible question you could ever ask about supplements--from protein powders to amino acids to fat burners, muscle builders, strength enhancers--everything! And, my new book is very simple and easy to read. At the end of the book, I even tell you about what are, in my opinion, the best "supplement stacks" ever designed for bodybuilders. (This info has never been put into print before!) It's a great supplement guide if I do say so myself! And, I don't spend half the book whining, bitching, and moaning and proclaiming myself as the only true expert.  No... my new <I>1996 Supplement Review</I> just gives you the straightforward, most "cutting-edge" information on supplements that may help you build muscle and burn fat! That's all that really matters, <I>isn't it?</I></P>
<P></P>
<P>If you'd like to pick up a copy of my new book, you'll find ordering information on page one of this magazine, and like I said, you can get the darn thing for only three bucks--how can you go wrong with a deal like that?! You can't!<P></P>
<P></P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I recently read an article in
<I>Muscular Development</I> where Mike Mentzer predicted that Steve Blechman would take over
bodybuilding when Joe Weider retires because Steve is such a great businessman.  When Joe
steps down, will they stop publishing <I>Flex</I>?  (Aside from <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, <I>Flex</I> is my favorite
bodybuilding magazine.)<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I have no reason to believe Joe Weider is going to be retiring any time soon, and when/if he does, I'm certain <I>Flex</I> magazine will continue.</P>
<P>	I don't know if Steve Blechman will "take over" bodybuilding some day, but who knows--he might.  Both Steve Blechman and Joe Weider are brilliant businessmen--<I>far more skilled than I.</I>  I really don't know "squat" about big business--I've never read an issue of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, and I've never picked up a copy of <I>Forbes</I> magazine or <I>Business Week</I>.</P>
<P>	I don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out "who's in charge" of bodybuilding--I've got my hands full just trying to run the small business I've got and put together a good magazine.</P>
<P>	I've never really seen myself as the "business type" like Weider and Blechman--I'm really just a young guy who has always loved lifting weights; I'm obsessed with trying to build muscle and get stronger.</P>
<P>	I spend every spare minute I've got either working out or trying to learn more about how to get stronger and more muscular.</P>
<P>	The fact that I'm not a "real businessman" like Blechman and Weider is probably more than obvious--I have a lot of admiration for these dudes, but I don't necessarily ever want to be like them.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> In addition to working out hard and using the right supplements, what nutritional advice can you give me to help build muscle and burn fat?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> The first thing you want to make sure you're doing is consuming meals that are balanced
in protein and carbohydrates six times a day.  A bowl of pasta is not a "meal"--neither is 15 egg
whites.<p>

	I believe there's a certain metabolic environment created when you consume a nutrient-rich, calorie-compact meal containing protein and carbohydrates that is important for optimal
amino acid and energy uptake by your muscle cells as well as proper oxidation (burning) of fat.<p>

	As far as calories go, if you're trying to build muscle and burn fat (which is basically
what I'm always trying to do), I recommend consuming a number of calories equal to your body
weight times 12.  For example, I weigh 200 pounds, so I try to consume around 2,400 or 2,500
calories a day (200 x 12). <p>

	If your main focus is to try to get cut, I recommend planning your daily calorie intake
around a number equal to your body weight times 10.  For example, if I wanted to get really cut
and not focus on gaining any more muscle size and strength for the time being, I would try to
consume around 2,000 calories a day (200 x 10).<p>

	Now, if you're trying to "bulk up" and you aren't concerned with fat loss, I recommend
consuming a number of calories equal to your body weight times 15.  For example, if I just
wanted to put on more muscle size and strength and was not concerned with losing fat (or even
gaining a little), I would consume 3,000 a day (200 x 15).<p>

	I recommend a diet that consists of around 30% to 35% protein, 45% to 50% carbs, and
around 20% fat.  (Yes, 20% fat!  Some dietary fat may be necessary to build muscle size and
strength.  If you don't believe me, try to get bigger and stronger without it!  If you lower your fat
intake down to 10% a day or less... within a week you'll probably notice a decrease in strength
and muscle fullness.)<p>

	The number of calories you're planning to consume each day should be divided by the
number of meals you're going to eat.  For example, if my goal intake is 2,500 calories a day
(which it is) and I plan on eating 6 meals, that means I should be trying to get around 400
calories per meal (give or take 100).<p>

	You can get your calories from quality whole-food sources like oatmeal, chicken, turkey,
cottage cheese, pasta, skim milk, reduced-fat cheese, lean steak, all kinds of fruits and
vegetables, or you can use a high-quality meal-replacement powder or protein supplement.<p>

	You should also drink a lot of water each day.  I try to drink at least 60 ounces of water--not pop, not milk, not juice--just water.  (Water is absorbed by your system differently than
calorie-containing fluids.)  This is to be consumed in addition to any water that might be used to
make protein drinks or anything like that.  This water can be consumed with meals or between
meals.  Drinking a lot of water helps keep your muscles properly hydrated (full of water), which
is very important on any muscle size and strength-building program.<p>

	Now, the above recommendations are "guidelines," not "etched-in-stone" rules.  You
might be one of the rare people whose metabolism is so fast you need to eat more calories per
day than what I'm recommending.  If this is the case, try starting with one of the "baseline"
numbers I recommended above and increase the number of calories you eat by 500 a day for one
week.  Then, make an evaluation--gradually "fine tune" your calorie intake until you think you're
getting the desired results.  (It's extremely helpful to keep a "nutrition log"--especially if you're
not really sure how many calories you're taking in each day.)<p>

	Now, if you're one of the rare individuals whose metabolism is especially slow, you may
have to decrease your calorie intake by 300 calories a day, a week at a time, until you start to see
the results you desire.<p>

	Give these recommendations a try--I'll bet you'll see a difference!<p>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I was very sad to learn that bodybuilding legend Don Ross recently passed away of a heart attack. Has there been any more information on how this man, who was in such good shape, died so prematurely?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I was also sad to learn about the passing of Don Ross. It's too bad that things like this have to happen.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The information I have is that Don Ross died of a heart attack, just like thousands and thousands of other men do every year. If you didn't already know this, heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States. It's a big problem!</P>
<P></P>
<P>The fact that Don Ross was lean and muscular and had exercised all his life obviously didn't make him immune to heart disease.</P>
<P></P>
<P>An autopsy revealed the main arteries around his heart were between 70% and 100% blocked. (Just because someone looks strong and healthy, it doesn't mean they are.) </P>
<P></P>
<P>Obviously, bodybuilders who use massive amounts of steroids and other dangerous drugs, with no medical supervision, are taking their chances. Also, bodybuilders who dehydrate themselves before competition, to show those last few striations, are also flirting with disaster.</P>
<P></P>
<P>And, some bodybuilders go through huge weight fluctuations in incredibly short periods of time. I've seen some top amateurs who compete at 176 pounds and balloon up to 225 pounds within a month or 2 after their competition. Some experts think losing and gaining 50 pounds in such short periods of time may be especially stressful on the heart.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Anyway, <I>most</I> people who are into physique development are also into fitness. I know I am! I don't smoke. I don't do recreational drugs. (I do drink some beer about once a month, as I described earlier in this column.) And even though I've used steroids in the past, I never used mega-dosages nor did I come close to "abusing" them.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Since I know most of you are like me in this regard (you want to look great, feel great, and live a long time), I'd encourage you, regardless of how healthy you feel, to visit your doctor regularly, and at the bare minimum, get a blood test twice a year.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Don Ross, like thousands of other men, probably didn't even know his cholesterol had been sky high for over a decade.</P>
<P></P>
<P>If you start monitoring your health at a young age (I haven't even been on this planet for three decades, and I watch my blood lipid levels like a hawk), you have an excellent chance of being able to prevent heart attacks, strokes, and other physical disasters.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Heart disease is a very treatable condition in most circumstances. There are medications available that you can take to lower your cholesterol and blood pressure. Sometimes, even if you do "eat right" and exercise, your body may still produce too much cholesterol. But, like I said, this is a condition that's usually treatable.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Anyway, I think the obvious recommendation here is that even though you're a bodybuilder and you might look great and feel good, don't assume you are "bulletproof." Check with your doctor often, and ask a lot of questions. It's simple advice, but it could very well save your life.</P>

<H3>This Stuff Works - <I>BIG TIME!</I></H3><BR>
<H4>by Bill Phillips</H4></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3>Muscle Growth and Protein Turnover 101</H3></CENTER><P>
Muscles grow by a circular process of synthesizing and breaking down protein.
Remember, muscles are made up of primarily protein (amino acids) and water. The total protein
accrual or muscle growth is the balance between the amount made and the amount broken down.
If you want to build bigger, stronger muscles, you're going to have to make a significant
alteration in your body's existing protein cycle. That means you are going to have to speed up the
rate of synthesis and/or slow down the rate of breakdown.<P>
It is well known that intense weight-training exercise stimulates the body's anabolic or
muscle-building processes. Ironically, weight training also causes the breakdown of muscle
tissue.<P>
In the "ideal" situation, the increase in protein synthesis stimulated by weight training
will exceed the increase in protein breakdown, and the result will be a gain in muscle size and
strength.<P>
Usually, when you first start working out, the above scenario plays itself out--it's
common to gain muscle size and strength from almost every workout during the first few months
of training.<P>
Unfortunately, the human body is very "adaptive." As soon as your muscle size reaches a
certain point (which is probably governed by genetics), your body adapts so any increase in
protein synthesis is counterbalanced by an increase in protein breakdown. When you get to this
point, you basically have hit what bodybuilders call a "plateau"--you don't gain muscle size and
strength no matter what you do! This is your body's way of "stabilizing" itself. It's called
homeostasis.<P>
It's my belief that even if you follow the most effective training and nutrition program,
it's very unlikely you'll be able to break these plateaus without doing something to dramatically
affect the rate at which your body is building up or breaking down protein tissue. (I'm sure most
of you who've been training for a number of years would agree with me on this one.)<P>
<CENTER><H3>Why Steroids Work</H3></CENTER><P><B>The reason anabolic steroids have such a dramatic impact on muscle growth is
because they alter your body's protein balance</B>. Ironically, steroids, even though they're called
"anabolic," which means "building up," exert most of their positive effects by preventing protein
breakdown. Recent evidence demonstrates up to 75% of the muscle-building effects of steroids
are due to their ability to inhibit protein degradation. Why is this? Well, in simple terms, anabolic steroids have a way
of "shielding" muscle cells from your body's main counterregulatory hormone, cortisol. It's not important to understand that complicated issue, but it is important to understand that once you've reached a certain degree of muscular development it's very likely that you're going to have to find some way to accelerate protein synthesis or inhibit protein breakdown to keep making gains.<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/arrowpq.gif"></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><H3>Can You Increase Protein Synthesis?</H3></CENTER><P>
What are your chances of finding a new training, nutrition, or supplement program that
increases protein synthesis? Well not very good. I mean, what are you going to do--train more
often? Alright, let's say training more often does increase the rate at which your body is
synthesizing protein--those same workouts are going to increase the rate at which protein is
being broken down, too. And you have to be careful because if you train too often, you can cause
your body to break down more muscle than it builds up--this is what's often referred to as
"overtraining."<P>
Okay, let's say we try a nutritional approach. What about eating more protein? Well,
numerous studies have investigated this, and it doesn't appear that consuming super-high levels
of protein increase the synthesis of new muscle tissue.<P>
High-calorie diets aren't the answer either. And there are no supplements on the market,
at least that I'm aware of, which have been shown to increase protein synthesis. Hell... even
muscle-building drugs like anabolic steroids and clenbuterol don't exert the majority of their
effects by increasing protein synthesis!<P>
After years of studying this issue very thoroughly, I've become convinced that targeting
<B>muscle-tissue breakdown </B>is the key. I've already mentioned there is substantial evidence
"anabolic" drugs exert their effects by minimizing protein breakdown. Since we know this is the
way the most potent muscle-building agents available work, it makes sense to target this area of
the equation. <P>
<CENTER><H3>Mid-Term Review</H3></CENTER><P>
Okay... I want to make sure you're following me here. Let's do a quick review--so far,
we've learned that in order to gain muscle size, you have to speed up the rate at which your body
is building protein or slow the rate at which your body is breaking protein down. We've
discussed that it's highly unlikely such an alteration can be made, in the experienced weight
trainer, through exercise alone.<B> (Many lifters are already doing the right kinds of workouts
but are still not growing!)</B> We've also learned anabolic steroids "tip the scales" in your favor by slowing the rate at which your body breaks down protein. (Unfortunately, anabolic steroids have side effects and are illegal. And these days they're very hard to get!) We also discussed that it's extremely unlikely changing your diet or taking any particular supplements will increase the rate at which your body synthesizes protein. <P>
Well... provided you understand all of the above, the next question you've got to be
asking yourself is, "Are there any supplements that can slow the rate of protein breakdown which
will, in turn, cause an increase in muscle size?"<P>
The answer is... <B>YES!!</B> The preliminary results of a recent double-blind, placebo-
controlled university study offer strong evidence it is indeed possible to "upgrade" the body's
ability to prevent muscle-tissue breakdown which occurs subsequent to intense stress such as a
brutal weight-training workout.<P>
Now, before I tell you about this university study, I want to make it clear this is the first
time I've seen sound, scientific evidence demonstrating that the use of a particular dietary
supplement does indeed slow protein breakdown.<P>
<CENTER><H3>Evidence... Not "Speculation"</H3></CENTER><P>
Now, I think it's important you understand the difference between "scientific evidence"
and "scientific speculation." Many of the "scientifically designed" supplements sold to
bodybuilders today are based on speculation. For example, that whole thing with ornithine
alpha-ketoglutarate (OKG) was speculation. It's true some scientific studies have shown OKG
may inhibit protein breakdown in hospital patients suffering from trauma such as surgery, injury,
burns, etc. However, in the case of OKG, it was never shown this compound could increase
protein retention--it was only shown to slow tissue wasting in hospital patients. There are no
studies that show using OKG, or many of the other supplements on the market today, help weight
trainers gain size and/or strength faster. Basically, many of the "scientifically designed"
supplements out on the market are based on unsubstantiated "best-guess" theories. <P>
Unfortunately, there really haven't been a lot of research studies which have tried to
conclusively determine whether certain supplements actually help build muscle mass and
strength. The reasons for this are fairly obvious--scientific studies, especially detailed,
double-blind university studies, are very expensive to conduct. Sadly, most companies just don't
put enough money into research.<P>
I believe the study I'm going to tell you about is especially significant because it looks at
the direct effects of the use of a dietary supplement on size and muscle strength. This was an
incredibly meticulous study, and I think you'll find it to be extremely exciting--I know I did!<P>
<CENTER><H3>Here's The Scoop!</H3></CENTER><P>
On June 2, 1995, an abstract was presented at the American College of Sports Medicine
Conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota. That abstract revealed that the use of a dietary
supplement called <B>"HMB" may cause dramatic increases in size and strength in athletes who
train with weights.</B><P>
The specific purpose of this study, which was conducted by doctors at Iowa State
University, was to determine the effect of dietary supplementation of a leucine metabolite called
beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) on muscle metabolism of humans performing
resistance exercise. Based on animal data, it was hypothesized that HMB would decrease the
muscle proteolysis (protein breakdown) induced by resistance exercise, resulting in increased
muscle mass and function.<P>
(Data from animal studies have shown HMB supplementation can stimulate muscle
growth by 20-30%! Further data from these investigations have indicated the muscle growth seen
in animals being fed HMB occurred because of a decrease in protein breakdown.)<P>
Forty-one male volunteers between the ages of 19 and 29 were recruited for this study.
Each subject underwent extensive testing which included things like body composition analysis,
muscle biopsies, blood tests, and so on.<P>
Each of the 41 test subjects followed the same weight-training program which included
the use of both free weights and machines. The weight-training sessions alternated between upper
and lower body exercises, and the subjects lifted three times per week with at least one day of
rest between sessions. (These workouts were very similar to the type of training program many
bodybuilders follow.)<P>
The nutritional intake of each subject was also carefully controlled. On average, the test
subjects consumed approximately 2,400 calories a day, which was slightly less than required, and
between 117-175 grams of protein per day.<P>
Fifteen of the subjects consumed 3 grams of HMB per day; 13 consumed 1.5 grams of
HMB per day; and another group of 13 test subjects consumed no HMB at all (the control group).
<P>
The researchers monitored the test subjects extensively during this three week study, and <B>it
became extremely obvious that the use of HMB was producing dramatic results. </B><P>
By the time the study was over, the group of weight trainers using 3 grams of HMB a day
had gained almost 3 solid pounds of lean mass (55% more lean mass than the group of
non-users)! In addition, they experienced strength gains that were 295% greater than the test
subjects who followed the same workout program but did not use HMB! (The results
experienced by the group using 1.5 grams of HMB a day were significant but not as extraordinary
as the results seen in those using three grams of HMB a day.)<P>
This study also used state of the art analytical procedures in an effort to identify just
exactly how HMB might be exerting its powerful effects. For example, they measured the
amount of something called 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) that was excreted by the body each week
of the study--3-MH offers scientists a way to look at muscle protein breakdown in the body.
They also measured other markers of muscle-protein breakdown called creatine phosphokinase
(CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In addition, they measured nitrogen balance.<P>
<B>The major preliminary finding of this incredibly meticulous study was that HMB
supplementation resulted in an enhancement of muscle function in humans undergoing
resistance exercise.</B> This effect was clearly shown in the study by increases in muscle strength and is supported by trends in increased lean tissue mass, improved nitrogen retention, and decreased indicators of muscle damage. <B>Some of the most compelling evidence of improved muscle metabolism with HMB supplementation was an observed 20% decrease in 3-MH
loss in urine and a 20-60% decrease in the levels of the enzymes CPK and LDH, indicating
muscle damage in the plasma.</B> This suggests HMB somehow supports the body's ability to
minimize muscle damage associated with muscular work or stress.<P>
Although no one is exactly sure how HMB works, one hypothesis is that HMB helps
decrease muscle protein turnover. This decrease in muscle damage in turn results in a more rapid
neural recruitment by the muscle fibers and may act as a catalyst to faster increases in strength. This could explain the effect of HMB in the first week of exercise in this study, when
unsupplemented subjects lost strength while HMB supplemented subjects gained strength. With
HMB supplementation, a decrease in muscle breakdown was supported by a reduction in the
essential plasma amino acids in blood. Because these amino acid values were obtained from
subjects who fasted overnight, the major contributor to plasma amino acids was natural protein
breakdown by the body.<P>
I've learned that the doctors who conducted this study have also wrapped up three other
clinical studies on humans using HMB which support these findings. These studies will be
published in the near future.<P>
The doctors who have performed these studies believe the enhancement of muscle protein
metabolism, shown through HMB supplementation, could also have relevance in other "stress"
situations such as: malnutrition/starvation, trauma, and/or burns. Of course, further studies will be needed to determine if the dietary supplementation of HMB can support the body's ability to recover from those kinds of conditions.<P>
<CENTER><H3>Take-Home Lesson</H3></CENTER><P>
So what do the preliminary findings of this recent study mean to you and me? Well, it
looks like we've finally found a supplement we can use to support our body's ability to minimize
protein breakdown and very possibly "tip the scales" of protein balance in our favor. This could
allow us to make substantial gains in muscle size and strength--drug free!<P>
I believe this new discovery could be one of the most important findings for bodybuilders
everywhere who want to build muscle size and strength but do not want to have to turn to, or
continue to rely on, anabolic steroids and other possibly dangerous and illegal muscle-building
drugs.<P>
<CENTER><H3>All Right... Where Do I Get HMB?</H3></CENTER><P>
Obviously, every serious bodybuilder who learns about this information is going to run to
their local health-food store and ask for HMB. Wait... not so fast! You see, HMB is not available
anywhere. TwinLabs doesn't have it. Wieder doesn't have it. EAS doesn't even have it! You
can't get HMB at GNC, at any gyms or health-food stores--it's not available anywhere--at least
not yet!<P>
<B>Here's the deal</B>--Metabolic Tech-nologies, Inc. (MTI), the company which owns the
rights to HMB and who funded this recent study, has only recently, and I mean very recently (like
two weeks ago), started manufacturing HMB in any "bulk" quantities. For the last six years,
HMB has only been manufactured in small "pilot batches"--just enough HMB was
manufactured to meet the needs of those involved in the university studies.<P>
MTI is in the process of trying to "ramp-up" HMB production in anticipation of making
this supplement available on a fairly wide-scale basis within the next year.<P>
<B>So, if everything goes as planned, you should be able to buy HMB, as a dietary
supplement, at health-food stores within a year. But for now, HMB is next to impossible to
get.</B> As a matter of fact, I've been trying for months to get MTI to send me a supply for myself and only recently "scored" just three weeks ago. This stuff is harder than hell to get! (But man does it work! You can really feel it!) For those of you who are like me--who want to try HMB and can't wait until it's available in stores--I've got some good news for you.<P>
I recently met with the folks at MTI and explained some things about the "bodybuilding
world" to them. I told them how thousands of guys, just like me, are trying to build bigger,
stronger bodies, and we're all very aware that anabolic steroid use, combined with weight
training, is, to date, the superior method for doing this.<P>
I explained that most readers of Muscle Media 2000 are looking for "alternatives" to
illegal and possibly dangerous muscle-building drugs, and if they could find something, anything
at all, which might help them get better results faster, it may help deter steroid use.<P>
Of course, <B>bodybuilders don't use steroids because they want to break the law--they
use steroids because the damn things work! If bodybuilders can find "alternatives" that
work, they'll use 'em!</B> (Now, I'm not saying HMB is more powerful or even as powerful as
anabolic steroids. What I'm saying is this recent study offers strong evidence HMB may help
weight trainers gain size and muscle strength. It's too early to say exactly how much muscle mass
HMB might help you build.)<P>
To make a long story short, guess who gets to be among the first to try HMB? You! I've
secured an initial supply of HMB which I'm offering exclusively to readers of Muscle Media
2000.<P>
That's right! Look through the other muscle magazines. Check the health-food stores.
You won't find anyone else selling HMB at this time. It's not being advertised anywhere. There
are no fancy TV commercials promoting it, no slick brochures, no before and after pictures...
there's nothing! (Talk about being on the <B>inside!</B>) <P>
But here's a little bad news... I know it is a relatively common marketing technique to
enforce the idea that "supplies are limited," and sometimes that's not always true. But let me
assure you, the supply of HMB I've snatched up from MTI is indeed very limited! Like I said,
MTI is only now beginning to ramp-up production of this product. They believe it will be 6 to 10
months before their manufacturing facility is up and running at full speed.<P>
Therefore, because supplies are so limited, I suggest that anyone who wants to try HMB
sooner, rather than later, take immediate action!<P>
Also, I don't want any one person "hogging" these extremely limited supplies, so I'm
setting a strict limit of no more than 10 bottles per person. <P>
Like I said, this is an exclusive deal for Muscle Media 2000 readers only. Sure, every
bodybuilder will get to try HMB sooner or later (probably in the next 6-10 months). But for now,
there's just not enough to go around.<P>
The HMB I have acquired comes in bottles with 120 capsules--250 mg of HMB in each capsule.
The recommended serving for maximum results is three grams per day, which is equivalent to
four capsules, taken with meals, three times daily. <P>
Each 120-capsule bottle costs $34.95. This doesn't make HMB the least expensive
supplement on the market, but then, it's certainly not the most expensive. <B>(In terms of what its potential benefits may be, it could very well be the "best buy" on the supplement market
today!) </B><P>
As the manufacturing process of HMB is "streamlined," I'm told the product will likely
become less expensive. So those of you who can't afford HMB now may want to sit back and
wait about 10 months--the price should go down. This will make it an even better value.<P>
If you're on a tight budget and want to try HMB right away, I would suggest you take a
good look at the supplements you're buying now and see which ones you can do without. I'm
calling HMB a "must-use" supplement for all serious bodybuilders--right up there with
supplements like creatine monohydrate and Phosphagain.<P>
Okay... let's say you want to give HMB a try RIGHT NOW--you don't want to wait 6-10
months, and you've got the "disposable income" to spare. Here's what you  do--<B>call my
customer care department at 1-800-615-8500. (Ask for Dept. #2468.) Tell the sales
representative you speak with you're a Muscle Media 2000 reader, and you're in the door.<P>
</B><P>
Remember, whenever you buy anything from me--a book, a magazine subscription, a
supplement, etc., I offer you an unconditional, lifetime, 100% money-back guarantee. It's the
strongest guarantee you'll ever find in this business or any other, and it's definitely an indication I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase. If not, you get 100% of your purchase price refunded!<P>
Before we wrap this up--let me issue a word of warning to all the bodybuilding
supplement companies out there: the nutritional uses of HMB for promoting nitrogen retention
(muscle gain) are protected by a strong patent. They're not "patent-pending"... They're patented!
The patent is owned by the Iowa State University Research Foundation (ISURF) and has been
licensed to Metabolic Technologies, Inc. under U.S. patent number 5,348,979. <B>ISURF is
affiliated with Iowa State University and spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each
year to vigorously protect the university's discoveries and patents. Don't say I didn't warn
you!</B><P>
Buyers... if you come across a supplement that is supposed to have real HMB in it and
doesn't have the U.S. patent number 5,348,979 on the label, don't buy it! It's a rip-off!<P>
As you can see, when it comes to "alternatives" to anabolic steroids and other drugs that
help you build size and strength, I would say HMB is one of the most exciting ever!<P>
Even more clinical studies are being planned to test HMB. In fact, another study
involving weight trainers is already underway! And you can bet Muscle Media 2000 will be the
first magazine to report these findings to you, so you can stay on the cutting edge!

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I've heard that using the "Long" kind of IGF-1 produces the best results.  Do you know where I can get this stuff?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I don't know where you can get Long IGF-1 or any other kind.  I knew some guys were getting this stuff through chemical supply houses, but that avenue has dried up--as a matter of fact, a couple guys got busted for trying to buy IGF-1 from these sources.<P>
	As far as Long IGF-1 being stronger--I'm not sure if that's the case.  There is some possibility that Long IGF-1 could be the most dangerous type bodybuilders are experimenting with because it has the potential to cause systematic anaphylaxis (a type of allergic reaction that you can die from).<P>
	If I were you, I wouldn't use any type of IGF-1 until scientists answer more questions about exactly how this stuff affects human beings.

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I recently saw an ad for a high-calorie "weight-gain" product that caught my attention.  This ad showed some study results and claimed this was scientific proof this supplement works.  Do you know if this is true?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I'm aware of the ad and the study you're asking about.  First of all, "proof" is a very strong word--one scientific study isn't <I>proof</I> of anything.  I'm very careful when using the word "proof"--in my opinion, studies offer <I>evidence</I> that something does or doesn't work.  I think you would need a number of pretty solid studies before you could convince me they represent "proof" of anything.<P>
	In this study, weight trainers who used a high-calorie supplement made better gains than lifters who used no supplement.<P>
	Now, from a "scientific" standpoint, these results are not as valid as they could be because the two groups were not "blinded."  That is, the non-supplement users knew they weren't getting anything, and the supplement users knew they were taking something.  This leaves room for a "placebo" effect.<P>
	An inside source told me there was a third group involved in this study that just received a plain carbohydrate powder.  I'm told this "control group" experienced the same results as the weight-gainer group.  If that's true, I guess it means using a supplement that contains calories may help you get better results from your weight-training program <I>if</I> calories are the "limiting factor" in your program.  The results would also offer <I>evidence</I> that the high-calorie "gainer" supplement didn't work better than a plain carbohydrate powder.<P>
	So, I guess this means you should be sure to take in enough calories when you're trying to build muscle.  How much is <I>enough</I>?  Well, I'm convinced, for most, it's less than 3,000 calories a day.<P>

		<H3><CENTER>Is it really the fountain of youth?</CENTER></H3>
		<H4><CENTER>By Dr. John Abdo</CENTER></H4>
		<H4><CENTER>Executive Producer and Host of <I>The Fitness Profile</I> Television Show</CENTER></H4>
		<P>I recently had the unique opportunity to visit the El Dorado Rejuvenation & Longevity Institute (ERLI) in Cancun, Mexico.  Many of you may have seen the ads promoting this institute in other bodybuilding magazines.  Actually, this was my first introduction to ERLI.  Guaranteed claims regarding the treatments offered by ERLI included increases in lean muscle tissue, strength, stamina, bone density, sexual potency, and reductions in bodyfat.  </P>
		<P>After that ad caught my eye several times, I contacted the president of ERLI, Howard Turney.  I introduced myself and explained to Howard my 	interests in investigating his claims to produce some segments for my television show.  Should I find the information newsworthy, I would promote his institute on my program as well as documenting it on video.  Howard responded by inviting me and my crew to visit his institute on November 6, 1993.  That weekend represented a monumental breakthrough in Howard's institute as he hosted the first annual symposium for the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M).  A myriad of research scientists, human biologists, genetic engineers, and nutritionists collaborated for the first time in history to formulate an international affiliation on anti-aging medicine and to reveal their findings to the world.  While attending the seminars, I learned that the drugs and treatments available elsewhere around the world today have proven efficacious and safe for building stronger muscles, enhancing health, and <B>prolonging</B> life in both laboratory studies and in human recipients!</P>
		<P>Dr. Ronald Klatz, ERLI medical advisor, founder of the American Longevity Research Institute, and A4M president, is one of the world's leading 	authorities on anti-aging treatments.  Klatz states, "Aging is not inevitable.  Most of the infirmities and disabilities associated with aging are, in fact, reversible when the mechanisms of human biology are understood, and the treatments are administered accordingly.  Over the years, we have made great strides in human biology, medicine, and aging.  For the first time in medical history, we are now able to utilize this knowledge to keep people younger and stronger throughout their entire life spans so that what we consider to be the normal decline in aging is not inevitable."  Klatz continues to explain, "For the athlete who 	wishes to enhance his or her performance, there are great alternatives to the use of dangerous compounds such as anabolic steroids."</P>
		<HR>
		<H2><CENTER>Hormone Replacement Therapy</CENTER></H2>
		<HR>
		<P>Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is the primary focus for the treatments administered by ERLI and A4M.  Since natural hormone levels decline or become out of balance as we age, depleted blood hormone levels are reestablished and maintained.  Accurate and sophisticated hormone/age related profiles diagnose the degree of hormonal depletion.  Then specific dosages are administered to regain normalcy.</P>
		<P>The HRT offered at ERLI is based around the administration of human Growth Hormone (hGH).  Since hGH is a master hormone, administration acts as a precursor which ultimately results in the endocrine system returning to the natural biological harmony.  The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has approved hGH for the treatment of dwarfism in children; its applications in the treatment of aging have not yet received approval for use in the United States. However, in April 1982, the FDA issued a bulletin legalizing the use of "Approved" drugs for "Unapproved" applications and in 1988 ruled that it was legal for	an individual to import effective drugs while under a physician's care.  This importation of drugs may not exceed quantities of three month supplies and may be used only for personal administration.</P>
		<P>Taking this FDA ruling into account, Howard Turney discovered a legitimate way to launch his institute while A4M physicians can legally prescribe hGH to American patients.  Several criteria must first be met prior to acceptance on hGH treatment with ERLI and A4M.  1) You must be at least 40 years of age.  2) A thorough medical questionnaire must be completed.  3) A hormonal blood assay must be taken by an authorized A4M physician to indicate a deficient hGH level supported by a computer-generated metabolic analysis identifying the specific rate of age-related hGH decline. (HGH will not be administered to those individuals with healthy levels although other treatments are available which may enhance health and prevent age-related degenerations.)  And 4) a minimum stay of two days is required at the Cancun institute to complete patient evaluation and treatment prescription.  During the patient's stay at ERLI, in-depth	seminars are presented on all aspects of therapy as well as the legal rights regarding returning back to the U.S. with the prescribed medication.</P>
		<HR>
		<H2><CENTER>Manufacturing & Cost</CENTER></H2>
		<HR>
		<P>Prior to 1985, growth hormone had to be extracted from the pituitary glands of cadavers (dead humans).  But with genetic engineering, Genentech and Lilly began producing synthetic versions.  These two pharmaceutical companies developed synthetic growth hormone under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983. The Orphan Drug Act offers incentives for drug manufactures to develop drugs which treat fewer than 200,000 patients.  (There are only an estimated 10,000 growth-hormone-deficient children in the United States.)  The companies who participate in the Orphan Drug Act are granted a seven-year exclusive to 				manufacture and distribute.1</P>
		<P>Earlier this year, Genentech's orphan drug status expired while Lilly's is due to expire sometime in 1994.  Seven years ago, when synthetic growth hormone was exclusively offered, other pharmaceutical companies were reluctant to manufacture this hormone for monetary reasons.  But this year alone, an estimated one hundred million dollars worth of hGH sales are expected.  You can bet the competition has lined up awaiting free-market access.  This will provide additional sources of hGH and (hopefully) lower the cost as well.  The average first 3 month supply costs approximately $4,600 at ERLI.  Maintenance dosages thereafter vary per patient.</P>
		<P>Currently, hGH administration is delivered by subcutaneous injection.  However, in the near future, Dr. Klatz feels that other, more convenient methods will be available probably in the form of nasal sprays or buccal caplets.</P>
		<HR>
		<H2><CENTER>The BioMarker Study</CENTER></H2>
		<HR>
		<P>"One of the most important facets relating to A4M deals with our BioMarker program," states Dr. Vincent Giampapa, director of the Plastic Surgery Center and the National Skin Institute of Montclair, New Jersey.  Dr. Giampapa is an avid bodybuilder and martial artist whose clientele includes a variety of athletes	who have sought Giampapa's supervision after steroid abuse.  Giampapa explains, "The protocol (in general) of our testing determines age-related changes in organisms and genes on a number of levels.  As scientists, we now know of treatments which restore molecular integrity and have a profound effect on health, performance, and longevity."</P>
		<P>The American Medical Association (AMA) theorize that the aging process lies somewhere within the master mechanism of the brain which directs the aging process through its control over the body's hormonal system.  The AMA speculates that aging lies within the individual cells and is linked to genetic	coding.  Deciphering our genetic code serves a primary purpose with the BioMarker program.  Dr. Gregory Fahy, who is on the Board of Directors of the	American Red Cross and who holds a Ph.D. in pharmacology, recently made the following statement:  "The aging process is under biological control.  And since it is under biological control, it is possible to intervene."  Fahy is suggesting that genetic alteration, through the array of treatments we now have access to, can prevent aging.  Fahy adds, "Monitoring hGH levels is the basic building block which controls the aging process."  With scientists like Giampapa and Fahy, the BioMarker program is quickly establishing itself as a world-wide data bank regarding the diagnosis and treatment of age-related maladies and health restoration.</P>
		<HR>
		<H2><CENTER>Profile</CENTER></H2>
		<HR>
		<P>Human Growth Hormone is not a steroid and has none of the side effects which are reported with steroid use.  In fact, the only hGH side effect admitted by ERLI president Howard Turney is a slight retention of fluid for the first three months of treatment as the body's hormonal system rebalances itself.  Beyond that, no further negative effects occur.  (Please be advised that A4M and ERLI use very conservative dosages of hGH.  Reports of acromegalia, carpel tunnel syndrome, and other negative side effects have been reported in athletes who self-administer high dosages of hGH.)  (Editor's Note: And according to Health	magazine's article about the clinic, some of ERLI's patients have reported these negative side effects also.)</P>
		<P>Since most of the patients attending ERLI at this time are nonathletes, statistical information regarding results can only be accounted for the sedentary recipient of hGH therapy.  After only three months of treatment, current ERLI patients are experiencing a dramatic improvement in overall health and well-being.  Within 6 to 8 months, on average, an increase in lean muscle tissue of 8.8% and a 14% reduction in bodyfat are also experienced.  (Under these controlled modes of administration, the results experienced in athletes have not yet been determined.)</P>
		<P>Other benefits documented by ERLI patients read just as the ad does with improvements in muscle strength and endurance, sexual potency, bone density, cholesterol levels, skin tone, and healing capacity following an injury or surgery.</P>
		<P>Although hGH is the granddaddy of drugs at ERLI, staff clinicians prescribe a variety of other treatments which have a vast range of benefits.  These include nutrient supplementation, Smart Drugs, and immune system regulators, just to name a few.  Here's a partial list and description of others:</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Deprenyl:</B> This drug's mechanisms are more brain chemical related than hormone related.  Deprenyl has a profound effect on the many brain chemicals called neurotransmitters that carry messages from one brain cell (neuron) to another.  These brain chemicals are oxidized (degraded) into the brain by an enzyme called monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B).  Scientists have found a progressive increase in brain MAO-B activity with advancing age in humans. Deprenyl use produces a remarkable increase in libido and sexual function.  Since sex is largely an emotional response to external stimuli, researchers believe deprenyl's sexual enhancing abilities affect the physiology of one of the activation centers in the brain where sexual response is generated.  Deprenyl not only increases ones desire for sex (libido) but ability and performance are also increased.3</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>DHEA:</B> This compound is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands.  Research has found DHEA to have significant anti-obesity, anticancer, and anti-aging properties.  DHEA levels decrease with age, and there is good reason to believe that taking exogenous DHEA may extend the life	span and promote youthfulness.  Dr. Vincent Giampapa believes in DHEA and states, "Administration of DHEA, under qualified supervision, has demonstrated to be beneficial in increasing muscle size while reducing fat."  Taken orally, the mode of action for DHEA is linked to its ability to influence other hormones.  In essence, DHEA acts as an endocrine precursor producing similar (but slightly reduced) effects to that of injectable hGH.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Antioxidants:</B>  Among the many antioxidants prescribed by A4M and ERLI include Vitamins C and E, Selenium, PABA, beta-carotene, and Super Oxide Dismutase (SOD).  According to Dr. Lord Lee Benner, chairman of the World Health Foundation, antioxidants are the most effective way to control free radicals that run rampant within our bodies and destroy our cells.  Benner states, "The basics for optimum health and longevity are proper eating, exercise, nutritional supplementation, and stress reduction.  To age successfully (as Benner refers), you have to stop cellular degeneration in the beginning by limiting the ingestion of toxic materials like junk food, drugs, and alcohol, while reducing stress and consuming plenty of antioxidants through food sources and supplementation."</P>
		<HR>
		<H2><CENTER>Athletes' Warning</CENTER></H2>
		<HR>
		<P>Unfortunately, many of the compounds administered by A4M and El Dorado get into the wrong hands and are misused.  When misuse becomes documented, the momentum gained by anti-aging specialists takes an unsatisfying turn for the worse, as with the case of GHB (Gamma Hydroxy Butyrate). According to several A4M scientists, GHB, once available OTC, was the most remarkable compound for stimulating the natural release of growth hormone to	build muscle and lose fat.  GHB got misused, and as a result of overdose, two bodybuilders became hospitalized; the following week, the FDA had GHB taken	off the market.</P>
		<P>Athletes who wish to obtain hGH and other treatments are encouraged to consult a qualified A4M physician to use wise judgement when trying to alter	the intricate biochemistry of the body.</P>

<A HREF="v48_a1.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> In addition to working out hard and using the right supplements, what nutritional advice can you give me to help build muscle and burn fat?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a2.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I recently read an article in
<I>Muscular Development</I> where Mike Mentzer predicted that Steve Blechman would take over
bodybuilding when Joe Weider retires because Steve is such a great businessman.  When Joe
steps down, will they stop publishing <I>Flex</I>?  (Aside from <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, <I>Flex</I> is my favorite
bodybuilding magazine.)
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a3.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> If I'm using the low-calorie
lean-mass stimulator Phosphagain<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>; (which contains creatine monohydrate), do I need to take Phosphagen<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>; or Phosphagen HP<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>; (which also contain creatine monohydrate)?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a4.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> Do you know any reliable
sources for GHB?  I used to be able to get it at a health-food store near my gym, but they recently
stopped selling it.
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a5.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I read an article in the last issue
of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> [January 1995] about this new supplement called HMB.  I was wondering
if it's all right to use this stuff along with creatine monohydrate.  If I did "stack" these two
supplements--what type of gains do you think I would get?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a6.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> Which supplement works
better--creatine phosphate or creatine monohydrate?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a7.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> If I were to go steroid shopping
in Europe, what would I find as of early 1996?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a8.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I read that the supplement HMB
is a metabolite of the BCAA leucine and KIC.  Can I get the effects of HMB by just taking
leucine or KIC?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a9.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> What do you think are the most
common mistakes bodybuilders make that keep them from gaining size and strength?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a10.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I recently saw an ad for a high-calorie "weight-gain" product that caught my attention.  This ad showed some study results and claimed this was scientific proof this supplement works.  Do you know if this is true?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a11.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've heard that using the "Long" kind of IGF-1 produces the best results.  Do you know where I can get this stuff?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a12.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've read about this new supplement called CLA a few times over the past few months in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>.  I want to try it, and I've looked everywhere--GNC, the gym I work out at, and my local health-food store.  No one even knows what this stuff is.  Do you know where I can find it, or do you have any more info on CLA?

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I've read about this new supplement called CLA a few times over the past few months in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>.  I want to try it, and I've looked everywhere--GNC, the gym I work out at, and my local health-food store.  No one even knows what this stuff is.  Do you know where I can find it, or do you have any more info on CLA?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> You're right--you can't find CLA supplements at GNC or any other health-food stores or gyms that I know of.  (I think CLA supplements will probably hit the U.S. market hard within the next 8-12 months.)<P>
	CLA (which stands for conjugated linoleic acid) is a very interesting new product.  I first became interested in CLA supplementation about four or five months ago.  I literally looked all over the world trying to find this stuff and finally located a source for it in Norway.<P>  
	CLA represents a totally new kind of bodybuilding supplement--as you are probably already aware, CLA is a special type of "fatty acid" that some experts, like Dan Duchaine and myself, believe has the potential to be a potent "growth factor."<P>
	And, we aren't the only ones who are convinced CLA has potential.  I know of some very well-respected doctors and scientists who have extensively studied CLA supplementation and are convinced it can accelerate growth (in the absence of increased calories) and can help minimize weight loss which may occur subsequent to elevated levels of catabolic hormones.<P>
	These scientists aren't interested in how CLA supplementation can help bodybuilders get bigger and stronger--their interest revolves around the use of CLA as a growth factor in animals intended for meat production (such as broiler chickens).  These scientists are also interested in how CLA supplementation can be used to prevent weight loss in people who are suffering from various diseases and adverse metabolic conditions.<P>
	Over the last 6 months, I've spent at least 100 hours reading every clinical study I could find regarding CLA supplementation.<P>
	Although no clinical studies have examined what effects, if any, CLA supplementation might have on body composition or strength levels of weight trainers, I'm <I>convinced</I> CLA has tremendous potential as a bodybuilding agent.  (I recently learned that a CLA/weight trainer study is being designed, and the results from this study should be available within six months.)<P>
	I've been supplementing my diet with four grams of CLA a day for about two months, and there is no question in my mind this stuff works--it's one of the very few supplements I've used that I can honestly say produces the type of effects you can see and feel.<P>
	Of course, I have no evidence that CLA supplements will work for everyone, but this is one topic you'll be hearing more about in future issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>.<P>
	I tell all about CLA supplementation in my new <I>1996 Supplement Review</I>--I even show you exactly how I stack CLA with other supplements I'm using, like creatine monohydrate and HMB.  (I had planned to write about how I "stack" supplements in this issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, but to be honest, <I>we ran out of room!</I>  I hope to include that information in the next issue, but if you'd like to check out what I call my "Deluxe" bodybuilding supplement stack [a stack I think is the most powerful supplement combination ever designed], you can find it in Chapter 7 of my <I>1996 Supplement Review</I>.)
	By the way, if you haven't picked up a copy of this book yet, you should!  I think it's very important reading for all bodybuilding supplement users. And you can't beat the price: it's <B>FREE!</B> (Ordering information can be found on page one of this issue.)<P>

		<H3><CENTER>Mike Mentzer: A Thinking Man's Approach to Weight Training</CENTER></H3>
		<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT>sk a bodybuilder about the book <I>Atlas Shrugged</I>, and he or she might tell you it's a program for building bigger traps or that it's about the life story of a guy who didn't like sand kicked in his face.  But if you ask Mike Mentzer, you better be willing to pull up a chair because he's been a devout student of the philosophical ideologies of Ayn Rand for a number of years, and he's looking to make converts of anyone within earshot.  As a matter of fact, he has serious plans for leading a philosophical upheaval in the U.S.</P>
		<P>Most of us know Mike Mentzer as the number 1 proponent of Heavy Duty Training and as the author of three books on that subject.  He is responsible for the theory of High Intensity Training, whereby less effort is better, and defining the precise amount of effort is best.  Competitively, he won the 1976 Mr. America and the 1978 Mr. Universe, where he became the first person to ever receive a perfect score in an international competition.  He also played a pivotal role in one of bodybuilding's most regrettable debacles: the 1980 Mr. Olympia.</P>
		<P>For anyone who witnessed the contest, it was painfully apparent that Arnold's much publicized comeback at Sydney, Australia would end up in victory. He appeared casual on stage, standing relaxed, making jokes, and not even bothering to hit all the compulsory poses.  Meanwhile, a serious Mentzer had given this show his all, only to see what should have been the crowning glory of his career used as a tiny stepping stone for Arnold's burgeoning superstardom.  Mentzer gave the sport his middle finger and never competed again.</P>
		<P>Today, Mentzer lives in Southern California where he has a successful mail-order and personal-training business.  Since that day in Sydney, his life has had its tragedies and triumphs.  He talks about those, while also shedding some additional light on his theory of High Intensity Training, which is put forth so succinctly on his <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> Audiotape Interview.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Mike, for those who haven't heard the audiotape, would you briefly explain your theory of High Intensity Training.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>Most bodybuilders make the mistake of trying too many training systems, frantically going from one to another, looking for something that works.  But the fact is that there is only one valid theory of anything--electronics, engineering, astronomy, medicine, mathematics--and there can be only 	one valid theory or scientific approach in bodybuilding.  The theory of High Intensity is that <B>one and only</B> theory.  It is the only theory that has a set of principles which set forth a guideline for successful action.</P>
		<P>Now, follow me on this.  Any theory must have a starting point, a first principle.  The first step is to identify what it is you're seeking to achieve.  In this case, the answer is to build muscle.  Now, what is the stimulus responsible for this?  That stimulus is intensity--not volume or frequency but the intensity of the exercise.</P>
		<P>A lot of magazines banter about this term intensity, but most of what you read in the magazines is hogwash.  Intensity is the percentage of possible momentary muscular effort being exerted.  The closer intensity gets to 100%, the greater the stimulus.</P>
		<P>Think of this in terms of a bodybuilder who can curl 120 pounds for 10 reps.  The first rep requires the least intensity, maybe 8% to 12%.  The second may require a 20% effort; the third will be harder still until we finally get to the last possible rep the bodybuilder can perform.  That rep requires 100% effort. There is something that happens physiologically during this last rep, something that is critical to the goal, something that is responsible for switching on the growth machinery inside the body.  But in order to stimulate that response, the exercise must be carried to momentary muscular failure.</P>
		<P>Therefore, High Intensity Training involves performing the exercise to failure.  That creates the response the bodybuilder is seeking, and to stop short of that point is of no consequence whatsoever.</P>
		<P>Now, listen closely to what I'm saying.  This is very important.  To do any more than is required defeats your purpose.  High Intensity dictates brief and infrequent training.  Overtraining is the most underrated mistake in bodybuilding.  Overtraining is the worse thing a bodybuilder can do.  Overtraining means performing one set more than what is needed.  In most instances, only one set of an exercise and never more than two exercises per body part need to be performed.  Anything more is a waste of time and will lead to stagnation and overtraining.</P>
		<HR>
		<H2><CENTER>"An effective Heavy Duty workout can take as little as 17 minutes!"</CENTER></H2>
		<HR>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Your views are very specific on training.  What about your views on a nutritional program?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	As much confusion as there is about training, there is even more about nutrition.  A large part of this industry is based on the fraudulent sale of nutritional supplements.  They want you to believe that it is a highly complex subject when, in reality, it is fairly simple.</P>
		<P>All a bodybuilder should be concerned with is getting a well-balanced diet every day, a diet that supplies the body with all the vitamins and nutrients it needs.  If you drink too much water, you excrete it.  You don't have that luxury with proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.  Too much of any one of these will turn into bodyfat.</P>
		<P>It is a fact that most bodybuilders are grossly overnourished, just like they are overtrained!  Most bodybuilders eat way more than they need to sustain physical mass and contribute to the negligible amount of growth they can experience in any given day.  They overnourish themselves, and they still don't grow!  That fact demonstrates that nutrition is not the problem.  The problem is in a lack of training knowledge.</P>
		<P>The way to stimulate muscle growth is to apply 100% effort when you train, but never overtrain.  The way to eat is to provide an adequate diet,  but never overnourish.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Many multiple-set training programs are broken down in phases aimed at specifics like growth, precontest, or maintenance.  Is there a maintenance phase of High Intensity Training?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	Really, there's no physical need for a maintenance program because when you're properly regulating the volume and frequency, you'll never overtrain.  The only time this program might vary is if the goal changes.  If a person does not want maximum muscle growth, he or she can pull back a little shy of failure in a set.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	In your tape, you say you are adamantly opposed to aerobics.  You also suggest that bodybuilders begin reading philosophy books with all the time saved in their workouts.  Does this mean that you don't advocate bodybuilders taking up aerobic activities, like bike riding or in-line skating, in their free time?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	It depends on the individual.  Most bodybuilders primarily want to gain as much strength and size in as short a time as possible.  If that's the goal, then they should not do any of those activities.  The human body has a finite number of units of adaptive energy available.  If you try to divide that up between bodybuilding and aerobics, you'll get mixed results or, worse, end up losing muscle and endurance.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Your theory, while it makes perfect sense, supports a one-set formula of exercise that basically contradicts everything everyone else has ever prescribed.  How do you explain this?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	Most of what has been said has been said by people who have no background in philosophy, logic, or science.  They have applied whatever intellectual power they may have to putting forth a program, but these programs are not theory.  There is only one valid theory, and that is the theory of High Intensity Training.</P>

		<P><B>MM:</B>	You've talked quite a bit about goals.  Have you always known what your goals have been?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	When I was younger, my career was punctuated with some self-doubt, but I've always known what I wanted.  I admit that I've taken a couple of detours, maybe made a few wrong turns along the way, but I got back on track.  I've got my mind working for me better than ever.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Was one of those wrong turns your use of recreational drugs?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	I wouldn't call what I used recreational.  I began using amphetamines years ago, in part to help with dieting and bodybuilding and also to give me enough energy to write my articles.  After the 1980 Olympia, I went into an emotional tailspin.  I lost my career, and I lost my mother and father. With all the emotional problems and the continued use of amphetamines, it became more difficult to maintain emotional control, and I went even deeper into drug use.  At the time, my intellect was not developed enough to enable me to understand all that was going on, and the emotions overwhelmed me.</P>
		<P>	Finally, I saw where it was going and could no longer deny there was a real problem.  I said to myself that it was time to stop.  That's when I discovered philosophy, and I began studying every day.  Eventually, I gained a comprehensive view of life, which is the purpose of philosophy.  It's been a process of maturation, a transition where I've gone from a person who was guided by emotions, to a person guided by philosophy.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Are you drug free now?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	Yes, and I have been for years.  I still drink a little bit, but the only drug I use is coffee.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Would you advocate amphetamines for dieting?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	I'm not dogmatic on the issue of drugs and have nothing against the advances of medical science.  A little speed will help, and probably won't hurt the individual, but it depends on the person.  It's been reported that Ayn Rand used a mild form of amphetamine for many years, and she obviously had no impairment or problem.  But she has a highly developed mind.  If you're not advanced intellectually, you can be overwhelmed, and it can create problems.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Are you happy with your life today?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>Happier than I've ever been before.  I've finally achieved a kind of maturity that can only be gained as a result of developing the mind. Until a person develops an intellect and learns how to think, he or she can't really be happy.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	It sounds like you'd prefer to talk about philosophy rather than bodybuilding, but let's get back to the sport before we finish up.  What kind of shape are you in today?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	Physically, the worst shape of my life.  While still involved in the business of bodybuilding--personal training, writing books and articles--I've put my own training on the back burner in order to devote more time to studying.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	And what is your brother doing these days?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	Ray is quite successful.  About four years ago, he became very involved in Arthur Jones' new medical rehabilitation corporation.  Now he's part owner and operator of five clinics.  He's living in Redondo Beach and still training quite hard.  He's been a bit overweight, but he's quite muscular with 20-inch arms.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	You've been in bodybuilding for more than 30 years, and you certainly have a unique perspective.  Give us your first response to the following names, so we can get a better sense of that perspective.  Ready?</P>
		<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/mmarms.gif" ALT="[Photo of Mike Mentzer]"></CENTER><BR>
		<B>Mike:</B>	Ready.<BR>
		<B>MM:</B>	Mike Quinn.<BR>
		<B>Mike:</B>	Terribly misguided.<BR>
		<B>MM:</B>	Ben Weider.<BR>

		<B>Mike:</B>	Nothing.<BR>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Okay, do you have any advice for other bodybuilders who might want to pursue philosophy?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	As a rule, bodybuilders are intellectually self-arrested.  I'd have to advise them to be very cautious in approaching philosophy.  Most people don't know how to think and can't distinguish truth.  There can be only one valid theory on anything, including life.</P>
		<P>Mine is essentially Ayn Rand's, which is that man is a heroic being whose highest moral purpose is the achievement of his own happiness, whose noblest activity is productive achievement, and whose only absolute is reason.  While I haven't been able to understand all the details and implications, I work on this every day.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Where do you see yourself five years from now?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>Where I'm at now but further ahead financially.  My ultimate goal is to make enough money, so I can help affect a cultural movement that will bring this country back to reason.  People think we need political change, but what we need is a philosophical change.</P>
		<P>Ayn Rand understood that the last intellectuals in this country were the founding fathers James Madison and Thomas Jefferson.  Since then, everything has gone downhill intellectually and culturally.  Progressively, we are losing more of our freedoms.  Unless people learn how to think, they can't understand what's going on politically, and they'll be blindly led into a state of tyranny.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Okay.  Now, if people want to contact you for personal training or philosophy lectures, how should they do it?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>They can reach me at Gold's Gym, Venice, CA, or by calling 310-827-7661. </P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Anything you want to add?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	I hope this interview helps enlighten some bodybuilders.  And for those who thought they knew me before, now you know me a little bit better.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>In your last Q&A, you talked about preventing injuries. However, you didn't talk about the number of reps you should do for a proper warm-up. I used to religiously warm up with 2 sets of 15-20 reps, but after your answer, I lowered the reps and increased the sets. I find this works much better and gives me a much better workout. But I'm unsure of the number of reps I should perform in my warm-up. My primary training reps range from 10-12 on medium days and 6-8 on heavy days.</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>The most common mistake people make when warming up is they perform way too many reps. Some sports medicine practitioners have even noted that the people who show up at their clinics often have one thing in common: they perform high reps to prepare for a max lift.<P>
The best way to warm up is to do a lot of low-rep sets. Why? When warming up for strength training or bodybuilding, the body has to know only that the weight is going to be heavy and what the range of motion is on that particular lift. If you warm up with low reps, you won't get a buildup of too many fatigue metabolites which will interfere with neural conduction. In other words, you won't burn out before you get to your heavy sets.<P>
Here are some sample plans on how to warm up for different rep ranges and strength levels.<P>
<CENTER><B>Example 1: the target is 3 x 10-12 reps @ 100 lbs</B><P>
<B>Warm-up<BR>
	40 lbs  x  5 reps<BR>
	60 lbs  x  3 reps<BR>
	75 lbs  x  1 rep<BR>
	85 lbs  x  1 rep<BR>
	95 lbs  x  1 rep</B></CENTER><P>
Rest just long enough to adjust the weight for yourself. Your partner can also go in between your warm-up sets. Rest 3 minutes after the single rep at 95 lbs. Then begin your work sets at 100 lbs.<P>
<CENTER><B>Example 2: the target is 6 x 2-3 reps @ 315 lbs</B><P>
<B>Warm-up<BR>
	45 lbs  x  2 sets  x  4 reps<BR>
	135 lbs  x  3 reps<BR>
	185 lbs  x  2 reps<BR>
	225 lbs  x  1 rep<BR>
	275 lbs  x  1 rep<BR>
	300 lbs  x 1 rep</B></CENTER><P>
Rest just long enough to adjust the weight for yourself. Your partner can also go in between your warm-up sets. Rest 3 minutes after the single rep at 300 lbs. Then begin your work sets at 315 lbs.<P>


<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> I'm preparing for a bodybuilding show, and my local university offered to monitor my body composition via underwater weighing. Is this method any good? I want to know because they charge $65.00 a pop for each test.</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> It's often stated, although erroneously, in bodybuilding and fitness magazines that underwater weighing is the best method for measuring bodyfat.
For the well-trained bodybuilder, this test isn't that valid. For example, I once tested a black bodybuilder who had won a silver medal in the Canadian Bodybuilding Championships a few days after this show. He weighed in at 242 lbs at 5'11". When we tested his bodyfat percentage with underwater weighing, it measured out to be minus six percent. How could that be? I was quite intrigued, so I did a bit of digging, and here's what I found:<P>
1)	The skeletal density of blacks is approximately ten percent higher than the skeletal density of whites.<BR>
2)	Very few exercise physiologists know that the density formulas used to estimate bodyfat percentage were derived from weighing cadavers who were, in most instances, homeless people in their 70's. (Obviously, their bone density would be quite a bit less than the average bodybuilder's.)<BR>
3)	Strength training increases bone density.<BR> 
Michael H. Stone, a prominent strength-training physiologist has reviewed the subject most extensively. He wrote a great paper on it which was published in <I>Strength and Power in Sport</I> (edited by P.V. Komi), published by Blackwell Scientific Publications for the International Olympic Committee Medical Commission.<BR>
Dr. Stone points out that:<P>
1)	Bone density is higher in athletes who are exposed to high forces (weightlifters and throwers) as compared to athletes who have an aerobic base (distance runners and soccer players).<BR>
2)	Swimmers (non-weight-bearing athletes) have the lowest bone density.<BR>
3)	Bone density is more likely to increase at weight-bearing sites (e.g., femoral neck) than at non-weight-bearing sites (e.g., mid-radius). (The femur is the thigh bone, and the radius is one of the forearm bones.)<BR>
4)	Depending on the site, junior weightlifters have bone densities 13% to 34% greater than non-athletes.<BR>
5)	Bone-mineral content is highly related to the load lifted. In other words, the stronger you are, the denser your bones are likely to be. This has been shown in both weightlifters and powerlifters.<BR>
6)	Strength training may offset the effects of osteoporosis.<BR>
7)	Strength training is far superior to aerobic training for increasing bone density.<P>
Because some of the added bodyweight you gained while on your bodybuilding program is skeletal weight (particularly if you do lots of squats and overhead work, like snatches and presses), the underwater fat test is rather useless. In fact, your best bet is to use skin-fold calipers and take measurements over ten different sites. Use only the sum of the skin folds as your gauge for bodyfat loss.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>I need some help with my legs. My legs measure 26.5 inches at midpoint. My hamstrings are okay, so I don't work them much. My problem is the inside of my legs. My leg routine is as follows:<P>
	<CENTER>5 sets of squats<BR>
	5 sets of leg presses<BR>
	4 sets of leg extensions</CENTER><P>
I go to 375 lbs on the squat for 6 reps and have 9 plates on each side of the leg press for 6-8 reps. I was going to start doing my leg presses with my feet closer together and lower on the platform in order to emphasize the inside of my legs. Right now my feet are shoulder width apart and high on the platform of the leg press. Could you please help me out?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>I get this type of letter all the time, but they're difficult, if not impossible, to answer because they lack some very basic but essential information. In order to properly assess this person's question, I would need to know the following:<P>
1)	At what tempo are the reps performed?<BR>
2)	How long is the rest interval between sets?<BR>
3)	Are all these sets true work sets, or is the last one the only gut buster?<BR>
4)	How many reps are performed on the leg extensions? And what is the foot position?<BR>
5)	How deep do you go in your squats and leg presses?<BR>
6)	How much do you weigh, and what is your height?<BR>
7)	What do you mean by the inside of your thighs? Do you want to develop the adductors (the long, thin muscles that lie vertically in the inside of the thigh) or the vastus medialis muscles (the "teardrop" shaped muscles slightly above the knee)?<BR>
8)	How often do you train your legs?<P>
I don't have all the info, but I'll do my best to answer your question. Assuming that you want to emphasize the adductors in squat and leg-press training, you have to use a wide stance with the feet turned outward as much as proper ergonomics will allow.<P>
You also want to double the number of reps on every set. In this manner, you'll tap into the FOG (fast oxidative glycolytic) fibers, which will bring about greater growth. In leg training, heavy weights are not always necessary, as we can see from the size of the leg muscles of speed skaters and alpine skiers who perform a lot of work where the time under tension is elevated.<P>
Another tip that will help is that one workout out of two should be devoted to hamstrings-only training-if you are truly interested in thigh size.<P>
Don't hesitate to write me again with your question, but please include the info I need.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> I'm a trainer for the U.S. Air Force, and every month I truly enjoy reading your column and articles, but what I want to know is where do you get all this information? Do you read a lot, or is it experience, or what? What are your sources?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>To answer this question, I must say that <B>a)</B> I do read a lot, just in a more creative way than the average person, and <B>b)</B> I apply my readings to my work even if they're not directly related to my field of expertise.<P>
Recently, in between the prejudging and the evening show of the Mr. Olympia, I was graciously invited to go for a ride with Bill in a Gulf Stream jet, and while we were flying over the Great Lakes, we discussed the value of reading. I discovered, as both Type A-behavior people, we hate wasting time and have the habit of "listening to books" while driving in a car or during idle time. I make a point of reading or listening to three books per week. Assuming that the average person drives 30 minutes a day, if that person were to listen to informational tapes instead of garbage radio, he or she would get the equivalent of a university semester of course work in a matter of weeks.<P>
There are many areas of knowledge that we can apply to the field of exercise physiology, whether music, psychology, business, etc. One of the best books I've read over the last few years is by best-selling author and Fortune 500 companies' consultant Steven Covey: <I>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</I>.<P>
One of the more useful Stephen Covey quotes is, "The good is the enemy of the best." This refers to the fact that people will keep themselves busy to give themselves the illusion that they're productive. After reading this quote, I went to coach the alpine ski team at the local gym in the ski resort in Whistler. As I was coaching my athletes, I watched the average local trainees who usually get only mediocre results.<P>
These guys were doing the "good instead of the best." They never did the most result-producing tasks. As my female skiers were doing chins with 35-lb to 50-lb dumbbells, some local lift operator (a granola-eating, herbal-cigarette-smoking piece of white trash) came up and admiringly said in a voice reminiscent of Beavis': "Wow, are these ladies ever strong! I wish I could have strong lats like that." Well, at this point, one of my athletes, Stephanie, answered Dorko the Amazing Snowboard-Head (nicknamed by yours truly), "Hey Dorko, maybe your problem is all you do for your lats is the geeky lat-pulldown machine. And by the way, if you were into personal hygiene, you'd be able to pull yourself up without having to lift all the dead cells, dried sweat, and other putrid grunge your body holds on to dearly, you [expletive deleted] twirp. Get out of here before I puke on you."<P> 
People will select good exercises instead of the best ones, even while knowing that in the same time it takes them to do the good exercises, they could do the best ones and see results much faster. So for example, if they did chin-ups instead of pulldowns or squats instead of leg presses, their progress would skyrocket. If they used a variation of the deadlift instead of just leg curls, they'd also build a thick set of erector spinae (the muscles in the lower back which pull you up from a bent-over position). You get the idea.<P>
(By the way, after Dorko was torn apart by Stephanie, he ran to the showers, got a haircut, and is now over his young-adult identity crisis and works as a junior executive at Merrill Lynch under the nickname Sergeant Slaughter.)
<P> 

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> What do you think of Drs. Fleck and Kraemer's new book <I>Periodization Breakthrough!</I> I want to know if it's worth buying.</B>
 
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>In training, like in nutrition, you'll find that there are conflicting opinions on the best way to get cut. For example, Keith Klein uses a low-fat approach to dieting, while Dan Duchaine espouses a 33%-fat diet. Yet there's still some common ground; for example, both Dan and Keith will tell you to stay away from refined sugars.<P> 
You'll find the same thing with training. Some people will tell you to train using low sets (Mentzer, Jones, and Darden), while others believe in using many sets (Egger, Kubik, Hartmann, and Tünnemann), but one common ground that is emerging in bodybuilding is the need for more planned variation in training load and intensities. These variations are known as "periodization."<P>
Amusingly, a few years ago at a sports science meeting in Canada, I got into an argument with a colleague who refused to use the word periodization. He said the word was sexist and not politically correct. His rationale? Periodization will be associated with menstrual cycles: "PERIOD"-ization. What a dweeb. The etymology of periodization actually refers to the word <I>period</I> which in Finnish illustrates the seasons of the year.<P>
Both Drs. Fleck and Kraemer are among the first American exercise physiologists, after Richard Berger, to show a genuine interest in the development of effective strength-training protocols, while their colleagues were still interested in the over-studied field of aerobic training. Both authors have published extensively in the scientific peer-reviewed type of publication and have authored several books on strength training, including the best seller <I>Designing Resistance Training Programs</I>.<P> 
Dr. Fleck has worked for several years as a physiologist and consultant for elite national athletes at the United States Olympic Committee's Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. Dr. Kraemer is from Penn State and has had extensive experience both in the research and practical areas of strength training. He's also the founding editor of the <I>Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</I>. But their biggest credit is that they have been able to "translate" the scientific literature so the layman can understand the material.<P>
As one can see, the book was written by experts. The authors discuss the concepts behind training periodization, the loading parameters to be manipulated, periodization models, monitoring, and planning of training phases-weeks, intermediate cycles, and training year.<P> 
I'd say the degree of satisfaction you'll get from this book will depend on your level of expertise. Someone who works with periodization models on a daily basis (e.g., a university strength coach or a national team coach) may find it too basic, but for about 98% of the readership out there, I would rate the book highly valuable as it bridges the gap between scientific research and practical application. The concepts brought forward in the book will be of help to the fitness enthusiast, athlete, and bodybuilder alike.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> I'm a tall ectomorph, and my squat has not gone up in weeks. Any suggestions on how I can improve? At first, it went up rapidly, but now I'm at the point where I dread doing my squat workouts. It takes an ephedrine sandwich with ma-huang spread to get up for these workouts. What should I do?</B>
 
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>First, at this point, the best way to improve your squat is to stop squatting... Yes, I am serious. Your nervous system is probably sick and tired of the movement.<P>
Second, for your slender body type, I would suggest you embark on a bent-knee deadlift specialization program. The bent-knee deadlift and back squat work basically the same muscles. Once you set a new record in the deadlift, you can return to the squat and expect an increase in squatting performance.<P>

Have a training question that you just have to have answered? Well, you're in luck! You can now set up a personal telephone consultation with Charles Poliquin by contacting Laura Moore at Guruetc (500-484-BODY) or e-mail (GURUetc@aol.com).<P>Charles Poliquin is also available for seminars. He'll be discussing Loading Parameters for Mass and Strength Training on March 1 and 2, 1997, in Montreal, Canada. Contact Natalie Delisle at 514-626-8363 or e-mail VAM@total.net for more information.<P>

    <H3>THE SCIENCE OF SUPPLEMENTS TAKES ANOTHER STEP FORWARD</H3><P>
    <H4>by Dan Duchaine</H4></CENTER>
  	<FONT SIZE=+3>1960</FONT SIZE> was the high point of anabolic development.  Doc Ziegler was handing out little blue Dianabol pills to Olympic lifters at York, Pennsylvania.  Deca Durabolin, the same anabolic steroid that pregnant women synthesize naturally, was also commercially introduced.  Both steroids were tremendous advancements over the various testosterones that athletes had been using.  There was an old saying, "If you can't grow on Deca and D-bol, then nothing's gonna' work."  And frankly, that generally remained true.  Nothing after 1960 was any better.  We got fancier steroids with less side effects.  We tried veterinary steroids.  We embraced underground "designer steroids," supposedly smuggled in from East Germany.  Growth hormone never really panned out as the great superior anabolic we all prayed for.  Clenbuterol was surprisingly effective for fat loss, and it was mildly anabolic, but it was no anabolic second coming.<P>  
	Nonetheless, in the upcoming year, 1996, we will see a bona-fide new anabolic development.  The name is HMB, short for <B>ß-Hydroxy ß-Methylbutyrate</B>. HMB is highly anti-proteolytic.  And its effects are not hearsay: they're backed up with scientific study.  This research is not the usual rat and chicken studies.  The anti-proteolytic research was done on weightlifting humans.  The HMB subjects got stronger, and they got bigger on only three grams a day!  HMB is the start of a new anabolic revolution: supplemental nutrients that deliver drug-like anabolic effects.  You can buy it NOW.  It won't break your savings account.  It's <B><I>not</I></B> an illegal steroid.  But here's the best part: HMB is, for the time being, the bodybuilder's secret.  The armchair academics will cautiously wait for follow-up studies.<P>
  Because I have been investigating the various effects of muscle trauma in the development of my Body Contract workout system, I immediately understood the anabolic effects that HMB induces.  Over the years, I've encountered a number of naysayers who have said, "Supplements don't work: they're all scams.  Just train and eat good food."  HMB relegates these reactionaries into the same class of people that belong to the Flat-Earth Society.<P>

	Usually I don't have much faith in any nutrient masquerading as an "anti-catabolic."  I think it's because many nutritional supplement companies have used this term in the loosest manner possible as a marketing ploy.  Catabolism, as applied to athletic performance, is when the amino acid content of the muscle cell decreases.  The active hormones that cause this to happen are <I>cortisol</I> and <I>glucagon</I>.  Cortisol secretion happens when stress and trauma are inflicted on the body.  Glucagon is elevated from variances of nutritional intake.  Up to this point, nutrient anti-catabolics have been mostly replacement nutrients.  For example, the major sacrificial aminos which are debited from a muscle cell from increased cortisol are glutamine and the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs).  So whenever you encounter advertising copy that claims these amino acids are "anti-catabolic," there is a built-in assumption, namely, that the fortification of these amino acids will either replace or forestall their egress from the muscle.<P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H3>"This is a revolutionary way of dealing with catabolism: limit the muscle damage before cortisol can be secreted in response."</H3></CENTER><P>
<HR>
  Perhaps we could say that these types of nutrients are <I>passive</I> anti-catabolics.  The true active anti-catabolics (all are prescription drugs) deal mostly with cortisol's effects in a number of ways, not all of them successful.  Anabolic steroids block cortisol from latching onto muscle cells.  Cytadren, the Cushing Syndrome drug, attenuates cortisol secretion.  But remember: cortisol is a reaction to <I>any</I> kind of stress and trauma in the body.  And point of fact, your typical bodybuilding workout is a type of trauma that causes cortisol secretion.  Each workout sends a signal to the muscle cells to expel amino acids along with the anabolic stimulus we all strive for.  Cortisol, however, is a necessary hormone, secreted in reaction to some kind of damage.  Without cortisol, you would die, and it would be a painful death at that.  So limiting cortisol, in a performance sense, is cautiously a good thing to do, but too much inhibition will cause great pain in the joints.  Anabolic steroids combat the effects of cortisol in a very well-balanced manner, actually reducing joint inflammation.  However, this short-term solution completely ignores the reason for elevated catabolism in the first place: muscle trauma.<P>
<CENTER><H5>Qualitative Trauma</H5></CENTER>
	In my Body Contract workout system, I recognized that ultimate anabolic response from training is a give-and-take situation.  Some part of the weightlifting exercise causes muscle growth. We can't be absolutely sure what the specific anabolic stimulus is, but it seems to center around the muscle trauma happening in the eccentric (lowering) part of the weightlifting movement.  But at the same time, lifting heavy weights also causes damage to the muscle.  This combination of inflammation and microtears in the muscle fibers is the trauma that cortisol responds to.  The net anabolic response is a <I>ratio of the anabolic stimulus contrasted with catabolism</I>.  The muscle will grow when the anabolic part overwhelms the catabolic component.<P>
  When muscle growth plateaus, the cause is a rough counterbalance of opposing forces.  Many bodybuilders assume the cause of the halt of progress is because the workout is not intense enough, but I believe that in most cases there is more than enough anabolic stimulus within the typical high-intensity workout, but within the same workout, too much nonproductive (perhaps counterproductive) trauma is happening.  Some amount of inflammation and microtears is necessary for muscle cell growth.  But too much intensity will generate so much trauma that the anabolic/catabolic ratio is changed because of increased cortisol.<P>
<CENTER><H4>Changing the Anabolic/Catabolic Ratio</H4></CENTER>
<HR>
	At the various Olympic training centers, sports medicine specialists are constantly measuring athletes' blood levels to chart the various anabolic and catabolic hormones in the body.  Obviously, the individual can't significantly increase testosterone or growth hormone levels.  It's against the rules.  The alternative is to lower the cortisol, the chief catabolic hormone.  When this happens, at the same testosterone level, more anabolic activity happens because of the newly adjusted testosterone/cortisol ratio. This reasoning applies to the weightlifting workout.  To enhance the anabolic stimulus, we have two choices: either somehow instill a greater anabolic stimulus (and keep in mind that the specific anabolic stimulus is still unknown), or conversely, reduce the trauma.  Reduced trauma will cause a more favorable anabolic/catabolic ratio, and as a result, less cortisol is secreted.  This cortisol reduction causes less catabolism and magnifies the effects of both testosterone and growth hormone.  So why am I spending all this time writing about this reduction of muscle trauma?  Because HMB's anti-proteolytic properties are not the typical passive anti-proteolytic properties that we expect from non-drug sources.<P>
<IMG HEIGHT=72 ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE SRC="../images/mentor2.gif" ALT="[Mentor graphic]">   <I>HMB causes a reduction of muscle trauma!</I><P>
This is a revolutionary way of dealing with catabolism: limit the muscle damage before cortisol can be secreted in response.<P>
	How does it work?  We don't know!  Here's what I know so far.  In front of me, with the rubber-stamped "CONFIDENTIAL" on every page, I have a pre-publication human study, "The Effect of the Leucine Metabolite ß-Hydroxy ß-Methylbutyrate on Muscle Metabolism During Resistance Training."  All the subjects who used 3 grams a day of HMB gained strength and muscle over 3 weeks on a diet shockingly low in calories (less than 2,400 calories a day).  Muscle trauma was measured in two ways.  With blood tests, the enzyme creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) was measured.  High CPK levels are an indication of muscle trauma.  Also, urine samples were analyzed for 3-methylhistine (3MH) excretion.  With both trauma markers, three grams of HMB significantly reduced both CPK and 3MH.<P>
  But why does HMB work?  I have my own hypothesis.  In this human study, something very interesting happened during  the workout.  The subjects were using relatively heavy weights with repetitions averaging between three and five.  Usually in weightlifting, most of the work load is done with the fast-twitch, Type II muscle fibers.  However, HMB caused a greater engagement of the slow-twitch, Type I fibers.  This doesn't usually happen in high-tension weightlifting.<P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H3>"All the subjects who used 3 grams a day of HMB gained strength and muscle over 3 weeks on a diet shockingly low in calories..."</H3></CENTER><P>
<HR>
  I dug up another HMB study, this one on fat quality of beef that were fed HMB.  The results?  The animals had <I>greater amounts of intramuscular fat</I> than normal.  So what?  Do we want more intramuscular fat in humans?  Usually no, because deposition of intramuscular fat usually happens when the individual is immensely obese.  Usually we can't selectively load intramuscular fat without putting fat in other bad places.  But as Barry Sears, the other "fat-diet" guy, pointed out a few issues back in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, intramuscular fat is a superior energy source for ATP production, much faster and more efficient than glucose or glycogen.<P>
  I believe the real focus of the anti-proteolytic activity of HMB is related to the high amounts of intramuscular fat it facilitates, allowing the slow-twitch, Type I fibers to stay engaged during high-tension anaerobic exercise.  By spreading the tension (weight) over more muscle fibers, there is less trauma induced from less microtears during the eccentric phase.  At the start of this HMB anabolic revolution, the obvious application was for muscular growth in bodybuilders.  But I imagine that even endurance athletes would immensely benefit from increased intramuscular fat levels.<P>
<CENTER><H4>HMB HISTORY</H4></CENTER>
<HR>
	Where did HMB come from?  HMB is the twice removed metabolite of the amino acid <I>leucine</I>.  The transformation happens in the liver.  First leucine is catabolized to a leucine variant called alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC).  We have had KIC supplements for a few years now in response to some studies indicating that KIC is anti-catabolic.  But there are problems with using it.  The average dosage to generate a small anti-catabolic effect is at least 15 grams.  Most individuals don't use nearly enough.  The more serious concern is that we now know that the next metabolite catabolized from KIC is the actual compound that instills the anti-proteolytic effect.  This is, of course, HMB.  Unfortunately, the body doesn't readily convert KIC into HMB.  The logical thing to do is isolate the HMB compound, which is what the scientists did.<P>
  HMB is an efficient anti-proteolytic. HMB is optimal with only 3 grams a day verses the 15-gram amounts needed with KIC.  We have two natural sources of HMB: grapefruit and (of all things) catfish.  But you won't see the amazing anti-proteolytic catfish and grapefruit diet anytime soon, as you need crates of each to find the three grams.<P>
<CENTER><H4>HMB Availability & Dosages</H4></CENTER>
<HR>
	This will be the year of HMB.  So where is it?  The bottleneck is the present absence of commercial availability.  Buried in the confidential papers that an unknown source lent me, I found the original cost to produce the first batch.  Fifty kilograms cost the researchers $100,000!  That's $2,000 a kilo!  In the mid-'80's, black-market steroid manufacturers could buy raw steroid ingredients for less.  The task over these last few months has been to make HMB economically viable. I know of at least three companies that are deep in development to make HMB economical.  (<I>Editors Note:</I> One thing that supplement companies which are pursuing HMB may need to know is that if they plan on selling this product as a muscle builder, they're going to have to somehow get permission from a company called Metabolic Technologies, Inc. [MTI] that has exclusively licensed the patent from the Iowa State University Research Foundation. So far, MTI is the first and only company to bring HMB to the market.)<P>
 <HR>
<CENTER><H3>"Been using it for three weeks, feels like Deca [Durabolin]."</H3></CENTER><P>
<HR>
	So three grams a day: all at once?  No. The activity of HMB has a four-hour time span.  Consequently, the logical dosage would be one gram every four hours or so.  I must tell you, initially when I encountered HMB in March of this year, I was not terribly impressed.  This was because most other so-called anti-catabolic nutrients, especially KIC, have had very unexciting results.  I had put the small amount of research that Jessica, my research assistant, found via Medline in a file and promptly forgot about it.  A few months later, I received a query from Bill Phillips asking if I would be interested in doing an article on HMB.  Scrawled across the page, handwritten, was the terse message: "Been using it for three weeks, feels like Deca [Durabolin]."  If this statement came from some advertisement from Leo Costa and his ilk, I would have never believed it, but this was a personal message from someone who knows that I'd lob a merciless flame assault over the FAX machine if I thought he was trying to pull a fast one.  And then that human HMB study arrived.  I was sold.<P>
<CENTER><H4>Will It Work For You?</H4></CENTER>
<HR>
	Time will tell.  The subjects in the HMB study were "newbies," not having worked out for at least three months.  The greatest gain was over two and a half pounds after three weeks of training.  Granted, all beginners make some kind of progress.  But other research shows that weightlifting repetitions of between three and five is not the optimal repetition range for growth.  This is the repetition range that the HMB subjects used.  I'm predicting that combining HMB with my Body Contract workout should generate even more spectacular results.  And at this moment, my East Coast assistant is going into his human lab rat mode and will do complete blood chemistries before and after HMB and Body Contract use.<P>  
	This next year is going to be tremendously exciting.  We have found a powerful anti-proteolytic nutrient that most researchers still don't know about.  We're going to have thousands of bodybuilders becoming nontraditional researchers.  And when the recognized researchers cautiously advance the concept of HMB's anti-proteolytic properties, bodybuilders will just yawn and say, "Been there, done that.  What's <I><B>really</B></I> new?"  And when HMB does make it to the commercial market and you try it, write in and let me know how it worked for you.  I have this feeling that HMB is the start of a new, glorious <B><I>anabolic revolution</I></B>.<P>

Dear Friend,<P>
I'm definitely not one of the smartest men on the planet, but I do have a great deal of <I>common sense</I>. I'm a logical man, so I struggle with things that don't make sense-they frustrate me.<P> 
One thing that's been nagging at me for many years and has become a real source of frustration lately has to do with how the "medical establishment" views folks like us who want to build more muscular, leaner, stronger physiques.<P>
Think about this: why is it that the medical community considers it perfectly normal to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day, get drunk five times a week, and consume a diet that is tantamount to timed-release suicide, but it's considered <I>abnormal</I> to want to build muscle?<P> 
Why is it considered normal to go to cosmetic surgeons and have them rebuild your face, suck out your fat, and cram a couple of 400-cc plastic bags of saline under your skin, while those who endeavor to put their time and effort into building a classical, muscular physique are considered mentally unbalanced?<P>
Why are doctors writing over 80,000 prescriptions a week for diet pills, which are unquestionably being used as "cosmetic drugs" by thousands, but you can't get a doctor to even talk about prescribing drugs for weight/muscle gain?<P>
Why is it that a person who aspires to build a strong, muscular, healthy body typically can't find a physician who knows anything about the subject or who can give a more intelligent response than, "Why on earth would you want to build more muscle? That's ridiculous!"<BR>
(It doesn't make sense... does it?)<P>
In reality, wanting to build a lean, strong, muscular body-to pursue physical perfection-is a desire that man has had for thousands of years. Ancient Greeks often depicted the human figure, through paintings or sculptures, with perfect muscular proportions.<P>
Virtually all of Michaelangelo's work, from his statue of David to his painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel of God creating Adam, depicted muscular, lean, proportionate figures. Artists like da Vinci often depicted heroic men with well-developed muscular physiques as well.<P> 
In modern-day times, figures who are good, of sound mind and pure soul, are depicted in much the same way as the ancient Greeks viewed their gods-with broad shoulders, a narrow waist, and muscular arms and legs. Cartoon superheroes like Batman and Superman (even those damned Ninja Turtles) are depicted with ripped abs, capped shoulders, and "V-tapers." Cinema superstars like Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Van Damme rely on their physiques to play the part of heroes as well.<P>
Make no mistake-man's desire to build a muscular body does not emanate from insecurity or psychological abnormalities, nor is it something that was created by Joe Weider, Perry Rader, Charles Atlas, or Jack LaLanne. Man's desire to sculpt a Greek god-like physique is innate-it's as natural as his desire to be successful and provide for his family.<BR>
(This makes sense... doesn't it?)<P>
Why then is it considered so out of the ordinary, by the medical establishment, to seek the assistance of modern science to build a better body?<P>
I'm not merely referring to the use of drugs like anabolic steroids-using virtually <I>any</I> muscle-building compound, such as creatine, HMB, amino acids, etc., is something that 95+% of all doctors consider completely unnecessary and irrational.<P> 
Don't believe me? Walk into your doctor's office tomorrow and tell him/her that you want to build 18" arms and bench press 365 lbs at 5% bodyfat. Tell him what supplements you're using and which ones have worked for you. Ask your doctor to test your blood because you want to see if your cortisol levels are optimal for building muscle or to see if your testosterone levels are low, so you can determine whether you need to take testosterone. (Do it-I dare you!) Your doctor won't know what the hell you're talking about and he/she will think you're friggin' nuts!<P>
Do doctors think we (bodybuilders) are out of line because the nature of medicine in Western society is <I>exclusively</I> to treat disease? The answer to that question is a resounding NO!<P>
Think about it... literally hundreds of thousands of Americans have elective cosmetic surgery each year-surgery that is <B>not</B> necessary and does not treat, cure, nor prevent any disease.<P>
Cosmetic surgery is widely accepted, despite numerous risks that are inherent to these procedures, including infections, excessive bleeding, and the always present potential of fatalities that go hand in hand with the use of anesthetics. And, on top of all this, the outcome of cosmetic surgery often leaves patients extremely dissatisfied (and many patients end up having additional cosmetic procedures to "repair" problems from the first surgery!).<P>
And now, the medical community has clearly established a precedent for the use of cosmetic pharmaceuticals with the rampant dissemination of fat-loss drugs like Redux (dexfenfluramine). Tens of thousands of women who are not anywhere near clinically obese are being written prescriptions for this powerful appetite suppressant (which I be-lieve could have more side effects than 'roids!).<BR>   
(Do you see why I'm frustrated?)<P> 
Why on earth is it not acceptable or "allowed" for a man to have the opportunity to seek the assistance of a competent, qualified practitioner with expertise in "physique augmentation"? A doctor who would respect your individuality and freedom of choice without copping an attitude or passing judgment.<P>
If you walk into a plastic surgeon's office and say you'd like to get a nose job or some cheek implants, does he/she say, "You're not ugly enough for plastic surgery"? No. The doctor listens to what you want, why you want it, and then he or she tells you what can be done for you. And, oftentimes, the doctor will explain, "While I'm in there, I could also give you some stronger cheekbones, lift the skin around your eyes, and give you fuller lips..."<P>
Here's my solution-I believe the medical establishment should create a new class of medical doctors who specialize in physique augmentation and body-composition alterations. I'm not talking about doctors who just prescribe steroids all day-I'm referring to <I>experts</I> who would be intricately trained in every aspect of building muscle and enhancing strength while simultaneously reducing bodyfat. These doctors would be well versed in areas such as weight training, nutrition, supplementation, and pharmaceuticals. These medical specialists would work with people (like us) who want to build better bodies, for whatever reason. Maybe some want to compete in bodybuilding contests, but most won't-most will do it for much the same reasons people have plastic surgery-to look better.<P> 
A competent "physique-augmentation practitioner" would first spend time consulting with you, getting an idea of what kind of body you would like to have and also make detailed notes about what you've done, to this point, to get in shape. Then, extensive blood work would be done to evaluate hormone levels, overall health, blood lipids, etc. Body-composition measurements would also be made.<P>
Then, various strategies would be employed, such as a prescribed training and nutrition program, supplement regimen, etc. A follow-up consultation would be scheduled where your progress and health would be evaluated and monitored.<P> 
It would seem likely that, in most cases, the use of anabolic steroids or growth hormone would be a <B>last</B> resort. But in some cases, it would be warranted if the level of muscle mass and strength the subject desired to attain exceeded what their genetics would allow, even <I>with</I> a disciplined training, nutrition, and proper supplementation program. In this instance, the physique-augmentation practitioner would prescribe doses of anabolic steroids that have been shown in clinical studies (like the one recently reported in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>) to be safe and effective. Regular consultations would be scheduled to guard against side effects while trying to maximize results.<P>
The truth is that for the typical, healthy human being, the administration of steroids by a competent physician poses very few risks and, in many cases, produces tremendous results. In fact, I don't think there's really any question as to whether the use (not abuse) of most anabolic steroids is safer than the use of appetite-suppressant drugs like Redux.<P>
Also, think about the health benefits involved with the type of program a physique-augmentation practitioner would prescribe. When a women goes in to get a new set of boobs or a guy goes in to get fat sucked out of his belly, what are the health benefits? I can't think of any. But, when you're training with weights, consuming a proper diet, and using the right supplements, there's no question that your health improves dramatically. And, what adverse reactions that might occur secondary to the use of certain anabolic steroids could be dramatically offset by the health-enhancing effects of exercise and proper nutrition.<P> 
Ponder this-people suffering from low self-esteem often think that maybe getting a hair transplant (another cosmetic procedure that has its share of risks) or a nose job will change the way they view themselves or the way others view them. But, in most cases, they're wrong. If a person with a flabby, pear-shaped body has a nose job, they're still, for the most part, not going to look that great. But with the help of a physique-augmentation practitioner, they could literally transform their whole bodies, including their health, vigor, and energy and very, very likely extend their lives!<P> 
There are literally hundreds of thousands of people who are out there, right now, self-administering steroids. That's not good. Anabolic steroids can be very dangerous (as could almost any medication) if they're being used by people who don't know what the hell they're doing. That's why, for the past ten years, I've tried to do what I can to inform those individuals who are interested in steroids and other bodybuilding drugs and help them learn what the true risks and benefits are. But in recent years, this whole steroid mess has gotten much worse. Nowadays, I'd guess that over 90% of the steroids sold on the black market (which is virtually the only place people can get them) aren't even real, and some contain dangerous contaminants.<P>
Another compounding factor is that even though competitive bodybuilding isn't growing (<I>Muscle Media 2000</I> <B>isn't</B> really a magazine for competitive bodybuilders, by the way-the majority of those who read this magazine are interested in building a better body for other reasons, not to compete in a typical bodybuilding contest), the number of people who are weight training, using supplements, and following "bodybuilder-like" programs is increasing dramatically! Literally millions of people from all walks of life-Hollywood superstars, lawyers, corporate CEO's, athletes, college students, etc., want to have greater muscularity, less fat, and get better results faster from the time they spend exercising.<P>
The fact is, establishing a segment of medicine that specializes in physique augmentation or positive body-composition alterations would be a tremendously lucrative practice, not only for physicians but for drug companies as well! (The drug companies are going to be amazed when they discover the profit potential of what I'm proposing.)<P>
And, it's not like you'd have any trouble finding guys or gals who would like to be physique-augmentation practitioners-there are probably hundreds of people who read <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> alone-people who are going to college, trying to decide what career they should pursue, and so on, who could get extremely motivated about becoming a "bodybuilding doctor." I've received so many letters over the years from folks who are very passionate and excited about weight training and bodybuilding, and they want to somehow find a career that complements their interests (like I've been fortunate enough to do). Many of these people end up pursuing "sports medicine" degrees, which can lead to an exciting $30,000-a-year job putting away weights. Others become personal trainers, some pursue chiropractic medicine (because it's a little more open minded), others become pharmacists, and some become medical doctors, but most end up somewhat unfulfilled.<P>
Many of these individuals would make fantastic medical practitioners who specialize in helping people build better bodies. And, a lot of general practitioners who are  into bodybuilding would jump at the chance to undertake the required training to become a "bodybuilding doctor."<P>
This all just makes too much sense. Somewhere, somehow, something has gone wrong-I don't know if it's the negative stigma that surrounds bodybuilding because of the freakish nonsense that goes on in the upper echelon of this sport or if all the sensationalism that surrounds steroid use by athletes has warped people's minds, but something isn't right.<P>
Of course, the truth is, if competent medical professionals were in charge of administering steroids or helping people achieve their physique goals <B>without</B> the use of steroids, we could put an end to this "steroid problem" altogether.<P>
I'm not insinuating that steroids should be sold over the counter-that's not my point at all. As a matter of fact, I don't care if they remain Schedule III controlled substances. It's just that <I>if</I> someone is determined to use them in an effort to build a better body, this use should be monitored by a doctor,   not a local black-market steroid dealer.<P>
I'm not saying that sporting federations should not ban steroid use-that's a completely different subject. If the International Olympic Committee, the NFL, the NCAA, etc. want to prohibit steroid use, that's fine. Anyone who chooses to participate in any particular organized sport should follow the rules of that organization. Likewise, if the people promoting the Miss America or Miss Universe contest want to prohibit all women who have had breast augmentation surgery, then that's perfectly reasonable as well.<P>
What I <B>am</B> getting at is that our medical establishment has already set a precedent for the use of cosmetic drugs, and they have also clearly established that it's fine and dandy to seek medical help for elective cosmetic procedures. Why, then, should the medical establishment not take the same approach to physique augmentation? <I>There is no reason!</I><P>
So, what can be done about all this-what can we do to fix the system? I believe a major change in this area can be made, and I'm going to make this one of my missions in the coming years. I'll lobby Congress, petition the American Medical Association, educate drug companies, etc. I believe that within 5 years (by the time I'm in my mid-30's), there will be radical reform in this area.<P> As a matter of fact, I already have a pretty good plan under way-a plan I'll tell you about in future issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. Under my plan, steroid <B>abuse</B> and the steroid black market will be virtually eliminated, and individuals who live in America-the freest nation on earth-will be able to exercise their independence and individuality and rightfully choose exactly what they want to do with their bodies-which is a decision that should always be made by an individual, <I>not</I> the government.<P>
What do you think? Am I nuts, or am I on track (again)? Mail or fax me your input and ideas, and I'll see if any of your insights can be put into my master plan-a master plan that I think may help solve some of bodybuilding's biggest problems and probably prevent needless deaths while enhancing the quality of life for thousands.<P>
Until next time...<P> 
Be Well,<BR>

P.S. Some people have expressed that they feel the bodybuilding industry has pushed for the illegalization of steroids in an effort to sell more "steroid-replacing supplements." You know what? I think some people might be right. I think the bodybuilding industry has taken a very hypocritical and detrimental stance on this issue by: a) lying about the fact that pro bodybuilders abuse the hell out of steroids and b) proclaiming that supplements and "championship workouts" are all that are needed to build a superhuman physique.<P>
Being in the supplement business myself, I'm not at all concerned about the possibility that if doctors could prescribe steroids for muscle building, people wouldn't use supplements. That's not at all true. As a matter of fact, I'd be thrilled if doctors understood how supplements like creatine and others can help those who exercise get better results faster, because as it stands now, most of them don't have a clue!!<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I heard that the pro bodybuilders you insulted in your last Q&A column, where you gave your brief Mr. Olympia contest commentary, were very offended by your remarks, and I understand several of them plan to kick your ass the next time you show your face at a bodybuilding contest unless you issue a formal apology. When I read your remarks, I thought they were rude and out of line. Don't you think you owe them an apology?<P></B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Oh... you're absolutely right... an apology is in order. Here goes... <BR><I>I'm so very sorry that you've taken so many bucketsful of steroids and gallons of growth hormone that you all look like circus sideshow freaks.</I><BR> Will that work?<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I've been reading a lot about these MuscleTech products in <I>Muscle-Mag International</I>. These supplements have really been getting a lot of hype. I have a hard time taking many of their claims seriously, but they recently alleged their new product, Creatine 6000-ES, works better than any other creatine supplement, including Phosphagen HP, which is what I use. If there's a better creatine supplement on the market, I want to use it. But I'm skeptical-I occasionally scan the newsgroups on the Internet, and I saw one person write that the publisher of <I>MuscleMag</I>, Bob Kennedy; one of their editors, Johnny Fitness; and a writer named Greg Zulak own MuscleTech. He said these guys are scumbags and are running a major scam. Do you know the inside story?</B><P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>I've been asked different versions of this question literally hundreds of times over the past few months. Let me tell you what I know... starting with Bob Kennedy, who does not fit my definition of "scumbag." I have nothing but good things to say about Bob Kennedy. He is a unique individual, an extremely hard-working man, and he has done a lot for me and many others over the years-very unselfishly. He's also got an incredible sense of humor-his personality can definitely be seen throughout the pages of <I>MuscleMag</I>. He loves bodybuilding, he enjoys being entertained and being an entertainer, and, without expected reciprocation, he has helped many in this sport/endeavor bolster their careers. As for Bob's magazine, I always enjoy reading parts of it.<P>
Now, I don't know Greg Zulak or Gino Edwards (who writes under the "tongue-in-cheek" pen name of Johnny Fitness) all that well, but what contact I have had with them has been very amicable. I have no reason to believe that these people are scumbags or that they are up to something malicious.<P>
As far as the MuscleTech products being "hyped," I suppose I agree with that, but hype or aggressive promotions alone are not inherently wrong. I think that's true whether you sell supplements, gym equipment, furniture-whatever. There is absolutely, positively nothing wrong with aggressive marketing (if there were, I'd be in big trouble because I pride myself as being a very aggressive, creative, but straightforward promoter).<P>
I can't tell you the "whole story" behind MuscleTech because I simply don't know it. To the best of my knowledge, a young gentleman by the name of Paul Gardiner (the guy who appears in the before and after ads for MuscleTech) owns the company. I believe Paul used to work at a <I>MuscleMag</I> retail store in Canada. I have no evidence that suggests any type of ownership of MuscleTech by Kennedy, Zulak, or Edwards. I asked Kennedy about it, and he told me, very convincingly, that he has no ownership interest in MuscleTech, and I'm inclined to believe him, but that doesn't mean I believe that's all there is to the story; however, I have more important things to do than play 007 and go digging around to try to figure out what the deal is. It's possible he's telling the truth when he claims he has no interest in the company whatsoever. Why <I>MuscleMag</I> runs pages and pages of editorial plugs for MuscleTech products, if they aren't getting paid something besides regular advertising rates, I have no idea.<P>
Now, I do have one major problem with this MuscleTech campaign, and that is this nonsense about their Creatine 6000-ES product being better than Phosphagen HP, and the B.S. about scientific studies that show this. One thing I can tell you, with the utmost certainty, is that it is <I>completely untrue</I> that Creatine 6000-ES has been proven to be better than Phosphagen HP in any real scientific studies-the type of studies that EAS funds, which are conducted at legitimate universities by qualified sports medicine doctors using double-blind, placebo-controlled designs.<P> 
And, I can tell you that there are now three separate university studies showing that Phosphagen HP produces significant effects-effects even greater than regular creatine monohydrate (which is a very good supplement by itself!). The first study was conducted at the University of Nebraska at Omaha with college football players. In this trial, athletes who trained with weights and used Phosphagen HP gained more size and strength, lost more fat, and could jump higher and run faster than weight trainers who used regular creatine or a placebo. The results of this study are being presented at the American College of Sports Medicine's next conference.<P>
Another study in which Phosphagen HP was compared directly to creatine monohydrate was conducted at Creighton University where it was shown that Phosphagen HP significantly enhances "anaerobic work capacity"-by over 30%-which is over twice as much as creatine monohydrate alone has been shown to do! The results of this study will be presented at the next National Strength and Con-ditioning Association scientific conference.<P>
Yet another study, conducted by Dr. Richard Kreider at the University of Memphis, indicates that Phosphagen HP produces <I>significant</I> increases in lean mass and strength. The results of this study will also be presented at the next American College of Sports Medicine conference.<P>
As I've explained to you before, there are a lot of companies out there selling creatine monohydrate products that contain added amino acids and other "creatine boosters," <B>but not a single one</B> of them has been put to the test like Phosphagen HP has.<P> 
As you probably know, ever since I've been involved with EAS, I've been allocating thousands of dollars to legitimate university research. Lately, numerous other supplement companies are claiming their products are scientifically tested, too, but in most cases, it's not true-it's just a marketing ploy.<P>
So, to wrap this up-I really don't have anything bad to say about Kennedy, Zulak, Edwards, nor <I>MuscleMag</I>. I don't have any evidence that these individuals own MuscleTech, and I don't have any problem with MuscleTech trying to sell their products. My one major complaint is the misleading comparison and unsubstantiated claim that their creatine product has been shown to be more effective than Phosphagen HP. That claim simply isn't true; as a matter of fact, if they can provide proof, in the form of real, double-blind, published university studies, that their Creatine 6000-ES product is better than Phosphagen HP, I'll cut them a check for $30,000. That's a pretty fair challenge-don't you think?<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I've been reading a lot about DHEA lately, first in your magazine and then in the newspaper. I'm a 42-year-old "recreational bodybuilder," and I'm really quite conservative when it comes to the use of medications and even supplements. I don't like to just start taking something because everyone else is. In an effort to determine if I really needed to take DHEA, I went to my doctor and asked if he could test my blood levels for the hormone to see if I'm deficient. He looked at me like I asked him for a sex-change operation-he made me feel about two inches tall. The bottom line is that he refused to run a blood test so I could gain the knowledge about my body I need to make an informed decision. It really pissed me off. So now, I'm asking if you know where I can get a blood test, and while I'm at it, do you think I should be taking DHEA anyway?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>I can completely understand your situation-over the years, I've received many letters like yours-these letters had a lot to do with the frustration (which I explained in this issue's "No Holds Barred" column) that I have with the medical community. These doctors go on TV and tell people things like, "DHEA should be used only by people who are deficient in this hormone..." Then, people like you, who are taking responsibility for their own health care, ask their doctors to help determine if they're deficient in a hormone like DHEA or testosterone or if they have high levels of cortisol, and the doctors get offended. I don't know if their egos are such that they can't accept the fact that one of their patients would even know what the hell DHEA or testosterone is or if the American Medical Association (AMA) and the insurance companies have got them by the balls so tightly that they're afraid to do anything that isn't 100% AMA standard operating procedure or that they might not get reimbursed for.<P>
I've been able to finagle my own account with MetPath Laboratories. (I can have my blood tested in any damn city in the country-I can have a lab tech come out to my office and draw my blood any time I feel like it, and I can get every test run that you can think of.)<P>
I'm fascinated by blood work. I'm always keeping an eye on my liver and kidney enzymes, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as watching how my hormone levels react to different training, nutrition, and supplementation programs. It's really quite fascinating, but it is expensive-I probably spend $1,000 every 8 weeks on blood tests.<P>
As far as where you can get your blood tested, I wish I could turn you on to my source, but I had a hard enough time getting this account set up for myself-I don't want to blow it. What I would suggest is that you try seeing another doctor-make some calls, and be very honest. Try to get hooked up with a doctor who understands where you're coming from. Although most physicians will rudely reject your ideas, I'm certain that you will eventually find one who will be supportive and respectful of your desires.<P>
As far as whether I think you should be using DHEA or not, I believe that since you are over 40, you probably could benefit from taking between 50 and 200 mg of DHEA a day. Over the past six months, I've gathered a lot of feedback from readers of my magazine who are using DHEA, and there is unquestionably a connection between the age of the user and how much of a benefit he or she experiences. The older you are, the more you benefit from DHEA supplementation. Of course, this is because as you grow older, your body produces less and less DHEA. (By the way, women need less DHEA-maybe only 25 mg/day.)<P>
As long as we're on the subject of DHEA, let me tell you something about this hormone that has not been discussed much, if at all, in the many articles I've read about this compound. DHEA seems to have potent "anti-anxiety" properties. This is a very interesting effect of taking DHEA. Virtually all of us face anxiety in our lives, and for many, this anxiety leads to stress levels that raise cortisol (something that bodybuilders don't need excess amounts of circulating in their bodies). Anxiety becomes such a problem for some that they're often put on anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines. Scientists have discovered that DHEA may work just as well as these potent medications, without the side effects. And, DHEA also acts as an antidepressant or mood-elevating agent.<P>
Another interesting little tidbit of info about DHEA is that it may relieve the major symptoms of Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS). It appears that women who suffer from severe PMS have a different pattern of daily DHEA production than women with no PMS.<P>
There's no doubt that DHEA is an interesting compound-one that could have a lot of applications for adults over the age of 35 or 40. Of course, don't expect your doctor to know about any of this-what's usually on his or her mind is getting you in and out of the office as fast as possible without having to answer queries from you that bring their omnipotence into question.<P> 

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I read about the EAS Grand Spokesperson Championship in the last issue of your magazine, and it sounds like a really neat contest. I was going to enter the contest, but that was right before Thanksgiving, so I decided to start after the holiday, but then I couldn't train for a whole week because I took a vacation, and then I just couldn't get started on my diet because of all the holiday parties and whatnot. I just can't see bringing a Tupperware bowl with steamed rice and grilled chicken to a Christmas party where everyone is enjoying prime rib, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie, and so on. I think once I get all of this holiday hoopla out of the way, I'll be ready to start a program and stick with it. Is it too late to get involved?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>I'd give you a bad time about your procrastination and lack of discipline <I>if</I> I didn't do the same damn thing myself. Between Thanksgiving and New Year's is a really hard time to stay focused on a strict weight-training and nutrition program. Fortunately, you can still get involved in the EAS Grand Spokesperson Champion-ship, but I wouldn't wait around any longer-I would start your program <I>immediately</I> after the holidays. Whereas Thanksgiving through New Year's may be a shitty time to start a shape-up program, the day after New Year's is an excellent time! Building a more muscular, leaner, stronger body is a fantastic New Year's Resolution, and with the holidays behind you, you have NO MORE EXCUSES!<P>
Remember why I set up this self-improvement contest to begin with-I recognize that virtually everyone needs <I>positive pressure</I> to help them achieve their goals. I know that providing you with good information about training, nutrition, and supplementation gives you the knowledge to make progress, but if I don't do something to motivate you or give you a strong incentive to put your knowledge into practice, then I'm not doing my job-I'm not helping you build a better body.<P>
Remember, in my contest, the winners will not be judged by who has the greatest physique but rather by who makes the most improvement and who can articulate, in a 400-word essay, why he/she should be the Grand Champion.<P>
I've been very encouraged by the number of people who've entered the EAS Grand Spokesperson Championship, and I've received a lot of positive feedback. People really are having fun with this, and they're doing exactly what they should be-setting goals, developing a plan, and giving their bodybuilding program a 100% all-out effort.<P>
But, let me tell you something-the number of people who <I>enter</I> this contest will be far, far greater than the number of people who <I>finish</I> it. Unfortunately, some people, no matter how much they think they want to build a stronger, more muscular physique, don't really want it bad enough. They just can't stick with it. They train hard for a couple of weeks, follow a strict diet, and then they virtually give up on themselves. Hey... if you miss a couple workouts, blow your diet for a few days, etc., don't give up! Just forget it, and get right back on your program. Don't sabotage yourself. Giving up on your program because you had a bad day, or even a bad week, is analogous to getting a flat tire on your car and, instead of just fixing it, getting out and slashing the other three.<P> 
My advice to anyone who's thinking about getting involved in the EAS Grand Spokesperson Championship, and to those who are already on their programs, is to please stick with it! After 12 weeks of strict dieting, intense training, and proper supplementation, you are going to be so proud of what you've accomplished and so elated about what you see in the mirror that it could very well change your whole life!<P> 
This contest has the largest prize package in the history of bodybuilding (over half a million dollars in prizes!). The winner will receive my Lamborghini Diablo (valued at over $200,000) and a $50,000-endorsement contract; the runner-up will win a brand-new Corvette (valued at $41,000) and a $50,000-endorsement contract; 8 other finalists will win $10,000-endorsement contracts; and 40 others will receive a free 1-year supply of their 2 favorite EAS supplements (valued at $2,000).<P>
For those of you who are competing in this contest-please realize that every day you stick with your program, your chances of winning become better and better. That's because every single day, other competitors are giving up on themselves. Remember, those who succeed persevere-they know that grand achievements are the result of <B>consistent</B> small efforts, repeated daily.<P>
Okay-enough preaching-for those of you who still might want to get involved in the EAS Grand Spokesperson Championship, call 1-800-749-5596 (ask for Dept. #4355). When you call, I'll send you a complete training, nutrition, and supplementation program (which is a great bodybuilding guide, even for those who aren't competing in the contest!). I'll also send you a complete list of the rules and regulations and a couple free samples of EAS supplements along with coupons good for $40 off of supplements like HMB, Phosphagen HP, Phosphagain 2, etc.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I heard about the new EAS supplement BetaGen<SUP><FONT SIZE=-3>TM</FONT></SUP> and something else called Myoplex Plus Deluxe<SUP><FONT SIZE=-3>TM</FONT></SUP>. What's in these products, and how do they work?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>BetaGen is a new supplement that contains a combination of creatine and HMB (probably the two best bodybuilding supplements on the market). Not only do I think BetaGen works extremely well-enhancing size, strength, and quite possibly accelerating fat loss-but it's also very convenient and an excellent value. BetaGen comes in a delicious orange-flavored drink mix-you take 11_2 teaspoons of the powder, stir it in a little water, or add it to a protein drink or meal-replacement powder-it really is simple and easy to use.<P>
With Myoplex Plus Deluxe, you basically have a top-of-the-line meal-replacement powder with 42 grams of protein, including a high percentage of ion-exchanged whey, and you also get a dose of V2G, GKG, and CLA in each serving. Myoplex Plus Deluxe is probably the most nutritionally complete bodybuilding supplement I've ever used, and it tastes fantastic. It was not an easy task getting all of these nutrients combined into one "supershake" and making it creamy, delicious, and easy on the gut, but we did it.<P>
On the supplement program I'm using now, I have a serving of Myoplex Plus Deluxe with one serving of BetaGen in it first thing in the morning, and then I have the same thing again in the afternoon, and sometimes I have another serving of Myoplex Plus Deluxe, by itself, later in the evening. Then, right before I go to sleep, I have a serving of BetaGen mixed with our new cell-volumizing formula, CytoVol. This is a fantastic supplement program.<P>
Instead of going into lengthy explanations about these new EAS supplements, I've included a special report in the back of this magazine that has in-depth information about EAS' entire new 1997 supplement line.<P>
Please notice that this special report is what's called a "bind-in" piece. I did not take any articles out of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> to include this information. I included this report simply because we have been getting literally thousands of requests for more information on the new EAS supplement line, and I thought it would be helpful to many of our readers to include information about these products. Those of you who are not interested in supplements, don't even bother looking at this section-it's for people who have questions about what these products are, what kind of science is behind them, what is in them, and how to get them. Once again, this special report was not put in at the expense of any columns or feature articles that were scheduled for this magazine.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>The owner of my health-food store gave me some information about a supplement called Endurox. He said this stuff has been proven in scientific studies to enhance athletic performance. Do you know if it works?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Endurox is a form of Siberian ginseng called Ciwujia that has been heavily promoted in recent months as a performance enhancer. The claims of enhanced endurance with Endurox are not completely unsubstantiated, but most of the data, which allegedly supports the efficacy of this compound, cannot be located through the extensive research databases we have access to. I think some of these studies were done in Eastern Europe years ago.<P>
I figured a good way to determine if Endurox really works is to put it to the test in a university study, so that's what we're doing. I had EAS provide funding for a double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate anaerobic work capacity and aerobic endurance at Creighton University. We should have preliminary results of this study by the time the next issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> goes to press. The doctors who are conducting the study intend to present the findings at the next National Strength and Conditioning Association scientific conference.<P>	
I have no financial interest in Endurox whatsoever; I think it might actually work, but I'm not sure, and the data that's out there is not what I would call really compelling.<P>
As you probably know, EAS is allocating funds to advance the whole science of sports nutrition. A lot of this funding will be spent to investigate products which EAS sells or is developing, but some of it will be spent on studies like this one-studies that are designed merely to answer the question, "Does this supplement work, or doesn't it?"<P>
I'll keep you posted.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>A friend of mine recently bought 20 vials of LyphoMed Deca for $30 a piece from a guy in our gym who said that this is the most powerful brand of Deca there is and that it's definitely not counterfeit. Is this really the best stuff?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>To start with, Deca (nandrolone deca-noate) is the same molecule no matter what brand name you've got-Organon, Steris, LyphoMed, etc. It's all the same thing. That is, if it's real, and the LyphoMed that your friend just bought ain't.
LyphoMed was sold to another company called Fujisawa U.S.A. in 1990 and changed to that name in 1993. They stopped making Deca in January of 1990. The last expiration dates were 1992. 
LyphoMed Deca used to be one of the most popular brands on the black market because a wily cat in Florida was buying the stuff (out the "back door") with a pharmaceutical license he fraudulently obtained. I remember seeing that stuff floating around the gyms-you could buy a box of 25 of those suckers for a hundred bucks. That was only $4 for a 200-mg vial! But, those days are long, long gone.
Today, almost all of the steroids which are sold on the black market are fake, and some of the injectable ones, like what your friend recently got his hands on, can be very dangerous. Sometimes they just contain regular vegetable oil, which was definitely not intended to be injected into your body. Any impurities or bacteria that are in this stuff can cause terrible infections. Over the past couple of years, I've heard of a lot of guys who got abscesses in their glutes from using counterfeit, injectable steroids. These abscesses have to be "lanced" and left open for days to drain, and sometimes the infections can spread and become life threatening.
Going back to my "No Holds Barred" column in this issue of the magazine once again, my point with this whole steroid issue is that when the government clamped down on the black-market distribution of real anabolic steroids <B>and</B> also made it illegal for doctors to prescribe these drugs, they created a much bigger problem. You see, they did not squelch the <B>demand</B> for steroids; they just cut off the supply. Now there's this huge counterfeit steroid problem.
Steroids, like virtually all other drugs, should be administered under the careful scrutiny of a qualified doctor. Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, that will be possible, and we can put this whole problem behind us. 
I wish I could keep you up to date on every counterfeit steroid that hits the market, but that's impossible. In my new book-the 7th edition of my <I>Anabolic Reference Guide</I>-I'll give you all the information I have on how to identify dangerous counterfeits and so on. That book should be available in just a few months.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>What do you think of the following supplements: Acetabolan, Hydroxycut, Ripped Fuel, Blue Thunder, MegaMass 2000, Male Fuel, PowerBar, Cort-Bloc, carnitine, pyruvate, and Tribestan?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>That's a great question, but unfortunately, it requires an answer that is far beyond the scope of this column. (I've got only so much space to work with here.)
I review each of these supplements and over a hundred more in my all-new, completely updated <I>1997 Supplement Review</I>. I evaluate what they do and don't do from a scientific and real-world standpoint. I also go into great detail about how you should decide what supplements are likely to work for you taking into consideration what your particular bodybuilding goals are. I tell you how to buy supplements at the lowest prices and not get ripped off. I also show you how to stack supplements to get the best results. It's really a great book, if I do say so myself (and I do).<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I've been reading your magazine for about a year and a half, and I've noticed that you rip on people left and right; last issue you basically said Cybergenics and Hot Stuff were garbage, and you regularly implicate many others in the bodybuilding industry as being immoral, unintelligent, and have even accused some of being criminals. Sometimes I wonder who you think you are-are you so delusional that you think you're perfect and therefore see everyone else as inferior or what? I've seen some things written in the other magazines that suggest you are far from perfect, like that you've used steroids.</B>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>I'm delighted that you read my magazine, but I think you may not be reading it carefully.<P>
On a <I>regular basis</I>, I openly and candidly admit numerous things I do that are much "less than perfect."<BR> (Mother Teresa I ain't-that's for sure!)<P>
One of the things that is perceived as negative by many people is my use of steroids when I was competing in bodybuilding in the '80's, which is something I've been very honest about. But, that was such a valuable learning experience for me. How could I possibly be an expert on something if I've never experienced it? Experimenting with all different kinds of steroids back then enabled me to gain invaluable introspection and knowledge on this subject. Some view this as a negative thing-I see it as a positive experience.<P>
I think the thing that makes me an effective bodybuilding information provider-the reason literally tens of thousands of bodybuilders read every issue of <I>MM2K</I>-is because, in some way, they can relate to me. I'm not perfect, but I am "in touch" with this market because I have many of the same wants, needs, desires, etc. as my readers. I'm "barely out of my 20's" (80% of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> readers are between 20 and 35 years of age), and I see and feel the same things as many of my readers. Usually, by the time people are asking me questions about something that's new on the market or that's happening in the bodybuilding business, I've already thought of that question myself, because <I>I wanted to know</I> the answer, too. I don't think the other publishers in this industry are as close to the "core" as I am-many of them are well up in their years and are "married to their ideas" (even though their ideas are wrong) and aren't willing to change to meet the needs of the market.<P>
When I'm off base, I just admit it and take corrective action. For example, we used to run stories on those Galaxy Fitness contests which the majority of my readers hated, so we dropped 'em. Hey, it was a mistake; I admit it, and I learned from it.<P>
Also, not every supplement my company, EAS, comes out with is a hit. I think the biggest bomb we ever dropped was a supplement we called Betadrine. The stuff sucked-I admit it. So we got rid of it.<P>
Despite regularly working 80-90 hours a week, I try to live a "colorful life." (I like to "party" when I get my work done.) Sometimes this gets me "in trouble." For example, in '95, when I was supposed to be covering the Mr. Olympia contest, I went out with a bunch of friends and got drunk before the show and forgot my glasses and couldn't even see the friggin' competitors, but I came clean-I told you the truth. The next time I went to that show, I remembered my glasses, and I didn't get drunk until <B>after</B> the contest.<P> 
And you know what, sometimes I don't put my weights away after I'm done with the leg press. (I know, that's awful...)<P>
And, I have my fair share of weaknesses. For example, one thing I constantly struggle with is that somewhere deep in my subconscious I have this urge (which I keep under control <B>almost</B> all the time) to get drunk and eat pizza every Friday night and go out with every beautiful woman I see-I seem to be having a real problem with Playboy Playmates especially. (I realize I'm probably the only guy in the world who feels like this...)<P>
Oh... as far as the criticism and rumors that you see (which usually emanate from my competitors), some of them might be warranted, and some of them probably aren't. (Rumors are usually not the truth.)<P>
It is disappointing when you see people writing or saying things that are not true. Typically, they have their own agenda. These things used to really irritate me, but then I realized such attacks meant that I had reached a certain level where jealousy could rule. After that realization, I've almost grown to welcome the negative side of success. It means I have reached a higher level. I think that everyone who reaches a certain standard of success has these problems.
I don't hide behind my writers and use them as puppets like the editors of some other magazines-I just lay it on the line. I give you the real deal-the straightforward, uncensored truth-and if sometimes you think that by criticizing others, I'm trying to make myself look perfect, I encourage you to look deeper and see that, in reality, I admit error, poke fun at myself, and am constantly striving to improve.<P>
My goal is to have the best fitness and physique development magazine there ever was (we're not there yet, but I think we're on our way!). I also want to completely change the sports nutrition business and truly make it a scientifically valid and respectable industry. I want my business to be even more successful, <B>and</B> I want more muscle and less fat!<P>
When it's all said and done, I'm really probably a lot like you and am most likely no more or less perfect than you.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>For the last few weeks, I haven't been sleeping worth a damn. I was wondering if it could be because of the supplements I'm taking-I'm using glutamine, whey protein, and creatine. Could any of those supplements be causing my insomnia?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>I doubt it. Usually the supplements that cause insomnia are things like ephedra, guarana, and other central-nervous-system stimulants.<P>
There are so many different causes of insomnia-millions of people struggle with this problem-I have had bad cases of insomnia myself. Sometimes, things just get so hectic and my mind just won't stop thinking, so to speak, and I can't get to sleep. Sometimes it's because I'm really stressed about something (like a magazine deadline); other times it's because I'm excited (like when I think of a new promotional campaign or a new product).<P>
A lot of people use over-the-counter sleeping pills (Unisom, Sleepinal, Nytol, or Sominex), but those don't work for me-they make me feel like I have a hangover the next day.<P>
I tried prescription sleeping pills, like Halcion (no thanks... I can live without the nightmares that shit causes), and other times I've used Xanax (a very small dose-.25 mg works well), but lately, I've been using an old-fashioned remedy-I just take 3 grams of tryptophan about half an hour before I want to go to sleep, and it really works! I get a good night's sleep, and I don't have that drug-like hangover the next day.<P>
The reason tryptophan may help you get a good night's sleep is because this amino acid is a precursor to a neurotransmitter called serotonin, which is basically the chemical that helps you go to sleep. (You can read more about this subject in an article in this issue called "The Science of Sleep.")<P>
Some people get very good results using melatonin, but for some reason, it doesn't work as well for me as plain old tryptophan.<P>
Unfortunately, since 1988, the FDA has enforced a dubious state of near-total tryptophan prohibition, based on the occurrence of serious side effects traced to a single contaminated batch of the amino acid, produced by a Japanese corporation called Showa Denko. This company had altered the time-honored manufacturing procedure for tryptophan, inducing a new and untested procedure, while abbreviating an important filtering step.<P>
The adverse effects of this tainted batch of tryptophan, which unfortunately included numerous deaths, have never been linked to any other batches of tryptophan. Nevertheless, the FDA has maintained its prohibition in spite of overwhelming evidence that it is not only unnecessary but may also be forcing people to take more dangerous and expensive drugs.<P>
I order tryptophan from one of these foreign mail-order companies called Inhome Health Services, Suite 401, 302 Regent Street, London, W1R 6HH, England.<P>
Whatever you do, don't let the insomnia continue-a lack of sleep can destroy your bodybuilding efforts and knock your IQ down about 50 points. A lot of bodybuilders who suffer from a lack of energy and strength interpret this as being a sign of overtraining, but they're actually suffering from sleep deprivation.<P>
As one more alternative remedy, I've found that reading Anthony Almada's articles in back issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> produces ample sedation and usually results in deep slumber in 15-20 minutes.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> Settle this bet for me: my friend, who is a Parillo disciple, says MCT oil is a thermogenic food, like carbs are. I remember you saying that MCT isn't thermogenic and won't raise body temperature, but Parillo says he has research to back up his claim. So who's really right?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> Calling nutrients "thermogenic" is a bit misleading as many people think of "thermogenic" only in terms of drug-like compounds like thyroid, ephedrine, and clenbuterol.<P>
Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT's) are saturated fats, but they aren't digested like most other fats. The majority of fats we eat are emulsified and taken up into the lymphatic system from the small intestine. Carbohydrates and proteins, on the other hand, travel through the small intestine and enter the portal vein, which is an expressway to the liver. MCT oils, because of their chemical structure, can be absorbed into the liver in the same way carbs and proteins are.<P>
Scientists judge whether a food is thermogenic (or not) by simply measuring the food-induced body-temperature elevation after an overnight fast. Some foods, like carbohydrates and proteins, cause a significant increase from the basal temperature after they're consumed, but most dietary fats don't.<P>
So how does this temperature elevation occur? Most of the heat is generated between the small intestine and the liver when carbohydrates and proteins are metabolized and oxidized. For example, in the small intestine, most of the glutamine (one of the amino acids in protein) is used to make ATP (the primary fuel source for every cell in the body). In this breakdown, some heat is generated. And in the liver, whenever carbs and protein are used as fuel, metabolized, or stored, some heat is generated. This heat is then dissipated throughout the body with blood circulation. Most dietary fats, since they enter circulation from the lymphatic system and not from the liver, have very little oxidation or rapid metabolization; hence, they barely elevate temperature when compared to carbohydrates and proteins. The liver will synthesize triglycerides and store them, but it won't use them as a fuel source.<P> 
Medium-chain triglycerides enter the liver and can be oxidized for energy because the liver can metabolize the MCT's into fractured fats called ketones and use them in place of glucose. Not all MCT's are converted to ketones, and the amount converted depends on the metabolic state of the individual. The chief hormone that assists the conversion is a pancreatic hormone called glucagon. How much glucagon there is in the liver depends on the amount of insulin and glucose in the blood. When glucagon is high (blood glucose at or below 50 mg/dl), the conversion of MCT's to ketones is very high. When excessive amino acids and sugars are present in a diet of carbohydrates, proteins, and long-chain fats, the liver converts a significant portion of MCT's into long-chain saturated fats.<P>
The curious thing about MCT's is that the research shows two conflicting facts. On one hand, subjects didn't shuttle MCT oils into bodyfat, and, as opposed to findings with other isocaloric diets (enough calories to maintain bodyweight), the subjects on the MCT diets lost weight. Scientists felt that much of the MCT is oxidized as an energy source, so weight is lost. So in this regard, scientists can say that MCT's raise metabolic rate. However, even though the MCT-fed subjects lost bodyweight on their isocaloric diets, the scientists can't record any significant temperature elevations, like they do when measuring subjects who eat carbohydrates and proteins.<P>
Here is where Parillo and I are both right and wrong at the same time. The consumption of MCT oils does raise the metabolic rate. If you tried two different diets, both at seemingly maintenance-calorie levels, one with MCT's and the other without, you would lose weight only on the MCT diet. But body-temperature levels would be the same on both diets throughout the day. Scientists have postulated that the oxidized heat is somehow dissipated in an unknown, unmeasurable manner. On the BODYOPUS diet, we've found that ketones will be excreted in a greater amount in the urine when carbohydrates are introduced into the body. The body doesn't readily use ketones as an energy source, and when carbohydrates are present, the body prefers glucose, not ketones, for fuel. When this happens, ketones will be more readily excreted because they can't be stored nor reconverted. What's truly happening in the MCT experiments (that show an increase of metabolic rate and no body-temperature elevation) might be a simple excretion of the ketones into the urine. The end result is a loss of usable calories and a reduction of bodyweight, with no temperature increase.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I have a question about the "Anabolic Round Table" a few issues back [<I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, September 1996]. Bruce Kneller stated that human growth hormone is a waste of money, and its ability to burn bodyfat is minimal. But I have a friend who's a national competitor, and he tells me GH [growth hormone] is an awesome fat burner and that all the pro bodybuilders are using it. How good is it really?
<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> This is a very tricky question to answer because I encounter so many people who use GH for different reasons. I have clients who aren't very athletic who are using GH for supposed longevity benefits. They're under a doctor's care, and the recommendation is to use enough GH over a week's time to reestablish the normal IGF-1 level of a healthy 20 year old. The few professional bodybuilders I know all use as much GH as they can afford. And although we've heard stories that some of the top pro bodybuilders are using 25 IUs every day, nobody I know can afford this amount. The most I've seen used, firsthand, is about ten IUs three times a week, but this particular competitor would use more if he could afford it.<P>
From your question, I'm deducing that you're considering using GH to lose some bodyfat, and someone you admire and trust has told you that GH is a staggeringly effective fat burner. GH has a similar quality to the aforementioned MCT oil: both are unusual metabolic elevators. We have research which showed that human subjects lost bodyfat while using GH, but it happened in an indirect way. In other words, the subjects didn't have increased body temperatures, so we can't say GH is a thermogenic drug.<P> 
I hate to say this, but at some dosage, GH seems to have almost magical effects. But scientific research has never generated the great end results we've seen in the bodybuilding arena. We've all seen numerous very good bodybuilders who started making significantly more money, usually from some supplement endorsement contracts, and within a few months, these competitors showed up at contests bigger and more ripped. The majority of bodybuilding experts, myself included, all seem to feel that such progress occurs because these competitors are using more GH since they can now afford more. But keep in mind that the GH is usually stacked with many other drugs. So I have no idea what minimal dosage is needed to start producing this "magic." I have plenty of friends who use four IUs of GH three times a week with virtually no changes in their bodies, but perhaps with long-term use, like a year straight, more people will see results, and I'll be proven wrong.<P>
Need I say that GH is not terribly cost effective? Both ephedrine and herbal yohimbine are potent thermogenic agents, and you can see fat-burning effects within a matter of days. Black-market clenbuterol and prescription thyroid medications can also raise body temperature and reduce bodyfat even more for only a few dollars a day. And if you're brave (or crazy) enough, 20 cents a day of dinitrophenol (DNP) will burn off at least a half a pound of fat a day without dieting; however, this drug is potentially very dangerous. Oddly enough, in the whole mix of fat burners, GH may be the least effective, but it's the safest of the lot as it doesn't raise blood pressure nor over-elevate temperature.<P>
I should add one more thing. I know a number of non-competing bodybuilders (myself included) who have both the finances and the access to GH at very good prices (about $35 for 4 IUs). None of us have bothered to buy and use this drug. Personally, at 44 years old, I don't see enough degeneration of my body from my younger years to warrant spending the money on this overpriced drug. Of course, if GH could grow hair back...<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I'm a 17-year-old bodybuilder with about 4 months of experience. I weigh 126 lbs at 5'6" with 6.5% bodyfat. I can afford about $30-$40 a month for supplements. What should I use? Also, I follow your Isocaloric Diet. Is this a good diet for me, or are there other diets that you would recommend?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> This is a very commendable bodyfat level. However, a typical (sedentary) doctor might diagnose you as underweight and unhealthy with such a low bodyfat level. You should get some blood tests done to make sure your testosterone and growth hormone levels are at least normal and hopefully at the high ends of the scales for optimal growth. Usually adult men at this low bodyfat level have very low cholesterol levels with correspondingly low testosterone. If you can't get these blood tests (and when I was your age, I couldn't afford to), you might experiment by raising your bodyfat level slightly to around ten percent. You may find that your muscular size and strength gains will accelerate.<P> 
About your use of supplements-I'm assuming you have free access to your family's kitchen and pantry, so you should be able to consume enough supermarket proteins and vegetable oils and won't need to supplement these two macronutrients. I just hope your parents will understand and support you when you clear out the refrigerator a day after it's stocked. Because your supplement finances are so limited, I'll be giving you some unusual advice that I wouldn't give to someone else who could spend more each month. You should shop around for the best buy on creatine monohydrate. You should be able to buy about 210 grams for around $40. Use about 20 grams a day (four 5-gram servings) for 10-12 days. This loading phase should bring enough creatine into the muscles so you can "coast" for another two to three weeks without using it every day and still get all the great effects. Remember that creatine works best with high-glycemic sugars. In this case, sugary Kool-Aid will work just as well as fruit juice.<P>
My Isocaloric Diet is just about perfect for building your foundation. Since you won't be buying exotic oils like flax or hemp to get your essential fatty acids, make sure you use soy oil, as this is the best of the supermarket oils for getting these nutrients. Make it easy on your parents' grocery bill, and derive most of your protein needs from the more economical supermarket proteins like eggs and dairy products. My Isocaloric Diet happens to be the most economical of all the weight-gain diets because the one-third dietary fat portion will cost only pennies a day.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> What do you think of Andriol (testosterone undecanoate). It's about time you got back to the steroid stuff. I didn't appreciate all that BODYOPUS crap in the October 1996 issue.<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  First off, Andriol might be the newest commercial oral steroid available, but it ain't all that swell. For many years, we all (both legal and illegal steroid users) bought the great pitch that Organon gave us. And it was only when we started doing frequent drug tests that we realized that something about Andriol wasn't quite right.<P> 
Here's how this steroid is supposed to work: most steroid compounds taken orally reach the liver from the small intestine. If the steroid hasn't been modified with something called 17-alkylation, the liver will break the steroid down rapidly into metabolites that aren't very anabolic and are eventually excreted in the urine. What Organon has tried (notice "tried") to do with their oral testosterone is pick a very long-acting ester that binds to the oil carrier. They use something called testosterone undecanoate dissolved into oleic acid, the same fat in olive oil. They needed a fat that was a long carbon length, so the fat wouldn't be absorbed into the portal vein that routes directly to the liver. Long-chain triglyceride fats are mostly absorbed into the lymphatic system, bypassing the liver. Organon picked oleic acid because it's an oil that won't turn rancid (oxidize) on a room-temperature shelf, and this combination of the undecanoate ester and oleic acid seemed to work best in getting oral testosterone into the body without 17-alkylation, which puts stress on the liver. Andriol, then, appears to be a convenient, nontoxic oral testosterone. I should point out that Andriol was introduced in 1978, a decade before the first testosterone transdermal patch was commercially available.<P>
The problem is that in the real world, Andriol hasn't worked in the way Organon promised. Each capsule contains 40 mg of testosterone, and the recommended divided dosage is about 6 capsules (240 mg) a day. To remind you, the average man secretes between seven and nine milligrams of testosterone a day. So, when taking 240 mg a day, it's pretty apparent that a lot is lost along the way. This is all fine if that 240-mg amount actually raised blood testosterone levels significantly, on par with either of the two transdermal patches. In comparing the two delivery systems, both patches (having about  20 times  less  testosterone in them) consistently raise blood testosterone more than the recommended oral dosage of Andriol.<P>
In a technical sense, any steroid with an undecanoate ester dissolved into oleic acid would work. If Organon wished, they could easily make a nandrolone undecanoate capsule-an oral Durabolin (although it would be expensive). As it is, Andriol has a higher daily cost than even the transdermal patches.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I just got steroid tested for my college football team, and I tested positive for testosterone. They say I have a testosterone to epitestosterone ratio of 13 to 1. What does this all mean, and is there any way to explain it?<P></B>


<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> Here's how the testosterone test works. Whenever testosterone is produced in the body, a "shadow" of it is made that looks similar but has no hormonal properties. This shadow testosterone is called epitestosterone. Although most of the two types of testosterone get metabolized into other compounds and are excreted, small amounts of both unchanged hormones show up in the urine. Most adult men will have about twice as much epitestosterone as testosterone in their urine, so the ratio would be 1:2 (one part testosterone to two parts epitestosterone). However, a small percentage of men can routinely have a ratio of six parts testosterone to one part epitestosterone (6:1). If you're one of these individuals and routinely test out at about 6:1, there's a possibility that once in a great while, you could generate a ratio of 10:1.<P>
In most college and professional sports steroid tests, officials will allow a testosterone/epitestosterone ratio of up to 6:1 and still call it negative. If your ratio is average, near 1:2, you could use about 200 mg a week of testosterone enanthate and still stay at or under 6:1. If you go over 6:1 and have been average before, then you'll test positive for testosterone, and the sports authorities will believe you've been taking additional testosterone. However, if you've consistently had a very high ratio, near the 6:1 limit, some sports officials will allow a 10:1 ratio and still call it a negative test result.<P>
At 13:1, you've got your tit in the wringer, and basically, you're screwed. There's no explaining this away. All the other various slick ways of raising testosterone, like using HCG, Clomid, or the various anti-estrogens, will increase epitestosterone along with testosterone.<P> 
And the testers have heard almost every possible story before. Mexican wild yam root doesn't affect the ratio. Nor does sarsaparilla, smilax, DHEA, or boron. Some IOC sports officials don't look at total urine amounts; they just look at the ratios, so in the future, if you can find some injectable epitestosterone, you can make a mixture of both hormones (make sure that both are the same esters) and achieve normal-looking ratios, even when using large amounts of steroids.<P>
The shame is, at 13:1, you really weren't using all that much testosterone. You could have almost equaled the elevated serum blood levels by using one of the yet-to-be-banned anti-aromatases, such as Arimidex.<P>

<A HREF="v47_a1.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I just got back from the Olympia in Atlanta, and I'm so upset about the judging I had to write and tell you about it. Although I have numerous problems with the judging overall, the greatest travesty was that Kim Chizevsky, who dominated the women's class, was robbed of the Ms. Olympia title--it's impossible that a person with any objectivity could give Lenda Murray the award over Kim. What the hell is going on here?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a2.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> In the last issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, you mentioned you were experimenting with hydroxy citric acid (HCA)... a new "fat burner." I was wondering if you've noticed any positive results from using that supplement?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a3.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've noticed there are quite a few Phosphagain "copycat" products coming out on the market. One product in particular, distributed by Strength Systems USA, supposedly works just like Phosphagain, but it's less expensive. Do you know if these other products are as good as Phosphagain?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a4.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've been trying to get that "cut" look forever. A guy at my gym suggested I try a new supplement called "Bromocriptine." He said it's really great for getting that super-hard look. Have you heard of this stuff?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a5.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I heard testosterone injections may soon be approved in the United States as a form of male birth control. I don't understand why testosterone would be approved as a form of birth control but not approved as a muscle builder. With some of these new uses for testosterone, do you think there's any chance the laws regarding doctors prescribing steroids for bodybuilders will change?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a6.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> What's the latest word on IGF-1? Are bodybuilders getting good results with this stuff?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a7.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I recently came across a bottle of nandrolone decanoate (Deca) distributed by Steris Labs. I'm sending a sample of the box and an empty vial for you to take a look at. Can you tell if it's legit?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a8.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I noticed that Dr. Mauro DiPasquale has come out with a new book about bodybuilding supplements. In his book, he contends he's the only "objective expert" in the industry. However, I also noticed he is working for Optimum Training Systems, and they sell supplements. How can he call himself objective?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a9.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I was very sad to learn that bodybuilding legend Don Ross recently passed away of a heart attack. Has there been any more information on how this man, who was in such good shape, died so prematurely?

--Tina Turner (from the song <I>Proud Mary</I>)<P></CENTER>

Dear Reader:<BR>
	<P>I'm worried.  I look around me, and I see, for the most part, gutless wonders.  Most of us are so shaking-in-our-boots terrified of offending someone that we're turning from a nation of "risk takers" into a nation of "play it safers."  Our role model is Jay Leno, whose ratings continue to rise and whose sole ambition is to get through life without pissing anyone off.</P>
<P>	Heck, who can blame him?  If you're not careful and don't adopt a bland, Wonder-Bread personality--if you take a chance--you're liable to say or do something that will oppose someone else's political, sexual, religious, fashion, sports, cooking, lawn care, or general lifestyle beliefs:  <I>"What do you mean you like the toilet paper up instead of down?  You bastard!  I'm gonna' boycott you, sue you, and maybe even call the toilet paper anti-defamation league. You'll be sorry you ever said that!"</I>  Maybe an appropriate name for our society would be the <I>Kingdom of Nice.</I></P>
<P>	Well, to put a twist on Gordon Gecko's catch-phrase of the '80's, <I>risk is good.</I>  If not for risk takers, this country wouldn't even be here.  If not for risk takers, we'd still be living in the Dark Ages.</P>
<P>	This applies to <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, too.  And excuse me (I wouldn't want to offend anyone) for blowing our horn or, more precisely, Bill Phillips' horn: a few short years ago, Bill had to make a decision: finish medical school and virtually guarantee himself a large salary, a sports car, and a nice big house in the suburbs with a blond wife (who makes a mean meat loaf), 2.2 kids, and a friggin' collie; or, open up an "office" in his mother's garage with an oil-stained floor and write a book about steroids that bodybuilders <I>might</I> actually fork over money to buy.  Needless to say, you know Bill took the road less traveled and wrote his first <I>Anabolic Reference Guide.</I>  A few years later, after some modest success, he took the ultimate gamble: he started a new bodybuilding <I>magazine.</I>  Oh, I can just imagine what his friends and advisors said:  <I>"Let me get this straight, you're gonna' start a bodybuilding magazine that doesn't cover bodybuilding shows, doesn't do stories on how Joe Blow trains his arms, and scrutinizes advertising?  Well, Billy-Boy, good luck, but can you pay me back that five bucks you owe me before you dump your savings into this venture?"</I></P>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>"If not for risk takers, this country wouldn't even be here."</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<P>	Well, you know what happened.  If not for a considerable amount of risk, <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> wouldn't be here, and Bill wouldn't be jockeying for a position with Joe Weider as bodybuilding's most influential publisher.</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> has, along the way, offended some people.  Yes, yes, I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.  It seems a lot of people don't like controversy; they don't like hearing the truth.  For them, anyone who smudges their rose-colored glasses deserves to be publicly attacked and then banished.  And, perhaps even more galling to them is when people who dare to speak the truth are successful.  <I>Well boo-hoo.</I></P>
<P>	I've been pretty thick-skinned to most of these attacks, but lately, a few comments have been cast our way that have put a burr under my psychic saddle.  Witness, just a few short weeks ago, Paul Dillett's comments on the Internet Dillett blasts the new supplement HMB--inferring it is a farce--and states, <I>"Wise up people, the only "supplements" that work where you will really notice a difference beyond what you psychologically tell yourself are DRUGS!</I></P>
<P>	Well, isn't that precious.   Maybe you're right, Paul.  We should ignore scientific studies and new breakthroughs in drug-free bodybuilding. Yes, maybe you're right. Nothing works except drugs.  For those of us who choose not to use drugs, let's just give up.  Let's forget working out, turn on the tube, and spend our days whacking-off to the Baywatch girls.  Never mind that you once told a group of people at a seminar that you ate a whole lot of vitamins to get big, that you personally endorse some sort of weird-ass electrical stimulation machine in the mags, or that your whole existence as a bodybuilder depends on the very supplements you disdain (no supplements, no Joe Weider; no Joe Weider, no professional bodybuilding; no professional bodybuilding, no Paul Dillett).</P>
<P>	Needless to say, there are a lot of people who use and believe in supplements, and there are few places safer to buy them from than Bill's company.  Who else gives unconditional guarantees on supplements?</P>
<P>	I'm not going to spend this entire column ranting about Dillett. He's a great bodybuilder, but that does not make him an expert on supplements.</P>
<P>	Another round of artillery was fired (albeit weakly) at me, more or less personally, in a recent issue of <I>Muscular Development</I>.  The article, written by John Romano, was an interview with Craig Titus, and it was in response to a recent story I did about Titus' run in with the law (involving the alleged sale of the drug ecstasy and possession of steroids with intent to distribute).  It seems poor John Romano was "floored" that any writer could report on the "personal upheaval" of a fellow member of the bodybuilding community.</P>
<P>	Apparently, Titus told Romano that it was all a lie; that I was out to get him, that the DEA was out to get him, that space aliens had framed him, or whatever.  Romano even wrote that I didn't actually interview Titus to get his side of the story, even though my notes on the conversation Titus and I had are right in front of me.  Never mind the fact that I got letters from law enforcement officials, ex-friends of Titus, and guys he had allegedly sent up the river congratulating me on having the guts to write the story.</P>
<P>	Listen John, you're a fine writer; I'd like to have you write for <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, but you have to learn this one basic rule of journalism:  you can't suck up to the people you write about.  Otherwise, you end up writing pathetically myopic articles like the Titus piece.  What happened to Titus was newsworthy.  Believe it or not, there are some kids around who idolize bodybuilders and look to them as role models, and I'm one of those idealistic guys who thinks role models should have moral convictions that are as strong as their bodies.  If they don't measure up, people should know about it.</P>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>"Believe it or not, there are some kids around who idolize bodybuilders and look to them as role models..."</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<P>	And lastly, the statement that suggests we turn our heads when someone in our "community" does wrong is ludicrous.  Yes, and likewise, Senator Packwood's mistreatment of women should have been ignored by his fellow senators, and O.J.'s "stab" at a marriage with Nicole Simpson should be ignored by his actor and ex-jock associates.  Sure, what's a little alleged killing between friends?</P>
<P>	 A couple of years ago, we took a chance and published an article by a gay doctor with AIDS.  I don't think any other mag would have touched that one with a 10-foot, nonoxinol-9-coated stick.  Instead, we took a chance.  The result?  The realization in the medical community that anabolic steroids could be a valuable treatment for AIDS patients.  Bill and I sleep pretty well at night knowing we helped prolong some lives.</P>
<P>	I could run off a string of similar incidences where taking risks paid off.  Of course, someone is always threatening a lawsuit, if not actual physical violence, against us.  Supplement companies are always angry with us for exposing their scams, and if Bill's anything like me, I'm sure he's wondered more than once what's going to happen when he turns the ignition key.  Dan Duchaine is certainly in the same leaky boat.</P>
<P>	Well, all I can say is, give us your best shot.  We're well aware of the potential risks of taking chances, and we're also aware of the rewards.  If we played it safe and were good citizens of the Kingdom of Nice, <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> would have fallen by the wayside long ago.  Instead, I think we're generally recognized by most of our readers as being straight-shooters.  And, with this trait has come what we consider to be a very faithful, loyal, and intelligent readership that most mags would sell their souls for.</P>
<P>	Taking chances applies to all things in life--even bodybuilding.  Maybe you wanted to try a new way of training or a new supplement, but the resident big guy at your gym said it wouldn't work.  Maybe you wanted to start a new diet, but your "nutritionist" said it was hogwash. Maybe you work out six days a week, but you think there might be something to this Mike Mentzer, high-intensity, couple-of-workouts-a-week thing, but you're afraid to try it.   My question is, how are you going to know if you don't take a chance?</P>
<P>	What's the absolute worst thing that could happen?  I'll answer that for you.  You could gain a pound of fat, lose a pound of muscle, or not make progress quite as quickly as before.  You could easily remedy any of those by going back to your old way of eating or training.  However, let me ask you this question: what's the <I>best</I> possible thing that could happen?  Well, the "risk" you took might pay off big time.  It might be the missing piece of the puzzle, the one thing that kicks your body into gear and starts making your ultimate goal--whatever that might be--obtainable.  </P>
<P>	Life is chance.  Life is risk.  There are no great rewards if you always play it safe.  Once in awhile, you're going to offend someone.  Once in awhile, someone's going to think you're crazy or stupid or maybe even insensitive (shudder).  Maybe.  If you can't handle it, take a back seat and let those of us who want to get down and dirty into the ball game. We might take our share of bloody noses, but once in a while, we're going to run up and down the field leaving spike marks in the opposition.  Then, when we're standing in the end zone, we'll stick our thumbs to our noses, wiggle our fingers, and give the dull, bland members of the Kingdom of Nice a good, loud raspberry.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Be Well!</P>

<H4>by T.C. Luoma</H4></CENTER>
	<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>t's ironic: fat is America's number one enemy, yet only a couple hundred years ago, it was one of the best genetic adaptations a person could have.   Having a "healthy" supply of fat guaranteed you'd make it through a famine or a particularly hard winter.  You could also endure long marches or treks, while those around you who weren't lucky enough to be able to store any fat fell by the wayside into the muddy ditches.  Fat kept you warm when there wasn't enough wood to start a fire, and fat made it easier to sleep on the hard, lumpy ground.</P>
<P>	Sure, all that stuff applied back in more primitive days, but it's now almost the year 2000.  We don't have periods of famine (at least not in the Western world); we have central heating, Sealy Posturepedic beds, and any long treks we take are punctuated--every 15 miles or so--by a McDonald's.  Besides, we now have a whole new aesthetic--we like lean bodies.  Men should have defined chests and abs that ripple at least a little bit.  Women want to be lean and supple like felines, and this desire becomes more pronounced with each passing year.  Where it used to be good enough to have a rear end you could bounce quarters off of, it's now required that you be able to bounce two and a half-pound weights off your butt.  The trouble is, our bodies still think we live in primitive times!  They don't know we want to get rid of the excess fat, and they're determined to hold on to it at any cost!</P>
<P>	Given the body's stubbornness in dropping what is no longer wanted, all kinds of pharmaceutical shortcuts have been proposed.  Some work pretty well, but almost all have their drawbacks.  The following guide is an attempt to separate the chaff from the wheat, so to speak.  Here, in no particular order, are what I consider to be the top six fat-burning compounds available.  I've also rated each one from both an effectiveness standpoint and a safety standpoint from one star to five where one is least and five is most.  For example, one star equals the least effective or least safe drug or supplement, while five stars denotes the most effective or the most safe drug or supplement.</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H3>CLENBUTEROL</H3></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><B>Effectiveness Rating: * * * * *</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Safety Rating: * *</B></CENTER>
<P>	Of all the fat-burners, clenbuterol is the most highly coveted--it not only burns fat but also builds lean body mass.  Who could ask for anything more?  Well, despite its positive attributes, clenbuterol has some problems.  For one, it's not available in the United States.  Two, it's a drug and is illegal to bring it into the country without a prescription.  There are other problems as well.  It has side effects that are, well, disconcerting (although admittedly, a lot of bodybuilders don't seem to mind them).  And finally, its benefits are temporary--very temporary.  Unless you stay on the stuff all the time, you'll quickly lose any lean body mass you might have acquired, and unless you modify your eating habits, you'll quickly revert to your previously "uncut" state.</P>
<P>	What exactly is this "wonder drug," and how does it work?  Clenbuterol belongs to a class of drugs called beta agonists.  Beta agonists, depending on whether they're classified as beta-1, beta-2, or even beta-3, have very specific effects on the sympathetic nervous system.  Clenbuterol, a beta-2 agonist, affects the bronchial system.  It's prescribed in Mexico and overseas as a bronchodilator, but it's not approved for use in the U.S., probably because it has a half-life of close to 60 hours (the FDA doesn't like drugs to have long half-lives).  It's also on the banned substances list of the U.S. Olympic Committee.</P>
<P>	A funny thing happened during some of the preliminary clenbuterol studies done with animals: their bronchial systems dilated alright, but they also started getting leaner and more meaty.  Countless animal studies were done on a variety of different species, and the results were always the same.  Scientists coined this phenomena as "nutrient partitioning."  Word of these studies trickled down to ranchers, and suddenly, bulked up cattle started making the stock show circuit.  Even competitors in the Junior livestock circuit began using the drug.  In 1994, a 16 year old won almost $38,000 for raising Badger, a prize steer that caused the mouths of slaughter-house executives to water.  Within days of the subsequent lab tests (which came back positive for clenbuterol use), the prize money was forfeited, and the young owner was banned for life from the stock circuit.</P>
<P>	Various cases of clenbuterol "poisoning" also began popping up in Europe.  In France, 22 patients were diagnosed with clenbuterol food poisoning after ingesting liver from clenbuterol-raised calves.  A similar case in Spain resulted in 135 cases of food poisoning.  In both cases, symptoms ranged from muscle tremors, palpitations, nervousness,  and headaches--pretty much the same symptoms clenbuterol-using athletes have experienced and shrugged off without a second thought.</P>
<P>	Anyhow, based on all the animal studies, humans, as is their nature, began extrapolating from the data.  "Hey, if it works on cows, why not me?"  Bodybuilders all over the world began using the drug and experiencing results from dosages that weren't too far off from the clinical dosages prescribed to asthma patients.</P>
<P>	Most bodybuilders take the drug in short two-day on, two-day off cycles for three weeks, followed by three weeks off to prevent receptor-cite degradation.  </P>
<P>	Interestingly enough, most researchers aren't sure how or why clenbuterol builds muscle and burns fat, but each mechanism seems to act independently of the other.  As far as building muscle, clenbuterol seems to cause hypertrophy but not hyperplasia, and the efficiency of the muscle growth depends on both protein synthesis and degradation.  It apparently suppresses degradation more, and the net effect is more muscle mass.</P>
<P>	As far as burning fat, clenbuterol seems to work by directly stimulating lipolysis in fat tissue, although this effect hasn't been shown to be consistent in all species.</P>
<P>	One of the papers I consulted for this article referred to the sudden deaths of two IFBB bodybuilders from clenbuterol, but I haven't heard anything to confirm that statement.  In fact, I haven't heard of any serious problems from clenbuterol use, although clinically, at least, the possibility of an enlarged heart in users certainly exists, and such a condition could ultimately lead to some kind of heart obstruction and subsequent death.  It could also pose a problem for athletes who compete in high-temperature environments as experiments on lab animals have shown hyperthermia to be a distinct possibility.</P>
<P>	Although I'm certainly not advocating that anyone take clenbuterol, it seems to be the most potent and interesting fat burner, at least as far as bodybuilders are concerned.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Clenbuterol Dosage: Three or four 20-mcg pills a day taken in divided doses (a typical tablet contains 20 mcg, but some formulations contain 10 mcg, and liquid solutions are available in 1 microgram, 20 micrograms, and 0.059 mg ml-1 concentrations)</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H3>DEXFENFLURAMINE</H3></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><B>Effectiveness Rating: * * * *</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Safety Rating: * * *</B></CENTER>
<P>	First, the bad news about this anti-fat drug: it's not available in the United States. (How come none of the good stuff is?)  It's been used in Europe for several years with success, but the U.S. is hesitant to approve it for use here.  When dexfenfluramine recently came up for a vote in front of an advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it was rejected by a vote of five to three.  FDA bigwigs argued that the drug can cause brain damage in humans.  It's true the drug did cause test animals to go a little wacky, but only after giving them doses that were 10 to 20 times higher than the amount that would be prescribed to humans.  </P>
<P>	Dexfenfluramine is considered hot stuff among fat-loss fans because it's a more highly evolved form of fenfluramine, the only non-amphetamine treatment (approved) for weight loss--no amphetamines, no jumpiness.   "Dex" is theorized to work against fat in a variety of ways.  One mechanism is fairly basic: it's an appetite suppressant.  By enhancing the production of serotonin--a brain chemical responsible for many pleasure sensations--the brain is convinced the stomach is full.  Of interest to bodybuilders is the fact that this appetite suppression is geared towards carbohydrates and fat instead of protein.  This means that you'd be more inclined to snack on a protein-based chicken breast rather than a loaf of insulin-increasing bread.  </P>
<P>	Of course, many of you might want something that works by magically burning fat rather than just throwing a monkey wrench into your appetite.  Well, it seems that Dex might fit this bill, too.  At least one study has shown the drug to increase the thermic effect of food, similar to what you might experience with ephedrine.  Additionally, dexfenfluramine has shown a trend in increased IGF-1 production, although that might very well be a side effect of reductions in obesity.  </P>
<P>	Another metabolic benefit seen with Dex is a reduction in insulin resistance.  Studies have shown it to reduce insulin resistance in as little as one week, independently of any weight loss.  That means your body would better metabolize high-carbohydrate foods and perhaps burn them off as opposed to storing them.</P>
<P>	Ultimately, it all comes down to whether the drug is safe.  European researchers conducted the most comprehensive long-term (one-year) study of any anorectic (appetite suppression drugs) on Dex.   They found it to be remarkably effective with minor side effects such as diarrhea, dry mouth, increased frequency of urination, and drowsiness in a small number of patients.</P>
<P>	Dexfenfluramine is sold under the brand name Redux, but whether it will be sold in the U.S. is questionable.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Dosage: 15 mg twice a day</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H3>HYDROXYCITRATE (HCA)</H3></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><B>Effectiveness Rating: * *</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Safety Rating: * * * * *</B></CENTER>
<P>	Take a look at almost any over-the-health-food-store-counter fat burner and you'll likely see HCA listed as one of the ingredients.  HCA is derived from fruits in the genus Garcinia, most often the Bridall berry.  To make a long biochemical story short, HCA supposedly works by inhibiting the suppressive action of a certain enzyme (malonyl-CoA) on fat oxidation.  In the liver, the enzyme carnitine acyltransferase limits the rate at which fat can be oxidized.  Malonyl-CoA, in turn, limits the action of carnitine acyltransferase.  HCA, however, minimizes the suppressive effects of malonyl-CoA, which allows acyltransferase to oxidize fats "at will."</P>
<P>	Aside from actually enhancing fat oxidation, HCA is also said to act as an appetite suppressant.  By converting caloric energy into glycogen (which is stored in the liver) instead of fat, a complex chemical sequence tells the body that the level of glucose and glycogen in the liver is high; consequently, it's not necessary to eat (or rather, overeat).</P>
<P>	Rats have had wonderful success using HCA (you don't see many overweight rats, do you?), but human studies are rare up to this point.  Still, it seems that HCA, especially when compared to the drug-status conferred on most of the other effective fat burners, is especially appealing.  You don't need a prescription; you won't be arrested for having it in your possession; and it doesn't seem to have any harmful side effects (other than some occasional acid indigestion for those who are sensitive to Vitamin C).</P>

<CENTER><H3>EPHEDRINE, CAFFEINE, AND ASPIRIN STACK</H3></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><B>Effectiveness Rating: * * * *</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Safety Rating: * *</B></CENTER>
<P>	Up until some time last year, the sale of ephedrine was unrestricted.  Now, because of a few reported deaths allegedly attributed to ephedrine (anywhere from 3 to 18 in the U.S., depending on who you ask), sales are somewhat restricted.   You can still get it in most states, but you must be 18 years old.  Many off-the-beaten-track health-food stores and highway truck stops still carry the drug under the names mini white, white crosses, or even by its regular name, ephedrine.  </P>
<P>	Ephedrine is simply an herb derived from the ephedra plant, but its main chemical constituent, ephedrine, is a beta-adrenergic agonist, kind of like clenbuterol.  It's long been regarded as a fairly potent thermogenic compound, but it was found to be extremely effective when combined with caffeine and aspirin.  It's true that caffeine is also a fairly good thermogenic compound, but it hardly measures up to ephedrine.  When the two are combined haphazardly (taken together), their thermogenic qualities are additive: one plus one equals two.  However, when the 2 are combined in fairly specific ratios--200 mg caffeine to 20 mg ephedrine--the results are supraadditive.  In other words, the effects of each are multiplied.  When aspirin--300 mg of it per each ephedrine/caffeine dose--is thrown into the equation, the results are further enhanced.</P>
<P>	Aside from "burning" fat, the ephedrine/caffeine stack has also been shown to have nutrient partitioning effects: animals fed the mixture obtained the same growth on a 20% lower energy intake but gained 10% more muscle and 30% less fat than control animals.  In humans, the ephedrine/caffeine stack was found to be as effective as dexfenfluramine over a 15-week period.</P>
<P>	How does the stack work?  No one's really sure, but there are several theories.  Aside from turning calories into heat instead of storing them as fat, the combination may actually cripple the body's ability to form fat.  Caffeine, by itself, increases blood adrenaline levels, thereby increasing lipolysis, the breakdown of fat.  How any or all of these effects are increased by combining all three drugs is not well understood.</P>
<P>	The stack, although promising, does pose some problems.  For one, both of the drugs stimulate the central nervous system, and some people are especially sensitive to the effects.  Being lean is desirable but not at the expense of being wired all the time.  Also, ephedrine has been implicated in some deaths, but truth be told, evidence suggests that overdoses of the drug were involved.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Dosage: 200 mg caffeine, 20 mg of ephedrine, and 300 mg of aspirin, 3 times a day</P>

<CENTER><H3>DHEA</H3></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><B>Effectiveness Rating: * * * *</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Safety Rating: * * * *</B></CENTER>
<P>	The adrenals are little globular glands that sit on top of the kidneys.  One of their functions is to produce a steroid called dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).  Up until a few years ago, very little was known about this steroid-like compound, except for the fact that peak serum levels in the body headed south after age 25.  In fact, if you're lucky enough to live to the age of 85, your DHEA levels probably are only about 5% of what they were when you were 25.  That's why the longevity people jumped on this drug.  They figured if they could raise levels by taking the drug, either orally or by injection, they could regain their youth.   Well, they may be at least partially right.  DHEA, even though scientists still don't know its exact physiological role, has been shown to have beneficial effects on obesity (and diabetes) in animals.  Not long ago, it was found to have the same beneficial effects in humans.</P>
<P>	Researchers have found that DHEA can significantly decrease fat mass in human subjects.  In a study conducted at Virginia Commonwealth University, a group of men were given 1,600 mg of DHEA a day (in divided doses) for 28 days.  After the test was completed, the men averaged a 31% decrease in bodyfat with no changes in weight.  This suggests that the loss in bodyfat was accompanied by a concurrent increase in muscle mass, all without adding any kind of exercise to their lifestyle or with any adverse side effects.  Hot damn!  What's more, the drug resulted in a decrease in serum cholesterol in all the men--quite rare for conventional anabolic steroids.</P>
<P>	Although the exact mechanism responsible for the loss of bodyfat is unknown, some researchers have theorized it has to do with increased insulin sensitivity.  Others have attributed its fat melting effects to its ability to increase the thermogenic properties of food.</P>
<P>Until last year, you could order DHEA from various mail-order supplement companies without getting in trouble.  Unfortunately, that's no longer the case.  As of late 1994, the government considers DHEA an anabolic steroid even though it really isn't.  Possession of it without a prescription (a foreign subscription, since it isn't available in the U.S.) is illegal.	</P>

<P>Dosage:  from 50 to 200 mg a day</P>

<CENTER><B>Effectiveness Rating: * * * *</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Safety Rating: * * * *</B></CENTER>
<P>	Arriving at my sixth choice for the "best fat burner" was tough.  There are several drugs/compounds out there that are purported to be effective fat burners, but all have their drawbacks: most are either illegal or haven't been approved by the FDA yet.  Others might be unsafe, and others, despite all the hype, don't seem to work that well.  Consider growth hormone, IGF-1, or some of the "cutting" steroids like Winstrol V--all seem to be remarkably effective in burning fat and have the bonus of diverting calories towards muscle instead of fat--a remarkable combination.  However, all are either illegal, difficult to get, or unsafe.  Others, like leptin, the remarkable new fat-burning hormone that leans out lab mice in a matter of days, or orlistat, the compound that prevents the body from absorbing fat, are months or years away from being introduced to the market.  The nutrient fat burners, like chromium picolinate or l-carnitine, just haven't measured up to all the hype.  After all, do you know anybody who's noticed a difference in bodyfat percentage from taking either of those two compounds?  I didn't think so.  That leaves me with a naturally occurring compound that hasn't been <I>conclusively</I> proven to be an effective, cure-all fat burner, but it has nevertheless shown promise in at least a few clinical studies: pyruvate.</P>
<P>	Pyruvate is a salt of pyruvic acid, and it's an important intermediate in protein and carbohydrate metabolism.  Scientists first became interested in using pyruvate as a supplement to prevent the fatty liver deposits seen in alcoholics.  Pyruvate prevented fatty livers, and it seemed to do so by altering both fat and carbohydrate metabolism.  Other scientists put two and two together and began testing the supplement on overweight people.  In short, researchers found that pyruvate, when substituted for glucose in the diet, resulted in an inhibition of expected stores of lipid deposition, while nitrogen stores were maintained (muscle tissue was preserved).</P>
<P>	Just how pyruvate works in humans in uncertain.  Animal studies seem to prove that pyruvate causes a decrease in overall food consumption and increased resting energy expenditure.  Human studies, however, have failed to confirm this.  One theory has to do with an increase in the "membrane potential of mitochondria" which stimulates cellular respiration, creating a bigger energy demand and thus burning up more calories.  </P>
<P>	Various studies using pyruvate as a fat-burning agent have shown positive results.  Patients taking a pyruvate supplement lost between 23% and 48% more fat than placebo groups.  Other studies have shown pyruvate supplementation to improve endurance, too, which might indicate that it's a viable ergogenic aid.</P>
<P>	Pyruvate supplements could start showing up in health-food stores soon.  This is an exciting new supplement that you may want to keep an eye on!  </P>
<P></P>
<P>Dosage:  Most studies have used between 15 and 30 grams a day, taken in divided doses with meals, but new research suggests anywhere between 2-10 grams a day may work quite well.</P>
<P>	Despite the availability of fat-loss drugs or compounds on the market (black or otherwise), there are no cure-alls. Each, with the possible exception of leptin, the fat-loss hormone of the future, has its drawbacks.  Any of the items on this list can only be regarded as tools in fighting fat.  The real trick, now as always, is to eat sensibly, eat frequently (small meals), and build enough muscle so that your body's metabolism operates efficiently.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>D</FONT>r. Squat didn't look good. He didn't look like he was the doctor of
anything, much less an actual physical exercise. The "doctor," otherwise known as Fred Hatfield,
had just been named the new editor of <I>Men's Fitness</I>, the new
Weider magazine, but his normal body weight of 170 had puffed up to about 250 pounds, and not
a very pretty or healthy 250 pounds at that. Apparently, he was preparing for his assault on the
squat record and trying to break the half-ton mark (in the amount lifted--not his actual
body weight).  Regardless of his admirable goal, the phrase "morbidly obese" came to
mind, especially when Fred wheezed up the short flight of stairs like a steam locomotive that had
seen better days. As he leaned back and let unopposed gravity guide him into his chair, his
great mass accelerated at the speed of a falling object--32 feet per second. The chair groaned,
shook, and ultimately withstood the impact as Dr. Squat <I>collided</I> with it.
<P>
I marveled at the impressive engineering that must have gone into that chair.  It was probably
built to withstand earthquakes or something.  Another phrase popped into my head: <I>heart
attack</I>.<P>

       Fred had invited me over to discuss business.  He wanted me to do a voluminous
ergogenic research article (2 weeks of work for 200 bucks), but before we started to talk brass
tacks, he had to eat.  He pulled out some Three Musketeers--<I>yes,</I> candy bars! 
Inadvertently, I blurted out, "What the f---?"<P>

 "Calories are calories," responded Dr. Squat.<P>

     That was the scene that replayed itself in my mind as I recently received an ad for Fred
Hatfield's <I>Bodycraft Software</I>.  I didn't expect the software to help me lose 8.8 pounds of
fat in 35 days, but since I'm a computer software kind of guy, I shelled out the $79.95 anyway. 
Besides, if I didn't get 50% leaner and 75% stronger, I could always send the damn thing
back within 30 days and get my money back. Here's the pitch: if you have a computer, this
software will program your weekly meals and workouts according to your wants and desires. 
Need to get big?  Click your mouse here.  Need to lose weight?  Just click there.  I was hoping
there would be a "I wanna' get laid" icon, but I guess 250-pound Three Musketeers' eaters don't
think about stuff like that.  <P>

     Granted, the software claims are exaggerated, but the price isn't a total rip-off as software
goes, and the program is pretty bug-proof, attractive, and logical.  Of course, if you only train two
days a week like I do, it won't work.<P>

     Even though I can't use the software, I didn't return it.  Most consumers will probably
feel the same way about it as I do: it's not a terribly sophisticated product, but at least it's not
totally stupid.  So I filed <I>Bodycraft</I> in the lessons-learned part of my brain and forgot
about it...until I got a follow-up offer in the mail. It was a special report prepared by Fred
Hatfield, Ph.D.  I read it cover-to-cover, and then... <I>I got pissed off!</I> Here's the new
pitch: For $49.95 (a discount of $35!), I could buy...IGF!  Only it wasn't insulin-like growth
factor-1, it was IGF-<I>33</I>!  What, you ask, is IGF-33?  I had the same burning question in
mind. IGF-33 is supposedly a special whey protein with "anti-catabolic nutrients and growth
factors." <I>Yes, brother, hallelujah</I>! ...full of the "missing ingredients" that will create "daily
miracles."  <I>Amen, brother</I>!  For only $49.95, I could get all those goodies that everyone's
been lusting after for the last few months: IGF-I, IGF-II, transforming growth factor-beta,
colostrum, and alpha-ketoglutarate. Geez, would I be violating my parole if I ordered this
potent stuff?  Oh heck, I couldn't pass on this tremendous offer. Besides, if for some weird,
inexplicable reason I didn't like it, I had 30 days to return it.  I went for it.  I knew IGF-33 would
turn out to be a scam, but I wanted to know what exactly was in IGF-33 that allowed the
company to say there were anabolic drugs in it.<P>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>"IGF-33 is supposedly a special whey protein with 'anti-catabolic nutrients and growth
factors.'"</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
     And here it is in front of me.  Okay, it doesn't have a flashy label, and despite the hype, it
doesn't have a weird, ethereal glow around it, and the post office, instead of angels with golden
wings, delivered it.  Incidentally, it's not called IGF-33 but rather CO#588--Ionic Whey
Supreme.  Maybe all the money went into the ingredients and not the packaging.  Let me check
out the label:  Hmmm....let's see...<I>ionic whey concentrate, flavor, and aspartame</I>.  Hey! 
Where are the growth factors and colostrum?  Where <I>be</I> those miracles? They must
have shipped me the wrong product.  I called to check.  Nope, everything's in order.  Of course, you
didn't really think a nutritional supplement would have drugs in it, did you?  Of course not.  But
this product is being promoted as having drug-like characteristics.<P>

     Scams like this come and go all the time.  The big difference here is that Fred Hatfield,
Dr. Squat, is lending his name to the hard sell. His use of factoids and outright lies is so
great that I actually felt embarrassed for him when I read the accompanying literature.  Beyond
that, Fred made it personal when he mentioned me, referring to me as that "locked-up steroid
peddler." Towards the end of the pitch, Dr. Squat reminds us that he's lifted 1,014 pounds,
so he knows what works.  He also claims to have used IGF-33 to set his squat record.  I flashed
back to the candy-bar episode where he told me "calories are calories."  Gee, I didn't know ionic
whey protein was even available back then.  Maybe the Three Musketeers thing was just a ploy.<P>

     In a very narrow technical sense (about as narrow as the legal ground <I>Bodycraft</I> is
walking on), all whey proteins will have minuscule amounts of IGF-1. Colostrum is the initial
form of milk produced right after birth.  I imagine some of the milk used in cheese making must
be from colostrum-producing cows.   Eventually, the liquid whey will be refined into a powdered
whey protein.  How much IGF-1 is in the end product?  I don't have any idea, but I'd guess the
amount to be in pictograms (a pictogram is a trillionth of a gram).  Let's ignore the fact that all
studies involving IGF in humans used an average dose of 18 milligrams.  For a very short time,
newborn babies can consume IGF-containing colostrum milk, and the IGF will reach the
bloodstream intact because the newborn's small intestine doesn't yet contain the necessary
enzymes to break down IGF peptides.  Peptide hormones are very long, complicated chains of
amino acids.  The chief ones are insulin, growth hormone, and IGF.  Ever wonder why we have
no oral versions of these hormones?  Simple.  Adults have fully functioning enzyme systems that
will break down the peptides into individual amino acids, so whatever microscopic amount of
IGF contained in whey will be handily converted into ordinary amino acids by your gut.<P>

Perhaps you're wondering how the marketers of this product can get away with making
these outrageous claims.  Isn't it against the law?  Here's how it works. The FDA has some
very specific laws about the sales of unapproved drugs.  According to the FDA, a drug is any
substance that makes a "function or structure" change or <I>claims to do so</I>.  This would
disallow substances like GHB and clenbuterol.  But remember, the substance doesn't have to be
an actual drug.  If the product has drug-like claims on the label or in the advertising, then in a
legal sense, the substance is a drug even if the product is totally ineffective.  The latest legislation
regarding dietary supplements does allow "function or structure" claims <I>if</I> there is
substantiation to back up those claims.  Substantiation means reliable clinical studies.  For
example,  someone might say the regular use of antioxidant vitamins may reduce a person's
chances of getting cancer--that's kind of a drug-like claim, but since it can be backed up by
<I>substantiation</I>, you can legally make that claim.<P>

     If you have no substantiation, the only way to make claims such as, "you'll get bigger,
leaner, and stronger" is to make the claim as part of a training and supplement <I>system</I>. 
For example, IGF-33 makes a whopping-big dose of claims: get stronger, gain muscle, have
energy, reduce pain, promote healing, have better mental arousal, make your bowels move with
the regularity of a Japanese commuter train...  Alright, I threw that last one in, but you get the
picture.  Alphasport (the makers of IGF-33 and <I>Bodycraft Software</I>) is implying that
all these benefits are because of the system, not just the supplement.  Suddenly, these drug-like
claims are now out of the FDA realm of regulation.  Claims for a system, in this case an
integrated eating, training, and supplement package like <I>Bodycraft</I>/IGF-33, are now also
under the scrutiny of another agency, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  What's the
difference?  If you arouse the interest of the FDA, you might end up with a criminal indictment
for mislabeling.  The FTC, on the other hand, might impose a civil infraction on you, along with
a fine or a criminal indictment for consumer fraud or perhaps both.  However, the FTC doesn't
make a habit of cruising all the mags for fraudulent advertising.  Yes, <I>Bodycraft
Software's</I> claim of making me lose 8.8 pounds of fat in 35 days seems unbelievable, but
until the FTC gets a series of consumer complaints about the product, it's business as usual.<P>

     You might wonder why I'm picking on Fred Hatfield when there are many potential
targets out there, some far more deserving than Dr. Squat.  There are a couple of reasons.  Other
than the fact that he pissed me off (he should have said <I>formerly</I> locked-up,
<I>ex</I>-steroid peddler), I know he wasn't using it when he set his squat record.  Beyond that, I
also happen to sell a whey protein product, but I happen to play by the rules.  Barring that,
IGF-33 isn't a very interesting product.  It's not a drug; it's just protein.  Sure, some of the unusual
peptide structures in whey protein seem to enhance the immune system (a fact that's been
validated by research), but just eating whey won't make you bigger, stronger, or leaner.  It
happens to be one of the best of the current protein supplements, and numerous companies
produce quality whey proteins.  Regardless, it won't "protect your muscles from melting away,"
"give you more energy," or "give you better mental focus."<P>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>"...he pissed me off... he should have said <I>formerly</I> locked-up,
<I>ex</I>-steroid peddler."</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
     Most whey proteins cost less than $30 for a 2-pound container, so I have no idea why
IGF-33 costs $49.95 for an equivalent amount.  Remember, it's nothing more than whey
concentrate, flavor, and aspartame.  There isn't even any alpha-ketoglutarate on the label, even
though the special report seems to imply that it is in the product.  I've got a certain amount of
experience pricing such items, so I'd guess the actual cost to Alphasport per container of IGF-33
is less than $9, and that includes the container.<P>

     IGF-33's main selling point is the "golden" reputation of Dr. Squat.  He wants you to use
deductive reasoning to figure out that his product is great: if you presume, as he wants you to,
that he is great, that he knows what works, and that he used the product to achieve his greatness;
ergo, you can achieve greatness if you buy the product.  Contrast all that with my tarnished reputation.
Rather than being great, I'm generally perceived as being a world-class pain in the ass.  I've designed two
products, and they're both very popular and very effective.  However, I don't think anyone bought them
because of my reputation.  I present products that I think are the best.  And yes, I have a new supplement
in the works (ID3, pronounced Eye-Dee Cubed) that also has a very specific eating plan (the Isometric Diet)
and training system (the Body Contract). Alphasport has a system to sell, and so do I.  Except for having
what I consider to be a good deal of integrity, I'm not that different from Dr. Squat.<P>

     In my subconscious, where the demon lives, I know I could make a lot more money if I
just, you know, loosened up a bit regarding my advertising.  Sure, a combination of drug-like
claims, overt sexual titillation, and a little hypocritical posturing of some spokesperson who's
obviously on steroids would do wonders for my business.  After all, it's the de facto advertising
standard in the health-food business.  If it didn't work, supplement companies would resort to
other tactics.  Look at it this way: many of the potential supplement consumers aren't terribly
sophisticated.  In the past, I've always used a very low-key approach with my supplements,
naively assuming a superior product will succeed in the market place.  I think, at least initially, it
was my knee-jerk reaction to the original Cybergenics sales pitch.  Years ago, many of us in the
business thought that basically Cybergenics was shit and didn't work as claimed.  Surely, it was
only a matter of time before savvy consumers would wise up, and Cybergenics would be out of
business.  Just the opposite happened.  Hundreds of thousands of consumers thought otherwise. 
Scott Chinery [the former owner of Cybergenics] bought exotic sports cars.  I bought a
moped.<P>

     As a part-time supplement businessman, my intent is to formulate unique products, ones
I'll use myself because I couldn't find anything else like them on the market.  But because I
usually keep that demon in the back of my mind confined, I'm the worst possible choice for
writing advertising copy.  I'm afraid I'm a bit too laid back and too honest.  I think it's an
admirable stance, albeit not a very lucrative one.  Unfortunately, the run-of-the-mill customer is
usually attracted to exaggerated claims.  That simply means that someone else gets the money. 
Although there's no rule that says the best product can't have the best advertising campaign, it
happens far too infrequently for my tastes.  Usually, nice guys go broke.  In a few years, I'll need
a kidney transplant.  Consequently, I'm uninsurable.  So being nice not only makes me broke but
potentially dead.  With all that in mind, don't expect the ID3 ad campaign to be low key.  [By the
way, ID3 isn't available yet, but it'll be out soon!]<P>

     Why is it that health-food supplements are singled out for exaggerated and borderline
false claims?  I constantly see television ads for foods of questionable value (whether milk, pork,
Ovaltine, or mainstream weight-loss systems, all of which, in my mind, are just as odious as
health-food claims).  Whole milk does not "make a body good," but most consumers don't bitch
about it.  <P>

     During an interview with one of my local newspapers, the <I>LA Weekly</I>, the
reporter asked if I had a problem with steroid-using athletes hawking health-food supplements. 
No, not generally, and I'll tell you why.  The subliminal message in using a professional
bodybuilder in a supplement advertisement is that his or her "greatness" was achieved from the
use of the product. Obviously, most of the consumers buying the various health-food
supplements won't achieve the exaggerated claims presented.  After going through a few
containers, even the most <I>Gomer-esque</I> consumer will figure out that protein powder
alone, or whatever, won't turn him or her into a bodybuilding champion.  Still, people will
continue to buy the products simply because they like them, and they feel happier when they're
using them.  And if they don't like them, most of the major supplement manufacturers offer some
kind of money-back guarantee.  <P>

     On the other hand, consider the professional basketball star who pulls in millions for
endorsing soda pop, which is mostly sugar and water.  Try telling any of the soda pop makers that
you didn't find the product particularly refreshing--you feel that Mr. Basketball Star mislead you
and that you want your money back.  Just imagine the response.<P>

     To be competitive in the supplement business, I have to follow rules and regulations. 
And as long as my competitors follow the same rules, it's a fair game.  The marketers of IGF-33
don't follow the rules.  They present false claims that hook the wallets of unwary customers, so
they can be pulled in and gutted on the gore-stained dock of Dr. Squat.  They're taking money
away from me.  And I don't like losing a sale, especially when I was fouled.<P>

<HR>
<P>
There's no question about it--this is <I>the</I> most exciting "bodybuilding contest" ever!  It's a contest that anyone can win, whether you're 22 or 42; whether you're skinny and want to gain size or overweight and need to lose fat; no matter what your present condition is, this is <I>your</I> chance to have it all... the body you've always wanted, fame, cash, and truly one of the most remarkable automobiles in the world!<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/indent.gif">What's this all about?  Well, it's an exciting new kind of physique competition that's being sponsored by Experimental and Applied Sciences, Inc. (EAS), a leading developer of scientifically designed and university-tested bodybuilding supplements.  EAS does not hire professional bodybuilders as spokespersons-instead, they're looking for <I>real bodybuilders</I> and athletes to represent their products-bodybuilders who use EAS supplements along with a proper nutrition and exercise program to build inspiring physiques-people who are drug free and have "average genetics."<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/indent.gif">This is literally an opportunity for everyone who has ever aspired to build a better body to make their mark-to win the biggest prize in bodybuilding history! And to become a "bodybuilding celebrity" practically overnight!<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/indent.gif">In this contest, virtually everyone has a chance of winning-the overall champion will not be determined by who has the all-around best physique but rather who <I>makes the most improvement</I> during a 12-week bodybuilding program!<BR>
<IMG SRC="../images/indent.gif">Yes, it's completely true!  This is your chance to make it big--to own one of the most awesome automobiles in the world, have a big money endorsement contract, <I>and</I> get a more muscular, stronger and leaner body than you've ever imagined!<P>
<IMG SRC="../images/indent.gif"><B>This may very well be the most exciting opportunity ever offered to any and all unknown bodybuilders!</B><P>
But, to take advantage of this opportunity, you must act <B>now</B>!  Pick up the phone and call <FONT  COLOR=#FF0000><B>1-800-749-5596</B></FONT> (ask for Dept. #3055) and tell the operator to send you more information on the <B>EAS Grand Spokesperson Championship!</B> You will <I>immediately</I> be rushed a complete package with all of the rules, regulations, and information you need to enter this exciting, <B>new</B>  "bodybuilding contest"!<P>
<CENTER>
Please hurry!<P>  
<B>THIS IS A LIMITED TIME OFFER!</B><P>

Supplement Survey Results</h1>
Results taken from survey of visitors during May 1996<p>
</center>
<hr>
<table width=700 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5>
<caption align=top><h3>What supplements have you used in the last 12 months?</h3></caption>
<tr><th><img src="images/survey8/chart_1.gif" width=369 height=181 ><br>
<a href="ssresdtl.html"> Text Version</a></th><td>To no one's surprise, the most popular supplement was <b>creatine monohydrate</b>, with a whopping 83% reporting having used it in the last year. Close behind at 73% and 70% respectively, were <b>Vitamins & Minerals</b> and <b>Protein Powder</b>. The next significant entry was <b>Meal Replacements</b> which came in with a solid 58% response. 
<p>
In total, 16 products were listed with CoQ10 bringing up the tail with 8% reporting
having used it. Most all of the nearly 700 respondents listed using multiple supplements in the last 12 months. 
</td></tr>
</table>

<hr>

<table width=700 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5>
<caption align=top><h3>Top 5 supplements that you would recommend to your training partner:</h3></caption>
  <tr><th>
<img src="images/survey8/top5_supp.gif" width=207 height=157 >
  </th><td>A great testament to the effectiveness of a supplement is whether you would recommend it to a friend. These are the top 5 supplements that voters felt produced to a level that would make them feel strong about recommending them. <p>

Creatine monohydrate ran away with it but Meal-replacements like Myoplex came in second ahead of protein powders. Interesting that protein powders, reported as more widely used in the previous question, came out behind Meal-replacements in satisfaction. 

Rounding out the Top 5 were HMB and Vanadyl Sulfate.
<br><i>(Modified from List your top 3 supplements.)</i></td></tr>
</table>

<hr>

<table width=700 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5>
<caption align=top><h3>What supplements that you have tried that WOULD NOT RECOMMEND to a friend?</h3></caption>
  <tr><th>
<img src="images/survey8/bot5_sup.gif" width=214 height=164>
  </th><td>Far and away the winner (or loser) of the least recommendable supplements is Chromium Piccolinate. This is a <i>"save your money"</i> supplement, as rated by our visitors. Each one of these supplements has failed to provide desired results for the nearly 700 voters of our survey. In order, the losers where Chromium Piccolinate, Amino Acids, Sport Bars, Branched Chain Amino Acids and Weight-Gain Powders. Combine Amino Acids with the BCAA's and you may have the real winner there.<br>
<i>(Results taken from voting for "Your Bottom 3 Supplements")</i></td></tr>
</table>

<hr>

<table width=700 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5>
<caption align=top><h3>What brands of supplements do you purchase most often?</h3></caption>
  <tr><th>
<img src="images/survey8/brands.gif" width=374 height=173><br><a href="ssresdtl.html"> Text Version</a>
  </th><td>
First, we have to admit that the results are likely somewhat biased because <i>MM2K</i> readers tend to be loyal to EAS. Also, of note is that the respondents were able to select multiple brands. But still it makes for interesting gym talk. And that's all this is really about anyway - finding out more about our peer from all over the world.

<caption align=top><h3>Where do you usually buy your supplements?</h3></caption>
  <tr><th>
<img src="images/survey8/buyfrom5.gif" width=181 height=153>
  </th><td>Once again, no surprise here. GNC came in just ahead of direct ordering followed by Health-food stores, "other" and gyms. Other could be a number of things but I venture to bet that a good amount of "other" is ordering from the internet itself.
</td></tr>
</table>

<hr>

<table width=700 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=5>
<caption align=top><h3>How much do you spend on supplements each month?</h3></caption>
   <tr><th>
<img src="images/survey8/dollars.gif" width=209 height=194>
    </th><td>On average, 41% of the respondents spent between $50 and $100 per month. I'll bet its closer to the $100 than the $50. The second largest group spent $100-$150, coming in at 24%. And then there are the fanatics, 2% of which spend over $300 per month on supplements. A mighty expensive habit but then again I can't imagine this would last long if the pay out weren't present.

<tr><td>While the question was about the "most effective" steroids, when reviewing the responses it seems obvious that other factors weighed heavily in the voting. The two themes I saw most frequently in the responses where "I tried this because it is all I could get" or "it seemed safer than other options." Certainly these themes play out in the voting. For, while Deca is a fine steroid it is in no way the most effective but it is quite probably one of the safest anabolic steroids. And when it comes to availability, from what I hear it seems that Sustanon would be at or near the top.

<pre width="80">
<hr>
I think I will use steroids and/or growth hormone later in life as 
anti-aging agents.
<hr>
I'd only use the "safer" steroids, not crap like vet steroids.  And
I'd read up on them as much as possible before ever touching them.
<hr>
I have been tempted to use drugs for the quick results, but I believe
drugs are not the way to go because:
   a. They're not beneficial to my heath, despite the muscle they may add. 
   b. The health risks outweigh the benefits.
   c. I am proud to be able to say I have never used drugs, especially
      when someone thinks I have because of my training results.
<hr>
I don't take steroids because first of all, I know that oral steroids 
are rough on the liver. And secondly, I don't like the idea of sticking 
a needle in my ass.
<hr>
In my opinion, steroids are for people who look for the "easy way out" 
and are afraid of hard work.  I have a hard time respecting people 
(pros included) who use steroids.  I am not genetically gifted, but 
through hard work and dedication, I have built myself up to a decent 
size - 6', 215lbs, and 11% bodyfat (hydrostatic tank).  Over the years, 
I have had many opportunities to take steroids but never felt the need 
or desire.  I have always been told that good things are hard to achieve,
and a good physique is one example.  I have a few friends who are currently
taking steroids, and I find myself out-lifting them more often than not
(squat, bench, military press).  Dedication, hard work, perseverance and
enjoyment -- not steroids.
<hr>
Used in moderation and with a doctor's supervision, I feel steroids could
be useful and have only minimal risks. But as long as athletes continue to
abuse steroids, they will never be acceptable to society.
<hr>
I admire a person who works hard to achieve something, whether it's a 
well-built physique developed with the help of steroids, or one built 
naturally (more so the latter).  But I REALLY RESENT the CONFUSION 
surrounding training principles -- many have been ignorant and dishonest
regarding how to build quality muscle without steroids.  It makes things 
very confusing for those of us who choose to go natural.  Your magazine 
is a step in the right direction; it deals with things honestly!
<hr>
Cost and side effects are large factors in deciding not to use steroids 
for me. I always feel a bit tempted to take them.  The biggest reason for
me to take them would be that I could work out more often, but I am making
decent gains without them.
<hr>
I take a lot of pride in being steroid-free. My pride and honesty are two 
things which other people can't take away, so why would I want to give 
them up?  My trainer says I'll do them eventually because I'm not scared 
of them.  I have been curious as to a 6-week cycle, but I haven't reached
a plateau yet (thank you, HMB), so why should I crash my pride for something 
I don't need?
<hr>
I am a big believer in genetics but more so in human willpower. I believe I 
have both. I have made significant gains (24 lbs up in 1 month.- dropping 2%
fat to 12% total) using creatine, a fanatical diet (I do eat a protein meal
half into the night), Vitamin C megadosing, and of course, mind-blowing 
workouts. Although I don't have a real problem with the intelligent use 
of steroids, I feel far more motivated when "competing" against the 
pharmaceutically enhanced. These types of "impossible" challenges give me
the extra drive to succeed, and I will.
<hr>
Steroids seem to be the easy way out. I have no ill feelings toward anyone 
who may use them, but when I get bigger and stronger, I like to know that it
was a product of my own hard work, and not a side effect of a drug.
<hr>
I enjoy bodybuilding for the challenge and the health benefits.  If I took 
steroids it would feel like "cheating," plus it would possibly eliminate the 
healthy aspects of the sport.
<hr>
Why are steroids illegal? Do they impair your ability to drive or use heavy 
equipment? Do they keep you up all night and freak you out? I understand 
that if steroids are abused, they can cause health problems, but so can 
alcohol and tobacco. I think steroids should be legalized for adults to 
use  at their own discretion.						
<hr>										
My general opinion is that steroid abusers are lazy people looking for a quick
fix. It makes me sick to listen to the "pro" bodybuilders talk about hard 
training and diet, and paying your dues.  Hypocrites!
<hr>
I think using steroids in a safe way can be nothing but good.  It's a proven 
fact that there are some steroids out there, like Deca Durabolin, that are 
actually good for your body under some conditions. It's because of the bad 
rap society has placed on steroids that makes everyone think they are harmful.
<hr>
I used to work out at a club in San Ramon, CA where a good percentage of the 
guys used steroids. It is not easy watching people who are taking steroids 
gain strength and size in leaps and bounds ahead of someone who is not using 
them. If I stayed in San Ramon, I probably would be taking them myself.
<hr>
Although your magazine is far above the rest, please include at least a small
amount of information on lifetime drug free bodybuilding so those of us who 
are lifetime naturals can set realistic goals.  Bill and Shawn are fantastic 
inspirations to those of us who are drug free.  I have gone from 136 lbs at 
13% bodyfat, to 178 lbs at 8% bodyfat within three years of excruciating training.
Your magazine has given me some very valuable pointers.  At 5'9", I don't look
as good nor am I as strong as Bill yet.  By taking HMB, glutamine, creatine, 
and whey protein, I believe looking almost as good as Bill does now could be 
accomplished within another five years.  Bill definitely does not look like a
girl scout, as Craig "the Roid Freak" Titus stated. 

I wouldn't want to look like a Paul Demayo, and am striving for a look between
Shawn Phillips and Brad Minns. Lifetime natural competitions are in my future. 
Thanks.  Keep up the great job! 
<hr>
Presently I weigh 238 lbs, my best bench is  405 lbs, and my arms are just over 
19".  However, it seems like the bigger I get, the more strength and size I want.
I have been seriously thinking about trying steroids, having seen the results 
some of the other guys at the gym get. However, the quality of  "black market"
products is a concern.  I appreciate the info in MM2K and your willingness to 
present the issue fairly. It will certainly help if I ever decide to try them.
<hr>
I've been bodybuilding for 4 years and have always seemed to make gains each 
year. I've played football at the NCAA DIV-1A level and have always been a 
good athlete, so I'm very familiar with weight training. I've never considered
using steroids. I feel that those  who use them are not good enough athletes. 
When I started bodybuilding, I weighed 170 lbs. I now weigh 200 lbs with under
5% bodyfat. I've worked hard to get where I am today and I didn't use roids! I 
feel that pro bodybuilders are cowards because they will always share their diet
plans, workout programs, etc.. But, what they don't tell you is that they all 
use steroids, and I personally think that's "BULLSHIT!" 
<hr>
There doesn't seem to be enough info on women and steroid use. Do you need 
any more than a picture of a "woman" pro to know the story?  Nuff said! 
<hr>
I do use Vanadyl Sulfate, Creatine Monohydrate, and Chromium Picolinate, and 
am looking into some of the other new things coming out.  Oh, and I love MM2K.
Thanks for all the info guys. One more thing -- I am studying in England for a
year, and the gyms here suck and the guys are a bunch of scrawny little weeds.

<hr>
I think the "roid rage" is a myth `cause I felt nothing, no anger or anything
like that. I think it's just an excuse for assholes to act more like assholes
and give steroid use a bad image. 
<hr>
I only used Deca. Taking shots affected the nerves in my glutes and legs. I 
have had blood work done since and there was no damage done, but my voice went
through stages of cracking like a boy going through puberty and is still deeper 
than before. I missed approximately 3 periods. I do not ever want to do them 
again.
<hr>
They should not be classified as schedule drugs. I wish it could be like it was 
back in the early 80's - the good old days - when hell, Dan and everybody else 
was selling steroids through the mail. It was paradise.
<hr>
I compete in Olympic Weightlifting, so drug testing forces me to use the 
testosterones. I'm really hoping HMB is as good as what you guys are promoting 
because I would like to be able to get off the drugs so I don't have ANY chance 
of getting caught. I have a Life Extension doc who gets me scripts for Deprenyl,
Hydergine, Alupent and Cyproheptadine - that's my next experiment.  I heard about
it on the Charles Pouliquin tape interview II. I personally feel that all drug 
testing has done is make athletes look for alternatives, and use the least safe 
steroids like Suspension, etc.  I once spoke with the head guy at the lab which 
does the drug testing for the USOC, and he said that they can't keep up with all
the drugs and combos athletes find to take, especially hormones like IGF-1 and 
GH. US lifters have been buried in the 1995 World Championships because of the 
resurgence of drugs and the lenient attitude of the IOC and IWF.  But the US 
keeps pushing, and we're the only ones doing random testing.  I really don't 
care if we drug test or not, I just wish the world did it the same way so it 
would be a more even playing field.  Even in the US, some governing bodies 
like the USWF push harder for drug testing, while others are lax about it. 
<hr>
I don't encourage the use of any drugs, although I feel certain steroids can 
be very helpful depending on what they're used for.  The abuse of any substance 
can be harmful regardless what it is. I do encourage the use of all available
information to educate anyone who wishes to use or comment on steroids. 
Ignorance is our biggest downfall!
<hr>
I had a terrible time getting off steroids after being on for eight years. I 
did not take many breaks so I suffered from numerous hormonal deficiencies once
I stopped. This resulted in severe depression, and it took me three years to get
my system back to normal, medically.  I have no other effects today, and I get 
better results training drug-free in powerlifting.
<hr>
I have done about 4 cycles in the last year and a half, and have had very good 
results. Your magazine has been very instrumental in helping me make the right 
choices. I live in Southern California so there are a lot of roids to choose 
from, but also a lot of  bogus shit too. Reading your articles helps a lot! 
So I guess I am just trying to say thanks.
<hr>        
Being a physician myself, I see no problem with a knowledgeable, informed 
approach to the use of steroids in conjunction with bodybuilding.
<hr>
The dosages that I used in 1985 were conservative and they are considered 
laughable by today's standards. I was under a doctor's supervision for 
the blood tests and so forth. I stopped using steroids in 1989 because 
I was getting stuck with more and more fake stuff. I feel the supplements
(creatine, etc.) that are on the market now are getting close to the
effectiveness of anabolics.
<hr>
I am a collegiate shot putter and discus thrower, and I have taken a few 
Suspension shots before a competition.  I am acquiring goods for a 
cycle this summer.  I am excited about my first cycle.
<hr>
I feel that a lack of knowledge is the most harmful issue concerning steroids.
A close second to that is the availability of black market (fake) juice due 
to the shut down and restrictions placed on legitimate pharmaceutical 
manufacturers.
<hr>
Steroids have a bad rap in mainstream America, but I personally feel that 
steroid use is like the use of anything else.  If you abuse them, you will
have to pay the consequences.  I also feel that an occasional cycle of 8 
to 12 weeks can be beneficial assuming that a healthy lifestyle is followed
along with it, i.e., no smoking, no drinking, healthy eating, etc.  I 
have no regrets about using them and I will use them again at some point
in my life.  I really wish somehow they would be legalized.
<hr>
First off: I LOVE YOUR MAGAZINE!! It was a little slow catching on out on
the east coast, but now I see it more and more on magazine racks. I only 
wish you guys had been around in the 80's when roids flowed through the 
gyms like breath mints. We needed some guidance like only your stall can 
provide. All we had in those days was hearsay. Thanks for the great articles.
<hr>
Vive le Stock !!! Mais ya yeik de l'ostie marde sur le marche.
[Loose interpretation: I love them cows !!! Whatever it takes, 
give me two of them.]
<hr>
Athletically speaking, steroids led to a positive experience for me. 
However, other aspects of my life were negatively affected  (lack of 
patience, increased irritability & aggressive tendencies, somewhat 
hypertensive, hyperactive appetite, etc...).  But the positives 
outweighed the negatives as far as I'm concerned.  I would most 
likely do them again, but in my situation they're so difficult 
to find.
<hr>
From 1984 to 1988, I was heavily involved in bodybuilding. (At the 
time, I was living in my hometown of Sacramento, CA.)  In 1985, I 
began using steroids, primarily Anavar. My gym (Gold's) was a big 
sales point for steroids in the Sacto area, so obtaining steroids 
was as easy as ordering whatever you wanted at the front desk. I 
was reluctant to start, but at the same time wanted to see what 
my "potential" might be.  So I started experimenting, and ultimately
found that I got a lot of results using Anavar. At one point, I 
weighed about 235 pounds, which is pretty big for my height - 5'11".
Compared to others in my gym, however, I was definitely a light-
weight, both in size and the amount of drugs I took. I stopped 
working out in 1989, and only this past summer (1995), I began 
going to the gym again.  I'm surprised by how much has changed.

Steroids are not as openly used (at least here in Seattle), and
it seems to me that the science of natural bodybuilding supplements
has improved tremendously. After 9 months of working out, I now 
weigh 210 pounds. I'm pretty lean, very strong and, best of all
(at age 34) drug free!  My current creatine and amino "habit" 
however, is another story..
<hr>
I made good gains while on the stuff but lost about all of it after going off. 
Maybe it's my age (43), but I find being on the juice is very hard on my 
cardiovascular system. I get irregular heart beats and feelings of anxiety. If
it weren't for those negatives, I'd probably still be on. I've been training 
most of my adult life and have never found anything to give me the gains like 
this. I got positively huge, for me, while on the stuff. But my health means 
too much to me to take the risks, so I'm back on regular training and a proper 
diet.
<hr>
I'm glad I did them because experience is important in being objective. However, 
with the efficacy of bodybuilding supplements such as CLA, HMB, and Creatine 
Monohydrate, I'm able to think more about long-term health and self-preservation.
<hr>
The steroids I took were too androgenic; they made me too puffy and I felt tight 
and uncomfortable. I was frequently in a bad mood and prone to violent behavior. 
My sex drive dropped dramatically after use and it took about five to six months 
before it returned to normal.
<hr>
I used steroids for HIV wasting and saw my T4 counts go into the toilet!  I 
think these drugs can be immunosuppressive, and people should be very careful 
if they use them for medical reasons!
<hr>
Steroids have ruined bodybuilding for natural athletes. I cannot find the proper
competition forums and am disgusted with the sport in its current state.
<hr>
I took Primobolan and test for about two months - one shot of test a week and 
2-3 tabs of Primobolan. My bench went up to 315 from about 275 lbs, and my 
bodyweight went up from about 208 to about 225. That was nearly 6 years ago,
and I haven't lost much strength or size.  In fact, 5 months ago I hit 335 lbs
on the bench, largely due to creatine.
<hr>
I just wanted to commend MM2K for telling the truth about anabolic steroids.  
I feel that anabolic steroids can play an important role in treating certain 
medical diseases.  It is unfortunate that many physicians ignore the benefits 
of steroids for fear of getting a "bad rap."  One pro bodybuilder takes more 
"juice" in a year than an AIDS patient would need to extend his/her life ten 
years.  Education about the drugs is key!!! 
<hr>
I have not had a chance to read your articles on HIV and steroid use, but my
doctor heard quite a bit about other physicians putting people on such 
programs. While I was on a steroid program, the following were the results
we found: 1) greater amounts of energy (having been positive for almost 
10 years, this was very refreshing), 2)performance at the gym went through
the roof, 3)a lot of little problems associated with the disease cleared up,
and most important, 4) my viral load (level of activity of the disease) 
dropped from 115,000 to 2,400 (which is like saying that it went inactive).
After years of taking various drugs for AIDS, I had managed to turn a little
chubby. At 5'6", I weighed in at 175 lbs, with a body fat of 27%. Last June,
I joined a local gym and by September I managed to get the bodyfat down to 
18%, 12% by November. Unfortunately, in the situation I'm in, this means 
less weight (135 lbs), which is bad, so I went on the steroids. 

Currently, I weigh 155 lbs. I would greatly encourage people in my 
situation to pursue the use of the steroids. The gains seemed to outweigh
any bad side effects.
<hr>
I think you guys have a great magazine going; keep it up! As far as 
steroids go, I  train a HIV-positive man who receives as much Deca 
from his doctor as he wants. He shares with me for free, and I train
him for free. The only side effects I have noticed from my usage, is
a slight increase in irritable and aggressive behavior. I must also 
say that you guys are ahead of your time in the supplement business.
I have used (after reading about them in MM2K) creatine monohydrate
(Phosphagen and Phosphagain), V2G, Met-Rx, and more recently, Myo-Plex
Plus. Hey, I started out at 6' 2" tall, 160 lbs, and now I'm 225 lbs 
with abs!  
<hr>
From my own experience, the stuff is psychologically addictive -- from
the euphoria of being invincible, to the downs after a cycle is over.
<hr>
I took steroids when I was 17 (1975) for1 1/2 years (cycled). They 
triggered ulcerative colitis, and I ended up having an ileostomy when
I was 19.  I lost 75 lbs before it was all over....
<hr>
Yeah, I've been hittin' the sauce hard for the last year straight. 
I'm up to 265 lbs -- ripped!! I look awesome, but the only problem 
is my nuts are about the size of chick peas and I've got gyno the 
size of grapefruits. Other than my hair loss, pimpled out back, bad
attitude, high blood pressure, occasional jaundice, and liver tumors,
I'm doin' great! I just got this new beeper so they can alert me when
my new liver comes in. If I'm training or something, they can just 
beep me then airlift me to U of M Medical Hospital. Right now I'm 
taking HGH, one IU a day, two cc's of Suspension a day, three 
Sustanons a week, three tabs of Anadrol a day -- and guess what? 
I just benched 250 last week! My squat's up too -- I can do 275 
for a double. Wait, my beeper just went off, got to run and get 
my new liver. Just think of the shit I'll be able to take with a 
new liver!
<hr>
Up until the age of 22, I weighed 175 lbs, worked out, and could not 
gain a pound.  After using Anadrol, I shot up to 212 lbs at 14% bodyfat,
and later cut back to 195-200. Since that time, I have managed to get 
my body weight up to 220 with 13% bodyfat.  I feel the one cycle gave 
me a growth spurt that my body and psyche were in desperate need of. 
In the past year, I have become comfortable at 196 lbs with about 8-9% 
bodyfat, depending on the time of year. Yes, all in all, I think it 
was a very positive experience, except for the little retreat my 
hairline took.
<hr>
In America today, the government treats us like children -- 
I'm responsible enough to join the military and kill for my 
country, but I'm too childish to have control over my own body.
What I put in my body is my own fuckin' business. Our government 
regulates our lives the way they see fit. We are supposed to be
the land of the free, but I can't go into a drug store and buy
steroids. We, as a people, need to stop and look at the power 
we give all these piss-ant agencies like the DEA and FDA. You 
can walk down to any corner and find a crackhead standing there
and the police don't do a damn thing about it. But as soon as 
they find out I'm using steroids, I become public enemy number
one. Then, they give me a speech about how I'm destroying my 
life with steroids. You don't hear of too many bodybuilders 
on roids breaking into homes to supply their habits. It's my
body, and I'll put in it what the hell I want ....
<hr>
I feel that as with most any other substances, there are 
reasonable and acceptable dosages. The problem is that most
competitive bobybuilders exceed any sane level of use, and 
they continually rationalize the risks by merely fooling 
themselves into thinking that winning is worth it. Being 
a former Division I NCAA football athlete, I have seen 
first-hand the effects of high doses of steroids, and not
one of my associates ever looked like Paul Dillet or 
Dorian Yates. While I understand that football and 
bodybuilding are enormously different disciplines, it still
strongly suggests to me that pro bodybuilders are using 
insane doses and radical stacks to obtain their physiques.
I commend MM2K for continually educating its readers so 
they can at least make an informed choice based on the 
latest research. MM2K's equal emphasis on the newest legal 
supplements, and its in-depth testing and evaluating is a 
blessing for the masses. Please continue in your efforts 
and maintain your current standards.
<hr>
I read an article from MM2K about how some day supplements 
like creatine and HMB will take place of steroids. But I 
think even if we created a supplement that was as good as 
Anadrol without the side effects, bodybuilders would still 
use steroids. They will just use them along with the supplements.
Bodybuilders want any edge over the competition. But these 
supplements may keep the average person who just wants to 
shape up from doing steroids.

		<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>he author of this book, Bill Phillips, is probably known to most of you as the Executive Editor and Founder of the sensational	bodybuilding magazine <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>.</P><P><I>Muscle Media 2000</I> is one of the fastest growing magazines in its category - over 300,000 people read each issue. It has gained a reputation in the bodybuilding world as the "no holds barred" or "tell it like it is" physique publication because each issue candidly discusses topics that in the past had been kept "in the closet." Topics such as anabolic steroid use by top bodybuilders, as well as hard hitting	expos&eacute;s on supplement scams, are some of the controversial subjects <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> confronts head-on.</P><P>Phillips, a bodybuilder himself for 15 years now, has always had a passion for muscle. In his "competitive" years (1982-1986) he admittedly relied on anabolic steroids to help him build muscle size and strength, but like many bodybuilders, he gave up steroids when the federal crackdown hit years ago and the market became polluted with counterfeit and bogus 'roids. Although Phillips gave up steroids, he never gave up the desire to be bigger and stronger and has dedicated literally thousands of hours over the last seven years to studying bodybuilding supplements.</P>
		<P>Today, Phillips is living proof that you can continue to make gains in muscle size and strength and improve your muscularity without resorting to drug use, <I>if</I> you have the proper knowledge! Phillips, bodybuilding <I>drug free</I> at a height of 5'8" and a bodyweight of 202 lbs (with 7% bodyfat), benches a respectable 400 pounds and has also benched his present bodyweight for 45 consecutive, strict repetitions! Phillips contends, "I was <I>close</I> to being this big and strong when I was on steroids, but not quite." Although he believes the "science of supplements" is rapidly catching up with muscle-building drugs, he doesn't think it's quite there yet: "Although some of the new supplements are extremely effective, there is still no way a guy my height can put on 260 pounds of lean mass without using literally bucketfuls of bodybuilding drugs - and not just steroids!"</P> <P>Phillips has always tried to promote "realistic physique role models" in his magazine, <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. He believes aspiring bodybuilders should not set their goals based on what others have acheived - especially elite, genetically gifted, drug-enhanced professional bodybuilders - they should focus on constantly improving the body they	have and be the best they can be! And, Phillips believes this new book will provide all bodybuilders with the information they need to build the best physique they can - <I>drug free!</I></P>

<H2><CENTER>Beta-Hydroxy Beta-Methyl Butyrate (HMB)</CENTER></H2><P>
This supplement is definitely the 'state-of-the-art' in drug-free bodybuilding. It's totally new, and everything I've learned about it so far has me completely impressed!  For example, HMB was recently shown in a clinical study, performed by legitimate doctors, to increase lean-mass gains in weight trainers who consumed 3 grams of this stuff a day by up to 300% in only 3 weeks!<P>
And, the athletes who took 3 grams of HMB a day for 3 weeks and trained with weights gained 295% more strength than those who followed the exact same exercise and nutrition program but didn't use HMB. Now you know why I'm predicting that HMB may be the most powerful, natural bodybuilding supplement ever - perhaps even more incredible than creatine monohydrate!<P>
To explain how I believe HMB works, I need to tell you a few things about muscle growth in general, so bear with me - all of the things I'm about to tell you are very relevant, and I think you'll find them quite interesting.<P>
Muscles grow by a circular process of synthesizing and breaking down protein. Remember, muscles are primarily made up of protein (amino acids) and water. The total protein accrual or muscle growth is the balance between the amount made and the amount broken down. If you want to build bigger, stronger muscles, you're going to have to make a significant alteration in your body's existing protein cycle. That means you're going to have to speed up the rate of synthesis and/or slow down the rate of breakdown.<P>
The reason anabolic steroids have such a dramatic impact on muscle growth is because they alter the body's protein balance. Ironically, steroids, even though they're called "anabolic," which means "building up," exert most of their positive effects by preventing protein breakdown. Recent evidence demonstrates that up to 75% of the muscle-building effects of steroids are due to their ability to inhibit protein degradation. Why is this? Well, in simple terms, anabolic steroids have a way of "shielding" muscle cells from your body's main counter-regulatory hormone, cortisol. It's not important to understand that complicated issue, but it is important to understand that once you've reached a certain degree of muscular development, it's very likely you're going to have to find some way to accelerate protein synthesis or inhibit protein breakdown in order to keep making gains.<P>
After years of studying this issue very thoroughly, I've become convinced that targeting muscle-tissue breakdown is the key. I've already mentioned there is substantial evidence "anabolic" drugs exert their effects by minimizing protein breakdown. Since we know this is the way the most potent muscle-building agents available work, it makes sense to target this area of the equation.<P>
So are there any supplements that can slow the rate of protein breakdown which will, in turn, cause an increase in muscle size?<P>
The answer is... YES!! The preliminary results of a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled university study (the one I told you about at the beginning of this section) offer strong evidence that it is indeed possible to "upgrade" the body's ability to prevent muscle-tissue breakdown which occurs subsequent to intense stress such as a brutal weight-training workout. <P>
On June 2, 1995, an abstract was presented at the American College of Sports Medicine Conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota. That abstract revealed that the use of HMB may cause dramatic increases in size and strength in athletes who train with weights. <P>
The specific purpose of this study, which was conducted by doctors at Iowa State University, was to determine the effect this leucine metabolite (HMB) has on muscle metabolism of people performing resistance exercise. Based on animal data, it was hypothesized that HMB would decrease the protein breakdown induced by resistance exercise, resulting in increased muscle mass and function.<P>
(Data from animal studies have shown HMB supplementation can stimulate muscle growth by 20%-30%! Further data from these investigations have indicated the muscle growth seen in animals being fed HMB occurred because of a decrease in protein breakdown.)<P>
Forty-one male volunteers between the ages of 19 and 29 were recruited for this study. Each subject underwent extensive testing which included body-composition analysis, muscle biopsies, blood tests, and so on.<P>
Each of the 41 test subjects followed the same weight-training program which included the use of both free weights and machines. The weight-training sessions alternated between upper and lower-body exercises, and the subjects lifted three times per week with at least one day of rest between sessions. (These workouts were very similar to the type of training program many bodybuilders follow.)<P>
The nutritional intake of each subject was also carefully controlled. On average, the test subjects consumed approximately 2,400 calories a day, which was slightly less than required, and between 117-175 grams of protein per day. Fifteen of the subjects consumed 3 grams of HMB per day; 13 consumed 1.5 grams of HMB per day; and another group (the control group) of 13 test subjects consumed a placebo with no HMB in it at all. <P>
The researchers monitored the test subjects extensively during this three-week study, and it became extremely obvious that the use of HMB was producing dramatic results.<P>
By the time the study was over, the group of weight trainers using 3 grams of HMB a day had gained almost 3 solid pounds of lean mass (300% more lean mass than the group of nonusers)! In addition, they experienced strength gains that were 295% greater than the test subjects who followed the same workout program but did not use HMB! (The results experienced by the group using 1.5 grams of HMB a day were significant but not as extraordinary as the results seen in those using 3 grams of HMB a day.)<P>
This study also used state-of-the-art analytical procedures in an effort to identify just exactly how HMB might be exerting its powerful effects. For example, they measured the amount of something called 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) that was excreted by the body each week of the study - 3-MH offers scientists a way to look at muscle protein breakdown in the body. They also measured other markers of muscle protein breakdown called creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In addition, they measured nitrogen balance. <P>
The major preliminary finding of this incredibly meticulous study was that HMB supplementation resulted in an enhancement of muscle function in humans undergoing resistance exercise. This effect was clearly shown in the study by increases in muscle strength and was supported by trends in increased lean-tissue mass, improved nitrogen retention, and decreased indicators of muscle damage. Some of the most compelling evidence of improved muscle metabolism with HMB supplementation was an observed 20% decrease in 3-MH loss in urine and a 20%-60% decrease in the levels of the enzymes CPK and LDH in the plasma, indicating muscle damage. This suggests HMB somehow supports the body's ability to minimize muscle damage associated with muscular work or stress.<P>
Although no one is exactly sure how HMB works, one hypothesis is that HMB helps decrease muscle-protein turnover. In turn, this decrease in muscle breakdown results in a more rapid neural recruitment by the muscle fibers and may act as a catalyst to faster increases in strength. This could explain the effect of HMB in the first week of exercise in this study, when unsupplemented subjects lost strength while HMB-supplemented subjects gained strength. With HMB supplementation, a decrease in muscle breakdown was supported by a reduction in the essential plasma amino acids in blood. Because these amino acid values were obtained from subjects who fasted overnight, the major contributor to plasma amino acids was natural protein breakdown by the body.<P>
I've learned that the doctors who conducted this study have also wrapped up three other clinical studies on humans using HMB which support these findings. These studies will be published in the near future.<P>
So what do the preliminary findings of this recent study mean to you and me? Well, it looks like we've finally found a supplement we can use to support our body's ability to minimize protein breakdown and very possibly "tip the scales" of protein balance in our favor. This could allow us to make substantial gains in muscle size and strength - drug free!<P>
I believe this new discovery could be one of the most important findings for bodybuilders everywhere who want to build muscle size and strength but do not want to have to turn to, or continue to rely on, anabolic steroids and other possibly dangerous and illegal muscle-building drugs.<P>
Metabolic Technologies, Inc..... (MTI), the company that owns the rights to HMB and funded this recent study, has only recently started manufacturing HMB in any "bulk" quantities. For the last six years, HMB has only been manufactured in small "pilot batches" - just enough HMB was manufactured to meet the needs of those involved in the university studies.<P>
MTI is in the process of trying to "ramp-up" HMB production in anticipation of making this supplement available on a fairly wide-scale basis within the next year.<P>
So, if everything goes as planned, you should be able to buy HMB, as a dietary supplement, at health-food stores within a year. But for now, HMB is only available on a limited basis through mail order.<P>
As a matter of fact, I've been trying for months to get MTI to send me a supply for myself and only recently "scored" just three weeks ago. This stuff is harder than hell to get! (But man does it work! You can really feel it!)<P>
One more thing - let me issue a word of warning to all the bodybuilding supplement companies out there: the nutritional uses of HMB for promoting nitrogen retention (muscle gain) are protected by a strong patent. They're not "patent-pending"... they're patented! The patent is owned by the Iowa State University Research Foundation (ISURF) and has been licensed to Metabolic Technologies, Inc. under U.S. patent number 5,348,979. ISURF is affiliated with Iowa State University and spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to vigorously protect the university's discoveries and patents. Don't say I didn't warn you!<P>
(Buyers... if you come across a supplement that is supposed to have real HMB in it and it doesn't have the U.S. patent number 5,348,979 on the label, don't buy it! It could be a rip-off!)<P>
Even more clinical studies are being planned to test HMB.  In fact, another study involving weight trainers is already underway!  And you can bet <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> will be the first magazine to report these findings to you, so you can stay on the cutting edge.<P>
As you can see, when it comes to "alternatives" to anabolic steroids and other drugs that help you build size and strength, I would say HMB is one of the most exciting ever!<P>
<B><I>I rate it an enthusiastic A+!</I></B><P>

<H2><CENTER>Glutamine</CENTER></H2><P>
The is the most abundant amino acid in muscle tissue. Until just a couple of years ago, no one really paid much attention to glutamine supplementation - it wasn't a hot topic. However, in recent years, as experts have focused on the "protein-sparing" or muscle-saving potential of this amino acid, glutamine has become extremely popular.<P>Glutamine is an ingredient in many of the "meal-replacement powders" (a category of products we discussed earlier in this book), so a lot of bodybuilders already get a hefty supplemental dose of this amino acid each day.<P>Scientific studies seem to support the theory that glutamine supplementation may be important to maximizing muscle growth. In one recent study, it was shown that just a two-gram dose of glutamine caused a rather significant increase in growth-hormone levels. (Whether or not that growth-hormone increase had an effect on body composition has not been determined, however.)<P>Glutamine is also a very important amino acid to maintain proper health; deficiencies may mean an increased risk of infection, colds, flu, etc.<P>As far as what dosage is necessary to see results, the experts differ tremendously. Some believe the benefits of glutamine can be realized at a dosage as low as 2 grams a day, while others advocate 30 grams.<P>Personally, I take about 10 grams a day - most of which I get through my meal-replacement powder.<P>

<a name="aggression pill"><b>GURU:  I'm a fighter as well as a bodybuilder.</a>  I gained 15 pounds using   primobolan tabs, and I'm happy.  However, next year I'll be competing in kickboxing.  Can I pop one or
two aggression pills before a fight?  I'm normally laid back, and it's affecting my fighting instinct.
</b><p><p>
<b>A:</b> Before I answer your question, I'd like to tell you that this is the kind of question I really dislike. The <b>bodybuilding subculture doesn't need any more Type A individuals acting like assholes</b>. Anyway, most of the benign, non-androgenic steroids have been quietly removed from the commercial market.  The most plentiful steroids on the black market are the various testosterones, which are not considered anabolics but rather classic androgens.<p>

There have always been some individuals who actually crave increased aggressiveness, and such behavior has been condoned within their peer group.  The obvious examples are the overt contact sports like boxing.  But football players (when they were not being tested), law enforcement personnel, and military recruits all requested androgenic steroids when I was a steroid dealer ten years ago.<p>

As to this specific question: <b>yes, there is such a thing as an "aggression pill." </b> But I wonder if much of the "effects" are due to placebo.  There has been a recent scientific study which validates this possibility.  The obvious choice for Kickassabol is sublingual methyltestosterone, since it's an androgen and has an activity level of only about 20 minutes.  Some powerlifters I know would pop them like PEZ just before each lift.<p>  

The <b>next choice is the trade-named Halotestin</b>. The generic name is fluoxymesterone.  In its favor (or maybe not), it's more androgenic than methyltestosterone.  But it's not in sublingual form, so absorption is slow. This is available in Mexico as Stenox in two-milligram tabs.  I could cautiously recommend 10 milligrams of this drug, but it really doesn't get into the circulation swiftly like sublingual methyltestosterone does.<p>

The current state of the art for commercial androgens is a liquid veterinary oral preparation called <b>Checque Drops</b> (mibolerone).  An eyedropper is included in the packaging.  Checque Drops is the most androgenic substance currently being sold.  It's so powerful that it's taken in micrograms, rather than the usual milligrams.  It's used in animal medicine to prevent female dogs from going into heat, and it's usually added to the dog's food.  <p>

The powerlifters who use Checque Drops use two full droppers, taken orally.  Although some pain-tolerant individuals do inject the liquid, which is mostly propylene glycol, a solvent, it causes tremendous burning at the injection site.  It also doesn't do wonders for your stomach lining, either, which is why we have seen a limit of two droppers full.  I can't quite say if Checque Drops is terribly anabolic, because I have yet to see any powerlifter or bodybuilder use large amounts of it.  However, we do know that Checque Drops will latch onto the steroid receptor tighter than even testosterone.  Usually, the high-affinity androgens like dihydrotestosterone (DHT) or Proviron don't have any anabolic activity.  In the mid-'80's, the black market DDR designer steroids relabeled Checque Drops as dihydrolone and sold it as a so-called East German injectable.  The chief side effect was gynecomastia.<p>

Although Checque Drops doesn't convert to estrogen, it's one of the very few steroids that cross reacts with progesterone (the other "female" hormone) receptors.  It does not block the actions of progesterone but actually imparts progesterone-like activity at the receptor.  So continual use of Checque Drops may cause swelling of the (male) breast tissue, just as estrogen does.<p>

Even now, Checque Drops are used for powerlifting out-of-competition training. Within 20 minutes or so, 2 droppers of Checque Drops instill a noticeable psychological effect.  So Checque Drops is my candidate for Kickassabol.  But besides the fact that its use and possession is illegal (even if you're a horny dog), I don't recommend it because the androgens are what usually generate the side effects that l<b>ead to all the horror stories that average people associate with steroid use.</b><p><p>

<a name="3 sustanon 250"><b>GURU: </a> I want to use 3 sustanon 250's a week.  Should I space the shots out, or can I inject all of it at once? The sustanons are in preloaded syringes, and the needles are pretty big.  How do I transfer the contents into another syringe?
</b><p>
<b>A:</b> There is no benefit to spacing out the injections.  A total oil volume of three cubic centimeters is not an especially large injection.  And Sustanon, which is a blend of various durations of testosterone, is so long acting that there is no "magic" in spacing the injections throughout the week.  The standard Mexican Sustanon preload uses a 20-gauge needle.  (For readers who are unfamiliar with needle sizes, the smaller the number, the bigger the needle diameter.)  Most oil-based drugs are injected with a 21-gauge needle. The smaller the gauge (the higher the number), the more finger pressure needed to force the oil through the needle.  <p>

In practical terms, in a standard 3-cc syringe size, most steroid users can force oil through a 23-gauge needle by pushing with one hand.  Some individuals can use a so-called vitamin needle of 25 gauge, but it entails using both hands to push the syringe plunger.  Most vitamin needles do not use a screw-on connection between the needle and the syringe, and trying to force the oils through this combination generates so much fluid pressure (think of hydraulics) that usually the individual blows the syringe off the needle, and he's left with a needle sticking out of his ass, an empty syringe in his hand, and the oily steroid spewed about onto the worst of places.  When I self-surrendered to prison in 1989, I was trying to do the same vitamin needle stunt outside the prison gate inside my friend's new Mercedes and sprayed 3-ccs of Sustanon all over his beautiful Palomino leather interior.<p>

But you're right, the 20-gauge Sustanon needle is damn big.  And since you're insisting on using three preloads a week, that would create three very big holes that will accrue muscle scar tissue.  Here's how I used to do it, but first, I suppose I should give the standard warning of don't try this at home: my preference was a 23-gauge, 1-inch length.  I would remove the plunger and hold it in my teeth.  I held the empty syringe in my left hand, and I carefully plunged the Sustanon preload's contents into the open syringe top.  I emptied two more Sustanons into the syringe, which filled it to the 3-cc limit.  I then carefully and gently replaced the plunger right at the very edge of the syringe rim.  I didn't want to push the plunger in too much at this point because I'd dribble steroid out of the needle end.  Once the plunger was in position, I turned the syringe upside down (plunger pointing down).  I gave the syringe a few shakes downward, and that moved the trapped air up!
  to th
e needle end.  At this point I could push the plunger in more, removing the air from the syringe.  And then I was ready to finalize my felony.

<p><p><hr><p><p>

<a name="stop supps before show"><b>GURU: I have a natural</a> show coming up, and I'm using vanadyl, creatine, GKGtm, and ephedrine.  Should I stop any of these compounds before the show, and if so, when?
</b><p>
<b>A:</b> <b>Keep using the vanadyl and GKG </b>(a glutamine product).  I'm assuming you've already loaded with creatine, and you're probably using a smaller amount (the average is six grams a day).  To ensure you have the maximum fullness effect with the creatine, I suggest that you reload for five days before the show.  The research has shown that large amounts of creatine are not needed once creatine is loaded into the muscle, but it may turn out that reloading could add another pound of lean body mass.  I can't guarantee it, but it wouldn't hurt to try.<p>

<b>Using ephedrine up to the show is an iffy proposition</b>.  I've read research pointing out that clenbuterol, a Beta-2 agonist more potent than ephedrine, definitely lowers insulin sensitivity.  So use of clenbuterol would interfere with the carbing-up process.  I don't know if the same rationale applies to ephedrine.  Ephedrine is a poor Beta-2 agonist and has a poor fit at the receptor.  Most of the thermogenic action of ephedrine is not from direct stimulus at the receptor, rather its action is caused by the generation of your noradrenaline at the nerve endings.  I haven't read any research linking ephedrine to insulin sensitivity.  But on a wholly practical level, "cold turkeying" ephedrine may make you tired and depressed. You have to be at your mental best for your contest.  So even though there is a logical <b>possibility that ephedrine use will interfere with your carb-up</b>, I suggest you stay on ephedrine, so you can remain happy.<p><p>

<hr><p><p>

<a name="test vs deca"><b>GURU: I've read that testosterone </a>has great IGF-1 generating abilities, and Deca Durabolin is not nearly as good.  Should I avoid Deca if I want to get maximum growth?
</b>
<b>A: Testosterone is a more potent anabolic than Deca</b> Durabolin (nandrolone decanoate).  It might be that a steroid's ability to aromatize into estrogen is tied into the IGF-1 elevation.  Testosterone has more conversion to estrogen than  Deca Durabolin does, even though Deca Durabolin is made from an estrogen.  We know that the use of the estrogen blocker Nolvadex lowers IGF-1.  And we knew years ago that something about Nolvadex was inhibiting muscle growth because I received many comments that bodybuilders grew better without Nolvadex.<p>
  
So should you avoid a steroid which has less side effects than testosterone in your quest for ultimate growth?  It depends on how old you are.  From AIDS research, we now know that testosterone depresses the immune system.  Deca Durabolin does the opposite (but not to any great degree).  My recommendation is that from middle age onward (pick an age, I use age 40 as the starting point), <b>men should use Deca Durabolin instead of testosterone</b>, even in situations of testosterone replacement.  We also should be realistic.  After a certain age, both growth and IGF-1 are not secreted at their previous youthful levels.  So does it matter if <b>Deca Durabolin reduces IGF-1</b> production if normal levels in middle age and onward are already insignificant?  No research on that question has been done.  I have a feeling that IGF-1 production declines so much by middle age that its suppression from Deca Durabolin would have no effect.<p>

Another point to make about testosterone use--<b>we don't have a blood test that can tell us which individuals are going to lose their hair from testosterone use</b>.  I have a close friend who is 60 years old and uses 600 mg of testosterone a week and has a full head of hair.  And he has been using various steroids, including testosterone, for close to 30 years.  As we can see in the professional bodybuilding ranks, some bodybuilders are losing a lot of hair to be able to compete at the over 250-pound body-weight mark.  It would be interesting to interview a number of balding bodybuilders and ask them if they wished they had avoided the various baldness-causing steroids.  Is the loss of hair just a small price to pay for greatness?  That probably depends on if the individual has any kind of life outside of bodybuilding.  If the person's whole self and peer esteem is completely centered around his body "looking awesome," then I imagine that hair loss is no big deal.  But rem!
 ember, when the person stops steroid use and muscle size decreases, the hair, of course, doesn't grow back.<p><p>
<hr><p><p>


<b><a name="stop usage">GURU: one of the arguments </a>against steroid use is that all the gains I would make would disappear once I stopped using steroids.  Is this true?</b><p>

<b>A: Yes, eventually, virtually all of the gains from steroid use would disappear.</b>  However, it would take years for that to happen.  This is one of the reasons football players have not been getting smaller since drug testing began.  Off-season, players don't get tested, and they can accrue enough muscle mass to "coast" though the playing season.<p>  

The same logic applies with drug-tested bodybuilding shows.  A bodybuilder could swear on a polygraph that he hadn't used steroids for a year.  Swell, except, during the year of being "clean," a good amount of steroid-generated muscle will still be there.  Steroids are still the anabolic bargain.  In the studies of geriatrics using growth hormone, all of the beneficial effects induced from the growth hormone went away within a matter of weeks.  I predict that the same fleeting anabolism will happen with IGF-1.  Clenbuterol's effects diminished even more rapidly.  Many doctors don't want to admit it, but limited steroid use of a yearly, eight-week cycle would have virtually no adverse side effects and would probably vastly improve the health of the individual through the rest of the year.  It would be interesting to put a group of bodybuilders on a mild short cycle and then track the decreases of muscle mass over the months after the end of the cycle.  These results wouldn't !
 surpri
se me, but I don't think the anti-steroid crowd would like to hear that steroid gains do last for a long time.<p><p>
<hr><p><p>

<a name="first contest"><b>GURU: My gym buddies</a> have convinced me to enter a novice bodybuilding contest.  How many weeks should I diet before the contest?</b><p>

A:Competition is a good thing.  Even bowlers and golfers "compete."  I have often mentioned that most weightlifters who call themselves "bodybuilders" will never compete in a contest, but I think more should.  <b>A local bodybuilding show is an excellent opportunity to learn quite a bit about both your mind and body.</b>  Most of us will never have the genetics to become an international champion, but bodybuilding competitions allow you to feel like you're actually in a sport, as opposed to just participating in a hobby. <p> 

I'd like to see a polygraph-tested amateur contest at next year's Muscle Media 2000 <i>"No Holds Barred"</i> Seminar.  The first day would be the contest; the next day, there could be an informal seminar with the winners.<p>

I encounter many recreational bodybuilders who start training for a contest, <b>usually a novice one, only to "bail out" and quit the contest preparation because of discouraging results</b>. I've done it myself--after encountering a combination of too much muscle loss and sticking points in fat loss.  The novice bodybuilder usually expects some very unrealistic goals from the contest preparation.  The recreational (non-competing) bodybuilder rarely achieves low single-digit bodyfat percentages, so he or she won't encounter metabolic problems generated from prolonged dieting and overtraining.  It would be great if we could all only diet for four weeks (or less) to get into contest-ready shape.  But most of us can't.  Let me show you how to rectify some of the mistakes I made during my pathetic and short-lived competition years.<p>

<b>The worst mistake is to assume you're going to ipso-facto increase muscle mass and lose bodyfat at the same time,</b> like Franco Columbu used to do.  Granted, some individuals can pull this stunt off, especially with the assistance of some of the various anabolic compounds available, but unless you've executed this trick before, don't assume you can pull this off.  Be conservative, and accept the possibility that after the contest preparation, you'll end up with less muscle mass than you started with.<p>

<b>I recommend a ten-week contest preparation,</b> broken down into dieting for four weeks, eating normally for two weeks, and resuming dieting for four more weeks.  Through trial and error, I've found that after four weeks of reducing calories, the body will lower your body temperature by impairing the T4 to T3 thyroid conversion. (Your diet is stuck!)  If you continue dieting past this point, you'll have to drop calories even lower than before. And less calories will accelerate muscle loss.  Of course, there are tricks to extend the dieting phase without the body temperature drop, but these involve adding prescription thyroid medication.  And whenever you decide to stop using the medication, there will be an eight-week lag time when the body tries to adjust natural thyroid output back to normal. And even nominal amounts of calories during this time will be deposited as bodyfat.<p>


I've also learned the hard way that novice bodybuilders have a very difficult time achieving contest-ready bodyfat percentages of five percent or less if they start this ten-week dieting cycle with more than ten percent bodyfat. This isn't to say that some very gifted individuals can't whip themselves into great shape within 8 weeks from 15% bodyfat (or more).  But most of us will not be able to duplicate such dazzling results.  <b>I'm a believer of tracking bodyfat during the year with skin-fold calipers,</b> so it doesn't creep past the 10% to 12% range.  Whatever contest you decide to enter, plan it so at the ten-week out point, your bodyfat is right at ten percent. Maybe I should call it the "Guru 10/10 rule."

<a name="sodium load"><b>GURU: My bodybuilding</a> coach is recommending that I sodium load before the contest so I don't need to use a diuretic.  Should I do this?</b><p>

<b>A:</b> Eric Sternlicht created the concept of "sodium loading" about ten years ago when he was a UCLA graduate student.  He reasoned that by <b>force-feeding salt over a number of days, the body's reaction would be to curtail the secretion of the hormone aldosterone</b>, which regulates (retains) sodium in the body.  If the same salt-eating individual were to abruptly cease all intake of salt, the lack of systemic aldosterone would flush out large amounts of sodium and water from the body.  Usually, there is a three-day lag for down-regulated aldosterone to up-regulate.<p>

  On a purely creative level, sodium loading seems novel, logical, and elegant.  However, <b>sodium loading has never fulfilled its initial premise</b>.  I don't exactly know which part of the concept contributes to the dismal-looking end results, but I suspect it might be the relationship between low aldosterone, curtailed sodium, and water intake--all the while, the individual should actually be carbing up.  Unfortunately, too many of the sodium loaders have ended up looking spectacularly bad on contest day.
<p>
<b>I'm a strong advocate of injectable Lasix,</b> usually taken on the day before a contest.  But even an OTC [over-the-counter] herbal diuretic would give better results than sodium loading.  The present judging standards reward the "ripped" competitor, but this shredded look is not necessarily due to the thinness of the skin.  A competitor can have uniform skin-fold thickness of only two millimeters but still look (relatively speaking) "fat" because of too much water between the muscle fibers.  Saunas and sweat suits don't help eliminate water trapped between the muscle fibers in the thighs either (water follows gravity). 
<p>
 So I don't recommend sodium loading, even though I admire the reasoning behind it.  I just don't know how to make it work in any practical sense.  Always use some kind of diuretic for a contest, even if it's only buchu extract (a popular herbal diuretic).

<a name="creatine"><b>GURU: I read the published</a> research on using creatine monohydrate and followed the recommendations of 20 grams over 5 days and then a maintenance dosage of 6 grams a day.  I felt pretty good after the first five days, but after a week of using six grams a day, my strength and size gains diminished.  What am I doing wrong?</b><p>

<b>A: You're probably not using enough creatine after the first five days.</b>  Try doubling the dosage to 12 grams a day.  And if that doesn't work, raise the daily dosage to 20 grams.  As much as it seems logical to follow the recommendations from published research, many of the human research subjects may not have the same high-activity levels (or body weights) as bodybuilders.  In the case of creatine, the six-grams-a-day maintenance dosage was determined through muscle biopsies.  <b>Anecdotal evidence from bodybuilders shows that six grams a day isn't enough to sustain initial size and strength gains</b>.  It might be that bodybuilders need more creatine for exercise, or some individuals may not be using proper amounts of high-glycemic carbs to transport the creatine with insulin.<p>  

Personally, I would have the patience to load creatine at the initial recommended 20-30 grams-a-day dosage for a week or so and would have no problem in maintaining a once-a-day 6 gram dosage.  But if I had to continue using high amounts of creatine in divided daily dosages, I doubt I would be able to keep the routine up.  As to following the creatine dosages suggested by research, I would <b>always trust workout poundages and a tape measure over any of the research formulas.</b>

<a name="calf"><b>GURU:</a>Can you recommend a calf routine for me; mine are pretty pathetic? </b><p>

<b>A: No, I can't. </b> As far as I'm concerned, there are two classes of calves: either they're totally resistant to growth from any routine or just about any routine (including none at all) will cause growth.  I know that's pessimistic, but it's the conclusion I've reached after 20 years of watching hundreds (thousands?) of people train calves.  I've encountered bodybuilders with great calves, and it seems that any kind of work will cause the calves to grow.  Some bodybuilders achieve great calves (Vince Taylor comes to mind) with little or no direct work.  
<p>
But if you're one of those individuals who finds your calves are stubborn, you've probably already tried every imaginable way of training calves.  I certainly have.  High reps (up to 100), high sets, training them twice a day, every day, or seated calf raises in the middle of the night (the machine was next to my bed).  <b>I've tried very heavy weights, absurdly heavy eccentrics </b>(with two training partners hanging off the calf machine), most mail-order calf courses, even electrical stimulation.  I've injected steroids into my calves, tried those dangerous calf shoes, tried skipping rope, and even tried skipping rope while wearing those damn shoes. (Don't try this!)  Yet <b>my calves still...suck!</b>  In fact, some routines made my calves smaller!  So in my case, it looks pretty hopeless.  
<p>
Now, I just train them like any body part: 2-3 sets of standing and seated calf raises, 12 reps at 70% of my maximum weight, finishing off with 2-3 forced reps with a higher weight from my training partner applying the downward pressure.  
<p>
<b>There's only one secret for great calf development: be born with great calves.</b>

<a name="gain weight"><b>GURU: I want </a>to gain weight.  How do I know when I should stop?</b>
<p><b>
A:</b> It all depends on what sport you're in.  Whether we like it or not, any weight-gain program that includes <b>eating more than your maintenance calories will cause some deposition of bodyfat</b>.  So the real question is: how fat can you get?  I've seen many individuals start a very cautious mass program with the intention of not adding any bodyfat--even counting nutrients to the gram.  And it seemed that very stringent eating didn't generate much muscle gain when contrasted with other "diets" that were a bit more flexible.  It would help if you could actually see the various bodies in the locker rooms and assign bodyfat percentages.  For example, <b>at 15%, the sedentary man doesn't look fat in street clothes.  But a weightlifter at 15% bodyfat</b>, which is an average fat percentage with the heavier powerlifters and football players, looks very out of shape. Most of the fat accumulates on the stomach and trunk area, but in these two sports, there's no great motivatio!
 n among peers and players to diet down to a lower bodyfat percentage.  So the "you're too fat to even think of gaining weight" advice would probably be ignored.
<p>
However, let me assume you're in a bodybuilding mode.  <b>It wouldn't be wise for you to start a weight-gain program, which includes eating more and lessening your aerobics </b>(as being aerobically fit interferes with acquiring muscle), if you're already fat.  Unless an individual is unusually gifted and using an array of drugs, it's rare to see someone gain muscle and lose fat at the same time.  Yes, I've seen it done on the old <b><i>Rebound Training System</i></b> by Michael Zumpano and the current knock-off, Anabolic Diet.  But <b>both systems need an amount of discipline greater than anticipated</b>, and most weight trainers won't stay on such a program.   
<p>
The problem with getting temporarily fatter than usual (and we haven't decided the exact figure) is that <b>most individuals lose too much muscle when dieting off a lot of fat</b>.  Granted, just when I say 15% is too high a bodyfat percentage to allow a successful plummet to a single-digit fat percentage, there will be someone who pulls this off.  But typically, at 15%, a bodybuilder looks FAT, and when dieting down, much of the newly acquired muscle is lost.
<p>
Let me further assume your metabolism isn't astounding (if it were, you wouldn't be writing me for advice). For gaining weight, I use a very narrow fat window.  I suggest that you start your weight-gain program when your bodyfat is 9% or lower.  Needless to say, many individuals who'd like to gain weight will be disappointed to learn that they should actually go on a weight-loss diet before embarking on a bulking phase.  The fat window slams shut (in my opinion) at 12% bodyfat.  At this point, you should either hold your bodyfat at the 12% mark for a while or diet back down to 9% for another bulking phase.  Many of you might have another question after reading this advice: is it better to stay at the 12% for a while, or should I immediately diet down?  I think the term is "solidifying" the mass--somewhat like curing concrete--rather than "dieting down."  And I have no answer on this.  Personally, <b>I think you'll find that your metabolism will be at its highest, in terms of!
  body temperature, during a bulking phase</b> (unless you're eating high amounts of saturated fats), and this is a very nice time to start a weight-loss regimen, when your metabolism is optimum.
<p>
I'm afraid there's no textbook in which to look up magic answers on how many weeks you should be bulking up. Some individuals with enormous appetites and very poor eating habits could go from 9% to 12% within a few weeks. But everybody would like some hard numbers.  The average 200-pound bodybuilder would have a fat window of 3% about 6 pounds.  If you plan your bulk program over 8 weeks, this would allow a weekly fat accumulation of 3/4 of a pound.  This seems workable to me.  And <b>most weight-loss diets stop working after about 5 or so weeks,</b> so a bodybuilder at 12% should be able to diet down to a 9% bulk phase again after about 6 weeks of dieting.
<p>
As you can imagine, I recommend skin-fold caliper readings every week.  I've found that during a bulking program, many individuals deny that fat is accumulating.  This is probably because workout poundages go up, and you're able to get a better pump. This exuberance puts the "fat blinders" on.
<p>
I do think my Isometric Diet <p><b>(CREATE A LINK TO:see page 72 in the January 1996 issue of Muscle Media 2000)</b> <p>is an ideal diet for gaining weight.  If you're considering counting calories, I suggest you increase calories over maintenance by only 10%, and the extra calories should be equally divided among the three macronutrients (protein, carbs, and fat).

<p><p><hr><p><p>

<b>Should I stay with my successful low carb diet or try one of the new higher-fat diets?</b>

<b>GURU: I've always used a high-carb, low-calorie diet to prepare for my contests, and I've always gotten shredded.  Why should I change to one of those higher-fat diets?</b>
<p>
<b>A:There's no reason to automatically change what's worked for you in the past.</b>  You might be one of the people with great glucose metabolism and insulin control.  If you have very little bodyfat and only have to diet for four weeks or less, you'll probably never generate the problems that other people who have higher bodyfat percentages and need to diet for a longer period of time encounter.  I would point out that <b>if you do any aerobic activity, you won't be able to function well for long periods of time without eating</b> some carbs every hour or so.  When I was eating a high-carb diet and went on long bike rides, I would bonk out at the 25-mile mark and had to eat carbs, so I didn't get into the limp-and-crawl-home mode.
<p>
<i>(This is very true for me!  S.P.)</i>
<p>
I've found that women, having more bodyfat in their lower bodies, seem to experience better results when eating less dietary carbs.  I've included three separate diets in <b>BODYOPUS:</b> the modern high-carb diet for those addicted to carbs; the Isometric Diet, which has a daily 1/3 fat ratio; and the radical BODYOPUS Diet, which eliminates virtually all carbohydrates over 5 days.  The BODYOPUS Diet is not needed by everybody, and <b>I always suggest that people follow the easiest diet first</b> and only change if they encounter a problem the diet can't resolve.

<a name="CLA"><b>GURU: You have</a> mentioned both structured lipids and something else called CLA.  What are these things?  Are they fats or what?</b>
<p>
<b>A:Both are dietary fats</b>.  Let's start off with structured lipids as it is the simpler of the two to explain.  First off, understand that most of the dietary fats we eat are not individual fatty acids but a three-fatty-acid complex called a triglyceride.  A structured lipid is a triglyceride, a bonding of three fatty acids that is made synthetically in the laboratory because it can't be found in nature.  Usually, it is a mixture of medium-chain fatty acids (MCFA) (you might remember MCTs, a.k.a. medium chain triglycerides) along with a longer chain fatty acid.  <b>The two most popular structured lipids are blends of MCFAs and linoleic acid</b> (one of the essential fatty acids) or MCFAs and fish oils.  And some of you might be thinking: Why?  Why not just mix the various oils together rather than custom bond them?  Actually, for most healthy people, structured lipids are not really needed.  But structured lipids perform well with people who have some kind of fat malabs!
 orption so that needed fats are not taken into circulation but are just dumped in the bowel.  MCTs need little digestion to transport into circulation. For example, a person with reduced or no bile salts can absorb MCTs because no emulsification in needed.  By bonding a longer-chain fatty acid like linoleic acid or fish oils onto the MCFAs, research has shown that more of these longer-chain fatty acids are transported into the body as compared to consuming similar isolated amounts of both MCTs and vegetable oils.  
<p>
The end result is that structured lipids will have greater blood amounts of the essential fatty acids and reduce the bowel problems caused by dumping oils in the large colon.  <b>Structured lipids are not synergistic, which is to say that this bonding process does not cause any unique drug-like effect</b> that wouldn't happen if the isolated fatty acids could equally be absorbed.  I find structured lipids attractive but not for the usual reasons.  As much as essential acids are needed for muscular growth, of the two, linoleic acid is the most abundant in vegetable oils.  <b>Both corn and canola oil have high amounts of linoleic,</b> so the idea of enhancing its effects with a structured lipid seems unnecessary.  But bonding the linoleic with the medium-chain fatty acids soothes the digestion of the MCTs.  <b>Normal people get stomach upset with even moderate amounts of MCTs</b>, and anything I could do to make the MCT consumption more agreeable seems like a nice idea.
<p>
Moving on to Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA), we get into a <b>much more interesting area because CLA appears to have drug-like effects</b>.  CLA is transformed from one specific essential acid: linoleic acid.  This is a long-chain fatty acid.  To envision these fat chains, imagine a centipede where each of the body segments is a carbon atom, and the legs are hydrogen atoms.  A saturated fat would be a centipede with all its legs.  Each carbon body segment would have two opposite hydrogen legs.  A polyunsaturated fat is a centipede with some of its hydrogen legs pulled off.  Polyunsaturated fats in nature always have two legs pulled off at a time, always on the same side of the "centipede."  Such fats with the missing hydrogens on the same side of the carbon lengths are called cis fats.  
<p>
Naturally made CLA comes from two sources.  Both are animal sources.  The CLA in dairy products happens when cows, eating sources of linoleic like corn or soy, ferment the linoleic in their stomachs and transform the regular polyunsaturated fat from a cis form into a "centipede" that has had its legs pulled off from diagonal opposite sides, called a trans fat.  CLA is also found in grilled meat.  In this instance, the stored linoleic acid in the meat fat is transformed from heat and/or flame.  Neither source has large amounts of CLA.  Dairy products have about .03 to 1.8 grams per kilogram of milk fat.  Beef fat has one gram in each kilogram.  
<p>
Conjugated Linoleic Acid is a general term that encompasses about ten different isomers of cis/trans combinations.  <b>Recent research has shown that only one particular CLA isomer, the cis 9 trans 11 is the drug-like one.</b>  In a future article, I'll give you a primer on how to understand all these cis and trans and their accompanying numbers.  <b>CLA works as a drug in two different ways.</b>  It works as an anti-cancer and antioxidant when the CLA is incorporated in the cells of the body.  This has great application for cancer treatment as untransformed linoleic is a tumor promoter.  CLA is not.  It is also anti-catabolic, and this action is not completely explained.  Some of cancer catabolism happens from simple loss of appetite when the immune system is in high gear.  <b>Conjugated Linoleic Acid improves appetite in this situation, but the preservation of muscle mass is not wholly from increased food intake</b>.  So the potential attractiveness of CLA as an anti-catab!
 olic i
s from this unknown action and could have applications in dieting situations.  It might explain why high-fat red meat diets impart strength and size in weightlifters.  Some of this anabolic effect might be creatine loading (also found in red meat), but the CLA connection shouldn't be dismissed.
<p>
Other than eating excessive amounts of dairy or grilled-meat products, I have found no commercial source of CLA.  This doesn't mean that it cannot be made, even at an attractive price.  However, the present methods of synthesizing CLA in the laboratory result with the general ten isomer compound.  As yet, I have not found a viable economical way of isolating the specific cis 9 trans 11 active CLA.  But I'm still looking.
<p><i>(This is no longer true, as EAS introduced CLA to the bodybuilding world in early 1996!)</i>

<a name="flax"><b>GURU: On your</a> recommendation from the last issue, I went to buy some flaxseed oil.  It's damn expensive. My Nutritional Almanac tells me that soy oil has a pretty good source for linolenic acid.  So what's wrong with soy?</b>
<p>
<b>A: Modern supermarket soy oils are not what they used to be</b>.  The cooking oils in supermarkets have been highly processed so that color, taste, and smell have all been virtually eliminated.  Beyond that, oil manufacturers have always been looking for commercial oils that will have a very long shelf life and sustain high heat without turning bad.  Bad, in this case, means that eventually the highly unstable fatty acids like linoleic and linolenic acids will chemically bond with oxygen and turn rancid.  Also, light and heat will turn the cis fatty acids (which can be used in the body cells) into the trans fatty acids which aren't, in most instances (CLA excepted), good for the body.  
<p>
<b>Soy oil has about 10% linolenic acid content</b>, and this particular fatty acid is the one that turns rancid fastest.  So the oil manufacturers have bred a special strain of soybean that has very little linolenic acid in it, and it has replaced the more stable monounsaturated oleic acid.  To remind you, oleic acid is the chief fatty acid in olive oil.  So on one hand, the high oleic soy oil is a nice fat, as oleic acid does no harm.  But now you don't have any linolenic acid anymore, which would be okay except as a consumer you have no way of knowing which soy you are buying.  The label will not specify if the soy is the modified high oleic.  But yes, if you find a soy oil from a company that claims that their soy has not been bleached and deodorized, then soy might be a thrifty alternative.  But you need to compare prices.  <b>I would imagine, though, that the cost of the "natural" soy oil with its 10% linolenic content would not be much cheaper as compared to a 50% lin!
 olenic content of flaxseed oil if we figure cost for linolenic acid.</b>

<a name="grapefruit juice"><b>GURU: How much</a> caffeine and grapefruit juice should I take with my ehpedrine?</b>
<p>  
<b>A: Ephedrine is thermogenic, so is caffeine</b>.  The real question is: how much caffeine is needed for a synergistic effect, not just an additive effect. Let me illustrate the difference.  Make believe that using one 25-milligram ephedrine tablet would raise your body temperature one degree over normal.  Now imagine that without the ephedrine, you consume a couple cups of coffee (or No Doz or whatever), which would give you 150 milligrams of caffeine.  This caffeine amount would raise your body temperature a quarter degree above normal.  <b>An additive effect of ephedrine and caffeine together would be a simple addition of 1 degree and .25 degree,  a 1.25 degree total net temperature gain.</b>  What we're trying to do is get a synergistic effect, meaning that optimal amounts of each would generate a temperature raise (some "x" ephedrine amount and some "y" caffeine amount) that would be greater than the two separate temperature elevations added together.
<p>
There is research on this synergistic effect.  <b>The optimal ratio is 1:10 between ephedrine and caffeine.  </b>With each 25 milligram ephedrine tablet, you need to consume 250 milligrams of caffeine for the synergistic effect.  Any less caffeine and you'd get a greater temperature rise than with just ephedrine alone, but it would be additive, not synergistic.  Imagine that the ephedrine causes a one degree change and 250 milligrams of caffeine without ephedrine causes a half-degree elevation.   The synergistic combination will raise the temperature more than just the additive 1.5-degree elevation, perhaps another half degree, with a net gain of 2 degrees. <b> At these dosages, all is well and good.</b>  However, I know of many individuals who use 50 milligrams of ephedrine at a time.  You would need 500 milligrams of caffeine for the synergistic effect.  That's a lot of caffeine.  And I have no idea what the ratio is between ephedra (the herbal concentrate) and kola nut or!
  guarana.  The same 1:10 ratio still holds true, but usually the label listing the <b>herbs will not show you the equivalency between the herbal concentrates and the parent compounds.</b>
<p>
<b>It's not the whole grapefruit juice that you think you want but the trace naringin</b> contained in the peel (but concentrated in the grapefruit plant blossoms).  Naringin slows the breakdown of caffeine into its metabolite, paraxanthine, in the liver.  I don't recommend adding naringin to your ephedrine and caffeine mix, simply because it's not necessary.  Paraxanthine is just as thermogenic as caffeine.  Granted, <b>you won't feel the same stimulating bang as caffeine</b>, but in combining caffeine with ephedrine, overstimulation is more of a problem. Eventually, you'll see paraxanthine supplements which would allow you to get the full synergistic thermogenic effect with ephedrine, without the jitters. And doing a <b>1:10 ratio with 50 mg ephedrine and 500 mg of paraxanthine would be a doable combination.
</b><p>
Another unanswered question is what is the optimal ratio between clenbuterol and caffeine.  Is it 1:10?  It doesn't seem possible that, at a clenbuterol dosage of 20 micrograms, the predicted caffeine amount would be only 2 milligrams.

<a name="GHB"><b>GURU: I've been </a>using some liquid GHB from two different sources.  Both taste bad, but one tastes more like paint thinner than the other. The powder never tasted this bad. What gives?</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> As much as the FDA doesn't want gamma hydroxybuterate (GHB) being made, it's an absurdly simple compound to make.  Just add water and lye to the lactone solvent, adjust the pH to 7, and it's done.  And no, I won't give you the recipe again, and I won't tell you where to buy the lactone.  The toughest part of the granular GHB refining process was turning the liquid into a solid.  The drying gets rid of all the trace solvents that impart the petrochemical smell.  The various new (underground) GHB producers don't have the esoteric equipment to dry the liquid.  <b>What is the difference between the different-tasting liquids you allegedly have?  The fouler one of the two probably has a pH of slightly under seven</b>. 
<p>
 A well-made liquid GHB is no more toxic than the dry form.  And overall, GHB has virtually no toxicity.  The problem is how to know if the particular GHB is a good one. The best you can do is scrutinize the packaging.  One GHB on the black market has both contraindications and research listings included with the packaging.  But don't get too worked up about GHB.  <b>It's not really an ergogenic aid</b>. The corresponding rise of cortisol negates any positive effect caused by whatever slight growth hormone may have been caused by GHB use.  <b>GHB is a (mostly benign) recreational drug</b>.

<a name="Metformin"><b>GURU: I want </a>to go to Mexico to get some Metformin which is available as

<p>
<b>A:  </b>  I've mentioned recently that <b>the FDA has approved metformin, a potent insulin agonist</b>, for treatment of Type II Diabetes.  The trade name is Glucophage.  To remind you: metformin would be more potent in improving insulin sensitivity than either chromium or vanadyl sulfate.  I think the problem will be that most American doctors will not prescribe Glucophage to a healthy athlete. 
<p>
Should you acquire Mellitron in Mexico?  No.  Unfortunately, in scrutinizing the Mellitron closely, I found that along with the metformin, there are also 125 milligrams of another drug, clorpropamide.  This particular drug increases insulin secretion.  This is something most people wouldn't want.  We want to improve insulin sensitivity and at the same time lower insulin secretion.  Mellitron won't lower insulin but increase it.  However, if a bodybuilder uses injectable growth hormone, Mellitron would work well along with it. Large amounts of growth hormone make the receptors insulin resistant, and a slight insulin increase would be beneficial.  Most metformins available in Europe would be the isolated compound.

<A NAME="Carbs at night"><B>GURU: I want to carb up for </A>about the usual three days for an upcoming contest. Shuld I eat at night? I heard I shouldn't eat carbs after six pm.</B>
<P>
<B>A:</B>    When you carb deplete, your insulin sensitivity is greater.  And you're probably going to use chromium, vanadyl sulfate, and magnesium to improve insulin sensitivity.  But <B>it's true that insulin sensitivity is lowest at night</B>.  Let's discuss what is happening in your body that makes it dislike carbs at night. Cortisol, a catabolic hormone, is highest at night.  When cortisol is elevated, your muscle cell insulin sensitivity is lowered.  And I have no idea if using all these various insulin agonists will guard against the bad effects of the cortisol.  Probably not.  The other avenue would be to reduce the cortisol at night, so you could eat the carbs without worrying about the blood glucose going into fat cells instead of muscle cells.  I wondered about this same area in the Recomposition (carbing-up) phase of the BODYOPUS diet, when after the 5 no-carb days, you only have 48 hours to carb up before resuming another 5 days of no carbs.  In Recomposition, I!
  do recommend eating carbs throughout the night, waking up every two hours or so, to take in a specific carb meal.  <b>For most people, the best they can do is use chromium, magnesium, and vanadyl with each meal</b>.  But the really adventurous could try using the anti-cortisol Cytadren at 4:00 in the afternoon for the 2 days of carbing up.  The cortisol-lowering activity of Cytadren has a 14-hour duration.  So using Cytadren will lower cortisol throughout the night.  And as long as you use it for only two days, the usual feedback mechanisms wouldn't happen.  If your contest is on Saturday morning, then you would use Cytadren for the last two days of carbing up at night.  Remember, any diuretic will severely inhibit the carbing up process.  This is why I recommend that Lasix (or whatever diuretic you might be using) should be used on one day only before the contest, and finish your carbing up completely before you use any diur
etic.  This is the reasoning for eating mostly fats and proteins on the day before prejudging.  For example, if you plan on using a diuretic on Friday, then the carbing up would be done on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  And the Cytadren would be used on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons only so you could eat carbs at night; this is when the body would usually tend to store the carbs as fat.

A final note: <b>if you can't eat throughout the night, the last carb meal before bed should have some kind of delayed absorption.</b>  You should include some vegetable oil (about 1 tablespoon) and guar gum (about 10 grams) with the carb meal.  Glucophage (metformin), is ideal for slowing carb absorption, as the chief mechanism of metformin is to slow glucose uptake from the small intestine.

<a name="protein equal"><b>GURU:  Do I really need whey prote</a>in over other protein sources?  Wouldn't it be true that if I eat enough extra protein, I'd be getting enough amino acids?  Soy protein is way cheaper than whey protein.  Even if I need more grams of soy protein to get the same nitrogen, it's cheaper than most other proteins, even with the extra amount needed.</b>
<p>
<b>A:  </b> In one way, you're right.  <b>All amino acids are the same </b>(assuming they're not heat damaged, which makes them not totally digestible). The BCAAs in whey protein are just as good as the BCAAs in soy protein.  There are more BCAAs in whey than soy, but if you consume enough soy protein (or another protein), you can achieve the same nitrogen level in the body.  Of course, you may have to consume an extra 25% (or more) protein to achieve the same nitrogen.  But it might be more economical to buy 125 grams of soy protein than buying 100 grams of whey protein.  
<p>
However, these excessive aminos, because of the various limiting nondispensable aminos, will be eliminated from the body.  Remember, you can't store excess amino acids as you do fat.  <b>Extra aminos will be dealt with in three ways:</b> the liver will cleave part of the structure into urea, which is fine, as urea is excreted in the urine.  And some of the aminos can be converted into other amino acids, notably glutamine.  The rest of the partial aminos are converted into triglycerides (fat),  specifically saturated fats.  And we now know that saturated fat lowers insulin sensitivity.  The real interesting question is this: does excessive protein consumption lower insulin sensitivity from the increased saturated fats in the body?  This is an avenue I intend to explore in the future, charting the various pathways of each of the 21 dietary amino acids. I've wondered about the threshold amount of saturated fat needed to lower insulin sensitivity. Once I find this out, I could g!
 ive a 
definitive answer about soy protein.  <b>Well-made soy protein can adequately supply your amino acid needs.  However, it's not an efficient protein</b>, nor does it have any of the health benefits of whey.
<p>
I've noticed that in endurance sports nutrition, a protein ratio of 40% has become increasingly common.  Should bodybuilders follow suit? Bodybuilders are much pickier with their protein choices.  The higher the quality of protein, the less needed.  In the Isometric Diet, <b>I've recommended a one third protein</b> calorie ratio, assuming that bodybuilders will eat higher quality protein sources. I doubt, though, that a runner would <b>consider getting most of his protein from eggs and whey protein powder</b>, so 40% might be needed.  Of that 40%, some of  the amount will be turned into saturated fats. If a bodybuilder is using high-quality proteins, a protein ratio of 40% is excessive.

<a name="Ketosticks"><b>GURU: I'm following that new anabolic diet by mauro dipasquale.</a>  I check for ketones in my urine with ketosticks.  It shows a slight purple color when I get up in the morning.  But I check later on, and I show no ketones.  What gives?  What am I doing wrong?  Should I use a glucometer instead?</b>
<p>
<b>A: </b>    It would be safe to say that most readers have no idea what you're talking about.  Let me do a fill-in before I delve into your questions.  <b>The Anabolic Diet is a so-called new way of eating with a recommendation of eating mostly fats and protein with little dietary carbohydrate</b>.  Claimed benefits are fat loss and muscle growth at the same time.  The Anabolic Diet package costs $50 and gives you a 120-page booklet, a video, and plastic skin-fold calipers.  <b>The Anabolic Diet is very, very similar to my own BODYOPUS Diet</b>.  Both are seven-day cycles, with five days of eating virtually no carbs and then two days of carbing up.  
<p>
Both systems are based on a much earlier system called the Rebound Training System, created by Michael Zumpano (owner of Champion Nutrition) in 1980.  Michael and I modified this basic system into the <b>Ultimate Dieting Handbook in 1982</b>.  In BODYOPUS, I go into great detail on how the system works, but I will highlight some key points now.  The five (or more) no-carb eating days force the usual dietary and stored fats into something else called ketones.  <b>Ketones are fractured fats that can be used in the place of glucose</b>.  Ketones are a faster energy source than regular fats.  They don't yield the expected nine calories a gram; instead, they yield somewhat less, around seven calories a gram.  Ketosis doesn't normally happen--only when insulin is low and the other hormone in the pancreas, glucagon, is high.  Your blood glucose level has to be around 50 mg/dl for ketone production to happen in significant amounts.  To drop your blood sugar so low (regular blood glu!
 cose is between 80-120), you can't eat carbs for a few days.
<p>
<b>Getting into a short-term ketogenic state does a number of positive things</b>.  You train your metabolism to enhance its fat-burning ability, which gets lazy with a high-carb diet.  Also, as previously mentioned, ketone burning is inefficient, so more grams are burned as compared to non-ketogenic fat burning.  T<b>he really interesting thing about short-term ketogenic diets is the set up for an anabolic rebound growth spurt after the two-day carb-up.</b>  We don't know all the mechanisms for this growth spurt.  However, starving the body of carbs instills a temporary rise in muscle insulin acceptance.  The extra glycogen, fluids, and electrolytes will make the muscle cell bigger, and the increased mechanical leverage will make you stronger.  When you ramjet the muscle cells with more volume, you get an anabolic stimulus from the stretching of the cell.
<p>
About your particular problems: <b>once fats are converted into ketones, they have to be used as fuel</b> or eliminated.  You can't store ketones.  Your body can't reconvert ketones back into fats.  The route for elimination is through the kidneys and into the urine.  Remember, ketones in the urine are whole, unburned ketones.  <b>Ketosticks are small plastic and paper testing strips, </b>about the length of a Q-tip.  You allow your urine stream to wash over the paper end of the strip, and if there are ketones in the urine, the paper will turn from the normal tan color into a purplish color.  The deeper the purple color, the more ketones in the urine.  Your problem is that during the day, you don't get a purple reading on the ketosticks.  Does this mean you're eating too many carbs and not getting into ketosis?
<p>
<b>During the time you're sleeping, the liver is still converting fats into ketones</b>.  But since you have little energy requirements during sleep, these ketones are not needed for fuel.  They have to be eliminated.  When you wake up in the morning, your first urination will have unused ketones, and you will get a light purple color, assuming you haven't been eating any carbs for about 48 hours.  When you become active, the ketones will be used as fuel.  Between usual activities and exercise, most people in a ketogenic state won't show purple on the ketosticks, especially when on a low-calorie diet.  Most of the ketones will be used as fuel, with hardly any unused ketones left for excretion.  If you're eating a lot of calories, above maintenance, then you might get a purple reading during the day.  But BODYOPUS  is a weight-loss diet, so calories are at maintenance or below.  If you're trying the Anabolic Diet or BODYOPUS for fat loss and get a purple reading during the!
  day</
b>, you should either reduce calories or increase activity, so you won't have extra unused ketones.  Final advice on ketosticks: after 48 hours (in BODYOPUS, I give you tricks to lessen the time needed to start ketosis), you should be getting a light purple color on the ketosticks on the first morning urination only.  During the day, the ketosticks will show tan because most of the ketones are being used as fuel.
<p>
You want to buy a glucometer to check for your blood sugar levels?  Normal blood glucose is between 80 milligrams and 120 milligrams per deciliter of blood.  Glucagon secretion happens in significant amounts when your blood glucose falls to 50 mg/dl. <b>At first glance, it seems  a glucometer could be a good idea.  Glucometers use small testing strips like ketosticks,</b> but you have to prick your finger and put a drop of blood on one end of the strip; blot the excess blood off; stick the testing strip into the hand-hold glucometer; and the device will read the color of the strip and display the blood glucose level.
<p>
<b>Glucometers are used by diabetics to gauge how much insulin is needed to regulate blood glucose.  Usually, diabetics run blood glucose too high</b>, sometimes above 300 mg/dl. The problem with glucometers is all of them have an inaccuracy of up to 30 milligrams.  If you're a diabetic and you're estimating how much insulin to inject to lower blood glucose from 280 down to 150, then 30 points off is not that big of a deal.  However, if a non-diabetic individual is trying to plummet to 50 to establish ketosis, then 30 points is significant. Time and time again, BO<b>DYOPUS dieters tell me their blood glucose is "stuck" at 60ish, and they can't make it any lower</b>.  The actuality is that many times the blood glucose is below 60, only the glucometer reading is off.  It doesn't mean the glucometer is broken.  If you read the instruction manuals, all glucometers state that accuracy can be off by 30 points.
<p>
<b>You'll never get a dead-on accurate reading of blood glucose with the hand-held glucometers.</b>  If you take a glucose reading early in the morning at the same time as the ketostick reading, many times you'll find a purple color on the ketosticks and a glucose level in the 60's.  Obviously, you're manufacturing ketones, and your glucometer reading is off.

<a name="Dianabol"><b>GURU: I was steroid shopping </a>in Tijuana and found some small blue bottles of methandrostenolone made by Ludwig Heun in West Germany (at least, that's what the bottle said).  Is this stuff real?</b>
<p>
<b>A:  No. It's counterfeit.  I happen to know the entire history of this counterfeit because I  designed the bottle, label, and tablets.</b>  
<p>
Starting in 1985, I worked closely with a Tijuana pharmaceutical manufacturing company called Laboratory Milano.  <b>For many years, Laboratory Milano produced generic medications, primarily antibiotics, for Mexican drugstores.</b> The laboratory was named Milano because the owner, Juan Machlis, purchased all of the raw materials through a procurement company based in Milano, Italy.  Whenever a drug was needed, the procurement company would find a source of it and usually charge between 10% to 15% over wholesale cost.
<p>
When brand-name Dianabol and generic methandrostenolone were removed from the American market, several companies began making counterfeit versions, but all of them had problems.  Some of the pills were so poorly made and so loosely held together that you could use them as blackboard writing chalk.  Others were good but elusive, i.e., hard to find.  
<p>
About the same time,<b> an Indian crime family based in England began repackaging the Indian Pronabol 5 (methandrostenolone) tablets into small white bottles and labeled them as if the product were from Ludwig Heun GmbH KG, West Germany</b>.  This was a very nice product, and I remember going to various hotel rooms near the Los Angeles airport to buy thousands of bottles  from a bearded, turbaned old gentleman who looked like a diplomat. But as nice as the product was, I could never depend on consistent shipments.
<p>
<b>So I persuaded Laboratory Milano to manufacture methandrostenolone to my specifications</b>.  I designed a tiny light blue bottle with a white metal cap.  I supplied the Indian/English Ludwig Heun bottle label so Milano could copy it.  I picked this label for two reasons:  1) On the black market, the brand had established itself as a good, reliable product, and  2) I wanted to avoid any ties or references to Mexican manufacture simply because, at the time, most steroid users distrusted any Mexican steroid product. The unfounded assertion was that the Mexican drugs were not as potent as the European versions.  Besides, <b>calling it "Duchainabol</b>" was out of the question. 
<p>
Methandrostenolone was the first steroid produced by Laboratory Milano, and w<b>e made sure each tablet always contained at least six milligrams of the steroid</b>.  The cost for the raw materials and packaging was only $0.50 per unit, but we sold it for $4.50.  After that, <b>we made counterfeit versions (always with real steroids in them) of Lemmon testosterone cypionate and Lemmon nandrolone decanoate</b>. This was a screw up on my part because testosterone cypionate and nandrolone decanoate were never made by Lemmon.  I unknowingly had bought counterfeit steroids to duplicate!  
<p>
The original source of our methandrostenolone was from Germany.  W<b>e also purchased oxandrolone from Searle in England</b>.  This was ironic because Laboratory Milano and I duplicated the Searle Anavar exactly (the tablet mold cost us $10,000) and sold it for half the cost of what Searle sold it for wholesale to pharmacies. <b>Searle became so frustrated over this (we sold the counterfeit Anavar to American pharmacies) that the Anavar bottle size was doubled to differentiate between ours and theirs</b>.  
<p>
All the steroid tablets were smuggled in bulk across the border and dropped off at various motel rooms around San Diego. The bottles and labels were made in Tijuana and legally exported to America.  Mexican women would count tablets, load them into the bottles, and box them in packages of 100.
<p>
I stopped working with Laboratory Milano in the fall of 1986.  From that point on, the company cranked up production and flooded the American black market.  <b>Just before the arrest of the major "players" (myself included), Laboratory Milano produced some unusual products which I had designed</b>.  One was a methandrostenolone with a diuretic and liver antitoxin added. Others included very powerful injectable versions of oxandrolone and oxymetholone.  I can honestly say that these two exotic injectables are the most potent steroids I have ever used.
<p>
Since the breakup and prosecution of the Laboratory Milano conspiracy, the company has ceased all operations.  Nevertheless, <b>some of the former employees still have the ability to produce the various bottles, labels, and tablets of the various steroids</b>.  However, none of these current counterfeits have any steroid in them, the Ludwig Heun version included.  So if you see any European steroid being sold in a Mexican pharmacy, it's a counterfeit with no active steroid ingredients.

<a name="Clenbuterol long term"><b>GURU: Whenever I use clenbuterol,</a> it works great for about two weeks.  After that, I can use ten tabs a day and my temperature will hardly rise.  What can I do about this?</b>
<p>
<b>A: </b>Clenbuterol is a beta-2 agonist. It attaches to the same receptor as your natural adrenaline and noradrenaline do.  It has a very high bonding capacity to the adrenergic receptor.  Whenever a drug fits well onto a cell receptor, the receptor becomes resistant to that drug.  For example, <b>the thermogenic effect of ephedrine seems to have a longer duration (though it's not as potent)</b> for two reasons:  1) ephedrine doesn't have a high receptor affinity, and 2) ephedrine is not beta-2 specific.  
<p>
You might have heard about the newly discovered beta-3 receptors. The receptor is primarily a thermogenic messenger, and <b>over half the thermogenic effect from ephedrine is from beta-3 stimulation</b>.  Although the thermogenic message is not as intense as the beta-2 message, beta-3 receptors are very resistant to down-regulation.  Clenbuterol, however, has very little beta-3 stimulation.
<p>
Until some new synthetic beta-3 agonist is commercially available, <b>the beta agonist of choice is still clenbuterol</b> (although the stronger cimaterol is available as a research chemical in the U.S.).  The rapid <b>receptor sensitivity attenuation happens to all users</b>, and the various dosage schemes (i.e., two days on, two days off) just aren't successful.  
<p>
This attenuation and the lowering of above-normal body temperature are governed by two different mechanisms.  I've written about one of them before: the shunting of T4 thyroid away from the active T3 form into the ineffective reverse-T3.  Most of the thyroid in the body is the inactive T4 type.  The active thyroid that actually fits onto thyroid receptors is a reduced T4, and reduced T4 occurs when one of the iodine atoms is cleaved off the molecule by a specific enzyme (deiodinase).  Since we have no way of stopping the T4 from being transformed into ineffective reverse-T3 instead of the active T3, and there's no such thing as injectable deiodinase (which would prevent the reduction), the best approach is to supplement the missing T3 with Cytomel, a synthetic T3.  
<p>
The trouble is, <b>it's likely a daily amount of Cytomel higher than 25 mcg would eventually stop the production of natural thyroid stimulating hormone</b> (TSH), and the up-regulation will take about 8 weeks. Then, when you go off Cytomel, your body's still laggin' in production of TSH.  So now you know why almost everybody who stops taking thyroid (with the exception of the drug Triacana) gets fat.  For eight weeks, the body doesn't need as many calories.
<p>
Up to this point, the Cytomel trick was only a partial solution.  The second and major decrease of body temperature is caused by the down-regulation of the beta-2 receptor.  The receptor actually is still in the cell but not in its usual place.  The receptor must be at the outside of the cell surface to be available to the beta agonist.  T<b>here is research showing that the antihistamine ketotifen (trade name Zaditen by Sandoz) in large dosages will up-regulate the beta-2 receptors</b>.  This is similar to the American Periactin (cyproheptadine).  This class of antihistamine will cause drowsiness, hunger, and irritability, but you may think the negative symptoms are a small price to play. 
<p>
Here are the particulars.  Zaditen is only available in France in 1-mg capsules, 60 capsules to a box.  It sells for 65.10 francs (about $12.25).  Because of its appetite-stimulating and muscle-building properties, <b>Zaditen is sold through some of the American AIDS buying clubs</b>.  The average price for it in America is $40 a box.  The dose needed for the up-regulation of the beta-2 receptors is about 10 capsules (10 mg)--assuming you've been using 3 clenbuterol tablets (60 mcg) each day.  Sigma Chemicals, the company that has all the bodybuilding goodies that we like but can't buy (including steroids), does sell ketotifen (the fumarate version is water soluble) in raw bulk form.  Keep in mind that even when used with clenbuterol, which both reduces appetite and is more of a stimulant than caffeine, <b>Zaditen will still cause sleepiness and hunger.  Those aren't nice effects, especially if you're dieting</b>.
<p>
Your final solution to sustain clenbuterol's action is to use both Cytomel (25 mcg) and Zaditen (10 mg) each day after using clenbuterol by itself for 2 weeks.  <b>You'll need only 60 mcg of clenbuterol for a very pronounced thermogenic effect, hypothetically speaking, of course.</b>

<a name="Carbs Protein"><b>GURU: A few months back,</a> I read that I should eat protein with each carb meal when I carb up for my contest.  Why is this?  Is there a particular protein that would be better to use than others?</b>
<p>
<b>A: </b> Between the small intestine and the liver, <b>all proteins are reduced to individual amino acids</b>.  And each amino has the ability to cause both insulin and glucagon secretion from the pancreas.  Glucagon is insulin's evil twin: it's considered a catabolic hormone.  However, glucagon secretion doesn't happen in large amounts until blood glucose falls to about 50 mg per decaliter (one tenth of a liter).  Unlike insulin, which circulates in the blood, the small amount of glucagon secreted from amino acids stays mostly in the liver. Glucagon's job in the liver is to speed the release of glycogen.  Glycogen is a complex starch.  The same type of glycogen stored in the liver is also stored in skeletal muscle.  Glucagon sends the message to the liver to reconvert glycogen back to glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. 
<p>
<b>The reason why eating protein along with carbohydrates causes more muscle glycogen deposition is because the extra insulin (although insulin secretion from amino acids is small compared to a glucose response) is available in the bloodstream, and the glucagon pushes glucose out of the liver into the bloodstream.</b>
<p>
<b>It might be more efficient to use an isolated amino acid with a carbohydrate meal to "push" blood glucose</b> into muscle cells.  Not all amino acids have the same ability to generate insulin and glucagon. In looking over the scientific research, you'll find that the amino acid glycine elicits the highest secretion of both insulin and glucagon. The branched-chain amino acids elicit very little glucagon secretion, although the BCAA's (especially leucine) are good for boosting insulin.  
<p>
Now that we know about the nice glucagon pulse caused by glycine, you might see some nutrition company make an alpha-ketoglutarate variant with glycine (rather than ornithine).

<a name="45 Year old"><b>Guru: I'm 45 years old</a>, and I'm on testosterone replacement for low natural levels of testosterone--around 300-350 ng/dl.  My doctor has prescribed testosterone cypionate (100 mg per week), and this has brought my testosterone level up to around 600 ng/dl.  Should I switch over to your recommendation of Deca-Durabolin?  Is the use of Deca-Durabolin instead of testosterone for this purpose a documented and accepted practice?  One more thing: I'm using 21-gauge needles.  Should I try to go to something thinner to minimize scarring?</b>
<p>
<b>A: </b>  First off, <b>it's nice to see you've found a liberal doctor.  Most M.D.'s won't consider prescribing testosterone until they see your blood level of testosterone drop below 300 ng/dl</b>.  You appear to have an unusual metabolism.  Most males of your age would not realize such a high testosterone elevation on only 100 mg a week.  Usually a weekly 100-mg injection of testosterone would raise blood levels 100 ng/dl, at the most.  <b>What usually happens is that as males age, the ability to convert testosterone to estrogen (with aromatase enzyme) increases</b>.  The extra testosterone injected will more readily convert to estrogen and, at the same time, down-regulate the small amount of natural testosterone being produced.  I have a strong feeling that your particular metabolism doesn't manufacture very much aromatase, so the small amount of exogenous testosterone you're using has better potential, as much of it stays as testosterone and doesn't down-regulate your !
 own supply.  
<p>
Since your injected dose is quite small (only half of what the World Health Organization is recommending for FSH [follicle-stimulating hormone] down-regulation), <b>I can't see any real benefit for you to switch over to Deca-Durabolin</b>.  <b>Although the nandrolones have a higher androgen-receptor-binding ability than testosterone, the anabolic effect is not equal, so you might have to raise the weekly dosage to about 200 mg to equal all the positive effects of testosterone cypionate</b>.
<p>
In many other males, <b>more than just 100 mg a week of testosterone is needed to generate an optimal blood level of between 500-600 ng/dl.  At these higher amounts, more testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (which accelerates balding and swells the prostate) and estrogen</b>, which would further down-regulate natural testosterone secretion.  In these situations, when 200 mg or more of injected testosterone is needed each week, Deca-Durabolin is a nice option, as the DHN (dihydronandrolone) variant has a lesser affinity to receptors at the prostate and hair follicles.  The nandrolones also don't convert as readily to estrogen (although it's not markedly different from testosterone).
<p>
Now that we know the various mechanisms of the enzyme conversions of testosterone, an enlightened M.D. could also <b>prescribe both Proscar (using only a quarter of a tablet) and Nolvadex (10 mg) daily</b> and would see both a higher blood level of testosterone and a significantly smaller testosterone dosage.  I've reluctantly recommended Nolvadex (the most popular anti-estrogen) simply because most M.D.'s won't believe how Cytadren (at 250 mg a day) would work better for this purpose.  Of course, the upcoming supplement "Flavone X" could work for the same purpose.  However, if you're counting dollars, using Deca-Durabolin would be cheaper than using the combination of testosterone, Proscar, and Nolvadex.  <b>Too bad Primobolan Depot is not approved for use in the U.S.  It could be a perfect testosterone replacement as it has absolutely no conversion to either estrogen or DHT</b>.  You might have heard of a new androgen replacement called MECE.  It's very androgenic, so much!
  so, only micrograms are needed each day.  This steroid is simply a non-17 alkylated version of the veterinary Checque Drops (mibolerone).  I find it hard to believe that research
ers are taking this steroid seriously, as mibolerone is a potent progesterone agonist, binding to progesterone receptors and imparting progesterone actions (including sensitizing breast tissue).
<p>
<b>Deca-Durabolin, as great as it is, is not mentioned in the literature as a testosterone replacement for middle-aged men.</b>  It's recommended for women with systemic lupus (and there is published research on this).  The only drawback in using Deca-Durabolin for an androgen replacement is that with extremely low natural testosterone levels (less than 150 ng/dl), there might not be enough androgen action to reestablish libido.  In my case, my blood testosterone level is 370 ng/dl, and I have more than adequate libido.  I would choose Deca-Durabolin over a testosterone: <b>my hairline is borderline, so why tempt fate?</b>
<p>
As to your inquiry about needle gauges, yes, repeated weekly injections with a 21-gauge needle will eventually generate more scar tissue than a smaller needle would.  Realistically (and I've tried all the gauges), <b>the smallest gauge needle you can actually use to self-administer is a 23 gauge</b> (I prefer the 1 inch length).  But don't be surprised when your weekly shot takes 2-3 minutes to push the plunger all the way down.

<a name="appetite loss"><b>Guru:  Over the summer, I purchased</a> a few hundred tablets of metformin from a European mail-order company.  I started 2,000 mg/day (one 500-mg tab with meals 4 times a day) and experienced a severe loss of appetite.  After ten days, I ceased using the drug because I began to lose weight (muscle) and strength as a result of the lower calorie intake.  Do you have any thoughts on this?</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> I've gotten the same reports from other bodybuilders who comment on this loss of appetite.  At least you got the dosage right. Most non-diabetics who use Glucophage (the American version of metformin) have been cautious with dosages and haven't felt any beneficial effects.  
<p>
<b>The conundrum is this: bringing the dosage up high enough (between 1,700 and 2,000 mg) generates better glycogen storage and a workout pump, but the loss of appetite makes it difficult to eat enough food.  This </b>food apathy is caused by metformin's slowing of gastric emptying.  Such an effect would be nice to have while you're on a low-calorie diet.  But on a maintenance or hyper-calorie diet, metformin would be a problem.
<p>
The simple solution is to make sure you eat calorie-dense foods.  If there is any complaint (and it seems to be a very minor one) with the moderate to high-fat diets (whether it be Isometric or Zone based), it usually is that the increase of dietary fat means less food to eat.  This is the one instance where peanut butter is a guilt-free solution.  <b>So it seems logical that metformin and moderate-fat diets would compliment each other</b>.  Hunger from eating less carbohydrates is eliminated because of the slow release from the stomach (and from the small intestine, too), and the reduced carbohydrates will be prioritized for glycogen storage.  The dietary fat is calorie dense.  
<p>
If you're following a high-carb diet and won't consider switching to denser foods, the traditional approach for stimulating the appetite for athletes is the prescription antihistamine Periactin.  Unfortunately, Periactin causes lethargy and irritability.
<p>
<b>If none of the above solutions suit you, only use metformin when you're on a low-calorie diet.  If you lower the dosage enough, your appetite will not be affected, but at the reduced dosage, the insulin sensitivity enhancement will be negligible.</b>

But all my body parts are toasted! So what's the deal?</b>
<p>

<b>A:</b> The damnedest things make you sore.  If you simply did 12 concentric reps without the eccentrics, you probably would have been sore, too.  You haven't specified how many sets for each exercise you were doing with your Heavy-Duty routine.  <b>Most Heavy-Duty advocates don't actually do just "one set to failure": they do numerous warm-up sets beforehand</b>.  Although it appears the new extra sets and reps were overly traumatic for you, you'll find that your body will quickly acclimate to the extra work and stop perceiving it as trauma.  But some individuals are not suited for full-blown Body-Contact Workouts from the get-go, and I recommend easing into the system slowly.  <b>The first week, do only 12 concentric reps.  The second week, add the negatives at the same weight you used for the concentrics.  During the third week, on one set, use the 85% 1RM negatives.

<A HREF=#A1><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A>	I've been reading about this Craig Titus controversy in all the muscle magazines.  First, he got busted for peddling dope, and then he didn't.  Then he was a DEA informant, and then he wasn't.  Then he wants to fight everybody, including you.  In case you didn't see his recent interview in <I>MuscleMag International</I>, he says, "...I tried to call him [Bill Phillips], but he hid behind his fax machine and wouldn't even talk to me man to man.  His secretary kept telling me to fax him... I really can't wait to meet Phillips in person... I won't be hiding behind a fax machine..."  Wow!  What are you going to do?<P>
<A HREF=#A2><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I recently read a newspaper article that said the supplement chromium causes cancer.  I've been using this stuff for a couple of years, and now I'm worried that I might have done myself more harm than good.  Do you know how strong the link is between chromium and cancer?<P>
<A HREF=#A3><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I love your magazine, love bodybuilding, and love those fitness girls!  I heard that one of my favorite fitness models, Laurie Donnelly, recently moved in with you!  Did she bring her boyfriend, professional bodybuilder Lee Priest?  How can I meet one of these beautiful fitness stars?<P>
<A HREF=#A4><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> A friend of mine works at a pharmacy, and he said he can help me get a steroid called Medrol.  He said it works kind of like Anadrol, but I haven't been able to find any more information about this drug.  Is this a good steroid to take?
<P>
<A HREF=#A5><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I see you're now promoting a product called Myoplex Plus( instead of ------ [product name deleted].  I also noticed that you didn't mention ------ in your new <I>1996 Supplement Review</I>.  You used to say this product was very good, and now you don't even mention it--you just refer to it as the "leading brand."  What's up with that, and what's so special about Myoplex Plus?<P>
<A HREF=#A6><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I take small amounts of the anabolic steroid Primobolan Depot or Deca off and on between "cycles."  For example, during an off-cycle period of four months, I usually take a single 50-mg shot of Deca every 2 weeks and occasionally take 50 mg of Primobolan Depot.  Is this a bad idea?<P>
<A HREF=#A7><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I recently read about a study where researchers examined the effects of Deca-Durabolin and testosterone enanthate and found that neither drug had any effect on accelerating fat loss.  The same study showed that when people used Deca, their muscles got smaller, and when they used oxandrolone (brand name Anavar), their muscles got bigger.  I thought you said Deca was better than Anavar.  Does Deca work or doesn't it?<P>
<A HREF=#A8><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I understand that one of the ways to get better results from using creatine monohydrate is to take it along with a simple carbohydrate (like grape juice or dextrose), especially right after a workout.  I was wondering if it would be okay to add creatine monohydrate to my post-workout meal which contains 35% protein, 45% carbs, and 20% fat, with about 500 calories.  Will I lose the "insulin spike" effect that may help more creatine get shuttled into muscle cells if I take it with this meal?<P>
<A HREF=#A9><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I heard that there is a new fat-burning drug coming out that's a beta-3 agonist.  I heard it will really help burn off fat without increasing heart rate or blood pressure (side effects which I get from using things like ephedrine and clenbuterol).  Do you know when this drug is coming out?<P>
<A HREF=#A10><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've read some good things about a supplement called Cort-Bloc.  It's that "anti-catabolic" supplement <I>Ironman</I>magazine is pushing.  Is it good stuff?<P>
<A HREF=#A11><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I read about Dan Duchaine's Body-Contract Workout in the last issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> [February, 1996], and it looks like a great training routine.  I've also been reading Mike Mentzer's books, and they seem to make sense, too.  And, your brother Shawn has some pretty good ideas on training, and so does Charles Poliquin.  But, everyone is saying something different.  I don't know exactly what I should be doing in the gym--I can't figure out how many sets and reps to do or how much weight to use or whether I should go slow, fast, or what!  Can you offer any input that would help me decide who's right and who's wrong?<P>
<A HREF=#A12><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I read on the Internet that you deliberately "lost" the bench-press contest you recently set up so you would look like a "good guy."  I heard you can really press your body weight 50 times.  What are you up to?<P>
<A HREF=#A13><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I recently did a little "shopping" in Mexico and picked up a steroid called Maxigan. My only problem is, I couldn't understand what the hell the Spanish-speaking gentleman who sold this stuff to me was saying--what is it?<P>
<A HREF=#A14><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I read a short article in <I>Muscular Development</I> about HMB--one of their writers named Brian Leibovitz pretty much said HMB is "nothing special."  I thought this stuff really worked--does this Leibovitz guy know what he's talking about?<P>
<A HREF=#A15><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> Coach Poliquin and others (including Dan Duchaine) have recommended higher doses of creatine monohydrate than are recommended on the label.  For example, Coach Poliquin recommends about 40 grams a day for 7 days for a loading phase and then 20 grams a day for a maintenance dose.  Do you think I'll get better results if I take this much?<P>

<A NAME="A1"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I haven't really followed this whole "ordeal," so I don't know everything about it.  But, here's what I do know:  apparently Craig ran into some kind of trouble with the law regarding a drug called "Ecstasy" (to tell you the truth, I'm not even exactly sure what that stuff is, but I hear it's kind of like cocaine).  Then, apparently, he ran into a little steroid trouble.  Then, he got into a little "tiff" with some guy at the DEA, and then this law enforcement agent started calling magazines, including ours, to give the details about what happened to Titus.</P>
<P>	Anyway, our Editor-in-Chief, T.C. Luoma, conducted an interview with Titus and the DEA agent and ran it in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, thinking it would be of interest to our readers.  Now, after this story came out, it created so much controversy that Titus got a cover on <I>Muscular Development</I>, a cover on <I>MuscleMag</I>, and huge interviews in both magazines.</P>
<P>	If Craig thinks about how this whole thing has "played out," he'll see it's worked in his favor.  In this case, I think that old saying "all publicity is good publicity" is true. Something that initially made Titus look bad has, in turn, made him one of the most well-known bodybuilders around!</P>
<P>	I wish I knew more about the details of what went on, but to be honest, I just don't have time to keep track of all this stuff.  In all fairness to Craig, he probably does deserve the "benefit of the doubt."  And even if he did get busted on drug charges (steroids and/or Ecstasy), that has never hurt the "image" of a competitive bodybuilder before as far as I know.  Arnold Schwarzenegger has admitted numerous times that he used steroids, and look at him--he's one of the most famous and powerful people in the world!</P>
<P>	It's kind of crazy, but our little "industry" is one of the only "arenas" you could write "got busted for taking (or selling) steroids" on your resume!  Look at Dan Duchaine--I have a tremendous amount of respect for this man and so do thousands and thousands of bodybuilders, and he's a two-time convicted felon!</P>
<P>	As for Craig's pretty "unambiguous" threat towards me, he mentioned that he "can't wait to meet me." That's fine with me; in fact, I'll pay for Craig to come to my offices in Golden and meet with me anytime.  I'll take care of the airfare, transportation from the airport to my office, and a hotel room if necessary.</P>
<P>	As far as "hiding behind a fax machine," Craig probably just doesn't understand the way I'm forced to communicate.  Here's the deal on that--I've pretty much come to accept the fact that I am not as smart as many people--I have to try really hard--I mean really, really hard to do what I do. Putting this magazine together, managing the 80 employees that run my distribution companies, and keeping my book projects moving forward takes a lot of concentration.  Sometimes I have to work really weird hours--I'll come in to work at four in the afternoon and stay until two o'clock in the morning.  Other times, I'm so "frazzled" by all of the confusion and commotion that goes hand in hand with putting a magazine together, I virtually have to force myself into isolation to get anything done!</P>
<P>	Bottom line--if you want to get a hold of me, faxing is almost the only way--just ask any of my friends, business colleagues, even my mother!  Whenever they want to communicate with me, they light up the fax.</P>
<P>	Anyway, if I were Craig's "publicist," I'd try to keep this controversy going for a few more months to really "milk it."  In the long run, he's going to come out ahead--he'll have more fans; he'll be well recognized by the tens of thousands of people who read these bodybuilding magazines; and, guilty or not (for whatever he's been charged with), bodybuilding fans are going to judge him by his physique more than anything else.</P>
<P>	Now, I want to apologize to all my readers who don't give a rat's ass about this type of "gossip."  I'm sure you'll be glad we're now moving on to more relevant topics...</P>

<A NAME="A2"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> Don't get too worried.  I am not at all convinced there is a strong link between the use of supplemental chromium and cancer.	And, you need to understand that when we say "chromium," we're not talking about all types of this supplement--the "buzz" about chromium and cancer specifically involves chromium picolinate.</P>
<P>	Recent stories in <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>USA Today</I>, <I>CNN</I>, and other national news media, reported that chromium may cause chromosome damage.  The reports, based on a new study out of Dartmouth College, have caused a lot of people, like you, to become concerned about the overall safety of chromium supplements.</P>
<P>	The natural products industry was quick to respond to the news stories, which failed to report one critical detail of the study--other types of chromium supplements tested did not cause any harm!</P>
<P>	The Council for Responsible Nutrition and Dr. Richard Anderson, a chromium expert for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, were quoted in the news as saying that the "levels [of chromium picolinate] which induced chromosome damage in the Dartmouth study were not reasonable based upon physiological levels."</P>
<P>	Dr. Harry Preuss, a professor of medicine and chromium expert at Georgetown University Medical Center, told news reporters that "the study showed that chromium itself is nontoxic... like copper, zinc, and iron, chromium is a natural element that is found in many foods."</P>
<P>	A lot more research needs to be done to establish whether or not chromium picolinate really does have the potential to harm the body and, if so, at what dose?</P>
<P>	I find it interesting that well before any of this news about chromium picolinate came out, the Research Director at Experimental and Applied Science (EAS) and a good friend of mine, Anthony Almada, insisted on not putting chromium picolinate in any of the EAS formulas.  Phosphagain<SUP><FONT SIZE=1> tm</FONT></SUP>, Phosphagain II<SUP><FONT SIZE=1> tm</FONT></SUP>, and Myoplex Plus<SUP><FONT SIZE=1> tm</FONT></SUP>; all contain chromium citrate.  Remember, only chromium picolinate is suspected to have any adverse effects on chromosomes.  Maybe Anthony knows something the other researchers don't--I guess that's why he is often one step ahead of the rest of us!</P>
<A NAME="A3"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> Oh my... I'm going to end up turning this "Q&A" section into a gossip column yet! Somewhere, someone must have written something about Laurie Donnelly moving in with me because I'm being asked about it every day! I don't date Laurie Donnelly--my brother, Shawn, does! I still go out with beautiful swimwear/fashion model, Ami Cusack.<P> I'm not exactly sure what happened to Lee Priest, but I know he ain't hangin' out with Laurie and Shawn--they only live a block away from me, and I haven't seen that muscular dude runnin' around in my neighborhood!<P> I'm not exactly sure where you can meet your own "fitness Betty"--Shawn met Laurie while she was doing a photo shoot for <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> with USA bodybuilding champion Joe Lazzaro out here in Colorado last July. Okay... enough gossip for now.</P>

<A NAME="A4"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> Medrol is definitely not a steroid you would want to use if you're trying to build muscle.  It's not an anabolic steroid; it's a catabolic steroid.  Medrol contains methyl prednisolone, which is a synthetic hormone with properties similar to your body's own cortisol.  This drug is typically prescribed for connective tissue diseases and conditions involving immune reactions, including autoimmune disorders.</P>
<P>	In bodybuilding, when we say "steroids," we often assume everyone knows what we're talking about.  But, there are different types of steroid medications available.  Some are the anabolic/androgenic steroids like bodybuilders take, and others are catabolic steroids like Medrol.  Whereas anabolic steroids help build up muscle tissue, catabolic steroids actually break it down. This seems "elementary," but a lot of people just don't have any knowledge at all about steroids--including many people who use the drugs. Be sure to throw in the key word "anabolic" when you describe what kind of steroids you want your buddy to try to get for you.</P>
<A NAME="A5"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I wish I had a dollar for every time I've been asked this question over the last six weeks! This is a difficult question to answer because it involves a complicated game of legal semantics.  Suffice it to say I won't be using the name of that product ever again in this magazine nor anywhere else.  You might think that means that something "unsavory" comes into play here, but that's not the case. The supplement we all know I'm talking about (let's just call it Product X) is and always has been an excellent product.</P>
	I've been out of the "Product X business" for over a year--here's the story on that:  I  introduced Product X to bodybuilders in 1991, and the stuff just took off like crazy!  My company helped distribute the product for quite a while, but eventually, the demand just outgrew my operation here in Golden, so everyone involved agreed it would be best to turn the distribution of that product over to a California corporation that could take the product "mainstream."  So, that's what we did, and everything has worked out very well.<P>
	Basically, what I wanted to do was take the resources my company has and try to focus on making this magazine better and come out with the best bodybuilding supplements available.<P>
	The company behind Product X has much greater aspirations than I--they want to distribute the product to virtually all people everywhere--they already have the product in hundreds of grocery stores, discount stores like Target, and so on. They're doing a great job--much better than I could do.<P>
	Anyway, EAS recently came out with a supplement that was obviously "inspired" by Product X.  EAS' new total nutrition product is called Myoplex Plus.  Of course, you might think the only reason I recently switched from Product X to Myoplex Plus is because I now sell Myoplex Plus and not Product X.  I'm honest and admit that's one reason, but it's certainly not the only reason.  I really do think Myoplex Plus is an outstanding supplement--especially for bodybuilders.<P>
	Myoplex Plus has 42 grams of protein per serving, and the number one ingredient in it is ion-exchange whey-protein concentrate--a protein source numerous experts believe is the best protein source available to bodybuilders today.<P>
	Myoplex Plus also has a number of ingredients in it that some experts believe support the body's ability to build muscle and lose fat--things like alpha-ketoglutarate, taurine, arginine, borage oil, and hydroxy citric acid (HCA).  These things are not added to Product X.<P>
	And, unlike some of the other "high-tech" super foods that have come out over the past year, Myoplex Plus tastes absolutely delicious; it's easy to mix; and it's very easy on the stomach!<P>
	And, Myoplex Plus is really fairly priced--it's not the least expensive product in this category, but it's certainly affordable--especially when you consider it's a protein supplement, a vitamin and mineral supplement, a key amino acid supplement, and a total nutrition "meal-replacement" product all in one!<P>
	Anyway, I've been using Myoplex Plus for two months now, and I like it better than <I>any</I> other "powder" I've ever tried!<P>
	The research scientists at EAS designed Myoplex Plus especially for weight trainers and serious bodybuilders.  It's got "bells and whistles" that your average "fitness" consumer just doesn't need.  For example, I don't think people who consider a workout to be 30 minutes on the stationary bicycle need the nutrient "reinforcement" that bodybuilders need. These "recreational" fitness buffs probably just don't need the extra amino acids and other unique nutrients found in Myoplex Plus.<P>There's no doubt about it--Myoplex Plus was designed with one particular market in mind--bodybuilders and serious weight trainers.  You know as well as I do that trying to build more muscle while losing bodyfat is very difficult--I'm always looking for any and every advantage I can get!<P>
	Ironically, even though Product X was introduced originally to bodybuilders through a bodybuilding publication, I'm quite certain that most of the people out there who are using that product now are what you would call "mainstream" fitness buffs--there are probably one hundred million people who are "kind of" into fitness in the United States and probably only one hundred thousand who are really serious about bodybuilding.  Obviously, the bodybuilding market is a mere "speck" compared to the big, mainstream fitness population.<P>	As far as I'm concerned, those people who are not serious about weight training wouldn't even need a product like Myoplex Plus--Product X is "good enough" for them.<P>
	The reason I'm explaining all of this is because I just want to be very straightforward--I don't think people who aren't very serious about bodybuilding should even bother trying to figure out whether they should be using Myoplex Plus or not--in my opinion, they shouldn't.  They should stick with Product X or whatever.  However, I highly recommend Myoplex Plus for serious weight trainers because it contains good things Product X doesn't.<P>
	Anyway, I hope this information helps you somewhat--I'm sorry I can't make perfect sense out of this whole legal "name game" for you, but I assure you, it's not worth wasting your time to try to figure it out.<P>
<A NAME="A6"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> It's common for athletes to use a small amount of a mild anabolic steroid between cycles, but I don't know if that makes much sense.  The amount of Primobolan or Deca that you mentioned probably isn't going to do any good from a physiological standpoint, but I realize you may benefit from it in a psychological way. That is, you may feel that you still have an "edge." Nevertheless, the small amount of steroids you take between your cycles probably isn't toxic, but depending on who you ask, it may or may not prevent your body from restoring its natural testosterone production.  There is also the issue of blood cholesterol levels--long-term steroid use may increase cholesterol levels and cause heart disease in some users.
	I know some bodybuilders who started taking steroids and swore they were only going to use them for a few weeks until they developed a certain amount of size and strength.  Well, for many of them, a few weeks became a few months; a few months became a few years; and a few years became a lifetime!<P>
	Those of you who read my books and regularly read this magazine know I'm not convinced that an occasional cycle of steroids poses a significant health risk for most, but I do believe it's a BAD idea to use steroids, at any dosage, continually.<P>
<A NAME="A7"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> The study you're referring to was recently published in the <I>International Journal of Obesity</I>, and it has virtually no relevance for bodybuilders.  They only used a 30-mg dose of Deca every 2 weeks--that's about 1/13th of what I would consider an effective dose.  Plus, these subjects didn't train with weights or anything.<P>
	There's absolutely no questioning whether or not Deca-Durabolin is an effective steroid for building muscle size and strength--it is!  Of course, there are steroids that work better, like Anadrol 50 and Dianabol (methandrostenolone), but those drugs are much more toxic than Deca.<P>
<A NAME="A8"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> Yes, I think you would.  Typically, when you add fat to a meal, it blunts the insulin spike you get from carbs.  Now, most of the time, that's good--stable insulin levels are a positive thing for people who are trying to build muscle and lose fat.  But, when you're trying to purposely spike insulin levels to force more creatine into muscle cells, you should avoid fat at that time. 	Try this--right after you work out, have a serving of Phosphagain<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>; mixed with grape juice or fruit punch of some kind, or have a serving of Phosphagen HP<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>;, or use any other type of creatine monohydrate mixed with grape juice right after you work out.  Then, wait about an hour before you have the post-workout meal you described in your question.<P>
<A NAME="A9"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> Drug companies are trying to develop new pharmaceuticals to treat obesity, and one class of compounds they're exploring is the beta-3 agonists.  The plan is to develop drugs that burn fat without affecting other beta receptors like those which cause an increase in your pulse rate and affect other receptor sites that may cause you to become nervous and jittery. (The effects on heart rate and blood pressure are due to stimulation of beta-1 and beta-2 receptors.)<P>
	They are trying to make a compound that has effects which are so isolated that it will cause an acceleration of fat-burning yet does not have adverse side effects.<P>
	So far, they have had some success, but researchers recently discovered that one beta-3 agonist which they are experimenting with, called BRL-47672, is quickly metabolized in rats (and possibly humans) into a potent stimulator of beta-2 receptors.<P> 
	As far as I can tell, it looks like we shouldn't be expecting a true, ultra-effective beta-3 agonist on the market anytime soon--I'll definitely keep an eye on it and let you know if there are any new developments in this area.<P>
<A NAME="A10"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> Cort-Bloc is a new supplement that contains phosphatidylserine (PS) and melatonin.  Both compounds have been shown in some studies to have an effect on cortisol, and it's hypothesized that these supplements may allow bodybuilders to make better gains faster, but there are no studies that directly confirm this.<P>
	A researcher named Bob Fritz is, to my knowledge, the guy who has "pioneered" the use of PS by bodybuilders.  I've read everything I can get my hands on about this compound, but I'm not quite convinced it will help bodybuilders get bigger and stronger.  I recently <I>faxed</I> Bob Fritz and told him <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> would fund a double-blind, placebo-controlled university study to examine what effects, if any, PS might have on lean mass, bodyfat, or strength.  Hopefully he'll get back to me in the near future--it's been a while since I sent him my offer.  I'll continue to wait patiently for a reply.<P>
	I reviewed Cort-Bloc, and about every other supplement you can think of in my new <I>1996 Supplement Review</I>.  If you don't already have this book, you should definitely check it out--it's a terrific, 100+ page book that's easy to read, easy to understand, very up to date, and full of relevant information!  You can find an ad for that book (which is <A HREF="../nsr/nsr_of.html">free</A>, by the way) on page 21 of the April MM2K.<P>
<A NAME="A11"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> As far as I'm concerned, all of the experts you mentioned are "right."  I've followed Dan's Body-Contract workout, Mentzer's Heavy-Duty workout, as well as my brother's training routine.<P>
	They've all been effective for me--but, they don't work forever.  I'm convinced even the best training program doesn't work indefinitely--you have to mix things up from time to time.<P>
	<P>Your question got me thinking about why I seem to be able to get results from all kinds of training programs when other people can't.  I was thinking maybe it's not so much the training program you follow as how you follow it.  Let me see if I can explain this... There's a "feel" you get when you're working out right.  There's a feeling--a sensation--that tells you the workout you're doing is damaging muscle fibers and stimulating growth.</P>
<P>	It doesn't matter if you're doing a set of five, a set of fifteen, or if you're doing squats or shoulder presses--there's a sensation that you should have that tells you you're getting the job done.</P>
<P>	I'm very familiar with that sensation, but in working with other lifters, I've noticed that some of them don't recognize it--they aren't sure what a good set is--they're not really sure what's going on.</P>
<P>	I think a lot of different training programs work for me because I make sure they all have that "one thing" in common.</P>
<P>	Of all the topics that are confusing in bodybuilding, here's one thing I believe is an absolute certainty--if you don't stress or damage muscle cells during your workout, it doesn't matter how much HMB, creatine, protein powder, etc.  you take; it doesn't matter how much rest you get; it doesn't even matter if you take steroids--you're not going to get bigger and stronger.</P>
<P>	If you're interested in more of my thoughts on this topic and what I think the common thread in many of these routines is, you should read an article I wrote that appears in the magazine called "A Sure Thing in a World of Confusion."  As a matter of fact, read that article twice if you're confused about what type of exercise routine is going to produce results for you--then, follow the advice, and don't ask any more questions about training for six weeks.  Don't hire a personal trainer; don't read any more training articles in any bodybuilding magazines; don't read any more books about bodybuilding exercise--just follow the advice in that article for six weeks.  Then, write (or <I>fax</I>) me and let me know how much that advice helped your workouts.</P>
<P>	Seriously--<I>try this!</I>  I think you'll be extremely surprised at how simple the complex subject of weight training can be if you eliminate all the "fluff" and just try to figure out what it is about lifting weights that makes you bigger and stronger.</P>
<A NAME="A12"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> That's a funny rumor!  I wish I lost "on purpose."
	For those of you who aren't "up" on all this, here's the story: last summer, one of my readers challenged me to a "war of reps" after hearing I had won an impromptu strength contest on last year's <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> Bodybuilding Caribbean Cruise.<P>
	Anyway, we turned this challenge into a promotion for a new EAS product called Phosphagen HP(, and we ended up having 1,254 guys enter this contest.  And the ten strongest (measured by how many times they could bench press their body weight) got an all-expenses-paid trip to our <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> Las Vegas Seminar, November 18 and 19, 1995.<P>  
	At the seminar, we had a "bench off."  The ten finalists went head to head with me as well as each other, and the champion took home $10,000!  (This is the largest cash prize in any bench-press contest ever, as far as I know!)<P>
	The ten finalists that ended up in the Las Vegas contest were all very, very strong!  I knew when I saw them that I had met my match.  These guys had shoulders and pecs on them that just wouldn't quit!<P>
	To make a long story relatively short, I pretty much got my ass kicked around by these guys--but, I was a "good loser" and coughed up the ten grand, fair and square, just like I said I would.<P>
	I ended up learning a lot of things while training for that bench-press contest.  And, all of those flat bench sets to failure really packed some new size on my anterior deltoids and pecs!<P>
	I also learned how complicated "peaking" for a performance event is.  My strength levels were going up and down over the last four months, and I just didn't "peak."<P>
	One of the things that really threw me off was that I had to have major surgery to remove a ruptured salivary gland on the right side of my neck six weeks before the event. Ironically, I blew that salivary gland out last summer, doing my first ever, strict, 400-lb bench.  That was in June of 1994.<P>
	In October of 1994, doctors attempted to repair the salivary gland through a surgical procedure where they went through the bottom of my mouth, but it just didn't "hold."<P>
	I ruptured the gland again while I was training for the Vegas strength contest, and this time, the doctors had to make a four-inch incision in the side of my neck and go in and take that sucker out.  (FYI--the surgery was scheduled for about 50 minutes--it ended up taking about three hours. The doctors said it was one of the toughest procedures they ever did--the "mass" they removed was as big as a tennis ball and was wrapped around every single structure in my neck--not a pretty thought, is it?)<P>
	Anyway, I couldn't work out for three weeks after the surgery, which left me with only three weeks to get my strength back up for the bench-press contest.<P>
	I felt I could do it--I was even hoping that the rest might help my shoulders and elbows recover--they were getting sore because of all the intense training I was doing.<P>
	After being on HMB for a month, right before the surgery, I did a super-clean set of 45 repetitions with 200 lbs. That was a personal record.  A week before that, I set another personal record by doing 225 lbs 31 times.<P>
	But, the day of the bench-press contest in Vegas, the best I could do was 37 clean reps with 200 lbs, which wasn't good enough.<P>
	However, I don't want to take anything away from the guys whom I competed against in the bench-press contest.  Three of them tied at 46 reps, which means they would have kicked my ass, even on my best day--I was just disappointed because I'm always trying to improve myself.<P>
	Right now I'm taking a few weeks off from bench pressing; then I'm going to start "maxing out" again--it's kind of fun to set goals and see if you can reach them.  It makes the workouts more meaningful, which, after training for 15 years, is a definite plus!<P>
	You can read more about our <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> "No Holds Barred" Las Vegas seminar in an article in the magazine on page 84.  It was a lot of fun, and I think most everyone who went learned a great deal--I know I did!<P>
<A NAME="A13"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> You must have been doing your shopping at a veterinary supply shop--Maxigan is an anabolic steroid intended for use in horses.  It's basically the same as Equipoise (boldenone undecylenate).  Maxigan is getting fairly popular with bodybuilders because of its accessibility in Mexico--Ju&aacute;rez, especially.<P>
	And, it's very inexpensive compared to Mexican Deca (which is somewhat similar in effect and toxicity to Maxigan)--it only costs about $100 for 50 ml.<P>
	From what I can tell, 100 to 200 mg a week is what most bodybuilders who are getting good results, with few side effects, are using.<P>
<A NAME="A14"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> Leibovitz is a good guy (a smart guy, too), but that doesn't mean he always knows what he's talking about. As I'm sure you're aware, <I>Muscular Development</I> is Twin Labs' magazine, and I've been informed that Twin Labs has been trying to get a supplier of HMB, but they've been unsuccessful.  Perhaps if they were able to sell HMB under the Twin Lab name, they might change their tune.</P>
<P>	Leibovitz doesn't have access to anywhere near the amount of data I have on HMB--and that's a <I>fact</I>!  I have a mountain of confidential material that has not yet been released to the scientific community--some very convincing evidence that HMB may be a potent stimulator of muscle size and strength.</P>
<P>	And, so far, the preliminary data from two double-blind university studies has demonstrated that people who use HMB and train with weights gain significantly more size and muscle strength than people who don't use HMB and train with weights.</P>
<P>	I often wonder about these guys with their Ph.D.'s... If they know everything about bodybuilding, then how come they don't have great bodies?  I mean, take a look at this Leibovitz guy--my accountant's got more muscle than this dude!  Sure, not everyone can build the type of mass pro bodybuilders have, but c'mon... </P>
<P>	I'd bet a month's pay that Leibovitz has never even tried HMB!  I've used it... <I>I've felt the difference it makes!</I>  There's no way even Einstein could convince me HMB doesn't work!</P>
<P>	It will probably be a long time before the "scientific community" gives HMB its "blessing," but, think about this--bodybuilders knew steroids worked 30 years before the scientific "experts" finally determined people who use steroids gain muscle size and strength faster. <I>Duh!</I></P>
<P>	Anyway, the thing I just can't emphasize enough, regarding my involvement in the promotion of HMB or any supplement, for that matter, is that I put my money where my mouth is. I mean, if you buy HMB, or any supplement or product I help promote, and don't get incredible results--results that are completely satisfying to you--then simply return the used or unused portion of the product for a full refund of your purchase price.  I offer an unconditional, lifetime money-back guarantee on every first-time order of all the products I promote and/or distribute.  That's the best guarantee in the business! <I>What on God's green earth could be more fair than that?</I></P>
<P>Why don't you try calling Twin Labs and see if they'll give you a lifetime money-back guarantee on any of the products they sell?  (Good luck!)</P>
One more thing--if you read the small piece about HMB in the March issue of <I>Muscular Development</I>, you'll notice that Leibovitz lists about a dozen supplements that he says work just as well as HMB. Guess what... Twin Labs just happens to sell all of the supplements Leibovitz recommends!  Go figure...</P>

<P>	In an effort to try to provide a "scientifically valid" answer to this question, EAS is putting up a considerable amount of money to fund more research involving creatine use.  Several studies will attempt to shed light on the "best" dosage of creatine monohydrate.  Hopefully, the results of these studies will be available by the end of 1996--I'll be sure to pass them along in future issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> My gym buddies have convinced me to enter a novice bodybuilding contest.  How many weeks should I diet before the contest?</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>	Competition is a good thing.  Even bowlers and golfers "compete."  I have often mentioned that most weightlifters who call themselves "bodybuilders" will never compete in a contest, but I think more should.  A local bodybuilding show is an excellent opportunity to learn quite a bit about both your mind and body.  Most of us will never have the genetics to become an international champion, but bodybuilding competitions allow you to feel like you're actually in a sport, as opposed to just participating in a hobby.  </P>
<P>	I'd like to see a polygraph-tested amateur contest at next year's <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> "No Holds Barred" Seminar.  The first day would be the contest; the next day, there could be an informal seminar with the winners.</P>
<P>	I encounter many recreational bodybuilders who start training for a contest, usually a novice one, only to "bail out" and quit the contest preparation because of discouraging results. I've done it myself--after encountering a combination of too much muscle loss and sticking points in fat loss.  The novice bodybuilder usually expects some very unrealistic goals from the contest preparation.  The recreational (non-competing) bodybuilder rarely achieves low single-digit bodyfat percentages, so he or she won't encounter metabolic problems generated from prolonged dieting and overtraining.  It would be great if we could all only diet for four weeks (or less) to get into contest-ready shape.  But most of us can't.  Let me show you how to rectify some of the mistakes I made during my pathetic and short-lived competition years.</P>
<P>	The worst mistake is to assume you're going to ipso-facto <I>increase</I> muscle mass and <I>lose</I> bodyfat at the same time, like Franco Columbu used to do.  Granted, some individuals can pull this stunt off, especially with the assistance of some of the various anabolic compounds available, but unless you've executed this trick before, don't assume you can pull this off.  Be conservative, and accept the possibility that after the contest preparation, you'll end up with less muscle mass than you started with.</P>
<P>	I recommend a ten-week contest preparation, broken down into dieting for four weeks, eating normally for two weeks, and resuming dieting for four more weeks.  Through trial and error, I've found that after four weeks of reducing calories, the body will lower your body temperature by impairing the T4 to T3 thyroid conversion. (Your diet is stuck!)  If you continue dieting past this point, you'll have to drop calories even lower than before. And less calories will accelerate muscle loss.  Of course, there are tricks to extend the dieting phase without the body temperature drop, but these involve adding prescription thyroid medication.  And whenever you decide to stop using the medication, there will be an eight-week lag time when the body tries to adjust natural thyroid output back to normal. And even nominal amounts of calories during this time will be deposited as bodyfat.</P>
<P>	I've also learned the hard way that novice bodybuilders have a very difficult time achieving contest-ready bodyfat percentages of five percent or less if they start this ten-week dieting cycle with more than ten percent bodyfat. This isn't to say that some very gifted individuals can't whip themselves into great shape within 8 weeks from 15% bodyfat (or more).  But most of us will not be able to duplicate such dazzling results.  I'm a believer of tracking bodyfat during the year with skin-fold calipers, so it doesn't creep past the 10% to 12% range.  Whatever contest you decide to enter, plan it so at the ten-week out point, your bodyfat is right at ten percent. Maybe I should call it the "Guru 10/10 rule."</P>
<HR>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> My bodybuilding coach is recommending that I sodium load before the contest so I don't need to use a diuretic.  Should I do this?</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>	Eric Sternlicht created the concept of "sodium loading" about ten years ago when he was a UCLA graduate student.  He reasoned that by force-feeding salt over a number of days, the body's reaction would be to curtail the secretion of the hormone aldosterone, which regulates (retains) sodium in the body.  If the same salt-eating individual were to abruptly cease all intake of salt, the lack of systemic aldosterone would flush out large amounts of sodium and water from the body.  Usually, there is a three-day lag for down-regulated aldosterone to up-regulate.  On a purely creative level, sodium loading seems novel, logical, and elegant.  However, sodium loading has never fulfilled its initial premise.  I don't exactly know which part of the concept contributes to the dismal-looking end results, but I suspect it might be the relationship between low aldosterone, curtailed sodium, and water intake--all the while, the individual should actually be carbing up.  Unfortunately, too many of the sodium loaders have ended up looking spectacularly bad on contest day.  I'm a strong advocate of injectable Lasix, usually taken on the day before a contest.  But even an OTC [over-the-counter] herbal diuretic would give better results than sodium loading.  The present judging standards reward the "ripped" competitor, but this shredded look is not necessarily due to the thinness of the skin.  A competitor can have uniform skin-fold thickness of only two millimeters but still look (relatively speaking) "fat" because of too much water between the muscle fibers.  Saunas and sweat suits don't help eliminate water trapped between the muscle fibers in the thighs either (water follows gravity).  So I don't recommend sodium loading, even though I admire the reasoning behind it.  I just don't know how to make it work in any practical sense.  Always use some kind of diuretic for a contest, even if it's only buchu extract (a popular herbal diuretic).</P><HR>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> I read the published research on using creatine monohydrate and followed the recommendations of 20 grams over 5 days and then a maintenance dosage of 6 grams a day.  I felt pretty good after the first five days, but after a week of using six grams a day, my strength and size gains diminished.  What am I doing wrong?</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>	You're probably not using enough creatine after the first five days.  Try doubling the dosage to 12 grams a day.  And if that doesn't work, raise the daily dosage to 20 grams.  As much as it seems logical to follow the recommendations from published research, many of the human research subjects may not have the same high-activity levels (or body weights) as bodybuilders.  In the case of creatine, the six-grams-a-day maintenance dosage was determined through muscle biopsies.  Anecdotal evidence from bodybuilders shows that six grams a day isn't enough to sustain initial size and strength gains.  It might be that bodybuilders need more creatine for exercise, or some individuals may not be using proper amounts of high-glycemic carbs to transport the creatine with insulin.  </P>
<P>	Personally, I would have the patience to load creatine at the initial recommended 20-30 grams-a-day dosage for a week or so and would have no problem in maintaining a once-a-day 6 gram dosage.  But if I had to continue using high amounts of creatine in divided daily dosages, I doubt I would be able to keep the routine up.  As to following the creatine dosages suggested by research, I would always trust workout poundages and a tape measure over any of the research formulas.</P><HR>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> Can you recommend a calf routine for me; mine are pretty pathetic.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>No, I can't.  As far as I'm concerned, there are two classes of calves: either they're totally resistant to growth from any routine or just about any routine (including none at all) will cause growth.  I know that's pessimistic, but it's the conclusion I've reached after 20 years of watching hundreds (thousands?) of people train calves.  I've encountered bodybuilders with great calves, and it seems that any kind of work will cause the calves to grow.  Some bodybuilders achieve great calves (Vince Taylor comes to mind) with little or no direct work.  </P>
<P>	But if you're one of those individuals who finds your calves are stubborn, you've probably already tried every imaginable way of training calves.  I certainly have.  High reps (up to 100), high sets, training them twice a day, every day, or seated calf raises in the middle of the night (the machine was next to my bed).  I've tried very heavy weights, absurdly heavy eccentrics (with two training partners hanging off the calf machine), most mail-order calf courses, even electrical stimulation.  I've injected steroids into my calves, tried those dangerous calf shoes, tried skipping rope, and even tried skipping rope while wearing those damn shoes. (Don't try this!)  Yet my calves still...suck!  In fact, some routines made my calves smaller!  So in my case, it looks pretty hopeless.  </P>
<P>	Now, I just train them like any body part: 2-3 sets of standing and seated calf raises, 12 reps at 70% of my maximum weight, finishing off with 2-3 forced reps with a higher weight from my training partner applying the downward pressure.  </P>
<P>	There's only one secret for great calf development: be born with great calves.</P><HR>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> I want to gain weight.  How do I know when I should stop?</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>	It all depends on what sport you're in.  Whether we like it or not, any weight-gain program that includes eating more than your maintenance calories will cause some deposition of bodyfat.  So the real question is: how fat can you get?  I've seen many individuals start a very cautious mass program with the intention of not adding any bodyfat--even counting nutrients to the gram.  And it seemed that very stringent eating didn't generate much muscle gain when contrasted with other "diets" that were a bit more flexible.  It would help if you could actually see the various bodies in the locker rooms and assign bodyfat percentages.  For example, at 15%, the sedentary man doesn't look fat in street clothes.  But a weightlifter at 15% bodyfat, which is an average fat percentage with the heavier powerlifters and football players, looks very out of shape. Most of the fat accumulates on the stomach and trunk area, but in these two sports, there's no great motivation among peers and players to diet down to a lower bodyfat percentage.  So the "you're too fat to even think of gaining weight" advice would probably be ignored.</P>
<P>	However, let me assume you're in a bodybuilding mode.  It wouldn't be wise for you to start a weight-gain program, which includes eating more and lessening your aerobics (as being aerobically fit interferes with acquiring muscle), if you're already fat.  Unless an individual is unusually gifted and using an array of drugs, it's rare to see someone gain muscle and lose fat at the same time.  Yes, I've seen it done on the old Rebound Training System by Michael Zumpano and the current knock-off, Anabolic Diet.  But both systems need an amount of discipline greater than anticipated, and most weight trainers won't stay on such a program.   </P>
<P>	The problem with getting temporarily fatter than usual (and we haven't decided the exact figure) is that most individuals lose too much muscle when dieting off a lot of fat.  Granted, just when I say 15% is too high a bodyfat percentage to allow a successful plummet to a single-digit fat percentage, there will be someone who pulls this off.  But typically, at 15%, a bodybuilder looks FAT, and when dieting down, much of the newly acquired muscle is lost.</P>
<P>	Let me further assume your metabolism isn't astounding (if it were, you wouldn't be writing me for advice).  For gaining weight, I use a very narrow fat window.  I suggest that you start your weight-gain program when your bodyfat is 9% or lower.  Needless to say, many individuals who'd like to gain weight will be disappointed to learn that they should actually go on a <I>weight-loss diet</I> before embarking on a bulking phase.  The fat window slams shut (in my opinion) at 12% bodyfat.  At this point, you should either hold your bodyfat at the 12% mark for a while or diet back down to 9% for another bulking phase.  Many of you might have another question after reading this advice: is it better to stay at the 12% for a while, or should I immediately diet down?  I think the term is "solidifying" the mass--somewhat like curing concrete--rather than "dieting down."  And I have no answer on this.  Personally, I think you'll find that your metabolism will be at its highest, in terms of body temperature, during a bulking phase (unless you're eating high amounts of saturated fats), and this is a very nice time to start a weight-loss regimen, when your metabolism is optimum.</P>
<P>	I'm afraid there's no textbook in which to look up magic answers on how many weeks you should be bulking up. Some individuals with enormous appetites and very poor eating habits could go from 9% to 12% within a few weeks. But everybody would like some hard numbers.  The average 200-pound bodybuilder would have a fat window of 3%-about 6 pounds.  If you plan your bulk program over 8 weeks, this would allow a weekly fat accumulation of 3/4 of a pound.  This seems workable to me.  And most weight-loss diets stop working after about 5 or so weeks, so a bodybuilder at 12% should be able to diet down to a 9% bulk phase again after about 6 weeks of dieting.</P>
<P>	As you can imagine, I recommend skin-fold caliper readings every week.  I've found that during a bulking program, many individuals deny that fat is accumulating.  This is probably because workout poundages go up, and you're able to get a better pump. This exuberance puts the "fat blinders" on.</P>
<P>	I do think my Isometric Diet (see page 72 in the January 1996 issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>) is an ideal diet for gaining weight.  If you're considering counting calories, I suggest you increase calories over maintenance by only 10%, and the extra calories should be equally divided among the three macronutrients (protein, carbs, and fat).</P><HR>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> I've always used a high-carb, low-calorie diet to prepare for my contests, and I've always gotten shredded.  Why should I change to one of those higher-fat diets?</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>	There's no reason to automatically change what's worked for you in the past.  You might be one of the people with great glucose metabolism and insulin control.  If you have very little bodyfat and only have to diet for four weeks or less, you'll probably never generate the problems that other people who have higher bodyfat percentages and need to diet for a longer period of time encounter.  I would point out that if you do any aerobic activity, you won't be able to function well for long periods of time without eating some carbs every hour or so.  When I was eating a high-carb diet and went on long bike rides, I would bonk out at the 25-mile mark and had to eat carbs, so I didn't get into the limp-and-crawl-home mode.</P>
<P>	I've found that women, having more bodyfat in their lower bodies, seem to experience better results when eating less dietary carbs.  I've included three separate diets in <I>BODYOPUS</I>: the modern high-carb diet for those addicted to carbs; the Isometric Diet, which has a daily 1/3 fat ratio; and the radical <I>BODYOPUS</I> Diet, which eliminates virtually all carbohydrates over 5 days.  The <I>BODYOPUS</I> Diet is not needed by everybody, and I always suggest that people follow the easiest diet first and only change if they encounter a problem the diet can't resolve.</P><HR>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> I've written a number of times, and I've never gotten a response, but I remember you saying that you answer every letter personally.  What gives?</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>	My workload has increased.  I try to write four articles for each issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, and I'm always working on a book project.  And I have another commitment to Next Nutrition.  So I can't respond to all my mail like before, but I do respond to a lot of mail.  However, I prioritize it.</P>
<P>	All my paper mail is received through <I>MM2K</I>.  Please limit your letter to one page.  And since I don't use a secretary, I only respond to letters which include a self-addressed, stamped envelope.  I respond fastest to mail which includes a post office postal card.  Your questions should be very brief, and the answers expected should be brief, too.  Typing a letter is a plus.  If you can't type, please print neatly.  I don't like cursive.</P>
<P>	There are some questions which will never get a response, simply because I don't have the answers.  Examples would be identification of counterfeit steroids or providing info on steroid suppliers.</P><HR>
<P><I>BODYOPUS</I>, Dan Duchaine's new book, is coming soon!  Watch for details on how to get a copy of this fantastic new book in future issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>.</P>

<H3>ANABOLIC STEROIDS IN EUROPE</H3><P>
<H4>An Interview by T.C. Luoma</H4></CENTER>
<P><B>As a whole, Americans are rather provincial--we think we're the best at everything, know everything, and set the pace for the rest of the world, while other countries, bless their hearts, are, well, kind of primitive.  This is particularly true of bodybuilding.  Most of us assume the rest of the world still lifts concrete-filled paint buckets and car axles.  And the Europeans?  Well, they've evolved past the paint-bucket stage, but not by much.  I mean, aside from a few bodybuilders with funny names who had to come to the U.S. to get really big, who have they got of any notoriety?    </P>
<P>	Well, let me tell you, nothing could be further from the truth.  Several European countries take their training seriously, even investing considerable amounts of money into bona-fide weight-training research.  And, since drugs are much more readily available in many European countries, their knowledge of drugs surpasses ours.</P>
<P>	To find out more about the European scene--particularly the drug scene--we made a few calls, checked a few contacts, and found Laslo Hortobagyi, a former competitive bodybuilder from Budapest, Hungary.  After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hortobagyi moved to Innsbruck, Austria, where he works as a personal trainer.  It was there that we contacted him.  What ensued was a fascinating and eye-opening interview.</B></P><HR>
<P>	<I><CENTER>The following is Part I of a two-part interview:</CENTER></I> </P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>MUSCLE MEDIA 2000</FONT><B>: Let's get right to it.  Where do bodybuilders obtain their steroids in Europe?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>LAZLO HORTOBAGYI</FONT>:  Anabolic steroids are obtained in Europe through five main sources. In decreasing order of importance, I'd say they are pharmacists, Eastern Bloc countries, barter, bootleg companies, and lastly, doctors.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>: Let's tackle those sources one by one.  Tell me about European pharmacies first.</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>: In some Southern European countries, you can often obtain anabolic steroids by simply walking in and requesting what you want--providing the quantity appears reasonable, in other words, a recommended dosage on the bottle for a four-month supply.  For instance, Greece is quite liberal, and visiting Italy and the other European countries can sometimes be fruitful, depending on what pharmacy or pharmacist you encounter.  (Some pharmacies do ask for a prescription.)  However, other countries, such as Germany and Belgium, are just as strict as the U.S., and you'll find that anabolic steroids are controlled substances.  </P>
<P>	Nevertheless, in many pharmacies, no questions will be asked. Normally, a prescription is required, but cash talks, especially if the customer pays in a strong foreign currency, like the American dollar or the German mark.  If one is willing to wait 24 to 48 hours, one can order fairly large quantities, i.e., 8,000 tabs of a chosen oral.</P>
<P>	Last year, when I was in Italy, while traveling with a professional bodybuilder, we went to purchase some oxandrolone. He wanted three boxes of the drug, and all the lady pharmacist said was: "Prescription or no prescription--same price." Disappointed that we purchased only 30 Deutsche marks' worth of oxandrolone, she opened up a drawer and started pulling out vials of testosterone propionate, bottles of testosterone undecanoate, and went on a tirade extolling the virtues of Primobolan. The pro bodybuilder, enticed by the enthusiastic sales pitch, left with more oxandrolone and some very cheap fluoxymesterone (Halotestin). </P>
<P>	Regarding currency, one should pay attention to exchange rates. For example, right now [November, 1995], a box of 30 five-mg tablets of Halotestin will sell for $8.00 in France but only for $4.00 in Italy. Whenever the Italian lira crashes, the average lean body mass of Italian border countries increases within a week!!! Bodybuilders from neighboring France, Switzerland, and Austria rush to Italy to stock up on various products. Unfortunately, there is always a simultaneous and coincidental rise in the price of anabolics in these border countries when the lira crashes. Those pharmacists certainly are greedy bastards.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>: So what you're saying is that European pharmacists are corrupt, right?</B> </P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>:  No.  That's not what I'm saying.  You have to understand, as a rule, Europeans are more disciplined than Americans. For example, let's look at the use of guns: in Switzerland, because of their militia system, almost every single household has a SIG high-powered automatic rifle, yet no one goes to the local McDonald's to blow away 50 or so countrymen out of anger when he loses his job.  In Europe, drugs, like guns, are respected for their potential and are not regarded as quick-fix solutions. In the former East Germany, only the most talented individuals, only the ones who could rise to national levels with proper training and genetic predisposition, were given anabolic steroids, so they could further their careers on the international level.</P>
<P>	Most European pharmacists perceive anabolics as very benign products and therefore trust the customer to use them rationally.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  All right. Tell me about the second source of steroids you mentioned, the Eastern European Countries?</B> </P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>: Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, anabolics have been pouring into Western Europe in large quantities at bargain-basement prices. For example, Hungarian-made methandrostenolone, better known as Dianabol in your country, is readily available in my new hometown of Innsbruck, Austria, for a ridiculous 1 to 2 American dollars for 100 tablets. </P>
<P>	Depending on how strong the Austrian shilling is, for a mere 15-30 cents, one can obtain a vial of testosterone blends, like the Polish Omnadren or the Russian equivalent to Durabolin and Deca-Durabolin. That means that for a mere $30.00 a month, one can do a very strong anabolic cycle. [Laslo provided an example of such a cycle.  See Table 1.]  Sometimes steroid pushers will exchange their goods for products readily available to Westerners, like jeans and pocket calculators.</P>
<P>	However, the Eastern Bloc steroids are only used in the off-season, since most of them, except for the nandrolones, are very androgenic. </P>
<P>	Most bodybuilders will also buy their other bodybuilding drugs like HCG and Clomid from Eastern Bloc individuals. They are real and much cheaper than the local equivalent. For example, Russian HCG and clomiphene citrate (a.k.a., Clomid) retail for a tenth of the price we pay at the drug store in Austria.</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/clomid.gif" ALT="[Photo of Clomid package]"></CENTER><P>

<P>	Russians, Bulgarians, and Romanians are quick to offer limitless supplies of growth hormone. However, Eastern Bloc growth hormone receives mixed reviews, since a lot of it is repackaged HCG.  Most Western bodybuilders vacationing in Spain or in Italy would rather pay more and be sure of getting the real stuff.</P>
<P>	Eastern Bloc steroids are brought in three ways: through a Russian Mafia-KGB agents consortium, direct mailing, or by local human couriers. </P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  Wait a minute...the KGB?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>:  Sure.  Since the Cold War is over, many KGB agents have nothing to do with their time. Being quite resourceful at smuggling, it is child's play for them to import extremely large quantities of anabolics.  Their ties to the Mafia allow them to tap into enormous quantities of anabolics, hence, the cheap prices. They even bring in the hexagon-shaped pink methandrostenolone from Thailand. Heavyweight bodybuilders and powerlifters love that product since it comes in jars of 1,000 tabs. Police sources report that the same individuals bringing in the anabolics also bring in AK-47's, Tokarev pistols, and grenade launchers for underworld clients in Western Europe, Canada, and the U.S. The same police sources report frustration in infiltrating these rings or even tapping their phones since they talk in codes developed for their former spying activities.</P>
<P>	Many Eastern-Bloc refugees have relatives or friends back home mail them packages on a regular basis. For example, my ex-neighbor, another Hungarian, now drives a cab in Italy. He gets  weekly shipments of Budapest's best Nerobol from his cousin on the track and field team. Apparently, the bottles he buys cost $1.00 in Hungary.  He then sells them to his American cousin for $40-$55 per bottle, and his cousin in turn sells them in Buffalo, New York, for between $100-$150.</P>
<P>	Some adventurous German bodybuilders will take a short drive to Poland or to the Czech Republic, train at the most hardcore gym, look for the guy with the most pimples on his traps, and buy  a few thousand tabs and vials from him. The steroids are then brought back to Germany and sold to friends in the hometown gym. They usually make the trip in a cheap car, because luxury cars like Audi's and BMW's are stolen within minutes in these countries. </P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  Unbelievable.  How about this "bartering system" you spoke of?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>: Within the Western European bodybuilding community, bartering anabolic steroids is very common. Italian bodybuilders will drive three hours from Milan to Nice, France, to exchange trunk loads of oxandrolone and Primobolan for Parabolan and Nilevar with the French bodybuilders. Everyone knows what the other guy pays for the stuff in his native country, so all they want to do is access the other guy's drugs. Fair trade is common practice. A typical trade would be 5 two-vial boxes of Theramex (testosterone heptylate) for 1 box of 30 tabs of oxandrolone.</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/nilevar.gif" ALT="[Photo of Nilevar package]"></CENTER>

<P>	Tourism-based steroid exchange is gaining popularity throughout Europe as well. For example, Dutch bodybuilders will bring Masterone with them on their Spanish vacation. After making contact with the local gym rats or the biggest bouncer in the discotheque, they will trade their specialty drug for a Spanish steroid like Stromba (stanozolol). The Southern European bodybuilders (Italians, French, Portuguese, and Spanish) will normally ask for androgens like oxymetholone and methandrostenolone from their Northern cousins, while the latter, in return, will ask for the highly anabolic drugs oxandrolone and stanozolol. The Northern-based Europeans (Holland, Sweden, Norway, Germany) normally have access to more androgenic drugs in their countries which generally accounts for their more massive physiques.</P>
<P>	Steroids are not only traded during vacations but also at bodybuilding competitions.  In France, because of its high number of French-speaking North African immigrants from Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, it is not odd to see Primobolan with Arabic writing come in from these countries. By the same token, testosterone propionate from Kenya is often seen in British gyms.</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/primo.gif" ALT="[Photo of Primobolan package]"></CENTER>

<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  How common are bootleg drugs?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>:  Most bootleg drugs are real anabolics, but they are produced in some guy's basement. They are mainly orals, usually coming in bottles of 50 to 100 tabs, depending on the product. They look very cheap, but they work great. They are most often made in underground labs in Britain or Ireland.</P>
<P>	The bootleggers import the raw ingredients from Thailand. A human mule will bring in, let's say, two kilos of pure oxandrolone. The steroid manufacturer will then make 800,000 2.5-mg tablets with that quantity. Lab analyses, however, have shown inconsistent results in the content of the active ingredient. For example the stanozolol and oxandrolone content were dead-on at a respective 5 mg and 2.5 mg a tab, but the oxymetholone was only 25 mg instead of the claimed 50 mg.  Luckily, things evened out since the methandrostenolone was seven mg instead of the labeled five mg.</P>
<P>	Since legitimate steroids are easily found in most of Continental Europe, bootleg steroids are normally only found in the British Isles; however, they sometimes show up in Holland and Denmark. Because they're cheap, they often end up mainly on North American streets.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  That brings us to the last source of steroids you mentioned--doctors.</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>: European doctors south of Scandinavia are very likely to prescribe anabolics to the bodybuilder but not to amateur athletes. This is because amateur athletes are often submitted to doping control, making it more likely the doctor will be investigated.  </P>
<P>	In Scandinavia, doctors very seldom prescribe anabolics to athletes or bodybuilders for fear of reprisal from the authorities. Norway, Sweden, and Denmark are the leading countries in the fight against doping in amateur sports. </P>
<P>	In Finland, athletes on real-life anabolic cycles (more than 1,000 mg a week) have been studied extensively by the medical establishment. Anabolic steroids are easily available on the Finnish black market because of  neighboring Estonia and Russia. This is why true 400-lb plus bench pressers are a dime a dozen in the Helsinki gyms.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  Do you see different patterns of drug use in Europe as compared to America?</B></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>:  Oh, yes!  Very dramatic differences. For one, Europeans tend to be more obsessed with the quality of the look they project and are not so keen on the "Captain Testo" bloated look.  Southern European bodybuilders are more likely to use refined anabolics like the ones I mentioned earlier. In their countries, the bloated-gut, moon-faced, acne-on-the-back look enjoys very little popularity with the opposite sex.  Size is not such a big deal in Southern Europe; in fact, it is often ridiculed by the general public.  Most Italians and Spaniards would rather have the Frank Zane look than the Dorian Yates look. That is why they also use plenty of cutting up agents like Percutacrine [a topical cream which is applied to the skin in places where one wants to lose fat] and Triacana pills and creams. The warmer climates they enjoy give them more beach time than their colleagues from Oslo.  Their Nordic cousins, in comparison, would rather look like Manfred Hoeberl.  Who needs abs when our summer's only ten weeks long? Long life to Anadrol!!!</P>
<P>	 Americans on European-steroid shopping trips, however, are very keen on the mass drugs like oxymetholone (a.k.a., Anadrol) and do not ask much for the refined orals like oxandrolone. They tend to buy a lot of injectables, merely for their profit potential.  The vial they pay $1.00 for here [in Austria] sells for $25-$35 on the American streets. Orals take up a lot of space in a suitcase and will only sell for 2 to 5 times their cost, while injectables will sell for 20 to 30 times their original cost.</P>
<P>	A lot of American bodybuilders preparing for state or local titles will come over here with a skinny date who will act as the mule to bring the stuff back home. Most of the girls who carry the steroids back are strippers or prostitutes who don't mind having a European vacation and getting the opportunity to make some extra money on the side--instead of on their backs!!!</P>
<P>	As far as other differences, European bodybuilders seem to care more about the prevention of side effects than their American counterparts. Hepato-protectants, like glutathione, are a staple of any steroid cycle. Restoration of normal functioning of the endocrine system is also of great concern to European bodybuilders.</P>
<P>	Europeans are also fond of using life-extension type drugs between steroid cycles. Hydergine is used for its growth-hormone releasing properties. High dosages of piracetam combined with deprenyl are used to permit the recruitment of higher-threshold fibers. Piracetam has also been shown to increase steroid absorption at the cellular level.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  What would you say are the three most popular steroids in Europe?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>:  Before answering this question, I must say that factors like foreign exchange rate, cultural background, desired effect--and even rumors  will influence the answer to your question.</P>
<P>	Simple economics, like foreign exchange rates, probably dictates the choice of anabolics more than cult followings. "How much can I get for the currency of my country?" is usually the first question asked.</P>
<P>	For recreational bodybuilders only interested in size, I would say the top three steroids are any generic form of Sustanon 250 (testosterone blend), Dianabol (methandrostenolone), and Deca-Durabolin  (nandrolone decanoate).</P>
<P>	For competitors, however, I would say Masterone, oxandrolone, and testosterone undecanoate caplets are the most popular steroids.</P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/masteron.gif" ALT="[Photo of Masteron package]"></CENTER>

<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  Masterone?  That's surprising.  Why is that?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>:	I have never seen a drug with such amazing properties as dromostanolone propionate [Masterone].  Within hours of taking it, you will see its effect on the human body. It gives a hard look; it's great for nutrient loading and, in fact, gives you quite a bit of strength. It is mainly available in the Benelux countries (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg).  A generic form of it is now being made in Spain and sells like hot cakes.  I just heard it's now also being made again in Germany and used with the same degree of popularity.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  Are there any steroids that are, in your opinion, underrated? If so, which ones?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>: The Italian injectable Steranabol Ritardo is very efficient at inducing mass gains.  Simply put, its anabolic properties are incredible. It's also very cheap: between 25 cents and $1.00 for a 25-mg ampoule. I have no clue why it is not more highly rated.  It might be because of its low price, people assume it's not effective.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  You mentioned oxandrolone many times.   Why is it so popular in Europe?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>: Oxandrolone is the steroid of choice for many reasons.  First of all, it is very anabolic with minimal androgenic properties. It is excellent for obtaining large increases in relative strength--strength on a per-kg of body weight basis--with basically no side effects. It can literally be stacked with anything.</P>
<P> 	Many of the top female bodybuilders are using oxandrolone because it has minimal androgenicity. Oxandrolone used to be made in France under the name Protivar. It was one of France's top-ten selling drugs, and I mean of all drugs--not just steroids available to the French public. The Protivar product also contained a certain blend of aminos to enhance its effectiveness. </P>
<P>	Oxandrolone isn't hepatotoxic either. Clinical studies with HIV patients revealed that even 80 mg a day induced no stress on the liver.  It doesn't inhibit the pituitary gland. With oxandrolone, there is no need to use the HCG followed by Clomid to restore the endocrine system. </P>
<P>	Furthermore, retention of gains is high. When you go off oxandrolone, you don't have a crash in performance like you would see with drugs like oxymetholone. The gains in body weight are not as dramatic as, let's say, with Dianabol, but you're sure to retain at least 80% of the gains you make.  And lastly, it clears the system quickly.  At low dosages (20 mg or less), one can pass a doping control test within 8 days of the tested event. This is why it has enjoyed great popularity with cycling and track athletes (sprinters, throwers, and jumpers).</P>
<P>	I think that once the American-made 20-mg tabs* hit the European market, it will be even more popular. At this time, there are only the 2.5-mg tabs from Italy and some bootleg forms from Holland and England. The present low dosage of the tablets jacks up the price of the cycle.</P>
<P> 	For bodybuilders, the current dosages of oxandrolone are about one 2.5-mg tablet for every 3 kg (6.6 lbs) of body weight.</P><HR>
<P></P>
<P><B>*Editor's note:  As reported in the last issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> (February, 1996), oxandrolone is now being manufactured in 20-mg tablets, and its use has been approved for AIDS patients in America.</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><I>This concludes Part I of this interview.  Be sure to catch Part II in the next issue of </I>Muscle Media 2000<I> where Laslo Hortobagyi reveals even more about European steroids, in addition to talking about various other topics such as veterinary steroids and nootropics (smart drugs).</I></P>

<A HREF=#A1><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I read about this new company called "Muscle-Tech" in an article in <I>MuscleMag</I> recently. How do you rate this company’s products?<P>
<A HREF=#A2><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I recently read that using the amino acid arginine can cause a significant increase in IGF-1 levels. I've read a lot about IGF-1, and it sounds like this is an important hormone for muscle growth. Do you know how much arginine I should take?<P>
<A HREF=#A3><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've been using 70 mg of vanadyl sulfate a day, and I've been getting really good results. I just wonder, since I'm using more than the "recommended dose," should I be cycling this stuff?<P>
<A HREF=#A4><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've heard a lot about top bodybuilders using insulin to help them gain muscle, and I've read some things about this in the various magazines, but I can't quite understand it. Why use insulin? I thought high insulin levels made you fat. You have a knack for explaining things (sometimes complicated things) in a way I can understand. What's this whole insulin thing about?<P>
<A HREF=#A5><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> Do you think RU 486 is a good bodybuilding drug?<P>
<A HREF=#A6><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> The guy who runs my gym told me he's going to start carrying a form of HMB put out by American Strength and Fitness or something like that. Do you know if their HMB is any good?<P>
<A HREF=#A7><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I saw an ad for a total-nutrition product in <I>Ironman</I> magazine that's supposed to have HMB in it. Is that real?<P>
<A HREF=#A8><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I was wondering if the recommended dosage of supplements like creatine monohydrate, HMB, CLA, and vanadyl sulfate should be adjusted according to bodyweight. Do you have any information on this?<P>
<A HREF=#A9><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> Why doesn't <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> have any bodybuilding contest coverage in it? How come there aren't any articles about the bodybuilding champions?<P>
<A HREF=#A10><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've been trying to get my girlfriend to work out with weights, use supplements, and so on, but for a long time she has resisted--she told me she didn't want to end up looking like one of those "grotesque" female bodybuilders. But, more recently, she's taken an interest in training with weights. I finally convinced her that free-weight exercise isn't going to make her look like a freak. Anyway, I wanted to know what type of nutrition, exercise, and supplement program you'd recommend for a relatively fit (my girlfriend only needs to lose a few pounds of fat, and she wants to put on some muscle) 28-year-old woman. I think she has the potential to look like one of those fitness models like Monica Brant or Laurie Donnelly.

<P>
<A NAME="A1"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> There's not much information available on Muscle-Tech. But what I've seen so far lacks credibility.</P>
<P>	Take this claim which appeared in that recent article for example, "...Muscle-Tech's products are over 500% more effective than any supplement currently available." I'd sure like to see the substantiation for that! Five-hundred percent more effective, huh? (Ridiculous claims like this make it hard to believe <I>any</I> of the claims made about Muscle-Tech products.) If Muscle-Tech can prove that claim, I'll personally cut them a check for $10,000!</P>
<P>	I have the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, which was done at a legitimate university and presented to scientists at the International Sports Nutrition Conference last September and is now <I>peer reviewed</I>, that show the Experimental and Applied Sciences (EAS) product Phosphagain<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>; produces an average gain in lean mass of 5.35 lbs in just 28 days (which is a <B>BIG</B> gain!).</P>
<P>	Okay...if Muscle-Tech's new supplements are 500% more effective than Phosphagain, then they'd produce an average gain of 26.75 lbs (5.35 x 500%) of lean mass in 28 days. That, my friends, ain't the case! There's no F-in' way any supplement has been shown to produce gains like that.</P>
<P>	The article constantly mentions Muscle-Tech's research, although it never mentions where this research is being done, where it'll be presented, who's doing it, etc. I repeatedly attempted to contact this Muscle-Tech company to ask for more information on their research but made no progress. One of our <I>MM2K</I> researchers contacted Greg Zulak (who wrote the Muscle-Tech article), but Zulak couldn't provide any information that could back the "unbelievable" claims made in his article.</P>
<P>	Nowadays, you see supplement companies throwing around the word "research" all the time. For many supplement companies, "research" means flipping through muscle magazines and trying to figure out what products are selling well and then attempting to imitate these products--that's basically what most "research" in the bodybuilding business consists of.</P>
<P>	In the last issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, I said EAS was going to conduct more research to find out what the optimal doses of creatine monohydrate are for bodybuilders. What I meant by "research" was that double-blind, placebo-controlled university studies are going to be conducted, and scientific, analytical methods such as muscle biopsies, body-composition tests, performance evaluations, etc. will be made before and after giving the subjects various doses of creatine monohydrate. Then, the statistics will be compiled by experts, and the data will be presented at a scientific conference. That's research!</P>
<P>	One of the products mentioned in that <I>MuscleMag</I> article, that I've been getting a lot of questions on, is something called acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC). ALC hasn't been <I>proven</I> to do <I>anything</I> positive for bodybuilders--there's some research that shows it may help mitigate chronic stress-related reductions in testosterone levels, but I looked everywhere and couldn't find any studies showing ALC has ever been shown to stimulate testosterone, much less promote muscle size and strength in healthy weight-training humans. When Zulak describes ALC, he says, "ALC is the only product I know of that has steroid-like effects--but without the negative side effects. The great feature about ALC is that, unlike steroids, it doesn't cause you to lose muscle when you stop taking it. There's no depression, increase of estrogen, zits..." Blah, blah, blah! Where's the substantiation for such claims?</P>
<P>	Before you'd be able to legally make claims like these, you'd have to do double-blind, placebo-controlled university studies in weight-training athletes. You'd have to measure their testosterone levels, their body composition, and all kinds of things. You'd have to compare ALC users to test subjects who consumed a placebo, and if you wanted to say that ALC doesn't cause you to lose muscle when you stop taking it, you'd have to continue to study the test subjects after they quit using the compound. What Zulak is claiming is that the gains in muscle size you make from ALC are permanent, and not only is there not any proof that ALC produces <I>any</I> gains in size and strength to begin with, making a claim that the gains are permanent is really, really going out on a limb. I know of no compound in the world that produces permanent gains in muscle size and strength... Steroids don't even do this! Using supplements or drugs that may accelerate lean mass and strength gains is similar to weight training itself in that if you stop doing it, eventually you'll lose what you've gained. The body always tries to go back to "normal." For example, would you expect to go out in the sun for two weeks and get a nice tan and then stay tan for the rest of your life? Of course not! It just doesn't work like that.</P>
<P>	In Zulak's defense, he's really not a supplement expert and maybe he's being fed information that he just assumed was correct--he might not have the knowledge to understand the difference between what's real and what's not. When I first started writing ten years ago, I made the same mistake myself a few times--I didn't know any better. But I now have a lot more experience and knowledge in the field of bodybuilding supplements, and I also know the difference between proof, evidence, and <I>total bullshit!</I></P>
<P>	I'm certain you'll start to see ads for Muscle-Tech supplements showing up in <I>MuscleMag</I>, and if the same claims show up in their ads that were made in this recent article, I hope they've got a great lawyer who can help them explain all of this to the Federal Trade Commission.</P>
<P>	And, finally, I want to reiterate my proposal to Muscle-Tech--if they can prove their supplements are 500% more effective (I assume they mean for gaining lean mass) than any other supplements available, I'll Federal Express them a check for $10,000 immediately. (Am I nice, or what?!)</P>

<A NAME="A2"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> What you read about arginine increasing IGF-1 levels originated with a study presented last year in the <I>Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition</I>. In that study, 45 subjects who used 30 grams of arginine aspartate a day for 14 days experienced a significant increase in blood IGF-1 levels.
	Unfortunately, I don't think this study really has all that much application for bodybuilders--you see, the subjects in this recent arginine study were between the ages of 67 and 82. Typically, by that age, a number of our bodies' key hormones will be well below what they are when we're in our 20's and 30's. It's extremely possible that arginine does not increase IGF-1 levels in young, healthy bodybuilders. But, hopefully, someone will study the effects 30 grams of arginine aspartate has on bodybuilders, and hopefully, they'll measure not only IGF-1 levels but body composition and strength as well--these are the most important factors to me and most other supplement users. For now, I'd say hold off on arginine--there are better supplements to spend your hard-earned money on.</P>

<A NAME="A3"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I'd say yes. A lot of bodybuilders have been using 70 to 100 mg of vanadyl sulfate a day, but I don't recommend this much. I've been getting great results with 45 mg a day, and I think that's all most lifters need. But if you want to use more, I'd definitely "cycle it." For example, you might use it for six weeks, stay off it for four weeks, then use it for six more weeks and so on.</P>

<A NAME="A4"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> Okay... Here's your insulin crash course: as you most likely know, insulin is a protein hormone that's secreted by an organ right in the middle of your gut called the pancreas. You might think of insulin as a "nutrient storage hormone." Simply put, what insulin does is escort protein (amino acids) and carbohydrates (glucose or blood sugar) into various cells of the body.</P>
<P>	For example, let's say you just drank a glass of orange juice. That orange juice is processed by your digestive system into the simplest form of carbohydrate (glucose), and it's shuttled into your bloodstream. Then, insulin comes along and takes that glucose into various cells where it's used for energy or stored.</P>
<P>	Insulin also helps glucose and amino acids get into muscle cells which facilitates anabolism. And, it can help prevent the breakdown of muscle tissue which makes it anti-catabolic.</P>
<P>	But as you mentioned, insulin can be a "double-edged sword." That is, it can also prevent the breakdown of bodyfat and increase bodyfat storage.</P>
<P>	However, a lot of bodybuilders are using insulin, and they're not getting fat--they're getting bigger and more cut than ever. Why is this? Well, it seems insulin, when given to a lean, muscular bodybuilder, increases definition and muscle fullness. But insulin, when given to obese persons, can make them even fatter.</P>
<P>	Remember how I told you insulin was a "nutrient storage" hormone? Well, it's also a nutrient storage hormone with <I>bias</I>. If you're placing extreme physical demands on your body by doing intense weight training and you're not taking in an excess amount of calories, the insulin in your body wants to take nutrients to muscle cells preferentially over fat cells.</P>
<P>	On the other hand, if you're a sedentary person who consumes an excess number of calories, day in and day out, insulin will increase your bodyfat levels.</P>
<P>	Now, a lot of top bodybuilders are using insulin, along with growth hormone, steroids, clenbuterol, thyroid drugs, and/or IGF-1. In that environment, it appears insulin's even more effective, and it may cause growth hormone (GH) and IGF-1 to become potent muscle builders and fat burners. (I'm <I>not</I> convinced IGF-1 or GH are all that great on their own.)</P>
<P>	There's no doubt that insulin use is having a major impact on pro bodybuilding--I have firsthand information that a bodybuilder who came out of nowhere last year and almost won the Olympia is a master with insulin--he really knows what he's doing!</P>
<P>	Injectable insulin is something that has been used for many years by diabetics--these are people who have a disease which prevents their bodies from making enough insulin (Type I diabetes), or they have a defect that causes their cells not to recognize insulin (Type II diabetes).</P>
<P>	Usually, Type I diabetics have to take insulin shots a few times each day to help their bodies transport glucose out of their blood and into cells. Now, you might be wondering if insulin is such a great bodybuilding drug, how come all diabetics aren't muscular and lean? Well, remember what I said earlier--how insulin works depends a lot on who's using it. Bodybuilders who are already lean and have a lot of muscle can get even bigger and leaner with insulin use, but for people who aren't working out hard with weights and aren't already quite muscular and aren't using other bodybuilding drugs, insulin would probably have virtually no positive effects on body composition.	</P>
<P>	Anyway, the bodybuilders I've been talking with use anywhere from 20 to 40 international units (IU) of insulin a day. There are two main types of insulin--long-acting and short-acting. Short-acting insulin stays in the body for about six hours after injection. (Insulin shouldn't be injected into a vein or intramuscularly--it goes under the skin or "subcutaneously.") This type of insulin usually kicks in about an hour or two after you take it. </P>
<P>	All types of insulin should be stored in a cool place like a refrigerator but not a freezer. There are different sources of insulin--standard and purified animal insulins as well as human insulins are available. Standard and purified insulins differ in their degree of purification and content of non-insulin material. Standard and purified insulins also come from different sources--they may be from beef, pork, or a mixture of the two.</P>
<P>	Human insulin is identical in structure to the insulin produced by the human pancreas, and it differs slightly from animal insulin. One thing some bodybuilders have pointed out is if they switch from animal to human insulin (or vice versa), they often notice a different reaction from the same dosage--this is just one of several complicated hurdles that insulin-using bodybuilders have to deal with.</P>
<P>	Keep this in mind--your pancreas naturally releases insulin (if you're not a Type I diabetic) after your blood sugar levels rise. Thus, it's insulin's job to keep things as "steady" as possible. But when you take an insulin injection, you're causing your blood sugar levels to go down--this is called hypoglycemia. </P>
<P>	If bodybuilders take a shot of insulin first thing in the morning and then just eat complex carbohydrates, they probably won't create a high enough blood sugar level by the time their insulin shot "kicks in," and they can go into a very deep hypoglycemic episode and experience things like shortness of breath, shaking, and extreme sweating. These symptoms can cause quite a panic!</P>
<P>	Now, wiser insulin-using bodybuilders apparently get good results by consuming 10 grams of glucose (simple carbs) per IU of insulin about 20 to 30 minutes after they take a shot. For example, if someone took 10 IU's of insulin first thing in the morning, he would consume about 100 grams of simple carbs 20 to 30 minutes later.</P>
<P>	If they don't take an insulin shot first thing in the morning and have a meal with only complex carbs, they can get away with not eating any extra simple carbs. The top bodybuilders I know typically take two or three shots a day, with at least six hours between injections. Some bodybuilders take a combination of the long and short-acting forms of insulin, but if they do this, they have to pay very close attention to their diets and eat exactly every three hours. They also need to make sure they have a good-sized serving of protein and carbohydrates with every meal.</P>
<P>	The longer-acting insulin stays in the system for about 24 hours and peaks several times a day. Reportedly, it's much harder to predict and manage. However, assuming that the competitive (serious) bodybuilder eats the way he should, he can make sure he has a sufficient amount of carbs throughout the day, so the risk of hypoglycemia is minimal. The advantage of the long-acting form of insulin is that it stays in your body throughout the day, and every time your blood glucose levels are increased, that extra insulin goes to work and pushes glucose (and available amino acids) into muscle cells. </P>
<P>	An example of how one top bodybuilder uses insulin is as follows: 15 IU's of the long-acting insulin plus 5 IU's of the short-acting insulin first thing in the morning, then 10 IU's of the short-acting insulin 6 hours later and another 10 IU's of the short-acting insulin after another 6 hours. This is a total of 40 IU's of insulin a day. (Using insulin before going to sleep is not a good idea! You can't tell if you're having symptoms of hypoglycemia, so you could have some big problems!) Most bodybuilders are cycling (going on and off) insulin even though many do not go off steroids. For example, a bodybuilder might use insulin for eight weeks, then take eight weeks off. Their thinking is that this might minimize long-term side effects of insulin use, which might include a disruption in the body's ability to produce certain neurotransmitters in response to low blood sugar levels.</P>
<P>	Insulin use for precontest preparation is extremely popular with the pros and top amateurs. It seems that when the body is glycogen depleted, using insulin while carbing up can produce such dramatic effects, you can literally stand in front of the mirror and watch your muscles swell.</P>
<P>	One of the most complicated things for a competitive bodybuilder is to carb up "just right." You see, if you deplete your muscles of glycogen (your body's stored form of carbohydrate) by eating a low-carb diet (100 grams or less a day) for 3 to 5 days and working out really hard, your muscles will be small and "flat." But when you start feeding your body with high amounts of carbohydrates again, your muscles "super compensate" and suck in even more carbs than they would normally hold--this is called "carbing up" by competitive bodybuilders.</P>
<P>	The tricky thing about this is if you don't consume enough carbs, you'll be flat, and if you take in too many carbs, glucose will "spill over," and you'll start holding water under your skin--you'll look bigger but still "flat." The bodybuilders I've talked to say that carb loading while you're using insulin produces incredibly dramatic results and makes it more likely that you will "peak" with maximum muscle fullness and definition.</P>
<P>	A good thing about insulin is that it isn't toxic to your liver (like steroids), and it doesn't cause abnormal bone or cartilage growth (like growth hormone). But, it really wouldn't be accurate to call the use of injectable insulin by bodybuilders "safe."</P>
<P>	In fact, there is a very ugly side to this issue. You see, if you misuse insulin, <I>you can kill yourself</I>--not 40 years from now--<I>today!</I> If you take too much insulin and don't consume enough carbohydrates, you can go into deep hypoglycemia and even a coma. (Remember Claus Von Bulow and that whole deal with his wife? If not, don't worry about it--it's not worth explaining...) Many bodybuilders constantly monitor their blood sugar levels with a tool called a glucometer. This may help lower the risks somewhat, but insulin is a drug that really belongs in the hands of a physician--self-administering it is just so risky!</P>
<P>	I personally wouldn't mess with insulin--I just don't like taking those kinds of chances with my body--to me, it's not worth it. I'm not a pro bodybuilder, and to be successful at what I do, I don't have to weigh 275 lbs and have 3% bodyfat. But bodybuilders who elect to make a career out of competitive bodybuilding sometimes feel they must do "whatever it takes." I feel bad for them, but no one is forcing them to do the things they're doing--they're "risk takers"; there's no doubt about it.</P>
<P>	I certainly wouldn't recommend insulin injections to the typical <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> reader who's trying to build a more muscular, better-looking physique. If you're not heavily involved in competitive bodybuilding, I definitely don't think it's worth the risk! However, since it's my job to tell you the truth about what's going on--I have to address questions like this one.</P>
<P>	Now, how can "non-kamikaze" bodybuilders "mimic" the results pros are getting from using injectable insulin? Well, that's something some pretty smart "bodybuilding scientists" are aggressively studying at this very moment.</P>
<P>	You see, taking insulin injections is not the only way to "enhance" the anabolic and anti-catabolic effects of insulin. Vanadyl sulfate, an "insulin mimicker" that is extremely popular with bodybuilders, is one possible "drug-free" way to gain an advantage, but new research has led to even more exciting discoveries in this area.</P>
<P>	Within the next year, I think you'll have access to a legal, safe "insulin mimicker" which could significantly enhance your body's ability to shuttle carbohydrates and proteins from your bloodstream into muscle cells. The compound that may do this is called IPF<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>; (insulin potentiating factor<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>;), and it's been "on the drawing board" for a couple of years now. The guys behind this product are the same folks who introduced bodybuilders to creatine monohydrate (probably the most popular supplement in bodybuilding history!). They claim their new IPF compound will work very similar to insulin injections for bodybuilders (but it's not something diabetics should use instead of injectable insulin!). The product is being designed to assist with muscle building, but it won't be so powerful that it can cause severe hypoglycemia and other dangers associated with injectable insulin use. (Of course, <I>MM2K</I> will be the first mag to bring you the whole story on IPF.)</P>
<P>	One last note--if you're thinking about using insulin, think twice--it's really risky!</P>
</P>
<A NAME="A5"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I originally wrote about RU 486 (specifically, RU 38486) almost five years ago in my <I>Anabolic Reference Update</I>. At that time, I reported that bodybuilders in Europe had been experimenting with it in hopes of accelerating muscle gains.</P>
<P>	RU 486 is that controversial abortion pill you sometimes hear about on the news. As it turns out, in addition to causing a hormonal environment that induces abortions in pregnant women, RU 486 also happens to be very "anti-catabolic."</P>
<P>	A recent study showed that a 600-mg dose of RU 486 (the same dose used to induce abortions) helped protect muscle tissue from the catabolic effects of cortisol.</P>
<P>	The downside is that RU 486 may also block androgen muscle receptors which would prevent testosterone from working its magic on muscle cells.</P>
<P>	RU 486 is interesting--I'll admit that. But if you're going to take the drug route, I'm virtually positive RU 486 won't produce better results than even a low dose of anabolic steroids, and if you're going to take the drug-free route (which is what I do), I think you can get better "anti-catabolic" effects with something like HMB than you could with RU 486.</P>
<P>	To date, no studies have shown that RU 486 helps weight trainers gain more size and strength. And I've heard from quite a few bodybuilders who tried RU 486 (mostly bodybuilders from Europe), and none of them seemed to report anything spectacular.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="A6"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> It's a scam! I've learned that a number of supplement companies are working on <I>fake</I> versions of HMB and plan to release them to the market any day now. One company that's calling their supplement "HMB" is actually putting in three ingredients: histidine, methionine, and some B-vitamins. What a rip-off!</P>
<P>	<I>Don't be fooled</I>--HMB stands for BETA-HYDROXY BETA-METHYLBUTYRATE!</P>
<P>	The only legitimate supplier of this supplement is Metabolic Technologies, Inc. (MTI) of Ames, Iowa. This company has licensed the HMB patents from the Iowa State University Research Foundation (ISURF).</P>
<P>	Not only does MTI own the patent rights, to my knowledge, they're also the only ones who know how to make this stuff in bulk quantities. It took them years to figure out how to produce HMB.</P>
<P>	Literally tens of thousands of bodybuilders are looking for HMB, and unfortunately, over the past few months, it's been in extremely short supply. (Hopefully by the time this magazine gets to the newsstands, the supply situation will be better.) Other supplement companies are aware of the demand for HMB, but they're pulling their hair out because they can't find anybody to make it for them. (It took MTI over four years to get their manufacturer up and running.) So it's not surprising to me, knowing how many scumbags there are in this business, to learn that some companies are going to be putting an HMB label on a product that's just totally and completely fake! These folks are absolute criminals; they're as bad as those dirtbags who sell counterfeit steroids. There's no shortage of people out there who are willing to pour Wesson oil in a vial, put a fake label on it, sell it to you for $20 per milliliter, and tell you it's Deca-Durabolin. What makes you think there would be any shortage of people who'd take some cheap amino acid like glycine, encapsulate it, put it in a bottle, and tell you it's HMB?</P>
<P>	You've got to be careful! At this time, the only brand of HMB capsules on the market which I know to be legit are the ones put out by MTI. In the future, MTI does plan to allow other supplement companies to buy HMB from them and sell it under other brand names. For example, EAS hopes to buy HMB from MTI and sell it under the EAS brand name sometime in the future. But right now, all the details haven't been worked out. I'll stay in contact with MTI and let you know who they're selling HMB to--then I'll tell you which companies have the real stuff.</P>
<P>	If I were you, I would make sure that before you buy any type of HMB, you check the label to see if it lists MTI as the source, and you should also watch for the U.S. Patent Number 5,348,979. That's the sign that the stuff is legit.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="A7"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> One company that makes a very popular meal replacement--a company I can't mention because of an unusual legal matter has advertised a new total-nutrition product containing HMB. At the time I'm writing this column, MTI has not supplied any HMB to this company, but I understand the two companies are in negotiations. I think this new form of "Product X" is supposed to have 1.5 grams of HMB per serving. They are recommending you use two servings a day (clinical studies have shown an effective dose is 3 grams a day).</P>
<P>	Using this product twice a day may produce good results, but Dan Duchaine tipped me off to something recently. He pointed out that HMB has an extremely short "half-life" in the blood--it's in and out of your system in just a few hours. Dan does not recommend only taking HMB twice a day; in fact, he thinks instead of taking one gram (four capsules) three times daily that taking two capsules six times daily might be best. Thus, what I just started doing is taking two capsules of HMB every three hours while I'm awake. This way, the HMB levels in my blood stay more consistent.</P>
<P>	My problem with using a meal-replacement powder that contains 1.5 grams of HMB per serving is that you would lose the versatility you have with capsules. Capsules are extremely convenient--you can keep a small packet of them in your pocket, your briefcase, whatever. It's very easy to take two capsules six times a day. According to the doctors who have extensively studied HMB, they say you can take it on an empty or full stomach--it shouldn't make any difference.</P>
<P>	In the most recent HMB clinical study, the test subjects used HMB in capsules and got great results! 	This was the second study to offer strong evidence that weight trainers who use HMB gain significantly more size and strength than nonusers! Also, test subjects who used HMB in this recent study showed a strong trend for fat loss! The test subjects took one gram of HMB three times daily. So, we have strong evidence to suggest that that dosage schedule is effective. But, it's possible that changing the dosage pattern to two capsules six times daily, instead of four capsules three times daily, may produce even better results! Perhaps this is something researchers might look at sometime in the future.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="A8"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> It seems to make sense that a 125-pound woman would not need to take the same amount of HMB as a 220-lb guy. Unfortunately, no studies have been done to answer this particular question.</P>
<P>	Logic would <I>seem</I> to dictate that if a 220-lb guy gets good results using 3 grams of HMB a day, a 125-lb lady should get good results by using 2 grams a day.</P>
<P>	It also <I>seems</I> to make sense that if a 220-lb bodybuilder gets good results using a maintenance dose of 10 grams a day of creatine monohydrate, then a lady who weighs 125 lbs might only need 5 grams per day. I would think the same would be true for other supplements.</P>
<P>	By the same token, guys who weigh over 220 lbs (and there are quite a few of them who read <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>) might need to take more of these supplements to get optimal results. For example, I know some big bodybuilders (275 pounders) use a maintenance dose of 30 grams of creatine monohydrate a day!</P>
<P>	You can assume that the dosages we talk about most often in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> are basically for guys who weigh between 150 and 220 pounds. If you're in that range (which at least 80% of my readers are), you probably don't need to make any adjustments. If you're not in that weight range, you might think about slightly decreasing or increasing your supplement intake in an attempt to "tailor" the dosage to fit your particular physiological needs. Hopefully, future research will provide us with more "exact" info.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="A9"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> The majority of my readers don't want that kind of information from <I>MM2K</I>. 	A few months ago, we ran a photo essay and simply put down a listing of the top ten finishers at the Mr. Olympia contest, and you would've thought I'd sent a personal letter to tens of thousands of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> readers telling them their mothers were lesbians! I got more nasty letters about that Mr. Olympia "photo essay" than you would believe!</P>
<P>	You see, the guy or gal who picks up <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> expects something different from us. If they want contest coverage, they know to buy <I>Flex</I>. That magazine will tell you everything you want to know about the major bodybuilding contests--who came in first, second, third, tenth, etc. </P>
<P>	<I>Flex</I> magazine is also filled with fantastic photos of pro bodybuilders working out, and it has some articles that have apparently been written by pro bodybuilders where they tell you how many sets they do, what weight they use, etc. </P>
<P>	Basically, coverage of top bodybuilding contests is not something our industry is lacking, neither are fantastic photos of well-built bodybuilding superstars and information on how they work out.</P>
<P>	<I>Muscle Media 2000</I> is not going to get into that--<I>ever!</I> It was not my intention when I started this magazine to come out with a publication that was like the others--I've always strived to make this magazine different--I've been trying to make it <I>useful</I>, and I think we've accomplished that.</P>
<P>	The sales of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> are booming! And people certainly don't read my magazine to find out who won this or that bodybuilding contest nor do they buy <I>MM2K</I> to read how this or that pro claims to have built his or her muscularity.</P>
<P>	The guys and gals who read this magazine do so because they want to find out the <I>real deal</I>. You read <I>MM2K</I> to find out how <I>you</I> can build a better body--this publication is kind of like a guide for "do-it-yourselfers." <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> isn't a magazine for people who "sit on the sidelines"--it's a fitness and physique development magazine for people who specifically want to learn how it's done and how they can do it!</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, most pro bodybuilders can't exactly tell you what they do to get "the look" they have. They're caught between a rock and a hard place. Because virtually all of them use steroids (and a bunch of other bodybuilding drugs), many of which are illegal, they can't openly talk about the use of these compounds. They talk with me about the drugs they use, but such conversations have to be kept confidential for obvious reasons. It's not that I don't like pro bodybuilders--it's not that at all. I have a number of good friends who are pros. It's just that my readers want the <I>whole truth</I>.</P>
<P>	I think the other magazines are good at what they do--like I said, <I>Flex</I> has great bodybuilding contest coverage and incredible photos; <I>MuscleMag</I> has great gossip and some really funny advertisements which I enjoy reading; <I>Muscular Development</I> is the "sexiest" bodybuilding magazine, etc. Each magazine has its own "specialty." <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> unquestionably has the most accurate, <I>honest</I>, straightforward information on "what to use." That is, we have the best information on new bodybuilding supplements and the most honest information on bodybuilding pharmaceuticals.</P>
<P>	We also have some pretty good training articles and some good information on nutrition, and I think, overall, Muscle Media 2000 has a pretty good sense of humor. But, the main reason people read Muscle Media 2000 is because they want to find out what to use and how to use it. That's what we're good at, so it makes sense that we should focus on that the most.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="A10"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> You know, I've been getting more and more questions like this over the past few months. It's an obvious sign that more ladies are taking an interest in "bodybuilding." I'm certain the reason more women than ever before are interested in weight training is because the muscle magazines have stopped running so many "freakish" pictures of female bodybuilders and have been featuring drug-free lifters like Monica Brant, Mia Finnegan, Laurie Donnelly, etc. Now, gals like your girlfriend can see that weight-training exercise and proper nutrition can help them build a beautiful body.
	If you'd like to help your girlfriend out, I'd suggest you read an article I wrote in the latest issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> called "The Right Way." It's on page 104 of the May issue.</P>
	This is a great article for guys who act as "personal trainers" for the women in their lives. This article will help answer your question.<P><HR>
<B>Just A Few More Things...</B>	<P>I'd like to say thanks to all the people who take the time to write in with their questions, positive comments, and feedback. I really appreciate it!</P>
<P>	I want to let you know I do everything I can to provide each and every one of you with the answers you're looking for--I personally answer literally hundreds of letters each month! (I'll bet I answer more letters each month than any publisher in this business ever has!)</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, I cannot provide a detailed response to every single question (I provide an answer to at least 90% of the letters I get).</P>
<P>	And, there are some subjects I just can't give you a personal reply on--one of those subjects that is strictly "off limits" is the use of bodybuilding drugs. For obvious legal reasons, I can't give people "one-on-one" advice that pertains to the use of steroids, insulin, IGF-1, etc. All the information I have about those kinds of topics is addressed in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> or in my <I>Anabolic Reference Guide</I> (the most comprehensive book ever written on bodybuilding drugs. That book is advertised on page 91 of the May issue).</P>
<P>	For those who have detailed questions about supplement use (a topic I can address in a one-on-one letter), I request that before you send me your questions, you thoroughly read my new <I><A HREF="http://www.mm2k.com/nsr/nsr96.html">1996 Supplement Review</A></I>. That book has the answers to almost every supplement question you can think of. <A HREF="http://www.mm2k.com/nsr/nsr_of.html">Here's where to order this book for FREE!</A></P>
<P>	I'm dedicated to providing you with specific, practical, "how-to" bodybuilding information, but unfortunately, I can't do this for every single person who reads the magazine. Believe me...if I could, I would! (Since I know the answers to 98% of the questions I receive off the top of my head, it really frustrates me that I just don't have the time.) The good news is I'll be writing more and more articles for <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> that address the "frequently asked questions" of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> readers, and it won't be long before <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> will be a monthly magazine!</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> I was steroid shopping in Tijuana and found some small blue bottles of methandrostenolone made by Ludwig Heun in West Germany (at least, that's what the bottle said).  Is this stuff real?</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> No. It's counterfeit.  I happen to know the entire history of this counterfeit because I  designed the bottle, label, and tablets.  <P>
<P>	Starting in 1985, I worked closely with a Tijuana pharmaceutical manufacturing company called Laboratory Milano.  For many years, Laboratory Milano produced generic medications, primarily antibiotics, for Mexican drugstores. The laboratory was named Milano because the owner, Juan Machlis, purchased all of the raw materials through a procurement company based in Milano, Italy.  Whenever a drug was needed, the procurement company would find a source of it and usually charge between 10% to 15% over wholesale cost.</P>
<P>	When brand-name Dianabol and generic methandrostenolone were removed from the American market, several companies began making counterfeit versions, but all of them had problems.  Some of the pills were so poorly made and so loosely held together that you could use them as blackboard writing chalk.  Others were good but elusive, i.e., hard to find.  </P>
<P>	About the same time, an Indian crime family based in England began repackaging the Indian Pronabol 5 (methandrostenolone) tablets into small white bottles and labeled them as if the product were from Ludwig Heun GmbH KG, West Germany.  This was a very nice product, and I remember going to various hotel rooms near the Los Angeles airport to buy thousands of bottles  from a bearded, turbaned old gentleman who looked like a diplomat. But as nice as the product was, I could never depend on consistent shipments.</P>
<P>	So I persuaded Laboratory Milano to manufacture methandrostenolone to my specifications.  I designed a tiny light blue bottle with a white metal cap.  I supplied the Indian/English Ludwig Heun bottle label so Milano could copy it.  I picked this label for two reasons:  1) On the black market, the brand had established itself as a good, reliable product, and  2) I wanted to avoid any ties or references to Mexican manufacture simply because, at the time, most steroid users distrusted any Mexican steroid product. The unfounded assertion was that the Mexican drugs were not as potent as the European versions.  Besides, calling it "Duchainabol" was out of the question. </P>
<P>	Methandrostenolone was the first steroid produced by Laboratory Milano, and we made sure each tablet always contained at least six milligrams of the steroid.  The cost for the raw materials and packaging was only $0.50 per unit, but we sold it for $4.50.  After that, we made counterfeit versions (always with real steroids in them) of Lemmon testosterone cypionate and Lemmon nandrolone decanoate. This was a screw up on my part because testosterone cypionate and nandrolone decanoate were never made by Lemmon.  I unknowingly had bought counterfeit steroids to duplicate!  </P>
<P>	The original source of our methandrostenolone was from Germany.  We also purchased oxandrolone from Searle in England.  This was ironic because Laboratory Milano and I duplicated the Searle Anavar exactly (the tablet mold cost us $10,000) and sold it for half the cost of what Searle sold it for wholesale to pharmacies. Searle became so frustrated over this (we sold the counterfeit Anavar to American pharmacies) that the Anavar bottle size was doubled to differentiate between ours and theirs.  </P>
<P>	All the steroid tablets were smuggled in bulk across the border and dropped off at various motel rooms around San Diego. The bottles and labels were made in Tijuana and legally exported to America.  Mexican women would count tablets, load them into the bottles, and box them in packages of 100.</P>
<P>	I stopped working with Laboratory Milano in the fall of 1986.  From that point on, the company cranked up production and flooded the American black market.  Just before the arrest of the major "players" (myself included), Laboratory Milano produced some unusual products which I had designed.  One was a methandrostenolone with a diuretic and liver antitoxin added. Others included very powerful injectable versions of oxandrolone and oxymetholone.  I can honestly say that these two exotic injectables are the most potent steroids I have ever used.</P>
<P>	Since the breakup and prosecution of the Laboratory Milano conspiracy, the company has ceased all operations.  Nevertheless, some of the former employees still have the ability to produce the various bottles, labels, and tablets of the various steroids.  However, none of these current counterfeits have any steroid in them, the Ludwig Heun version included.  So if you see any European steroid being sold in a Mexican pharmacy, it's a counterfeit with no active steroid ingredients.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> Whenever I use clenbuterol, it works great for about two weeks.  After that, I can use ten tabs a day and my temperature will hardly rise.  What can I do about this?</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> Clenbuterol is a beta-2 agonist.  It attaches to the same receptor as your natural adrenaline and noradrenaline do.  It has a very high bonding capacity to the adrenergic receptor.  Whenever a drug fits well onto a cell receptor, the receptor becomes resistant to that drug.  For example, the thermogenic effect of ephedrine seems to have a longer duration (though it's not as potent) for two reasons:  1) ephedrine doesn't have a high receptor affinity, and 2) ephedrine is not beta-2 specific.
<P>	You might have heard about the newly discovered beta-3 receptors. The receptor is primarily a thermogenic messenger, and over half the thermogenic effect from ephedrine is from beta-3 stimulation.  Although the thermogenic message is not as intense as the beta-2 message, beta-3 receptors are very resistant to down-regulation.  Clenbuterol, however, has very little beta-3 stimulation.</P>
<P>	Until some new synthetic beta-3 agonist is commercially available, the beta agonist of choice is still clenbuterol (although the stronger cimaterol is available as a research chemical in the U.S.).  The rapid receptor sensitivity attenuation happens to all users, and the various dosage schemes (i.e., two days on, two days off) just aren't successful.  </P>
<P>	This attenuation and the lowering of above-normal body temperature are governed by two different mechanisms.  I've written about one of them before: the shunting of T4 thyroid away from the active T3 form into the ineffective reverse-T3.  Most of the thyroid in the body is the inactive T4 type.  The active thyroid that actually fits onto thyroid receptors is a reduced T4, and reduced T4 occurs when one of the iodine atoms is cleaved off the molecule by a specific enzyme (deiodinase).  Since we have no way of stopping the T4 from being transformed into ineffective reverse-T3 instead of the active T3, and there's no such thing as injectable deiodinase (which would prevent the reduction), the best approach is to supplement the missing T3 with Cytomel, a synthetic T3.  </P>
<P>	The trouble is, it's likely a daily amount of Cytomel higher than 25 mcg would eventually stop the production of natural thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and the up-regulation will take about 8 weeks. Then, when you go off Cytomel, your body's still laggin' in production of TSH.  So now you know why almost everybody who stops taking thyroid (with the exception of the drug Triacana) gets fat.  For eight weeks, the body doesn't need as many calories.</P>
<P>	Up to this point, the Cytomel trick was only a partial solution.  The second and major decrease of body temperature is caused by the down-regulation of the beta-2 receptor.  The receptor actually is still in the cell but not in its usual place.  The receptor must be at the outside of the cell surface to be available to the beta agonist.  There is research showing that the antihistamine ketotifen (trade name Zaditen by Sandoz) in large dosages will up-regulate the beta-2 receptors.  This is similar to the American Periactin (cyproheptadine).  This class of antihistamine will cause drowsiness, hunger, and irritability, but you may think the negative symptoms are a small price to play. </P>
<P>	Here are the particulars.  Zaditen is only available in France in 1-mg capsules, 60 capsules to a box.  It sells for 65.10 francs (about $12.25).  Because of its appetite-stimulating and muscle-building properties, Zaditen is sold through some of the American AIDS buying clubs.  The average price for it in America is $40 a box.  The dose needed for the up-regulation of the beta-2 receptors is about 10 capsules (10 mg)--assuming you've been using 3 clenbuterol tablets (60 mcg) each day.  Sigma Chemicals, the company that has all the bodybuilding goodies that we like but can't buy (including steroids), does sell ketotifen (the fumarate version is water soluble) in raw bulk form.  Keep in mind that even when used with clenbuterol, which both reduces appetite and is more of a stimulant than caffeine, Zaditen will still cause sleepiness and hunger.  Those aren't nice effects, especially if you're dieting.</P>
<P>	Your final solution to sustain clenbuterol's action is to use both Cytomel (25 mcg) and Zaditen (10 mg) each day after using clenbuterol by itself for 2 weeks.  You'll need only 60 mcg of clenbuterol for a very pronounced thermogenic effect, hypothetically speaking, of course.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> A few months back, I read that I should eat protein with each carb meal when I carb up for my contest.  Why is this?  Is there a particular protein that would be better to use than others?</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> Between the small intestine and the liver, all proteins are reduced to individual amino acids.  And each amino has the ability to cause both insulin and glucagon secretion from the pancreas.  Glucagon is insulin's evil twin: it's considered a catabolic hormone.  However, glucagon secretion doesn't happen in large amounts until blood glucose falls to about 50 mg per decaliter (one tenth of a liter).  Unlike insulin, which circulates in the blood, the small amount of glucagon secreted from amino acids stays mostly in the liver. Glucagon's job in the liver is to speed the release of glycogen.  Glycogen is a complex starch.  The same type of glycogen stored in the liver is also stored in skeletal muscle.  Glucagon sends the message to the liver to reconvert glycogen back to glucose, which is then released into the bloodstream. 
<P>The reason why eating protein along with carbohydrates causes more muscle glycogen deposition is because the extra insulin (although insulin secretion from amino acids is small compared to a glucose response) is available in the bloodstream, and the glucagon pushes glucose out of the liver into the bloodstream.
<P>It might be more efficient to use an isolated amino acid with a carbohydrate meal to "push" blood glucose into muscle cells.  Not all amino acids have the same ability to generate insulin and glucagon. In looking over the scientific research, you'll find that the amino acid glycine elicits the highest secretion of both insulin and glucagon. The branched-chain amino acids elicit very little glucagon secretion, although the BCAA's (especially leucine) are good for boosting insulin.  
	Now that we know about the nice glucagon pulse caused by glycine, you might see some nutrition company make an alpha-ketoglutarate variant with glycine (rather than ornithine).</P>

<H3>Part Two</H3><P>
<H3>ANABOLIC STEROIDS IN EUROPE</H3><P>
<H4>An Interview by T.C. Luoma</H4></CENTER>
<P><B>As a whole, Americans are rather provincial--we think we're the best at everything, know everything, and set the pace for the rest of the world, while other countries, bless their hearts, are, well, kind of primitive.  This is particularly true of bodybuilding.  Most of us assume the rest of the world still lifts concrete-filled paint buckets and car axles.  And the Europeans?  Well, they've evolved past the paint-bucket stage, but not by much.  I mean, aside from a few bodybuilders with funny names who had to come to the U.S. to get really big, who have they got of any notoriety?    </P>
<P>	Well, let me tell you, nothing could be further from the truth.  Several European countries take their training seriously, even investing considerable amounts of money into bona-fide weight-training research.  And, since drugs are much more readily available in many European countries, their knowledge of drugs surpasses ours.</P>
<P>	To find out more about the European scene--particularly the drug scene--we made a few calls, checked a few contacts, and found Laslo Hortobagyi, a former competitive bodybuilder from Budapest, Hungary.  After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hortobagyi moved to Innsbruck, Austria, where he works as a personal trainer.  It was there that we contacted him.  What ensued was a fascinating and eye-opening interview.</B></P><HR>
<P><I><CENTER>The following is Part 2 of a two-part interview:</CENTER></I></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>MUSCLE MEDIA 2000</FONT><B>: Without regard to cost, what's the most-asked-for steroid on the black market?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>LAZLO HORTOBAGYI</FONT>:  I would say Parabolan is probably the most-asked-for injectable steroid. News of it being remade in France by a new company has been the source of many wet dreams for European bodybuilders.
	The most sought oral steroid is the bootleg form of the East-German Turinabol. It has a very strong cult following with German-speaking bodybuilders, particularly the ones who are closet powerlifters. This drug is unequaled for strength gains, especially when stacked with the Italian oxandrolone. At dosages as low as 10 mg a day of Turinabol, users report overcoming plateaus in strength and hypertrophy development. The normal dosage is about 0.5 mg per kg of bodyweight, but that dosage is often doubled and even quadrupled.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  Do the Europeans use much clenbuterol?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>:  Not as much as they used to. During the clenbuterol craze, most of the clenbuterol used came from veterinary sources. Vet clenbuterol is about a tenth of the price of human clenbuterol.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  Earlier, you said rumors influence steroid use.  What did you mean by that?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P>LH:  Rumors influence the makeup of steroid cycles to a terrible degree, particularly when steroid pushers want to unload large quantities of a given steroid. You will hear statements like, "My cousin sells the 'gear' to 'Mr. O,' and he says that he takes two Parabolans a day, and this and that..." Then, everybody rushes to buy his very convenient supply of Parabolan. Another guy may claim he is Mr. America's Italian cousin and says, ''He took a bottle of Anavar [oxandrolone] a day and 800 mg of Deca a week when he was at his best," and BOOM, he gets rid of 10,000 tabs of oxandrolone and 2,000 vials of Deca.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>: Are veterinary steroids popular in Europe?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>: The only veterinary steroid that has been used on a significant basis is the French equivalent to Canadian Equipoise. However, the dosage per cc is very weak; therefore, it's seldom used except by bodybuilders in rural areas.</P>
<P> </P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  From what you've told me, it seems as if the Europeans are much more advanced than Americans in regards to steroid use.  Is my assumption correct?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>:  Yes, and this holds true regarding training, too.  Without a doubt, the Northern Europeans--the Finns, Swedes, Germans, Austrians, and Norwegians--probably train the most scientifically. Sports science is highly developed in these countries, and unlike the North Americans, they like to study top-level bodybuilders and pass on the information. For example, the <I>Muscle Meets Magnet</I> book, which answers many questions on the muscle-recruitment effect of a variety of exercises, was written by Swedish exercise physiologist P.A. Tesch. </P>
<P>	The Americans, however, seem to get their act together better with nutrition and supplementation. In fact, European top pro bodybuilders will stock up on American supplements when competing in the U.S.  But of course, there are exceptions to the rule.  Creatine was used by British track and field athletes as well as Norwegian speed skaters years before American bodybuilders started using it.</P>
<P>	That brings up a point.  If one wants to get ahead in the drug scene, he should talk to cyclists, track athletes, or tennis players. These guys are more on the cutting edge of ergogens than any bodybuilders.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  If European bodybuilders, particularly Italian and Spanish ones, have such easy access to such efficient drugs, why aren't they bigger?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>:  I guess you could say the same about Mexican bodybuilders.  There are a lot of steroids there, but looking at the average Mexican trainee, you would think Darwin's evolutionary theory was in reverse gear--they are smaller, not larger, than most American or European trainees.</P>
<P>	Variations of cultures and laziness in training have a lot to do with why they are not bigger. <I>Steroid availability does not necessarily equate to bodybuilding success.</I> If steroids were the most important key to bodybuilding success, then France, Spain, Greece, and Italy would produce the best bodybuilders. In the countries mentioned above, using minimal ingenuity, one can buy truckloads of high-quality anabolics like Primobolan and Stromba.</P>
<P>	Again, steroids alone are obviously no guarantee of success.  Two French bodybuilders came here [Austria] for a ski vacation. The ski conditions were not very good, so they decided to come and train at our gym. They were strutting around like peacocks and started discussing dosages with everybody--even some customs officers--and everyone was snickering at these, how do you say it in American?  <I>Dweebs?</I>  One guy was on 8 Parabolans a week and 60 mg of Dianabol, yet he looked like a muscular swimmer. The other guy was using over 200 mg a day of various anabolics, plus 4 IU of GH [growth hormone] a day, and he again had a physique that most people can achieve naturally on a three-day-a-week program. Once I saw them train, I understood everything. They were so very, very weak for guys using so many drugs. One of our local boys came in, and the gym was very busy, and he wanted the Olympic bar the dweebs were using for bench press.  He walked over to the bench-press unit and started curling--in very strict fashion--the bench-press poundages they were using for their touch-and-go sets. I thought their eyeballs were going to fall out of their sockets. After completing his set of curls, he looked at them and said in a low Teutonic voice, <I>"Geh raus Spargeltarzans"</I> [Get lost, asparagus Tarzans].  Needless to say, they did not show up again at our gym.  They are now probably very avid Ping-Pong players...  </P>
<P>	First and foremost, genetics are the key to bodybuilding success. Countries where people tend to have naturally high levels of muscle mass, like Holland and Germany, produce large bodybuilders <I>&agrave; la</I> DeMey and Albrecht.</P>
<P>	Even though Italians and Spaniards are very macho in their attitudes, they don't associate muscle mass with masculinity. To be big is looked down upon in those countries  The way they train is the antithesis of what a guy like your Shawn Phillips would advocate. They train with endless sets of low effort and spend more time chit-chatting, grabbing their crotches, and staring down female members than applying effort. Their diet is also terrible. You cannot make bodybuilding gains on a breakfast of sweetened bread, butter, marmalade, and espresso coffee. </P>
<P>	Austrian and German bodybuilders who train in Italy scare the shit out of the clientele at the gym. The Germanic bodybuilders have a lot more intensity in their bodybuilding efforts and will out load and ridicule the wimpy poundages of their Italian counterparts. They still have the <I>Deutschland &Uuml;ber alles!</I> attitude.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  What kind of cycling patterns do the Europeans typically use?  You gave us an example of  what I presumed to be a contest cycle in Part I, but what about off-season cycles?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>: Steroids are taken for a very long time in Europe. Here is an actual Austrian national title winner's off-season cycle [Lazlo then pulled out the following lists from his briefcase]. The bodybuilder was  89 kg [196 lbs] at the start of this cycle.</P>

<P></P>
<P>	Following this 20-week steroid cycle, he would do a 6-8 week course of HCG and Clomid to try to restore his endocrine system.  Then a three-month steroid-free period would be observed.</P>
<P>	By week 15, Deprenyl, piracetam, and Hydergine would be added. Supplemental acetyl-l-carnitine, orotic acid, and AKG would be used to prevent muscle catabolism.</P>
<P>	Orciprenaline--a beta-agonist--is also used to maintain the lean body mass after the cycle. Albuterol is also used for the same purpose. A dose before a workout has been shown to increase strength between two and four percent only one hour after administering it.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  Wow. Those steroid dosages are pretty high, aren't they?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>: They are fairly typical, yet I have seen much higher dosages.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  Really?  For instance...</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>: Well, a 20-year-old Junior World Bodybuilding Championships finalist was using the following: injectables--a weekly dosage of 1,000 mg of testosterone heptylate, 1,000 mg of Dynabolon, and 532 mg of Parabolan; and orals--8 tablets of 50-mg oral Primobolan on a daily basis. If you calculate it, he was using 1,143 mg of various anabolics a day!!! He weighs 95 kg [209 lbs] at a height of 160 cm [5'2«"].</P>
<P>	One of the bouncers here at the local disco uses 30 vials of 50 mg of stanozolol a week, 2,000 mg of enanthate, 1,000 mg of propionate, and 1,000 mg of suspension, and of course, one Plenastril per meal [he eats 6 times a day]. He is 180 cm [70 in] tall and weighs 134 kg [295 lbs] at probably 10% bodyfat. It works out to be 1,085 mg a day!</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  Tell me more about the use of Deprenyl, piracetam, and Hydergine.  These are all parts of the life-extension drug family, aren't they?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>:  Deprenyl, also known as selegiline hydrochloride, is a monoamine oxidase [MAO] inhibitor normally used as a minor adjunctive treatment to the administration of L-Dopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The MAO activity permits the increase of active dopamine levels. It is used by athletes for its positive effects on the central nervous system. </P>
<P>	Bodybuilders using this dopamine agonist alone report a boost of libido during or after steroid cycles and increased muscle mass and a decrease in bodyfat. These ergogenic effects come from the fact that selegiline boosts the body's output of the gonadotropins. Other positive effects of Deprenyl are improved memory and cognition, but bodybuilders probably don't care about that.</P>
<P>	One problem with it is this drug is converted to methamphetamine and amphetamine in humans through normal metabolic pathways. An athlete using this product may therefore test positive for methamphetamine/amphetamine use.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  What's the typical dosage for Deprenyl?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>:  Athletes under the age of 60 report ergogenic effects on a dose as low as a 1.5-mg tablet every 3 to 4 days.  Higher dosages will give you the libido of 20 adult rabbits.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>: What does Hydergine do?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>:  Hydergine was originally developed in Switzerland for the treatment of high blood pressure; it worked poorly for this purpose.  However, it is known to have various other beneficial effects such as increasing the supply of blood and oxygen to the brain, increasing brain-cell metabolism, accelerating the dismantling of lypofusin--an aging pigment--in the brain, and improving intelligence.</P>
<P>	Athletes use Hydergine to boost learning and concentration and to increase growth-hormone output. I have seen athletes drop significant amounts of bodyfat while using nine milligrams a day of this substance.  Although not documented in scientific circles, bodybuilders report that it also potentiates the use of pre-workout stimulants such as ephedrine.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  What about piracetam? I sometimes use this before I write to improve my concentration.</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>:  Yes, piracetam is used by life extensionists to boost memory and cognitive function. It was one of the first nootropics developed. It was formulated in the '60's by the Belgian pharmaceutical company UCB. It is a close relative of the amino acid pyroglutamate. In medical circles, it has been used to treat a variety of ailments ranging from alcoholism to dementia to dyslexia. Piracetam potentiates the effect of Hydergine, psychotropics, and amphetamines--hence, its popularity in competitive strongmen circles.</P>
<P>	Even though it was first used by boxers and martial artists to boost learning of their sport skills; bodybuilders, strength athletes, and track athletes use it nowadays for its central-nervous-system-boosting properties. It was used as early as 1986 by athletes of the former East Germany. It was administered in that country to weightlifters and boxers for its enhanced noradrenaline releasing properties. After 11 weeks of treatment, one can experience better growth-hormone release and increased levels of dopamine in the brain.  Apparently, in the aftermath of all the positive drug tests in the Seoul Olympics, Bulgarian weightlifters and their Romanian colleagues jumped on the bandwagon.  They also use it to access more of the high-threshold fast-twitch fibers and to improve concentration. One should expect ergogenic effects only two to three weeks after beginning treatment.</P>
<P>	Incidentally, I know of a 30-year-old sprinter who took piracetam on a consistent basis of 6 tabs a day and managed to improve his P.B. [personal best] in the 60-meter run by a full tenth of a second.</P>
<P> 	Second generation piracetam-like drugs, such as oxiracetam and aniracetam, give the same results at half the dosage.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  In what dosages is  piracetam being used?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>: Athletes use a dosage pattern similar to creatine. In other words, they use large amounts, five to six 800-mg tabs for a week or so and then cut back to 2-3 tabs a day. When stacked with Hydergine, absorption increases fivefold, so a much lower dosage can be used. Piracetam is not yet on the banned substances list.</P>
<P>	German and Austrian bodybuilders normally take one 400-mg tab, along with a 2-mg  Hydergine tab, 3 times daily.</P>
<P>	At higher dosages, the desired effect is reversed, and the sought-after enhanced memory and concentration capability turns into partial amnesia and confusion. Therefore, be aware that piracetam is potentiated by choline, Hydergine, DMAE, and Centrophenoxine.</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>MM</FONT><B>:  What about powerlifters and Olympic-style lifters?  Do you know anything about their patterns of drug use?</B></P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>LH</FONT>: First of all, they use more growth hormone than bodybuilders. Because they have more money than bodybuilders, they can afford more products. They use growth hormone for its ability to regenerate the connective tissue.</P>
<P>	They tend to use a lot of testosterones: propionate, Sustanon, and of course, suspension. Undoubtedly, Plenastril from Switzerland [oxymetholone, known as Anadrol in the U.S.] is the oral of choice.  A minimum of three tabs a day is taken, with the average dose being five tabs a day. Turinabol is the preferred oral if available.</P>
<P> 	Strongmen love androgens because it's a well-known fact that the nervous system has receptors for androgens. They excite the nervous system and allow the athlete to use high loads. This explains why the German injectable form of Halotestin is so popular. It's less toxic than its oral counterpart and has very strong central-nervous-system excitation properties. However, the personalities of guys on it make Ted Bundy look like Mother Theresa. It is basically bottled 'roid rage.</P>
<P>	Close to competitions, they will use plenty of Halotestin and oxandrolone along with testosterone suspension.  Strongmen also use a lot of stimulants to get up for workouts. The drawback is they depress the appetite. No appetite, no eating; no eating, no gains. So the trend is to use a glucose/amino-acid drip [IV] right after the workout to feed the cells. Normal appetite comes back within an hour or two after the drip. </P>
<P>	The favorite stimulants of the strongmen are Nivalin and nicergoline from Bulgaria and Sydnocarb from Estonia and Russia.</P>

<A HREF=#A1><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A>	I read about this new company called "Muscle-Tech" in an article in <I>MuscleMag</I> recently. How do you rate this company’s products?<P>
<A HREF=#A2><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> 	I recently read that using the amino acid arginine can cause a significant increase in IGF-1 levels. I've read a lot about IGF-1, and it sounds like this is an important hormone for muscle growth. Do you know how much arginine I should take?<P>
<A HREF=#A3><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've been using 70 mg of vanadyl sulfate a day, and I've been getting really good results. I just wonder, since I'm using more than the "recommended dose," should I be cycling this stuff?<P>
<A HREF=#A4><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've heard a lot about top bodybuilders using insulin to help them gain muscle, and I've read some things about this in the various magazines, but I can't quite understand it. Why use insulin? I thought high insulin levels made you fat. You have a knack for explaining things (sometimes complicated things) in a way I can understand. What's this whole insulin thing about?<P>
<A HREF=#A5><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> Do you think RU 486 is a good bodybuilding drug?<P>
<A HREF=#A6><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> The guy who runs my gym told me he's going to start carrying a form of HMB put out by American Strength and Fitness or something like that. Do you know if their HMB is any good?<P>
<A HREF=#A7><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I saw an ad for a total-nutrition product in <I>Ironman</I> magazine that's supposed to have HMB in it. Is that real?<P>
<A HREF=#A8><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I was wondering if the recommended dosage of supplements like creatine monohydrate, HMB, CLA, and vanadyl sulfate should be adjusted according to bodyweight. Do you have any information on this?<P>
<A HREF=#A9><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> Why doesn't <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> have any bodybuilding contest coverage in it? How come there aren't any articles about the bodybuilding champions?<P>
<A HREF=#A10><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've been trying to get my girlfriend to work out with weights, use supplements, and so on, but for a long time she has resisted--she told me she didn't want to end up looking like one of those "grotesque" female bodybuilders. But, more recently, she's taken an interest in training with weights. I finally convinced her that free-weight exercise isn't going to make her look like a freak. Anyway, I wanted to know what type of nutrition, exercise, and supplement program you'd recommend for a relatively fit (my girlfriend only needs to lose a few pounds of fat, and she wants to put on some muscle) 28-year-old woman. I think she has the potential to look like one of those fitness models like Monica Brant or Laurie Donnelly.

<P>
<A NAME="A1"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> There's not much information available on Muscle-Tech. But what I've seen so far lacks credibility.</P>
<P>	Take this claim which appeared in that recent article for example, "...Muscle-Tech's products are over 500% more effective than any supplement currently available." I'd sure like to see the substantiation for that! Five-hundred percent more effective, huh? (Ridiculous claims like this make it hard to believe <I>any</I> of the claims made about Muscle-Tech products.) If Muscle-Tech can prove that claim, I'll personally cut them a check for $10,000!</P>
<P>	I have the results of a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, which was done at a legitimate university and presented to scientists at the International Sports Nutrition Conference last September and is now <I>peer reviewed</I>, that show the Experimental and Applied Sciences (EAS) product Phosphagain<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>; produces an average gain in lean mass of 5.35 lbs in just 28 days (which is a <B>BIG</B> gain!).</P>
<P>	Okay...if Muscle-Tech's new supplements are 500% more effective than Phosphagain, then they'd produce an average gain of 26.75 lbs (5.35 x 500%) of lean mass in 28 days. That, my friends, ain't the case! There's no F-in' way any supplement has been shown to produce gains like that.</P>
<P>	The article constantly mentions Muscle-Tech's research, although it never mentions where this research is being done, where it'll be presented, who's doing it, etc. I repeatedly attempted to contact this Muscle-Tech company to ask for more information on their research but made no progress. One of our <I>MM2K</I> researchers contacted Greg Zulak (who wrote the Muscle-Tech article), but Zulak couldn't provide any information that could back the "unbelievable" claims made in his article.</P>
<P>	Nowadays, you see supplement companies throwing around the word "research" all the time. For many supplement companies, "research" means flipping through muscle magazines and trying to figure out what products are selling well and then attempting to imitate these products--that's basically what most "research" in the bodybuilding business consists of.</P>
<P>	In the last issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, I said EAS was going to conduct more research to find out what the optimal doses of creatine monohydrate are for bodybuilders. What I meant by "research" was that double-blind, placebo-controlled university studies are going to be conducted, and scientific, analytical methods such as muscle biopsies, body-composition tests, performance evaluations, etc. will be made before and after giving the subjects various doses of creatine monohydrate. Then, the statistics will be compiled by experts, and the data will be presented at a scientific conference. That's research!</P>
<P>	One of the products mentioned in that <I>MuscleMag</I> article, that I've been getting a lot of questions on, is something called acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC). ALC hasn't been <I>proven</I> to do <I>anything</I> positive for bodybuilders--there's some research that shows it may help mitigate chronic stress-related reductions in testosterone levels, but I looked everywhere and couldn't find any studies showing ALC has ever been shown to stimulate testosterone, much less promote muscle size and strength in healthy weight-training humans. When Zulak describes ALC, he says, "ALC is the only product I know of that has steroid-like effects--but without the negative side effects. The great feature about ALC is that, unlike steroids, it doesn't cause you to lose muscle when you stop taking it. There's no depression, increase of estrogen, zits..." Blah, blah, blah! Where's the substantiation for such claims?</P>
<P>	Before you'd be able to legally make claims like these, you'd have to do double-blind, placebo-controlled university studies in weight-training athletes. You'd have to measure their testosterone levels, their body composition, and all kinds of things. You'd have to compare ALC users to test subjects who consumed a placebo, and if you wanted to say that ALC doesn't cause you to lose muscle when you stop taking it, you'd have to continue to study the test subjects after they quit using the compound. What Zulak is claiming is that the gains in muscle size you make from ALC are permanent, and not only is there not any proof that ALC produces <I>any</I> gains in size and strength to begin with, making a claim that the gains are permanent is really, really going out on a limb. I know of no compound in the world that produces permanent gains in muscle size and strength... Steroids don't even do this! Using supplements or drugs that may accelerate lean mass and strength gains is similar to weight training itself in that if you stop doing it, eventually you'll lose what you've gained. The body always tries to go back to "normal." For example, would you expect to go out in the sun for two weeks and get a nice tan and then stay tan for the rest of your life? Of course not! It just doesn't work like that.</P>
<P>	In Zulak's defense, he's really not a supplement expert and maybe he's being fed information that he just assumed was correct--he might not have the knowledge to understand the difference between what's real and what's not. When I first started writing ten years ago, I made the same mistake myself a few times--I didn't know any better. But I now have a lot more experience and knowledge in the field of bodybuilding supplements, and I also know the difference between proof, evidence, and <I>total bullshit!</I></P>
<P>	I'm certain you'll start to see ads for Muscle-Tech supplements showing up in <I>MuscleMag</I>, and if the same claims show up in their ads that were made in this recent article, I hope they've got a great lawyer who can help them explain all of this to the Federal Trade Commission.</P>
<P>	And, finally, I want to reiterate my proposal to Muscle-Tech--if they can prove their supplements are 500% more effective (I assume they mean for gaining lean mass) than any other supplements available, I'll Federal Express them a check for $10,000 immediately. (Am I nice, or what?!)</P>

<A NAME="A2"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> What you read about arginine increasing IGF-1 levels originated with a study presented last year in the <I>Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition</I>. In that study, 45 subjects who used 30 grams of arginine aspartate a day for 14 days experienced a significant increase in blood IGF-1 levels.
	Unfortunately, I don't think this study really has all that much application for bodybuilders--you see, the subjects in this recent arginine study were between the ages of 67 and 82. Typically, by that age, a number of our bodies' key hormones will be well below what they are when we're in our 20's and 30's. It's extremely possible that arginine does not increase IGF-1 levels in young, healthy bodybuilders. But, hopefully, someone will study the effects 30 grams of arginine aspartate has on bodybuilders, and hopefully, they'll measure not only IGF-1 levels but body composition and strength as well--these are the most important factors to me and most other supplement users. For now, I'd say hold off on arginine--there are better supplements to spend your hard-earned money on.</P>

<A NAME="A3"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I'd say yes. A lot of bodybuilders have been using 70 to 100 mg of vanadyl sulfate a day, but I don't recommend this much. I've been getting great results with 45 mg a day, and I think that's all most lifters need. But if you want to use more, I'd definitely "cycle it." For example, you might use it for six weeks, stay off it for four weeks, then use it for six more weeks and so on.</P>

<A NAME="A4"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> Okay... Here's your insulin crash course: as you most likely know, insulin is a protein hormone that's secreted by an organ right in the middle of your gut called the pancreas. You might think of insulin as a "nutrient storage hormone." Simply put, what insulin does is escort protein (amino acids) and carbohydrates (glucose or blood sugar) into various cells of the body.</P>
<P>	For example, let's say you just drank a glass of orange juice. That orange juice is processed by your digestive system into the simplest form of carbohydrate (glucose), and it's shuttled into your bloodstream. Then, insulin comes along and takes that glucose into various cells where it's used for energy or stored.</P>
<P>	Insulin also helps glucose and amino acids get into muscle cells which facilitates anabolism. And, it can help prevent the breakdown of muscle tissue which makes it anti-catabolic.</P>
<P>	But as you mentioned, insulin can be a "double-edged sword." That is, it can also prevent the breakdown of bodyfat and increase bodyfat storage.</P>
<P>	However, a lot of bodybuilders are using insulin, and they're not getting fat--they're getting bigger and more cut than ever. Why is this? Well, it seems insulin, when given to a lean, muscular bodybuilder, increases definition and muscle fullness. But insulin, when given to obese persons, can make them even fatter.</P>
<P>	Remember how I told you insulin was a "nutrient storage" hormone? Well, it's also a nutrient storage hormone with <I>bias</I>. If you're placing extreme physical demands on your body by doing intense weight training and you're not taking in an excess amount of calories, the insulin in your body wants to take nutrients to muscle cells preferentially over fat cells.</P>
<P>	On the other hand, if you're a sedentary person who consumes an excess number of calories, day in and day out, insulin will increase your bodyfat levels.</P>
<P>	Now, a lot of top bodybuilders are using insulin, along with growth hormone, steroids, clenbuterol, thyroid drugs, and/or IGF-1. In that environment, it appears insulin's even more effective, and it may cause growth hormone (GH) and IGF-1 to become potent muscle builders and fat burners. (I'm <I>not</I> convinced IGF-1 or GH are all that great on their own.)</P>
<P>	There's no doubt that insulin use is having a major impact on pro bodybuilding--I have firsthand information that a bodybuilder who came out of nowhere last year and almost won the Olympia is a master with insulin--he really knows what he's doing!</P>
<P>	Injectable insulin is something that has been used for many years by diabetics--these are people who have a disease which prevents their bodies from making enough insulin (Type I diabetes), or they have a defect that causes their cells not to recognize insulin (Type II diabetes).</P>
<P>	Usually, Type I diabetics have to take insulin shots a few times each day to help their bodies transport glucose out of their blood and into cells. Now, you might be wondering if insulin is such a great bodybuilding drug, how come all diabetics aren't muscular and lean? Well, remember what I said earlier--how insulin works depends a lot on who's using it. Bodybuilders who are already lean and have a lot of muscle can get even bigger and leaner with insulin use, but for people who aren't working out hard with weights and aren't already quite muscular and aren't using other bodybuilding drugs, insulin would probably have virtually no positive effects on body composition.	</P>
<P>	Anyway, the bodybuilders I've been talking with use anywhere from 20 to 40 international units (IU) of insulin a day. There are two main types of insulin--long-acting and short-acting. Short-acting insulin stays in the body for about six hours after injection. (Insulin shouldn't be injected into a vein or intramuscularly--it goes under the skin or "subcutaneously.") This type of insulin usually kicks in about an hour or two after you take it. </P>
<P>	All types of insulin should be stored in a cool place like a refrigerator but not a freezer. There are different sources of insulin--standard and purified animal insulins as well as human insulins are available. Standard and purified insulins differ in their degree of purification and content of non-insulin material. Standard and purified insulins also come from different sources--they may be from beef, pork, or a mixture of the two.</P>
<P>	Human insulin is identical in structure to the insulin produced by the human pancreas, and it differs slightly from animal insulin. One thing some bodybuilders have pointed out is if they switch from animal to human insulin (or vice versa), they often notice a different reaction from the same dosage--this is just one of several complicated hurdles that insulin-using bodybuilders have to deal with.</P>
<P>	Keep this in mind--your pancreas naturally releases insulin (if you're not a Type I diabetic) after your blood sugar levels rise. Thus, it's insulin's job to keep things as "steady" as possible. But when you take an insulin injection, you're causing your blood sugar levels to go down--this is called hypoglycemia. </P>
<P>	If bodybuilders take a shot of insulin first thing in the morning and then just eat complex carbohydrates, they probably won't create a high enough blood sugar level by the time their insulin shot "kicks in," and they can go into a very deep hypoglycemic episode and experience things like shortness of breath, shaking, and extreme sweating. These symptoms can cause quite a panic!</P>
<P>	Now, wiser insulin-using bodybuilders apparently get good results by consuming 10 grams of glucose (simple carbs) per IU of insulin about 20 to 30 minutes after they take a shot. For example, if someone took 10 IU's of insulin first thing in the morning, he would consume about 100 grams of simple carbs 20 to 30 minutes later.</P>
<P>	If they don't take an insulin shot first thing in the morning and have a meal with only complex carbs, they can get away with not eating any extra simple carbs. The top bodybuilders I know typically take two or three shots a day, with at least six hours between injections. Some bodybuilders take a combination of the long and short-acting forms of insulin, but if they do this, they have to pay very close attention to their diets and eat exactly every three hours. They also need to make sure they have a good-sized serving of protein and carbohydrates with every meal.</P>
<P>	The longer-acting insulin stays in the system for about 24 hours and peaks several times a day. Reportedly, it's much harder to predict and manage. However, assuming that the competitive (serious) bodybuilder eats the way he should, he can make sure he has a sufficient amount of carbs throughout the day, so the risk of hypoglycemia is minimal. The advantage of the long-acting form of insulin is that it stays in your body throughout the day, and every time your blood glucose levels are increased, that extra insulin goes to work and pushes glucose (and available amino acids) into muscle cells. </P>
<P>	An example of how one top bodybuilder uses insulin is as follows: 15 IU's of the long-acting insulin plus 5 IU's of the short-acting insulin first thing in the morning, then 10 IU's of the short-acting insulin 6 hours later and another 10 IU's of the short-acting insulin after another 6 hours. This is a total of 40 IU's of insulin a day. (Using insulin before going to sleep is not a good idea! You can't tell if you're having symptoms of hypoglycemia, so you could have some big problems!) Most bodybuilders are cycling (going on and off) insulin even though many do not go off steroids. For example, a bodybuilder might use insulin for eight weeks, then take eight weeks off. Their thinking is that this might minimize long-term side effects of insulin use, which might include a disruption in the body's ability to produce certain neurotransmitters in response to low blood sugar levels.</P>
<P>	Insulin use for precontest preparation is extremely popular with the pros and top amateurs. It seems that when the body is glycogen depleted, using insulin while carbing up can produce such dramatic effects, you can literally stand in front of the mirror and watch your muscles swell.</P>
<P>	One of the most complicated things for a competitive bodybuilder is to carb up "just right." You see, if you deplete your muscles of glycogen (your body's stored form of carbohydrate) by eating a low-carb diet (100 grams or less a day) for 3 to 5 days and working out really hard, your muscles will be small and "flat." But when you start feeding your body with high amounts of carbohydrates again, your muscles "super compensate" and suck in even more carbs than they would normally hold--this is called "carbing up" by competitive bodybuilders.</P>
<P>	The tricky thing about this is if you don't consume enough carbs, you'll be flat, and if you take in too many carbs, glucose will "spill over," and you'll start holding water under your skin--you'll look bigger but still "flat." The bodybuilders I've talked to say that carb loading while you're using insulin produces incredibly dramatic results and makes it more likely that you will "peak" with maximum muscle fullness and definition.</P>
<P>	A good thing about insulin is that it isn't toxic to your liver (like steroids), and it doesn't cause abnormal bone or cartilage growth (like growth hormone). But, it really wouldn't be accurate to call the use of injectable insulin by bodybuilders "safe."</P>
<P>	In fact, there is a very ugly side to this issue. You see, if you misuse insulin, <I>you can kill yourself</I>--not 40 years from now--<I>today!</I> If you take too much insulin and don't consume enough carbohydrates, you can go into deep hypoglycemia and even a coma. (Remember Claus Von Bulow and that whole deal with his wife? If not, don't worry about it--it's not worth explaining...) Many bodybuilders constantly monitor their blood sugar levels with a tool called a glucometer. This may help lower the risks somewhat, but insulin is a drug that really belongs in the hands of a physician--self-administering it is just so risky!</P>
<P>	I personally wouldn't mess with insulin--I just don't like taking those kinds of chances with my body--to me, it's not worth it. I'm not a pro bodybuilder, and to be successful at what I do, I don't have to weigh 275 lbs and have 3% bodyfat. But bodybuilders who elect to make a career out of competitive bodybuilding sometimes feel they must do "whatever it takes." I feel bad for them, but no one is forcing them to do the things they're doing--they're "risk takers"; there's no doubt about it.</P>
<P>	I certainly wouldn't recommend insulin injections to the typical <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> reader who's trying to build a more muscular, better-looking physique. If you're not heavily involved in competitive bodybuilding, I definitely don't think it's worth the risk! However, since it's my job to tell you the truth about what's going on--I have to address questions like this one.</P>
<P>	Now, how can "non-kamikaze" bodybuilders "mimic" the results pros are getting from using injectable insulin? Well, that's something some pretty smart "bodybuilding scientists" are aggressively studying at this very moment.</P>
<P>	You see, taking insulin injections is not the only way to "enhance" the anabolic and anti-catabolic effects of insulin. Vanadyl sulfate, an "insulin mimicker" that is extremely popular with bodybuilders, is one possible "drug-free" way to gain an advantage, but new research has led to even more exciting discoveries in this area.</P>
<P>	Within the next year, I think you'll have access to a legal, safe "insulin mimicker" which could significantly enhance your body's ability to shuttle carbohydrates and proteins from your bloodstream into muscle cells. The compound that may do this is called IPF<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>; (insulin potentiating factor<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>;), and it's been "on the drawing board" for a couple of years now. The guys behind this product are the same folks who introduced bodybuilders to creatine monohydrate (probably the most popular supplement in bodybuilding history!). They claim their new IPF compound will work very similar to insulin injections for bodybuilders (but it's not something diabetics should use instead of injectable insulin!). The product is being designed to assist with muscle building, but it won't be so powerful that it can cause severe hypoglycemia and other dangers associated with injectable insulin use. (Of course, <I>MM2K</I> will be the first mag to bring you the whole story on IPF.)</P>
<P>	One last note--if you're thinking about using insulin, think twice--it's really risky!</P>

<A NAME="A5"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I originally wrote about RU 486 (specifically, RU 38486) almost five years ago in my <I>Anabolic Reference Update</I>. At that time, I reported that bodybuilders in Europe had been experimenting with it in hopes of accelerating muscle gains.</P>
<P>	RU 486 is that controversial abortion pill you sometimes hear about on the news. As it turns out, in addition to causing a hormonal environment that induces abortions in pregnant women, RU 486 also happens to be very "anti-catabolic."</P>
<P>	A recent study showed that a 600-mg dose of RU 486 (the same dose used to induce abortions) helped protect muscle tissue from the catabolic effects of cortisol.</P>
<P>	The downside is that RU 486 may also block androgen muscle receptors which would prevent testosterone from working its magic on muscle cells.</P>
<P>	RU 486 is interesting--I'll admit that. But if you're going to take the drug route, I'm virtually positive RU 486 won't produce better results than even a low dose of anabolic steroids, and if you're going to take the drug-free route (which is what I do), I think you can get better "anti-catabolic" effects with something like HMB than you could with RU 486.</P>
<P>	To date, no studies have shown that RU 486 helps weight trainers gain more size and strength. And I've heard from quite a few bodybuilders who tried RU 486 (mostly bodybuilders from Europe), and none of them seemed to report anything spectacular.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="A6"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> It's a scam! I've learned that a number of supplement companies are working on <I>fake</I> versions of HMB and plan to release them to the market any day now. One company that's calling their supplement "HMB" is actually putting in three ingredients: histidine, methionine, and some B-vitamins. What a rip-off!</P>
<P>	<I>Don't be fooled</I>--HMB stands for BETA-HYDROXY BETA-METHYLBUTYRATE!</P>
<P>	The only legitimate supplier of this supplement is Metabolic Technologies, Inc. (MTI) of Ames, Iowa. This company has licensed the HMB patents from the Iowa State University Research Foundation (ISURF).</P>
<P>	Not only does MTI own the patent rights, to my knowledge, they're also the only ones who know how to make this stuff in bulk quantities. It took them years to figure out how to produce HMB.</P>
<P>	Literally tens of thousands of bodybuilders are looking for HMB, and unfortunately, over the past few months, it's been in extremely short supply. (Hopefully by the time this magazine gets to the newsstands, the supply situation will be better.) Other supplement companies are aware of the demand for HMB, but they're pulling their hair out because they can't find anybody to make it for them. (It took MTI over four years to get their manufacturer up and running.) So it's not surprising to me, knowing how many scumbags there are in this business, to learn that some companies are going to be putting an HMB label on a product that's just totally and completely fake! These folks are absolute criminals; they're as bad as those dirtbags who sell counterfeit steroids. There's no shortage of people out there who are willing to pour Wesson oil in a vial, put a fake label on it, sell it to you for $20 per milliliter, and tell you it's Deca-Durabolin. What makes you think there would be any shortage of people who'd take some cheap amino acid like glycine, encapsulate it, put it in a bottle, and tell you it's HMB?</P>
<P>	You've got to be careful! At this time, the only brand of HMB capsules on the market which I know to be legit are the ones put out by MTI. In the future, MTI does plan to allow other supplement companies to buy HMB from them and sell it under other brand names. For example, EAS hopes to buy HMB from MTI and sell it under the EAS brand name sometime in the future. But right now, all the details haven't been worked out. I'll stay in contact with MTI and let you know who they're selling HMB to--then I'll tell you which companies have the real stuff.</P>
<P>	If I were you, I would make sure that before you buy any type of HMB, you check the label to see if it lists MTI as the source, and you should also watch for the U.S. Patent Number 5,348,979. That's the sign that the stuff is legit.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="A7"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> One company that makes a very popular meal replacement--a company I can't mention because of an unusual legal matter (<A HREF="http://www.mm2k.com/v49/v49_uqa.html">see last issue's "Q&A"</A>), has advertised a new total-nutrition product containing HMB. At the time I'm writing this column, MTI has not supplied any HMB to this company, but I understand the two companies are in negotiations. I think this new form of "Product X" is supposed to have 1.5 grams of HMB per serving. They are recommending you use two servings a day (clinical studies have shown an effective dose is 3 grams a day).</P>
<P>	Using this product twice a day may produce good results, but Dan Duchaine tipped me off to something recently. He pointed out that HMB has an extremely short "half-life" in the blood--it's in and out of your system in just a few hours. Dan does not recommend only taking HMB twice a day; in fact, he thinks instead of taking one gram (four capsules) three times daily that taking two capsules six times daily might be best. Thus, what I just started doing is taking two capsules of HMB every three hours while I'm awake. This way, the HMB levels in my blood stay more consistent.</P>
<P>	My problem with using a meal-replacement powder that contains 1.5 grams of HMB per serving is that you would lose the versatility you have with capsules. Capsules are extremely convenient--you can keep a small packet of them in your pocket, your briefcase, whatever. It's very easy to take two capsules six times a day. According to the doctors who have extensively studied HMB, they say you can take it on an empty or full stomach--it shouldn't make any difference.</P>
<P>	In the most recent HMB clinical study, the test subjects used HMB in capsules and got great results! 	This was the second study to offer strong evidence that weight trainers who use HMB gain significantly more size and strength than nonusers! Also, test subjects who used HMB in this recent study showed a strong trend for fat loss! The test subjects took one gram of HMB three times daily. So, we have strong evidence to suggest that that dosage schedule is effective. But, it's possible that changing the dosage pattern to two capsules six times daily, instead of four capsules three times daily, may produce even better results! Perhaps this is something researchers might look at sometime in the future.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="A8"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> It seems to make sense that a 125-pound woman would not need to take the same amount of HMB as a 220-lb guy. Unfortunately, no studies have been done to answer this particular question.</P>
<P>	Logic would <I>seem</I> to dictate that if a 220-lb guy gets good results using 3 grams of HMB a day, a 125-lb lady should get good results by using 2 grams a day.</P>
<P>	It also <I>seems</I> to make sense that if a 220-lb bodybuilder gets good results using a maintenance dose of 10 grams a day of creatine monohydrate, then a lady who weighs 125 lbs might only need 5 grams per day. I would think the same would be true for other supplements.</P>
<P>	By the same token, guys who weigh over 220 lbs (and there are quite a few of them who read <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>) might need to take more of these supplements to get optimal results. For example, I know some big bodybuilders (275 pounders) use a maintenance dose of 30 grams of creatine monohydrate a day!</P>
<P>	You can assume that the dosages we talk about most often in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> are basically for guys who weigh between 150 and 220 pounds. If you're in that range (which at least 80% of my readers are), you probably don't need to make any adjustments. If you're not in that weight range, you might think about slightly decreasing or increasing your supplement intake in an attempt to "tailor" the dosage to fit your particular physiological needs. Hopefully, future research will provide us with more "exact" info.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="A9"></A><HR><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> The majority of my readers don't want that kind of information from <I>MM2K</I>. 	A few months ago, we ran a photo essay and simply put down a listing of the top ten finishers at the Mr. Olympia contest, and you would've thought I'd sent a personal letter to tens of thousands of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> readers telling them their mothers were lesbians! I got more nasty letters about that Mr. Olympia "photo essay" than you would believe!</P>
<P>	You see, the guy or gal who picks up <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> expects something different from us. If they want contest coverage, they know to buy <I>Flex</I>. That magazine will tell you everything you want to know about the major bodybuilding contests--who came in first, second, third, tenth, etc. </P>
<P>	<I>Flex</I> magazine is also filled with fantastic photos of pro bodybuilders working out, and it has some articles that have apparently been written by pro bodybuilders where they tell you how many sets they do, what weight they use, etc. </P>
<P>	Basically, coverage of top bodybuilding contests is not something our industry is lacking, neither are fantastic photos of well-built bodybuilding superstars and information on how they work out.</P>
<P>	<I>Muscle Media 2000</I> is not going to get into that--<I>ever!</I> It was not my intention when I started this magazine to come out with a publication that was like the others--I've always strived to make this magazine different--I've been trying to make it <I>useful</I>, and I think we've accomplished that.</P>
<P>	The sales of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> are booming! And people certainly don't read my magazine to find out who won this or that bodybuilding contest nor do they buy <I>MM2K</I> to read how this or that pro claims to have built his or her muscularity.</P>
<P>	The guys and gals who read this magazine do so because they want to find out the <I>real deal</I>. You read <I>MM2K</I> to find out how <I>you</I> can build a better body--this publication is kind of like a guide for "do-it-yourselfers." <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> isn't a magazine for people who "sit on the sidelines"--it's a fitness and physique development magazine for people who specifically want to learn how it's done and how they can do it!</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, most pro bodybuilders can't exactly tell you what they do to get "the look" they have. They're caught between a rock and a hard place. Because virtually all of them use steroids (and a bunch of other bodybuilding drugs), many of which are illegal, they can't openly talk about the use of these compounds. They talk with me about the drugs they use, but such conversations have to be kept confidential for obvious reasons. It's not that I don't like pro bodybuilders--it's not that at all. I have a number of good friends who are pros. It's just that my readers want the <I>whole truth</I>.</P>
<P>	I think the other magazines are good at what they do--like I said, <I>Flex</I> has great bodybuilding contest coverage and incredible photos; <I>MuscleMag</I> has great gossip and some really funny advertisements which I enjoy reading; <I>Muscular Development</I> is the "sexiest" bodybuilding magazine, etc. Each magazine has its own "specialty." <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> unquestionably has the most accurate, <I>honest</I>, straightforward information on "what to use." That is, we have the best information on new bodybuilding supplements and the most honest information on bodybuilding pharmaceuticals.</P>
<P>	We also have some pretty good training articles and some good information on nutrition, and I think, overall, Muscle Media 2000 has a pretty good sense of humor. But, the main reason people read Muscle Media 2000 is because they want to find out what to use and how to use it. That's what we're good at, so it makes sense that we should focus on that the most.</P>

It's an obvious sign that more ladies are taking an interest in "bodybuilding."

<B>Just A Few More Things...</B>	<P>I'd like to say thanks to all the people who take the time to write in with their questions, positive comments, and feedback. I really appreciate it!</P>
<P>	I want to let you know I do everything I can to provide each and every one of you with the answers you're looking for--I personally answer literally hundreds of letters each month! (I'll bet I answer more letters each month than any publisher in this business ever has!)</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, I cannot provide a detailed response to every single question (I provide an answer to at least 90% of the letters I get).</P>
<P>	And, there are some subjects I just can't give you a personal reply on--one of those subjects that is strictly "off limits" is the use of bodybuilding drugs. For obvious legal reasons, I can't give people "one-on-one" advice that pertains to the use of steroids, insulin, IGF-1, etc. All the information I have about those kinds of topics is addressed in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> or in my <I>Anabolic Reference Guide</I> (the most comprehensive book ever written on bodybuilding drugs. That book is advertised on page 91 of the May issue).</P>
<P>	For those who have detailed questions about supplement use (a topic I can address in a one-on-one letter), I request that before you send me your questions, you thoroughly read my new <I><A HREF="http://www.mm2k.com/nsr/nsr96.html">1996 Supplement Review</A></I>. That book has the answers to almost every supplement question you can think of. <A HREF="http://www.mm2k.com/nsr/nsr_of.html">Here's where to order this book for FREE!</A></P>
<P>	I'm dedicated to providing you with specific, practical, "how-to" bodybuilding information, but unfortunately, I can't do this for every single person who reads the magazine. Believe me...if I could, I would! (Since I know the answers to 98% of the questions I receive off the top of my head, it really frustrates me that I just don't have the time.) The good news is I'll be writing more and more articles for <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> that address the "frequently asked questions" of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> readers, and it won't be long before <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> will be a monthly magazine!</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> I'm 45 years old, and I'm on testosterone replacement for low natural levels of testosterone--around 300-350 ng/dl.  My doctor has prescribed testosterone cypionate (100 mg per week), and this has brought my testosterone level up to around 600 ng/dl.  Should I switch over to your recommendation of Deca-Durabolin?  Is the use of Deca-Durabolin instead of testosterone for this purpose a documented and accepted practice?  One more thing: I'm using 21-gauge needles.  Should I try to go to something thinner to minimize scarring?</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> First off, it's nice to see you've found a liberal doctor.  Most M.D.'s won't consider prescribing testosterone until they see your blood level of testosterone drop below 300 ng/dl.  You appear to have an unusual metabolism.  Most males of your age would not realize such a high testosterone elevation on only 100 mg a week.  Usually a weekly 100-mg injection of testosterone would raise blood levels 100 ng/dl, at the most.  What usually happens is that as males age, the ability to convert testosterone to estrogen (with aromatase enzyme) increases.  The extra testosterone injected will more readily convert to estrogen and, at the same time, down-regulate the small amount of natural testosterone being produced.  I have a strong feeling that your particular metabolism doesn't manufacture very much aromatase, so the small amount of exogenous testosterone you're using has better potential, as much of it stays as testosterone and doesn't down-regulate your own supply.  </P>
<P>	Since your injected dose is quite small (only half of what the World Health Organization is recommending for FSH [follicle-stimulating hormone] down-regulation), I can't see any real benefit for you to switch over to Deca-Durabolin.  Although the nandrolones have a higher androgen-receptor-binding ability than testosterone, the anabolic effect is not equal, so you might have to raise the weekly dosage to about 200 mg to equal all the positive effects of testosterone cypionate.</P>
<P>	In many other males, more than just 100 mg a week of testosterone is needed to generate an optimal blood level of between 500-600 ng/dl.  At these higher amounts, more testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (which accelerates balding and swells the prostate) and estrogen, which would further down-regulate natural testosterone secretion.  In these situations, when 200 mg or more of injected testosterone is needed each week, Deca-Durabolin is a nice option, as the DHN (dihydronandrolone) variant has a lesser affinity to receptors at the prostate and hair follicles.  The nandrolones also don't convert as readily to estrogen (although it's not markedly different from testosterone).</P>
<P>	Now that we know the various mechanisms of the enzyme conversions of testosterone, an enlightened M.D. could also prescribe both Proscar (using only a quarter of a tablet) and Nolvadex (10 mg) daily and would see both a higher blood level of testosterone and a significantly smaller testosterone dosage.  I've reluctantly recommended Nolvadex (the most popular anti-estrogen) simply because most M.D.'s won't believe how Cytadren (at 250 mg a day) would work better for this purpose.  Of course, the upcoming supplement "Flavone X" could work for the same purpose.  However, if you're counting dollars, using Deca-Durabolin would be cheaper than using the combination of testosterone, Proscar, and Nolvadex.  Too bad Primobolan Depot is not approved for use in the U.S.  It could be a perfect testosterone replacement as it has absolutely no conversion to either estrogen or DHT.  You might have heard of a new androgen replacement called MECE.  It's very androgenic, so much so, only micrograms are needed each day.  This steroid is simply a non-17 alkylated version of the veterinary Checque Drops (mibolerone).  I find it hard to believe that researchers are taking this steroid seriously, as mibolerone is a potent progesterone agonist, binding to progesterone receptors and imparting progesterone actions (including sensitizing breast tissue).</P>
<P>	Deca-Durabolin, as great as it is, is not mentioned in the literature as a testosterone replacement for middle-aged men.  It's recommended for women with systemic lupus (and there is published research on this).  The only drawback in using Deca-Durabolin for an androgen replacement is that with extremely low natural testosterone levels (less than 150 ng/dl), there might not be enough androgen action to reestablish libido.  In my case, my blood testosterone level is 370 ng/dl, and I have more than adequate libido.  I would choose Deca-Durabolin over a testosterone: my hairline is borderline, so why tempt fate?</P>
<P>	As to your inquiry about needle gauges, yes, repeated weekly injections with a 21-gauge needle will eventually generate more scar tissue than a smaller needle would.  Realistically (and I've tried all the gauges), the smallest gauge needle you can actually use to self-administer is a 23 gauge (I prefer the 1 inch length).  But don't be surprised when your weekly shot takes 2-3 minutes to push the plunger all the way down.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> I'm a woman who has an incidence of breast cancer in my family.  My doctor has warned me not to consume a high amount of dietary fats because the research shows that over 30% dietary fat will increase the risk of breast cancer.  How can you recommend a one-third fat diet with your isometric diet?  Isn't that dangerous?</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> Your doctor is partially right, and for the majority of women who don't consciously keep track of the specific types of fats they eat, this is good advice.  I've read these studies and found there are actually two different conclusions.  Generally speaking, if a woman reduces her dietary fat intake to 20% or lower, the risk of breast cancer is reduced.  At 30%, the risk increases.  I should point out that amounts higher than 30% do not pose any greater risk.  Many women are not schooled in nutrition, and on a day-to-day basis, the most an individual usually will do is count fat calories (or grams) and avoid broad fat categories like saturated fat and cholesterol.  Further into the studies, researchers do discuss the quality of fat consumed, and we find the specific type, not the overall quantity, of fats increase the risk.  The highest risk fats are animal fats (the saturated fats) from meats and dairy products and omega-6 fats (linoleic acid) such as corn and safflower oil.  Unfortunately, the American diet has large amounts of these two oils.  And all the research points to the conclusion that in any hormone-based cancer, whether breast or prostate, the omega-6 oils are potent accelerators of tumor growth. It's very rare to see a linoleic acid deficiency in Americans, as corn and safflower oil are so heavily used in snack foods.  And remember, stored bodyfat also has significant amounts of this essential fatty acid. </P>
<P>	In a practical sense, most women on a day-to-day basis probably won't take the effort to avoid the omega-6 oils.  This would include abstaining from virtually all restaurant foods.  For this large segment of the population, the simplest solution would be to restrict all dietary fats to 20% or below.  However, if a female were more selective in the dietary fats she consumed, a 30% fat diet would pose no risk.  As a matter of fact, large amounts of the omega-3 fatty acids (flax oil) suppress the rate of breast tumors.</P>
<P>	Most of the high monounsaturated fats have very little omega-6 fatty acids in them.  Olive oil is the current favorite at 6% omega-6 content.  If you happen to dislike the taste of olive oil, you should try macadamia (nut) oil, as it is 80% monounsaturated and only 3% omega-6.  And as Dr. Barry Sears has pointed out, monounsaturated fats are "neutered" fats: they don't affect hormone production.  You can purchase macadamia oil through Oils of Aloha at 1-800-367-6010.</P>
<P>	In my new ISO<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>3</FONT></SUP> diet meal replacement, although the fat content is 33%, about 90% of these fat calories are derived from a new genetically engineered sunflower oil.  The usual 60+% linoleic fatty acid (omega-6) has been replaced with oleic acid (monounsaturated).  Unfortunately, I don't know of any high-oleic sunflower oil you can buy at the retail level.  So for salad oils, macadamia oil is, by default, the highest in oleic acid.</P>
<P>	If you have the typical female body type, with most of your bodyfat centered at the hips, glutes and thighs, following a one-third fat nutrient ratio on a maintenance or low-calorie diet will lower insulin secretion, which is beneficial to mobilizing fat from these stubborn areas.  With your family history, you have the choice of two recommendations: simply reduce fat intake to 20% or below, or follow a higher fat diet, but avoid all of the recognizable omega-6 sources.  This list includes: corn, sunflower, cottonseed, sesame, soybean, and even peanut oils.  You might alternate the two courses.  There are times when you won't have the discipline or patience to chart the quality of your fats.  During these times, the 20% rule is easiest to follow.  But you already know I highly recommend a one-third fat nutrient ratio on a low-calorie diet.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> I tried your Body-Contact Workout [<I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, February 1996].  I've been doing Heavy-Duty Workouts up till now.  I remembered reading in the article that the workout was supposed to keep muscle trauma to a minimum and muscle soreness would be less (than with the Heavy-Duty Workouts).  But all my body parts are toasted! So what's the deal?</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> The damnedest things make you sore.  If you simply did 12 concentric reps without the eccentrics, you probably would have been sore, too.  You haven't specified how many sets for each exercise you were doing with your Heavy-Duty routine.  Most Heavy-Duty advocates don't actually do just "one set to failure": they do numerous warm-up sets beforehand.  Although it appears the new extra sets and reps were overly traumatic for you, you'll find that your body will quickly acclimate to the extra work and stop perceiving it as trauma.  But some individuals are not suited for full-blown Body-Contact Workouts from the get-go, and I recommend easing into the system slowly.  The first week, do only 12 concentric reps.  The second week, add the negatives at the same weight you used for the concentrics.  During the third week, on one set, use the 85% 1RM negatives.  And after a week off, starting the next month, your body will be ready for the productive benefits of directed intensity.  Give this a try!</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Question:</FONT> Over the summer, I purchased a few hundred tablets of metformin from a European mail-order company.  I started 2,000 mg/day (one 500-mg tab with meals 4 times a day) and experienced a severe loss of appetite.  After ten days, I ceased using the drug because I began to lose weight (muscle) and strength as a result of the lower calorie intake.  Do you have any thoughts on this?</P>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I've gotten the same reports from other bodybuilders who comment on this loss of appetite.  At least you got the dosage right. Most non-diabetics who use Glucophage (the American version of metformin) have been cautious with dosages and haven't felt any beneficial effects.  </P>
<P>	The conundrum is this: bringing the dosage up high enough (between 1,700 and 2,000 mg) generates better glycogen storage and a workout pump, but the loss of appetite makes it difficult to eat enough food.  This food apathy is caused by metformin's slowing of gastric emptying.  Such an effect would be nice to have while you're on a low-calorie diet.  But on a maintenance or hyper-calorie diet, metformin would be a problem.</P>
<P>	The simple solution is to make sure you eat calorie-dense foods.  If there is any complaint (and it seems to be a very minor one) with the moderate to high-fat diets (whether it be Isometric or Zone based), it usually is that the increase of dietary fat means less food to eat.  This is the one instance where peanut butter is a guilt-free solution.  So it seems logical that metformin and moderate-fat diets would compliment each other.  Hunger from eating less carbohydrates is eliminated because of the slow release from the stomach (and from the small intestine, too), and the reduced carbohydrates will be prioritized for glycogen storage.  The dietary fat is calorie dense.  </P>
<P>	If you're following a high-carb diet and won't consider switching to denser foods, the traditional approach for stimulating the appetite for athletes is the prescription antihistamine Periactin.  Unfortunately, Periactin causes lethargy and irritability.</P>
<P>	If none of the above solutions suit you, only use metformin when you're on a low-calorie diet.  If you lower the dosage enough, your appetite will not be affected, but at the reduced dosage, the insulin sensitivity enhancement will be negligible.</P>

<H3>The Future of Fat Loss and Beta-3 Adrenergic Agonists</H3><P>
<H4>By Bruce Kneller & Will Brink</H4></CENTER>
<P><B><P>The sad fact is, up to one-third of the populace in most industrialized countries suffer from obesity.  As many of you already know, obesity significantly increases the risk of a variety of metabolic and cardiovascular problems<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>1</FONT></SUP>. Over the past few years, the world of medicine has been on a quest to find out what causes obesity in some people and not in others.  As obesity is construed by many clinicians to be a pathological state, the idea of a "cure" for obesity has also been slung around medical circles.  The latest postulations from the medical "powers that be" contradict the traditional thoughts concerning obesity: it isn't necessarily the end result of a weak character, overeating, and/or a sedentary lifestyle. Instead, there appears to be a strong genetic correlation to both obesity and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), taking some of the blame off people who constantly fight to keep fat off.  We mention both obesity and NIDDM as these two pathologies seemed to be intricately interwoven and biologically related to each other.</B></P><HR></P>
<P></P>
<P>If we mention the word "ephedrine," many of you will say, "it's a stimulant, a beta-agonist...it burns fat and gives you energy before a workout," and the scientifically minded of you will say, "it's a beta-2 adrenergic agonist," and perhaps those of you in the intellectual cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me might smugly tout,  "it's a relatively nonselective beta-2 adrenergic agonist with many overlapping beta-1 adrenergic side effects."  All of you would be somewhat correct.  But there's another beta receptor site that warrants mentioning that's been overlooked for too many moons.  This is the beta-3 adrenergic receptor site.  And ephedrine may have some fairly potent beta-3 adrenergic agonistic activity.  This overlooked beta receptor could be the key to fat loss in the years to come.  Remember where you heard it.  Remember who told you about it first!</P>
<P>	Beta-3 receptor sites are found predominantly in brown adipose tissue (fat).  Rats and mice have large areas of fat that are exclusively made of brown fat to help them regulate their body temperature, fat levels, and other metabolic functions.  Newborn human babies have distinct areas of brown fat.  But adult humans don't have a lot of distinct brown fat.  So why, then, is this beta-3 receptor site important?  Come on, folks, if we don't have large areas of brown fat, who cares about this beta-3 site?  Well, it would appear that, in adults, brown fat is scattered about the more common white fat in a diffuse manner (especially around the viscera), leading many people to believe that brown fat has little to do with how adult humans regulate various metabolic processes.  However, if you add up the little, itty-bitty deposits of brown fat, you actually come up with a fair amount.  </P>
<P>	We know brown fat plays a big part in regulating metabolic processes because the chemical marker that identifies the presence of brown fat activity is found in the plasma of adult humans.<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></SUP> This clearly shows that brown fat is an active tissue in adult humans!</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>White Fat, Brown Fat -<BR>What's Color Got To Do With It?</FONT></CENTER>
<BR>
<P>	So, what the heck does brown fat do?  How is it different from the run-of-the-mill white variety that covers my Aunt Sadie's butt?  Well, friends, it would appear that brown fat is partially responsible for determining your metabolic rate and subsequent ability to burn fat (lipolysis).  And since the beta-3 site is what stimulates brown fat to step up fat-burning activity, we can draw the following conclusions:  1) if you have defective beta-3 receptors or relatively few beta-3 receptors (as determined by genetics), you'll have a hard time keeping fat off;  2) if you artificially stimulate (agonize) the beta-3 site, you'll dramatically step up metabolism and fat loss.  This, our ephedrine/clenbuterol/Cytomel-gulping friends, is hot news that could potentially pay off in a big way for future bodybuilders.</P>
<P>	Recent studies have indicated that some obese populations and NIDDM populations have a genetic predisposition to having defective beta-3 receptors<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>3-6</FONT></SUP> and/or a decrease in the number of beta-3 receptors.  Thus, the correlation between obesity and NIDDM may also be partially attributed to beta-3 receptor site anomalies.  The beta-3 receptor is considered responsible for increasing lipolysis and the delivery of free fatty acids into the portal vein from the abdominal viscera.<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>7,8</FONT></SUP></P>
<P>	OK, now for the English translation!!! The beta-3 receptor found in brown fat (the fat involved in body-temperature regulation and metabolic rate) is responsible for burning off fat in the midsection of the body.  </P>
<P>	People with a high degree of insulin resistance (people with NIDDM) typically demonstrate an increase in visceral fat mass (fat around the midsection).  An abnormality in the beta-3 receptor could possibly explain a link between abdominal obesity and insulin resistance.  We think the beta-3 receptor may also play a huge role in insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.  How could the beta-3 receptor possibly be involved in the development of insulin resistance in skeletal muscle?  Larger quantities of abdominal fat due to beta-3 receptor troubles could provide more free fatty acids for the synthesis of very-low-density lipoproteins in the liver.  This could result in changes of the fatty-acid composition of skeletal muscle membranes or higher triglycerides in muscle.<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>9</FONT></SUP> This is a bad thing!!!	In rats, the accumulation of triglycerides in muscle is related to the impaired action of insulin.<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>10</FONT></SUP> In humans, abdominal/visceral obesity is associated with the enhanced sensitivity of abdominal/visceral fat to catecholamine-induced lipolysis<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>8</FONT></SUP> primarily mediated through the effects of the beta-3 receptor.  Abdominal/visceral obesity is also associated with decreased uptake of free fatty acids by muscle and with insulin resistance in skeletal muscle and, in particular, impaired synthesis of insulin-stimulated glycogen.<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>11</FONT></SUP> So having mutated beta-3 receptors or an insufficient number of them will lead to increased insulin resistance in skeletal muscle (a symptom of NIDDM) and may actually decrease the ability to put on skeletal muscle mass and increase the ability to put on fat.  This means you have no problem storing fat but a hard time storing glycogen.  Obviously, it sucks if you happen to fall into this category!!!</P>
<P>	Brown fat differs from white fat not just in color.  Brown fat has a large number of mitochondria (the part of the cell where energy is produced) that contain something called uncoupling protein, which can stimulate oxidative phosphorylization and thereby increase metabolic rate.  Brown fat is present to oxidize lipids (burn fat) in order to produce heat and rid the body of excess fat.  Let's get a little more technical (as if that were possible) and say that stimulating (agonizing) the beta-3 receptor, found in brown fat, activates adenylate cyclase, which increases intracellular concentrations of cyclic AMP and results in increased lipolysis and thermogenesis.<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>12-14</FONT></SUP>  Roughly translated, if you kick these bad boy beta-3 receptors into high gear, you can burn a shitload of fat.  Increasing your body temperature requires that you burn calories...in this case, fat calories. So now we can take it a step further, trying not to use too much mind-numbing technical jargon and state that a drug that's a relatively specific beta-3 agonist will have profound anti-obesity and anti-diabetic effects in animals and, more importantly, in humans, as it will increase thermogenesis and burn more calories.</P>
<P></P>
<CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Give Me the Beta-3 Agonists Already!!!</FONT></CENTER>
<BR>
<P>	So who makes beta-3 agonists, and where can I buy them?  The corner drugstore?  Can I get them from the guy in the gym whose beeper goes off every time his cell phone stops ringing?  From some foreign country whose major exports are Andriol and dysentery?  </P>
<P>	Sorry, none of the above.  You're gonna have to be patient; beta-3 agonists are relatively new, and clinical trials are going on as we speak.  Quite a few big name pharmaceutical companies are getting involved in developing beta-3 agonists.  And why not? Think of the economic implications of being the first drug company to market a beta-3 agonist--a relatively safe one--to melt the fat off your body like butter.  Can you say "billion dollar industry"???  Although the following companies are developing beta-3 agonists, they're sorta "hush-hush" about the whole deal:</P>
<P>	Ciba-Geigy has at least one drug (code name--GCP 12177); Sanofi-Midy has another (code name--SR 58611A); ICI Labs has two (ICI D7114 and ICI 215001); and Smithkline Beecham has four ( BRL 26830A, BRL 37344, BRL 49653, and BRL 35135).  </P>
<P>	We also know the EXACT chemical names for each of these, so if you "really, really have to know them" (they're long and torturous), write to me, care of <I>MM2K</I>, and I'll be happy to send them to you. We're sure the aforementioned drug companies are going to be none too pleased that we tipped off <I>MM2K</I> readers to their surreptitious work, so don't tell them we told you about any of this.</P>
<P>	Maybe we should tell you about the results of some of these drug-company studies???  Sure, but remember--keep a lid on it!</P>
<P> 	The  journal article "Potentiations of the Anti-Obesity Effect of the Selective Beta-3 Adrenoreceptor Agonist BRL 35135 in Obese Zucker Rats by Exercise" (<I>British Journal of Pharmacology</I> 113.4 (1994) : 1231-1236) said that BRL 35135 was given at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg orally to half the rats in the study while the other half got a placebo. Bodyweight, food intake, brown fat thermogenesis, and plasma insulin/glucose levels were measured in both groups after three weeks of treatment (which consisted of "exercise," too).  The rats that got BRL 35135 showed a 45-fold increase in brown fat thermogenic activity and a decrease in plasma insulin levels of 50%.  The effect of BRL 35135 was significantly potentiated by exercise; the reduction in weight gain was 56% in comparison to 19% in sedentary animals.  That's some powerful stuff.  It makes clenbuterol and ephedrine look like candy!!!</P>
<P>	Another journal article, "Clinical Studies with the Beta-Adrenoreceptor Agonist BRL 26830A" (<I>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</I> 55.1 (1992) : 258S-261S), discusses a double-blind study with 40 obese patients who received either BRL 26830A or a placebo for 18 weeks.  Both groups were put on a calorie-restrictive diet.  After 18 weeks, the BRL 26830A group had a weight loss of median 33.88 lbs while the control group had a median weight loss of only 22 lbs.  Urinary nitrogen excretion was similar in both groups; this suggests that the weight loss was mainly from fat.  Psychological assessments showed that BRL 26830A had no adverse effects on mood and no effect on hunger or satiety.</P>
<P>	So there you have it.  In the upcoming years, it's more than likely that beta-3 agonists will be developed and marketed heavily.  The implications for bodybuilders and other athletes are obvious.  Of course, it will only take a short time before the "powers that be" find out bodybuilders are using these goodies and clamp down on them faster than Bill Phillips can say, "Pass the HMB, please!!!"</P>
<P>	  If current trends continue, the level of obesity and the number of people suffering from NIDDM should dramatically decrease, and the subsequent overall health of the populace at large should improve.  As some of us despise doing aerobics and have "a little more fat than we'd like" around our respective abdomens, beta-3 agonists could create quite a stir when they hit the market.  </P>
<P>	One of the nifty traits the beta-3 sites seem to possess is they are not down-regulated by overstimulation.  For example, if you use clenbuterol or even ephedrine to agonize beta-2 sites, the effects start to wear off in a few weeks because the beta-2 site becomes resistant to the effects (down-regulates).  So you have to increase the dose of clenbuterol or ephedrine to get the same effect.  In time, you won't be able to increase the amount of ephedrine or clenbuterol, as these drugs also agonize the beta-1 site to a degree, and you'll really start to experience nasty side effects (e.g., increased heart rate, shaky hands, etc.).  So you have to come off the clenbuterol or ephedrine and wait until the beta-2 site naturally up-regulates again.  And you usually end up regaining some or all of the fat you lost.</P>
<P>	The thermogenic effects of beta-3 agonists are not as profound as those caused by, let's  say, thyroid derivatives.  But thyroid derivatives have some pretty nasty side effects (not to mention that much of the thyroid-derived weight loss is muscle).  Taking a pretty big dose of a beta-3 agonist seems only to increase core body temperature by maybe a half degree Fahrenheit.  So the fat loss might be slower.  The trade-off is that even though the fat loss is slower, because the beta-3 site is not down-regulated, you can stay on these drugs for extended periods of time.  So you'll end up losing the same amount of fat as you would with the other aforementioned drugs, but it might take you a few weeks longer.  Beta-3 agonists will be great drugs for bodybuilders as beta-3's could replace the dangerous thyroid derivatives these boneheads currently chow down to shed fat come contest time.  Thus, beta-3 agonists may become a welcome and relatively safe addition to the bodybuilders' regimen of pharmaceuticals.  Now wipe that drool from your chin!</P>

You know what bodybuilding needs? It needs more people who can come up with solutions and not just identify problems.  We need more individuals who can take something wrong and make it right, instead of just taking something wrong and bitching about it.<P>
  We need more thinkers-more creative, uninhibited minds.  We need fewer cynics; fewer jealous, insecure, immature writers; and more physique role models with integrity, high morals (any morals would be nice), and charisma. <P>
   I point this out because I am getting kind of tired of the negativity and true lack of thought that goes into so much that's written and said in bodybuilding these days. <P>
  Lately, the bodybuilding media has had a bad case of "slam fever." Everyone is slamming everyone.  Have you noticed this lately?  Here are just a few examples-Teper slams Titus; Titus slams everyone; everyone slams Titus.  Everson slams Mentzer; Mentzer slams Everson, Duchaine, and Zulak; Zulak gets slammed for hyping MuscleTech.  Dan slams Hatfield; Hatfield slams Dan.  Romano slams the IFBB, Ben, and Joe; Dorian and Bev slam Romano.  Balik slams Weider.  Leibovitz slams me; I slam Leibovitz; Leibovitz slams me and Almada.  Supplement companies slam other supplement companies, and so on and so on...<P>
   It's somewhat amusing, but make no mistake-slamming people is easy.  Basically, all you have to do is be negative.  For example, I could walk outside today and something negative to say about every person who walks by.  I could open the newspaper and find something bad to say about everything I see.  I could slam the government, corporate institutions, people with money, people with money, people who believe in God, people who don't believe in God, etc., etc., etc.<P>
    All the slamming is one thing, maybe that will never end.  But the hypocritical B.S. I read following Munzer's death pushed me over the edge.  I saw so many people in the industry point the finger at Joe Weider with self-righteous vindication.  It was as though a number of information providers and Weider competitors were in some sick way happy that Munzer died-it seems to me that certain people were almost hoping something like this would happen so they could really get after Joe Weider-so they could criticize him openly and harshly for finally having done something "tangibly" wrong-something allegedly malicious.<P>
   Numerous letters were fired off to Joe Weider from several magazine publishers and writers, squarely placing the blame for Munzer's death on Joe and bringing up the fatality of Mohammed Benaziza.  The gist of the letters (one of which was an open letter printed in one of the other muscle magazines) went on and on about the things that Joe (and his brother Ben, head of the IFBB) has done wrong.
    After reading these letters, I had to think, "Why does the blame for Munzer's death get put on Joe Welder's shoulders and no one else's?" I can think of a lot of companies and individuals in and around bodybuilding who may need to take a good look in the mirror.  And, how about finding some solutions-some real creative, effective, and original ideas that might help solve the problem that has apparently been underscored by Munzer's death?<P>
   You know why no one's offering solutions?  It's like I said-because it's so damn easy to blame other people for problems and deny any responsibility yourself.  It's so easy to pass the buck to the next guy and say, "You figure it out; it's your goddamn problem.  It has nothing to do with me.  I just wanted to make sure I spoke up let everybody know I had nothing to do with it."
   Maybe we were all responsible in some way.  Maybe we should each look at what we can do to help make it right…  to take something negative and turn it into something positive.  But, that's not what I see people doing.<P>
   Think about it... It doesn't take much of a mental powerhouse to be negative and criticize things.  Like I said, any idiot can identify problems and place blame; it's much more difficult to find solutions - it's much more difficult to offer constructive criticism and then propose new theories or solutions to existing maladies.  You know why it's difficult?  Because you have to thin!  Problem solving is a very intense, often incredibly complex subject.  You don't have to be a genius to do it (I'm certainly not!), but you have to want to work hard to change things for the better. (You know what they say... "If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem!")
   Of course, once in a while everyone deserves a swift kick in the butt--a "slam" - even me!  But lately, I know some people who have become so caught up in being critical that they literally put the majority of their time and effort into finding things to complain about it.  It's called trying to build yourself up by running others down.<P>  
   When it's all said and done, to be quite candid, I don't give a frog's fat ass about what bodybuilder said this or what scientist said that or who's fighting with whom.  My interests as a bodybuilder lie primarily in how I can get this damn fat off my midsection and how I can build 19-inch arms.  I'm always looking for ways to -prove my body through exercise, nutrition, and supplementation.  I know that's what most of you care about too.  I know because I read your feedback--I listen to your concerns (I don't just hear them).<P>
   So, even though we'll play the slam game from time to time, I want to emphasize that the majority of articles in Muscle Media 2000 will be focused on positive things-things that really matter, like what the newest and best ways to lift weights are--what the best supplements are and how we should take them-and what's the best way to feed our bodies for maximum energy, health, and muscularity.  But that's not all! <P>
   I'd like Muscle Media 2000 to take the leading role as a problem solver-one that offers solutions and new ideas instead of just being a petty whiner-a cynic.  When wan-anted, we'll criticize, but we're going to make an effort to offer "constructive criticism." And we're going to try to come up with new ideas that might help make things better For example, m the last issue of Muscle Media 2000, 1 mentioned I think bodybuilders should be rewarded for not taking physique development to extremes, and I said I was going to try to promote that idea in future issues of Muscle Media 2000 by giving recognition to drug-free bodybuilders-even those who don't compete! 
   True to our word, on this issue's cover, we feature another completely drug-free bodybuilder-Keith Klein.  Not only is this guy drug free, he's 40 years old! (Check out his story on page 68.) Now that's giving credit where credit is due!<P>
   We're also giving EAS supplement endorsement contracts to drug-free bodybuilders like Danny Hester.  And, we just signed up a kid who has a terrific physique.  He was "using," but after reading our article in the last issue, he called us and told us he wanted to go "drugless" and do it our way! (You can read all about this guy in the next issue of MM2K!) We are trying to do something positive here, and it seems like it's working!  It's just a start, but who knows?  Maybe it will turn into something major!<P>
   Another POSITIVE thing we're trying do is help take bodybuilding and turn it into more of a scientific endeavor.  I have appropriated literally hundreds of thousands of dollars to help solve some of the problems we all have-problems like not knowing which supplements do what at which dosage-which ones are worth taking and which ones aren't and we are even going to do definitive studies on weight-training exercise. (You can read all about our latest research discoveries on page 142 of the August issue of MM2K!)<P>
   And this is just the beginning.  We are going to do whatever we can to help take the art/sport of physique development in a positive direction.  We are going to look at what we can do to improve our own "act." And we are committed to being a part of the solution, not just another voice that points out the problems!  Perhaps others might consider doing the same.<P>
Be well,<P>

<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>  I was wondering if you had any information about that stuff Duchaine recently wrote about called "Flavone X." Where can I get it?</P>
<A NAME="A1"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> All I know about Flavone X I learned from Dan's article. (This is something I'm definitely not an expert on.) To review what Dan discussed, apparently there is a natural compound (a flavone) that has the ability to act as a powerful anti-aromatase.  Now, from what I understand, if you can minimize the aromatization (conversion) of testosterone to estrogen, which happens naturally in our bodies, you can convince the body to significantly increase its production of testosterone.  There are a number of drugs that do this; aminoglutethimide comes to mind.</P>
   <P>I've never spoken to anyone who has used this product, and to my knowledge, no one manufactures it for distribution as a dietary supplement.  I believe the guy who came up with this idea is a researcher named Patrick Arnold.  I'm not sure if he's working with Dan Duchaine or a supplement distributor somewhere to try to bring this product to the market.</P> 
   <P>I'd sure like to see some double-blind, placebocontrolled studies-they could be simple and short-term studies that evaluate whether or not this theory actually holds up.  All you'd have to do is take ten guys, get some good baseline testosterone readings, have them take the appropriate dose (whatever that is) of Flavone X, and then measure their testosterone levels again.  You could probably do a study like this for about $5,000, and it would be quite simple.</P>
   <P>I'd also like to see some detailed information on the safety of this compound-I don't take things, even if they're called "natural supplements," if I don't know what they are.  Heck, I rather use steroids than take my chances with "unknown" substances: at least I know what steroids do and don't do.</P>
   <P>Hopefully, Patrick Arnold, or whoever is working on this project, will thoroughly evaluate the safety and efficacy of Flavone X before he brings it to the market.  I'll definitely let you know if I find out any more details I about Flavone X.</P><HR><P></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>   I used steroids pretty much continually form the time I was 20 until I was 26.  I took a lot of Dianabol, Anadrol, testosterone suspension, and testosterone cypionate.  I've been off steroids over a year now, and my testosterone levels and sperm count are far below normal.  I have a now wife and want to start a family.  I tried taking HCG, and while I'm on it, it seems to raise my testosterone level, but I can't get my wife pregnant.  What should I do?</P>
<A NAME="A2"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>    First of all, you should be working with a skilled endocrinologist, preferably one who has experience dealing with patients who have used steroids.  There are a few experts out there, but you're really going to have to do your ho work to find one in your area.  When you find an endocrinologist who can help you, it's likely this is what he'll disc( your prolonged use of androgenic steroids has probably disrupted your body's ability to produce two very important hormones luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).  The type of condition you're most likely suffering from is called secondary hypogonadism.</P>
    <P>Without going into a bunch of complicated scientific detail, let me just give you some of the basics-LH is a hormone that's released by the pituitary gland (the pituitary gets its signal to release LH from the hypothalamus, which secretes gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH]).  Anyway, LH stimulates the Leydig cells of your testes to produce testosterone.</P>
    <P>Now, you mentioned that you have tried using the drug human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG).  HCG is a substance produced by the human placenta and is extracted and purified from the urine of pregnant women.  As it turns out, HCG very closely resembles LH, and when you take HCG injections, the body receives a signal to increase testosterone production just as if it were receiving a positive signal from LH.  A single dose of HCG can significantly increase plasma testosterone levels in normal and hypogonadal men.</P>
    <P>A lot of steroid users take HCG when they come off a cycle in an effort to "jump start" the body's natural testosterone production, which may shut down when you use anabolic steroids.  Unfortunately, this doesn't always work because even though HCG stimulates testosterone production, it's still an "artificial" stimulation.  It doesn't address the reason the body ceased testosterone production in the first place, which is because something called the hypothalamic/pituitary testicular axis is 211 screwed up.</P>
    <P>When I used to take steroids, I'd sometimes go on a six-week cycle, take HCG for two weeks, and then do another six-week cycle.  During the two weeks I was on HCG, I would get so damn strong!  It probably had something to do with the fact that I had artificial testosterone in my system, and when I elevated my natural levels, I had a dual effect going on-it was incredible!  The bad thing about HCG is it may cause your testosterone levels to go so high that some testosterone aromatizes into estrogen, aggravating gynecomastia-the small bit of gyno I have, I developed while using HCG.</P>
    <P>Of all the drugs I see bodybuilders experimenting with today-insulin, IGF-1, GH, thyroid drugs, crazy European and Australian steroids that we know little about, etc., etc.-I hear very little talk about HCG.  This is surprising because for athletes who want to get big and strong fast, a simple stack of basic steroids like Deca, injectable testosterone, and HCG will produce mindboggling results!</P>
    <P>Now, when I was using HCG, I would take 1,000 IU injected intramuscularly every other day for 2 weeks.  I would not take HCG for more days at a time because it elevated my estrogen levels.</P>
    <P>I would never stay , on for more than 8 to 12 at a time, and I never any significant decrease in my natural testosterone production-I don't know if HCG had anything to do with it or if it was the fact that I used very low dosages (by today's standards) of steroids.</P>
    <P>Anyway, even though HCG will temporarily elevate your testosterone levels, it probably won't significantly increase sperm count or motility in a situation like yours.  What you might want to suggest to your endocrinologist is that he prescribe two drugs for you-HCG and something called Pergonal.  Pergonal is a drug that contains equal amounts of FSH and LH.  LH stimulates the Leydig cells in the testes to produce testosterone, and FSH acts on the Sertoli cells, thereby stimulating spermatogenesis.</P>
    <P>Now, your endocrinologist would be wise to put you on a pretty big dose of HCG-5,000 IU three times a week.  Your doctor should measure your testosterone levels until they get in the mid-normal range, and once this occurs, you should start taking 100 IU of Pergonal three times a week.  When you start the Pergonal, drop your HCG dose back to 1,000 IU twice a week.  You may have to be on these medications for several months, but eventually, there's a very good chance that your natural testosterone production and sperm count, as well as motility, will be excellent.  Assuming your wife is fertile and that you have sex with her regularly during this period of time (duh!), it's quite likely you could be a father soon.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, when you go off these medications, your testosterone production and sperm count will probably go back to their pre-existing low levels.  I would suggest you talk to your endocrinologist about putting you on testosterone replacement therapy. (It's kind of ironic that guys who take high doses of steroids for prolonged periods of time and then decide to go off them often end up having to go back on steroids [moderate dosages] for the rest of their lives just to stay "normal.")</P>
    <P>Here's one more thing you should bring up with your doctor that he probably won't think of-if you have any gyno (which you most likely do), and you don't want to see it aggravated by the use of HCG and Pergonal, ask him or her to prescribe Nolvadex (a potent nonsteroidal oral anti-estrogen).  It may help keep your gyno from getting worse.  Incidentally, Nolvadex, in addition to being an anti-estrogen, also stimulates FSH and LH production.</P><BR><P></P>

<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=left SIZE=5>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I've been working out for three years, and I've made some great gains.  I'm pretty happy with the way my arms and shoulders look, but I just can't get my chest to grow.  I do a lot of  bench pressing (my max. is 320 lbs), but for some reason, I feet most of the work in my shoulders and triceps-I have trouble getting a pump in my chest, and it hardly, ever gets sore from my workouts.  Any ideas?</P>
<A NAME="A3"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>   It's hard to say exactly what your problem might be without having the chance to go over this issue with you personally in a gym but here's what I would guess might help you out: try using a wider grip on your bench press-put your index fingers about 34 inches apart on the barbell.  This really forces the pectoral muscles into the exercise and takes the strain off the shoulders and triceps somewhat. (Depending on your body type, 34 inches apart may be a bit too wide or not quite wide enough.  You may need to make moderate adjustments.  For me, it's just right.)</P>
    <P>If you're not using a wide enough grip on the bench press, you'll be doing a lot of shoulder and triceps work.  That's great if you have big pecs and want to build your shoulders and triceps, but in your case, I would suggest you focus exclusively on doing wide-grip bench pressing.  Here's something else you can do to really blast those chest muscles-after you've warmed up and done a few heavy sets of bench pressing, take an even wider grip (36 inches between your index fingers) and do a "light", burnout set of 6-12 repetitions; really work the negative-let the bar down s-l-o-w-1-y, taking a count of up to six seconds.  You might have to have a partner lift the weight back up, but lower it with your own strength.  I guarantee this will destroy your pecs!</P>
    <P>For guys who already have great pecs and would like to add some mass to the front deltoids and triceps, try using a closer grip (26 inches between your index fingers) on most of your bench-press sets.</P>
    <P>If you're looking to develop your entire upper body, try to vary your grip on the bench press from having your index fingers 26 inches apart to 30, to 34, and then 36.  You can do a set at each width during your workout, or you can do an entire workout with a close grip, then next time use a wider grip and vary it each time. (Of all the chest exercises you can do, wide-grip bench pressing is #1 in my book!)</P>
    <P>Here's a simple, but killer, chest routine for you to follow the next time you train your pecs.</P>
    <CENTER>FLAT BENCH PRESS</CENTER></P>
    <CENTER>Warm-up 2 sets of 12 reps with 135 lbs</CENTER>
    <CENTER>Work Sets</CENTER>
    <CENTER>8 reps with 185 lbs</CENTER>
    <CENTER>6 reps with 225 lbs</CENTER>
    <CENTER>4 reps with 255 lbs</CENTER>
    <CENTER>2 reps with 300 lbs</CENTER>
    <P> When you're doing your heavy work sets, rest two or three minutes between sets.  Go fairly slow on the way down (two or three seconds) and press the weight up as fast as you can!</P>
    <CENTER>Burnout Set</CENTER>
    <CENTER>225 lbs to total failure</CENTER>
    <CENTER>(usually between 6 and 12 reps)</CENTER> <P> </P>
    <P> On this burnout set, take the weight down super, super slowly-six seconds for each eccentric phase.  Once you've reached concentric failure, have a spotter lift the weight for you and then lower it slowly under your own power.</P>
    <P> As soon as you finish your last set of bench presses, immediately do just one set of incline dumbbell flyes-use 55 lbs and go to total positive failure-usually between 8 and 12 reps.  Go fairly slow on the way up and down-three seconds up and three seconds down on these reps.</P>HThat's it!  Don't do any more exercises for your chest after this.  Just put all your effort into these sets.<P>  
    Make sure you write me after you try this program and let me know if your pecs don't get so damn sore you can't even touch them!</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>In the last issue of your magazine, I read about how this shampoo called Nizoral may help prevent hair loss caused by steroid use (which I am unfortunately experiencing!).  I understand Nizoral is also available in tablets, for oral administration, as well as the shampoo.  Would it help to take the orals also?</P>
<A NAME="A4"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>That would be a very bad idea.  Oral Nizoral, just like the shampoo, is an antifungal agent used to treat conditions such as oral thrush and some other nasty stuff Id rather not get into.
    Anyway, Nizoral tablets can be extremely toxic to the liver, and this stuff can virtually shut down testosterone production.</P>
    <P>Nizoral also interferes with cortisol production, and I've heard that some European athletes might have used this stuff in an effort to produce an anti-catabolic effect, but when you lower your body's testosterone levels and cortisol levels, estrogen becomes a big problem.  I could go on and on, but it's just not worth going into.  I'd stay the hell away from Nizoral tablets if I were you!   </P>
    <P> Now, extensive studies Nizoral shampoo have shown using this stuff does not increase plasma levels; in other words, washing your hair with shampoo does not mean you'll get this stuff in your blood I would if you took the tablets. </P>
    <P> Nizoral is reportedly an available only by prescription, and it apparently blocks the effect of androgens (testosterone) on hair follicles. </P>
    <P>Nizoral shampoo may be far more effective than Rogaine for preventing hair loss caused by steroid use - make sure to ask your doctor about it (not that he'll have a clue).   </P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I'm trying to lose fat and cut up, but I just can't seem to control my calorie intake-I get too damn hungry when I start dieting.  Right now, I weigh 205 lbs and would like to drop 10 lbs of fat.  I'm trying to eat about 2,000 calories a day, but it's hard not to eat more.  Is there any type of appetite suppressant I can take that might help me out?
<A NAME="A5"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>I don't recommend prescription appetite suppressants because there's a "natural" way to control your eating while you're on a diet that I think works very well.  It's called protein. Yes, protein can be a powerful appetite suppressant!</P>
    <P>Try this-cut back your carbohydrate intake and increase your protein intake.  Try consuming about 45 grams of protein every 3 hours throughout the day, for a total of 6 meals.  You should try to make each meal about 350 calories.</P>
    <P>Not only will protein help your fat-loss efforts because it causes a greater increase in your metabolism than any other macronutrient, clinical studies have shown protein may have a very nice appetite-suppressing effect.  On the other hand, carbohydrates, can cause a dramatic increase in your appetite. </P>
    <P>In one clinical study, a meal that was e up of 50% protein (consumed in the morning) caused  people to reduce their food intake by 25% throughout the rest of the day!</P>
    <P>Why don't you give this try?  It's an extremely effective plan, and it works quite well for me.</P>

<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=left SIZE=5>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>I've been thinking about trying steroids, but I'm concerned about the side effects. to got an honest answer from my doctor-he says that most athletes who go on steroids die from the side effects, but since I personally know about 50 guys who use steroids (and have used them for years), I know this is false.  What are the real side effects of steroid use?
<A NAME="A6"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>I don't know why so many medical professionals are absolutely clueless when it comes to steroids.  The fact that doctors in general have insisted for literally decades that steroids don't work, in spite of the fact that literally thousands and thousands of athletes were proving them wrong, and the fact that they continue to sensationalize and misrepresent the side effects associated with steroid use, has really hurt their credibility-it's no wonder most athletes don't trust or believe anything doctors say about steroids.</P>
    <P>So what are the real side effects of using steroids?  Well, that depends on what steroids are used and how they're taken.  If you're talking about therapeutic dosages, like 200 mg a week of testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, or Deca-Durabolin, the side effects are usually minimal but might include a reduction in HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) and an increased level of LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol).  This may slightly increase a persons risk of cardiovascular disease, but scientists believe that risk is minimal, especially if you exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet (two things that significantly lower a persons risk for heart disease).</P>
    <P>Other side effects might include acne, water retention, and decreased natural testosterone and sperm production.  Virtually all of these side effects are temporary, and things basically go back to normal when you stop taking these steroids, especially if you "cycle" the drugs (go on and off).</P>
    <P>The positive effects of cycling therapeutic dosages of steroids in healthy weight trainers include things like increased nitrogen retention, increased lean body mass and muscle strength, increased bone mass, increased vigor and sex drive, as well as an improved sense of well-being.</P>
    <P>Some experts (including me) believe the therapeutic use of anabolic steroids may help reverse many of the signs of aging and improve health in some people.</P>
    <P>In a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine (Vol. 334, No. I 1, page 713), which reviewed androgen therapy, a doctor states, "When administered properly, androgens are safe." I agree 100%.  My definition of the proper administration of these drugs is that they be used in reasonable dosages, and the subject who's using them should have his health monitored monthly blood tests, prostate check-ups, etc. (Notice I don't say "his or her." I don't think women should use steroids at all!)</P>
    <P>The unfortunate reality is, at least 90% of all body-builders who use anabolic steroids use dosages that greatly exceed what I consider "reasonable," and hardly any of them monitor their health in any way, shape, or form.</P>
    <P>Today, it's not unusual at all for a bodybuilder to use 2,000 mg of testosterone cypionate a week, along with hundreds of milligrams of toxic oral steroids, like Anadrol, as well as drugs like insulin, IGF- 1, growth hormone, thyroid, clenbuterol, ephedrine, and so on.  Virtually no scientific studies have been conducted to examine the effects this irresponsible drug abuse might cause.</P>
    <P>My guess is that individuals ' who abuse bodybuilding drugs in this manner will experience a significant increased risk for heart disease (the #1 killer in the United States by a long shot!), liver disease, kidney disease, psychological abnormalities, hair loss, acne, visceral growth (leading to that bloated-gut look), impotence, sterility, ulcers, and an enlarged heart.</P>
    <P>Of course, the "Positives" associated with this type of drug abuse are huge increases in muscle size and strength.</P>
    <P>Now, despite how great the risks seem, there are very few cases of huge bodybuilders dropping dead as a result of drug abuse.  Sure, there have been a few deaths in recent years that can be linked to excessive use of body-building drugs but not nearly as many as you might expect.
    But, does this mean that even huge doses of anabolic steroids, combined with other bodybuilding dope, aren't really that dangerous?</P>
    <P>My opinion is that it is dangerous-very dangerous and stupid.  The risks involved with the tremendous drug abuse that has gone on in bodybuilding over the past five years have not yet had time to come to the surface-we haven't really had a chance to see what type of side effects spawn from all this.  My guess is that over the next ten years, a lot of today's bodybuilding superstars will be suffering serious and even fatal side effects because of what they're doing to their bodies today. And for what?  Only a tiny handful of top bodybuilders make a decent living, and virtually none of them become "famous." As much as I truly love Arnold Schwarzenegger and as much as his existence has positively impacted my life, in a way, his success has "warped" the minds of many bodybuilders.  You see, so many bodybuilders think if they win a few big contests and get bulked up enough on steroids, they'll automatically become powerful, rich, and famous superstars.  Guess what, guys-it ain't gonna happen!<P>
    <P>The truth is, Arnold became what he is today not because he took steroids and won the Mr. Olympia contest but because of his charisma, talent, intelligence, and drive.</P>
    <P>And, as I discussed in the last issue of Muscle Media 2000, after a certain point, adding more muscle does not make you look better.  I don't know what these guys are thinking these days.  Everyone is so convinced that the more muscle people have, the better they look, and that's not true.  So, the reason most bodybuilders abuse steroids is a stupid one.  The end does not justify the means.</P>
    <P>Anyway, to answer your question, anabolic steroids, when used properly, are no more dangerous than hundreds of other prescription drugs-it's the abuse of these compounds that makes them dangerous.</P>


<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=left SIZE=5>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>I recently read an article in another bodybuilding magazine where the author said the supplement CoQ10 was a much better bodybuilding supplement than HMB.    Do you know if that's true?</P>
<A NAME="A7"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>I've been studying bodybuilding and practicing it for over 15 years.  I've reviewed feedback from, or personally interviewed, literally thousands of bodybuilders.  I survey the heck out of the readers of my magazine and others in an effort to discover what works and what doesn't.
    Yet, in all the years I've been at this, and out of all the people I've talked to and received feedback from, no one, not a single person, has ever told me they thought CoQl0 helped their bodybuilding efforts in any way, shape, or form.  I have personally used CoQl0 without noticing any results whatsoever.</P>
    <P>I've also reviewed all the scientific literature I have access to and have seen no peer-reviewed, published studies, no abstracts, no scientific data of any kind that leads me to believe that when CoQl0 is used by bodybuilders it produces an increase in lean body mass and/or strength.  The data just doesn't exist!  Thus, in my  <a href=http://www.mm2k.com/nsr/nsr96.html>(1996 Supplement Review)</a>, I rate CoQl0 as a worthless bodybuilding supplement.</P>
    <P>This is not to say that CoQl0 does not seem to have some interesting metabolic effects which might be of interest to endurance athletes and/or those seeking efficacious life-extension supplements.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, contemporary literature which I have access to on HMB offers strong evidence that this amino acid metabolite plays an important role on muscle metabolism.  Three separate, original studies have demonstrated that HMB exerts a positive effect on the things bodybuilder care about-size, strength, and fat loss.  And HMB works for me.  Thus, I gave HMB a very high rating in my 1996 Supplement review.</P>
    <P> I'm aware of the article you mentioned, and I'm also aware the author cites the reason I gave CoQ10 a bad rating and HMB a good rating was because I sell HMB and don't sell CoQ10.   That doesn't make any sense at all because there is nothing that would keep me form selling CoQ10 if I wanted to.  I could call any one of literally dozens of supplement manufacturers and ask them to slap a private label on the bottle of CoQ10, and I could sell it.  It's not complicated at all.  I could sell virtually any supplement I wanted to, but I'm involved in the marketing distribution of very few: products.  The products I endorse and help distribute are ones that have worked for me, and that I believe will work for other body builders.  If I had any reason to believe that CoQl0, or any one of many other products I don't sell, would provide positive bodybuilding effects for the people who read my magazine and purchase products from me, then I'd sell them.  Ifs that simple and easy.</P>
    <P> Here's one more thing that writer contends in his recent article that scientific abstracts mean nothing until they're peer reviewed.  Well, if he believes the abstracts which show the results of recent double-blind, placebocontrolled, university studies showing HMB positively influences muscle size and strength are meaningless, then why did he cite that research as a "new frontier in nutrition' on page 158 of the November 1995 issue of Muscular Development Why did he cite one of the recent HMB abstracts as a reference?  It dosen't make any sense.  When I cite an abstract to validate my claim that the study was actually conducted and this is not bogus non-sense like some marketers have been known to promulgate, it's improper but if he wants to cite the abstract, then it's okay.  Whatever!<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>   As a professional bodybuilder, I was very offended by what you wrote in the last issue of your magazine about how the 'top dogs' are all on steroids and are not credible spokespersons for supplements.  You know as well as I do that virtually all the money in this business comes from supplements.  Without endorsement contracts from supplement companies, a lot of top bodybuilders, including myself, would have no way to make a decent living.  Also, I think your article is going to hurt my ability to make money guest posing.  Why does your whole magazine have to be about steroids?  Don't you have anything else to write about?  And why don't you leave pro bodybuilders alone?</P>
<A NAME="A8"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> First of all, in Muscle Media 2000, we do much, much more than report information on steroids.  I think it just seems like it's all about steroids sometimes because I guess it's still shocking or surprising to some people that the issue is even candidly addressed at all.</P>
    <P>The reason I answer so many questions about steroids is because there is a huge void left by other information providers in this industry-they seem to either not know anything about steroids or they do a great job of pretending they don't know anything about them!</P>
    <P>The intent of TC.'s "No Holds Barred" article in the July issue of MM2K and my follow-up commentary in that issue called "How Can We Get Bodybuilders to Stop Abusing Drugs?" were meant to be very constructive, not destructive!</P>
    <P>Everyone knows pro bodybuilders take steroids-it's not a secret anymore, and it hasn't been for a long time!  Thus, I don't think many aspiring bodybuilders buy into the endorsement of a top bodybuilder who promotes a particular supplement.  Like I said in the last issue, it's just not a credible endorsement anymore.
    If you read this magazine regularly, you know I really have no problem (other than the legal ramifications and whatnot) with people using steroids-I just wish they'd stop abusing these drugs!  Maybe it's hopeless, but I just can't believe that if we deal with this issue in a very straightforward and forthright manner that people's sense of logic wont somehow prevail.</P>
    <P>Because of the way I've positioned the Experimental and Applied Sciences (EAS) supplements, I can't have any steroid users endorse them-it would be an inconsistent message.  EAS is a company that was literally founded on scientific research, and I'm determined to maintain as much credibility in the marketing and promotion of EAS products as possible.  I don't think signing up steroid abusing bodybuilders, no matter how nice, great looking, nor how great their achievements, is going to help.  I realize that pros like you are extremely dedicated to body building-I know how difficult the diets are and how just training and eating can be a full-time job!  I've been there.  I haven't been a pro, of course, but at one time in my life, I was as dedicated to physique development as anyone I know.  It's a bitch!</P>
    <P>I'm not trying to hurt any bodybuilders' chances of making a living off what they do-as a matter of fact, I'm trying to open up new opportunities for financial gain to bodybuilders who might not have had the chance to make a career out of bodybuilding.  For example, we recently signed Danny Hester-he's a great young bodybuilder, and he now has a super endorsement contract with EAS.  But, if he flunks a drug test (and we're testing him at random six times a year), then he's done-no more money.  Game over!</P>
    <P>  Danny will be an EAS spokesperson as long as he relies only on EAS supplements, quality nutrition, and intense weight-training exercise to build his body.</P>
    <P> If he uses steroids, even low dosages, it would be impossible for him to tell if the gains he was making were because of supplements or because of drugs-I just can't have that type of conflict.</P>
    <P>As far as guest-posing opportunities, I don't think my 'revealing' that pros use steroids is going to hurt anyone's chance of getting a gig. I don't know how things are out there in Venice, but the rest of the world knows bodybuilders take steroids-like I said, it's not a secret anymore.</P>
    <P> If you're ever interested in getting off steroids, send a fax or write me a letter, and we'll talk shop--I'd like to see some pros make a bold move, do the right thing, and come clean.  A pro that could just come out and tell the truth about having used steroids to help build his body and then come off the juice and start on EAS products (which I honestly believe are the best bodybuilding supplements available anywhere) would have a very interesting story to tell; it could garner a great deal of credibility with consumers in this market.  I've tried to encourage a couple of pros to do this already, to no avail-I even offered some pretty big money, but apparently there's something about this idea that the cats I'm pitching don't dig.</P>
    <P>Unlike other supplement companies, any contract I sign with a bodybuilder will have no rewards for winning contests and no penalties for losing; that is, as long as they're doing the best they can and a solid effort is being made to stick to the supplement, training, and nutrition programs I design for them.  If they're giving it their best, then I have no problem with whether they finish first or last.  It's the message that matters.
    I really think body builders should stop this obsession with getting bigger and bigger and go back to trying to build the perfect, muscular, symmetrical body-this is what body building should be about!</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>What do you think of this new supplement called HGF-I?</P>
<A NAME="A9"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I don't understand what this stuff is supposed to do-I know there are no studies that show it does anything to directly to improve muscle size and strength, and when I'm reviewing a supplement that has not yet been studied, I like to look for a theory-a possible mechanism of how it might work.  I don't have any idea how this stuff could possibly aid in muscle building.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I've had a bad case of gynecomastia for about 4 years—it actually started when I hit puberty, and then when I was 22, I started to use some Anadrol and testosterone off and on for a few years.  I've tried everything to get rid of the gyno—Nolvadex , Teslac, Proviron, etc., but it's not working.  Even though I'm not taking steroids, I would swear it's getting worse every few months.  What should I do?</P>
<A NAME="A10"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>   Here's my advice-get surgery, and have the damn things fixed once and for all!

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>I'm a freshman in college, and I love bodybuilding.  I'm taking creatine monohydrate, and  I'm getting great results, but the food at my cafeteria sucks.  I don't have a lot of money, but I know I could make better gains in muscle size and strength if I could get more protein and good solid nutrition.  I would like to use Myoplex Plus for a couple of extra meals a day, but to be honest, I can't afford it.  What should I do?</P>
<A NAME="A11"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>I know where you're coming from-I had to spend a whole year eating college cafeteria food-it's kind of like being in the military. (Hey, "Web page editor resembles that remark")  Fortunately, I have some great news for you.  Recently, I screwed up royally, and my mistake is going to allow you, and a handful of other bodybuilders, to get in on the supplement bargain of the century!</P>
    <P>Here's the deal while back, I was working on a new product idea-I was looking at all the instant breakfast products on the market and thinking about what a bunch of god-awful crap they are.  They're really nothing more than sugar combined with low-quality, high-lactose protein-they're just no good at all.</P>
    <P>I recognized that the concept of meal-replacement products (like Myoplex Plus, Rx Fuel, Neo-Lean, etc.) could be extended to appeal to all athletes who realize how important go6d-quality protein, vitamins, mineral's, complex carbohydrates, key amino acids, etc. are for the body.</P>
    <P>I wanted to come out with a super high-quality, high protein, very nutritious instant breakfast drink mix, so I worked with our food science laboratory in Southern California on this project for several months and came up with an outstanding formula.  I threw around all kinds of names, but the one I liked best was "Perfect Start." Basically, fiom a nutritional standpoint, it is my opinion that the nutritional profile of this product is a perfect way to start the day--ergo, "Perfect Start."</P>
    <P>I had one of my attorneys do what's called a "trademark searh' on the name Perfect Start to see if anyone had registered it. (Before you name a product something, it's commercially prudent to see if anyone else has registered the name first-it's standard business stuff.) Anyway, I was under the impression that Id received the "okay from my attorney to use the name Perfect Start, so I told the manufacturer to go for it.  We ran an initial batch of the product (fortunately for me it wasn't all that big of an initial batch).  I was going to uses this to test the concept-to see if fitness-conscious people would think my idea was a good one and if they would buy this product.</P>
    <P> Anyway, after this stuff hit my warehouse, I received a second memo from my attorney saying we can't use the name Perfect Start because someone else has already registered it.  Great!  Now I've got pretty good sized chunk of change sitting in inventory at my warehouse, and I can't market the product!  And there's no way I can repackage it; it's just not feasible.</P>
    <P>Anyway, I ended up getting rid of my attorney and hiring a new one, and I've decided to take this very frustrating and aggravating situation and turn it into something really positive for some of my loyal customers/readers.  Here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to take my supply of this Perfect Start formula, and I'm going to sell it for practically nothing.  It would be a shame to let this terrific product go to waste.  I can't sell it at health food stores because the company that has registered the name Perfect Start would freak out, so I'm just going to unload my inventory through my phone order service. It's a "clearance sale,"  I guess you might say.</P>
    <P>  As you know, a good quality meal-replacement product like Myoplex Plus (which is very to Perfect Start) costs about $2.50 a serving.  But, check this out- I'm going to sell my inventory of Perfect Start for 97cents a packet!  It comes in a box of 30 packets, which costs only $29.10 (plus our standard $6.50 shipping and handling charge).</P>
    Take a look (below) at the nutritional profile of "Perfect Start"-as you can see, it's a very high-quality product, and it tastes absolutely great,</P>
    <P>Basically, with "Perfect Start for less than $ 1. 00, you can get a balanced, high-protein, 4 complex-carbohydrate meal that would be great to first thing in the morning, and it would also be super for you to take anytime throughout the day when you need a high-nutrient, low-fat meal.  For Christ's sakes, on most campuses, you can't even get a soda out of the vending machine for less than a dollar!  This may very well be the best supplement bargain you'll ever come across!</P>
    <P>Basically, I have enough of this product for one percent of my readers-since subscribers get this magazine about a week before it goes out on the newsstand, I would think my Perfect Start inventory should be cleared out by the time this magazine even hits the stands.  It's going to be a first-come, first-served situation.
    Also, I have to set a strict limit of eight 30-pack boxes per customer-I don't want any retailers buying this product and then marking it up and reselling it-like I said, this could get me into some legal trouble, which I don't need.</P>
    What I would really like to see happen is some guys in school or perhaps in the military, into bodybuilding but don't have a lot of money, snatch up my inventory of Perfect Start.  Basically, Id like to see my "botch job' turn into something positive for someone.  So if you rant to order some Perfect Start, call <B>1-800-615-8500</B> (ask for Dept. #2566), but do it quick! </P>
    <P> I just want to get this whole thing behind me, go back to the drawing board, pick a name that someone hasn't used for a nutritional product like this, and hopefully get this product out  to retailers by the I end the year.  I really do think there is a need for a high-quality nutrition-packed "instant breakfast" supplement. I've just got to think of a catchy name. (If anybody's got a name that makes sense for a product like this, please send it over .. ) I expect this product will probably retail for about $2.35 a packet by the time it gets to health-food stores later this year.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>I Recently came across an article in a scientific publication that reported the findings of a study that examined the combined effects of synthetic growth hormone (GH) and that new recombinant insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1).  The researchers who performed this study come to the conclusion that these products do not work synergistically.  However, in recent issues of Muscle Media 2OW, several of your writers have claimed that GH and IGF-I produce a profound synergistic effect.  It seems this is a glaring mistake, and you should have your writers check their facts a little more closely in the future.  How could this mistake slip by?</P>
<A NAME="A12"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>I'm aware of the study you're talking about-it was published last year in The Journal of applied Clinical Endocrinology 6, Metabolism.  That study showed GH (at a dose of .025 mg per kg per day) combined with IGF-1 (100 mcg per kg twice daily) produced results that were no greater than when GH or IGF-1 were given independently.  So, not only did this study not show a synergistic effect, it didn't even reveal an additive effect.</P>
    <P>From a "big-picture" standpoint, I couldn't give a rat's ass if GH and/or IGF-1 work miracles by themselves or together or whatever-I don't use these drugs, I don't recommend these drugs, etc., so I don't have as keen an interest in this topic as I do in many others, like training, nutrition, and supplementation.  However, I don't want you to go away thinking the information in MM2K is inaccurate.  I understand your concern regarding this issue, so let me point out a few things in defense of the good people who write for MM2K.</P>
    <P>First of all, there are a few possible reasons why GH and IGF-1, when stacked in this study, didn't produce additive or synergistic effects.  The first and most glaring problem with trying to extrapolate information from this research into bodybuilding is that the guys in this study didn't even train with weights!  People who do intense weight-training exercise have a completely different metabolic/anabolic/catabolic environment than sedentary or "normal" folks.  None of our writers have ever claimed you can take any compound, even steroids, not workout, and see any increases at all in muscle size and strength.  The results of this study might have been completely different if the subjects were training with weights.</P>
    <P>This study also only evaluated one dosage--it's very possible that different dosages could produce different results, even though, from what I know about GH and IGF-I use, the amounts used in this study seem to be sufficient.</P>
    <P>I'm convinced, based on anecdotal evidence alone, that GH, IGF-1, and insulin, when theyre injected by bodybuilders who train hard with weights and give their body the proper nutritional support, produce much
    greater gains than when any of these compounds are used by themselves.</P>
    <P>I think thaes what some of our writers recently commented on, and I hope this makes enough sense to restore your faith in the accuracy and credibility of the information in MM2K Certainly, we're not 100% right all the time, but we give it our best shot!</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I use protein supplements like Next Nutrition's Designer Whey Protein and Myoplex Plus a couple of times a day to help make sure my muscles got the amino acids they need to get bigger and stronger, but I also like to eat real food.  I usually have oatmeal and egg whites for breakfast, a protein drink around mid-morning, tune for lunch, another protein supplement in the afternoon, and then I try to have chicken or lean red meat for dinner.  I actually have been following a nutrition program that was designed for me by one of the writers for your magazine, Keith Klein.  Sometimes I take raw egg whites and put them in a blender with orange juice and fresh fruit for breakfast-4've been doing this for years.  But, I'm getting tired of cracking a dozen eggs every morning and separating the white from the yolk, and coincidentally, I think I've had salmonella food poisoning twice over the past four months.  Both times I lost eight pounds in three days.  Man, was I sick!  I'm thinking about switching from egg whites to one of those egg substitutes like Egg Beaters or Better Than Eggs, but I was wondering if the protein in those products is as good as real egg whites.  I've read that if the amino-acid sequence of proteins isn't just right, it won't have the right bioavailability.  Is this true?</P>
<A NAME="A13"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>   First of all, it sounds like you've got a really good nutrition plan.  I think feeding the body with an ample serving of high-quality protein every few hours while you're awake is extremely important for maximizing muscle growth.</P>
    <P>My nutrition program is not too different from yours-I usually like to combine "regular food' protein along with the high-quality protein I get from supplements.</P>
    <P>Ever since I started bodybuilding, I've relied on egg whites and tuna as quality whole-food sources of protein.  I wish I had some accurate statistics on how many egg whites and how many cans of tuna bodybuilders consume each year-I'm sure it's literally thousands of tons!  And for good reason-these are very high-quality protein sources, which are also extremely low in fat.</P>
    <P>When I read your letter and you mentioned how much time you spend separating egg whites from egg yolks, I remembered how many hours I used to spend doing this.  I also thought about when I used to live in a small apartment with three other bodybuilders.  Every morning, we'd each have 12 egg whites in a "blender drink with orange juice and Carboplex (an old carbohydrate supplement that used to be sold by UniPro).  Oh Lord… Those were the days!  All that really mattered to us back then was eating, sleeping, taking steroids and working out—heck, sometimes we'd spend an entire day sitting around arguing about what would the best way to train legs and why.  We used judge our progress back then by how many new stretch marks we could each get and how soon we could outgrow our clothes.  Life was simple then—not a lot of responsibilities, no any kind... Boy have things changed!</P>
    <P>Earth to Bill--back to the real world.  What was I talking about..? Oh, eggs.  Where was I going with that ... ? I was thinking about all those damn egg yolks that used to pile up around that little apartment.  We'd go through almost 400 eggs a week-that meant 400 egg yolk and egg shells sitting around in the trash. (It was just too much to put down the garbage disposal.) By the time the trash got picked up every Tuesday, the entire neighborhood stunk... Man oh man were those egg shells and egg yolks rank.</P>
    <P>Fortunately, that part of the "good ole days" is long gone.  I don't even eat eggs any more, but I developed quite a liking for the taste of egg whites, especially in omelets with tomatoes and mushrooms.  It's a great diet food for bodybuilders!  As a matter of fact, sometimes I'll have an omelet for breakfast and instead of having chicken or fish for dinner, I'll have another omelet at night.  It really satiates my craving for "real food."</P>
    <P>For about a year, I switched to Egg Beaters-they're a pretty good product, and they're much more convenient than trying to separate the high cholesterol, fatty egg yolks from the high-protein, good-for-you egg whites.  Also, with a product like Egg Beaters, there's no risk of salmonella food poisoning, which is nice.
    But about four months ago, I switched from Egg product called 'Egg Right." This Egg is pretty nifty stuff.  
    I learned about it from one of the readers of my magazine who me a sample and told me he thought it was great.  Ever since then, been buying case after case, but to be honest, I never really thought there would be much of a market for it   Right now, it's being sold on a very limited basis—you can't find it at any health-food or grocery stores.  Ther product is manufactured for a company called R.J Nutrition in Phoenix, Arizona.  This company apparently developed the technology to extract the egg whites from eggs, purify it, and reconstitute it into a powdered form.  But Egg Right is not at all like those terrible egg-white protein powders that have been on the market for over two decades-you know, the ones that mix like oil and water and taste like rotten chalk Egg Right is not like that at all!  Egg Right mixes very easily with water, and unlike those crappy egg-white protein powders that you can still buy at the health-food stores, you can cook with Egg Right!  It makes an absolutely delicious omelet, or you can take the powder and use it to make protein shakes.  You can even use it to increase the protein content of a meal-replacement product or whatever else you're eating.</P>
    <P>Another thing I really like about Egg Right is that the people who formulated this stuff really knew what they were doing.  Egg-white protein is very good quality many experts still consider it the best protein nature ever invented.  But, the food scientists who created this product recognized that even Mother Nature has her shortcomings, and the amino acid profile of egg whites isn't perfect.  For example, egg-white protein is a little low in the amino acid alanine, which is an extremely important amino for protein metabolism--I think you'll be hearing a lot more about alanine in the future.  And, Egg Right is fortified with glutamine (virtually all bodybuilders know how important glutamine is for optimal muscle metabolism).  It's also fortified with Vitamin B6, which, if it's not present in the right quantities, can actually inhibit protein absorption and metabolism.
    So, Egg Right contains a super high-quality source of protein (egg whites), and it's also fortified with precise levels of glutamine, alanine, and Vitamin B6-nutrients that may very well play an extremely important role in protein absorption, utilization, and muscle building.</P>
    <P>Not only that, Egg Right has absolutely no artificial flavors, no artificial colors, no aspartame, no sugar, no lactose, no fillers, no binders, etc., etc.  This stuff really is 100% natural!</P>
    <P>And, guess what?  It's an f-in' bargain!  One container of the stuff contains the equivalent of 168 egg whites!  That's 14 dozen eggs-and it only costs $29.95.</P>
    <P> That actually makes it quite a bit cheaper than Egg Beaters (which I had been using for the past year) and other egg substitutes.</P>
    <P>I use Egg Right to make scrambled eggs, omelets, French Toast-my girlfriend even adds it to pancake batter to make really rich-tasting, high-protein pancakes!  She also blends Egg Right with pudding to make the creamiest, richest, healthiest high-protein pudding I've ever tasted!  It's unbelievable! (AR you do to make it is stir the powder in some water-it takes about a minute.)</P>
    <P>Anyway, I never really thought about helping this Rj.  Nutrition Company market Egg Right, but after I received your letter, I got to thinking about what a good product it is, and I thought Id do a little test market.  So, I bought a few cases of Egg Right and thought Id bounce the idea off the readers of my magazine.  I figured Id see if anybody were interested in using this product, and then Id collect some feedback and see if bodybuilders like this stuff as much as I do.  So, I'm basically doing a little test-marketing project.  If you'd like to try Egg Right, all you have to do is call my distribution company at 1-800-615-8500 (Dept. #2576), and check it out.  It's only $29.95 per container (plus $6.50 shipping and handling), and like I said, one container replaces 168 egg whites!  Heck, this one container could last you a month if you consume six egg whites every day-of course, I go through about twice that much, but I really like this stuff, and my girlfriend uses it to increase the protein content of all kinds of different foods.</P>
    <P>By the way, another benefit of Egg Right is that, unlike eggs (or even Egg Beaters or any other egg substitute), Egg Right has a 12-month shelf life!  And it doesn't need to be refrigerated.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>  I really, really want to look like a body builders to have big, muscular, vascular arms; pecs that look like plates of armor; and definded abdominal muscles more than anything else!  But I just can't seem to get anywhere.  I try to work out whenever I get a chance, but with my job, its very difficult.  And I try to eat right, but I end up going out to dinner with my wife, having pizza and beer with friends, and so on.  It's like I take one step forward and two steps back.  How do you stick with it?</P>
<A NAME="A14"><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>This is a great question, and it's one that literally tens of thousands of aspiring bodybuilders ask.  The truth is, bodybuilding is as much mental as it is physical.  Along with the success of every bodybuilder, athlete, or business person lies a tremendous commitment.  This is something I'm afraid we've neglected to properly address in Muscle Media 2000, and ies something we'll try to focus more on in the future.  For now, I would advise that you constantly strive to increase order and discipline in your bodybuilding endeavors.  Discipline usually means doing the opposite of what you feel like doing!

Okay, time to spill your guts.  I just listened to one of your audiotape interviews, and you mentioned your "1996 surprise" that's supposed to change bodybuilding forever.  You promised to release it in January of 1996.  It's way past that.  So, what is it?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>
Alright... I'll tell you about it if you promise not to use it!  About a hundred years ago, German TNT factory workers started mysteriously dying after breathing the dust and vapors of one of the TNT components: dinitrophenol (DNP).  The cause of death was from hyperthermia (the body temperature got too high, causing brain death).  After 30 years, DNP was reexamined and found to be a staggeringly effective metabolic elevator.  In the '30's, DNP was the diet drug in America, until the newly formed FDA restricted its transportation across state lines.
<P>
<b><CENTER> "...DNP is the most Dangerous compound in bodybuilding today<br>
one small mistake will cause a moderately slow DEATH."</CENTER></b>
<P>
The raising of body temperature through DNP is an entirely distinct mechanism from the action of beta-agonists like clenbuterol and ephedrine.  At the mitochondrial level, DNP interferes with the uptake of hydrogen ions from fatty acids that are used to make ATP (adenosine triphosphate).  It throws the fat energy off as heat instead of converting it to ATE At the correct dosage, DNP will elevate metabolic rate by over 50%!
<P>
Before you get too excited over this, be fore-warned: DNP is classified as a POISON!  Here's an excerpt from the Merck Index.
<P>Highly toxic material.  Readily absorbed through intact skin. ...profuse sweating, nausea, vomiting, collapse, death.  May cause dermatitis, cataracts, weight loss, granulocytopenia, polyneuropathy exfoliative dermatitis..
<P>I happen to be one of only three or four in the country who knows what per dosages are and how to synergistically combine it with other thermogenic agents like thyroid and betagonists.  So why do I feel this will change bodybuilding forever?  DNP is with common pool-cleaning chemicals your backyard, so it's not an illegal drug.  A year's supply costs than $20.  And when combined injectable Humulin R insulin, it's staggeringly anabolic and completely eliminates the problem of getting fat when using insulin without growth hormone.  Remember: in most states, insulin isn't a prescription item.  (However, that doesn't mean it isn't  potentially dangerous-it is!)
<P>
And that's all I'm going to say about DNP at this point.  This is a very slow project, and I may not be able to release all the results until the exhaustive research is done.  Most of the DNP research was done before 1966, which is when the computer database Medline starts the research listings.  My assistant is going through the voluminous Index Medicus books year by year.  Most of the research journals aren't even in the California medical libraries.
<P>
One more thing.  DNP is the most DANGEROUS compound in bodybuilding today.  Combined with insulin, one small mistake will cause a moderately slow DEATH.  This isn't a substance to look at lightly!
<P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>
Do you have a favorite steroid? And why?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>Well, yes and no.  You probably know that I'm regularly tested for steroids part of my supervised release from Federal prison.  But even if I could use steroids, I'd  face a major problem-my favorite steroid longer being made.
<P>
In Mexico, a company called Syntex sold Anatrofin (stenbolone acetate) in 100-mg ampoules mid-1980's.  After it was pulled off the Mexican market, one could still find a lower dose version in Europe.  I just loved this steroid because I was so damn happy while I was on it.  It was only mildly anabolic, but I had no acne problems, no water retention, and no subliminal anxiety like most of the other steroids instill.  I was just one happy steroid user.  I've used more potent anabolics, but if I had to pick one steroid to use for the rest of my life (which is something I'll have to do eventually as I'm continually anemic from my kidney disease), Anatrofin would be it.  If anybody finds out that some small country is producing it again, write in and let me know.
<p>
The only other drawback with Anatrofin is since it's a fast-acting acetate, ever-other-day injections are the only way to sustain the steroid in the bloodstream.

I've dumped so much money into my own private weight room that I don't go to any of the local gyms anymore.  Consequently, I don't have any steroid connections.  Since I'm a virgin about this stuff, do you think you could help a desperate man?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>Here's some info on a newsletter called <i>Bodywise</i> which regularly lists foreign pharmacies that will ship steroids into the country:
<P>
The URL on the Internet is: <a href="http://www.bwise.com/bodywise">http://www.bwise.com/bodywise</a>.  You'll have to subscribe to get the information. The mailing address is: Bodywise, Box 4208, Culver City, CA 90231.  Six issues (bimonthly) cost $25.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>
I see these ads for a steroid book called the <A HREF="../BOOKOFRS/special.html"> World Anabolic Review 1996</A>.  It's 40 bucks; is it worth the money?  Have you read it? Is it better than your Under ground Steroid Handbook?.</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>Here's the skinny: this is one kick-ass steroid book, and at the present time, it's the best book on the "how-to's" of steroid use.  What makes it so great?  Lots and lots of pictures (over 500) of real steroids from around the world.  The authors are European-based, and they've accumulated a staggering amount of information on various types and brands of ergogenic aids.  They list about 150 different steroids, growth hormones, thyroids, and diuretics, and very few don't have accompanying pictures.  And the writers seem to have hands-on experience with the actual effects of the various steroids on athletes..
</P>
Remember, both my Underground Steroid Handbook (USH) and the <a href="../bookofrs/special.html"> Anabolic Reference Guide</a>, 6th Issue are American-based and neither Bill Phillips nor I have great access to the range of steroids from Europe and the Far East.  Besides, the USH was written in 1988, and much has changed over the last eight years, so a lot of the information isn't entirely correct (which is why my USH is no longer in print)..
</P>
One nice thing about the WAR (World Anabolic Review) is that the authors have pointed out (sometimes painfully so) the instances where the USH was flat-out wrong.  In the past, I've raved about drugs like human growth hormone and Andriol (testosterone undecanoate), when, in reality, both aren't very cost effective and are just barely anabolic.</P>
<P>
What's wrong with the WAR?  Very little.  However, it's dry reading, and it seems to be a translated version of a foreign language, perhaps German.  Some of the advice on steroid use isn't entirely correct.  The recent AIDS studies have pointed out that pyramiding up in dosage may not be the best way to gain the most amount of muscle.  And the new information on tapering off steroids in order of estrogenic ability isn't discussed in the WAR.  In its favor, the WA-R authors do understand the relationship between estrogen and the clown-regulation of luteinizing hormone.
<P>
How could it be improved?  I'd pay $ 10 more if all the steroids were included on glossy color plates, like those in the Physicians' Desk Reference.  The gray-scale photos, since they're reproduced on non-coated paper, don't have the best detail..</P>
<P>
<A HREF="../BOOKOFRS/special.html"> The World Anabolic Review</A> costs $39.95 plus $4 shipping from MB Muscle Books in Houston, TX.  And, Bill Phillips just added it to the collection of bodybuilding books one of his companies, Mile High Publishing, distributes.  They sell it for $39.95 plus $3.00 shipping.  To order, call 1-800-615-8500 (Dept. #242).  Outside the U.S., call 303-279-3077..</P>

Okay, I'll stop calling you at work.  So here are my questions.  I'm fat, and girls won't talk to me.  I'm 18 years old and naturally large framed.  I can't take it any longer.  What steroids should I take that won't cause side effects?  Also, would I need other drugs like HCG or Nolvadex afterwards?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>Don't forget the obvious-eat right and exercise.  Realistically, the best stack to use which will cause minimal (if any) side effects would be 400 mg of Primobolan Depot a week along with about 50 mg of injectable Winstrol Depot every other day.  This isn't the most potent anabolic combination, but it won't shut down testosterone production, and you'll keep most of gains once you go off the stack.  If you're squeamish about needles, you'll need about 100 mg of the Primobolan tablets each day, along with at least 25 mg of the Winstrol tabs.  You'll probably gain some muscle, but you'll still be fat; steroids don't make fat disappear.  So you'll need some clenbuterol and thyroid (and obviously a low-calorie diet) to lose the fat.
</P>
In a practical sense, it would be cheaper for you to pay a hooker to get laid.  The only other expense would be a box of rubbers.  Besides, even if you get buff, I think you'll still have problems with the ladies.  Your heavy-handed approach when talking to people doesn't impress anyone, and you and I both know you're one pushy bastard.  Chill out!

I work out five times a , week and take the weekends off.  I don't see any major muscle growth with any of my body parts or any weight gain.  Does my age (15) have anything to do with the lack of growth, or is it my workout program?  I weigh 154 lbs, which is partially fat.  Should I take steroids?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>At your age, you shouldn't even think of taking any drugs.  Your body will soon begin its own natural anabolic hormone "cycle," and you'll grow like a weed if you're training hard and eating enough.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>
Do you know of a good way to smuggle steroids in from Mexico?  And if so, how would you recommend I do it?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>I definitely don't recommend that you smuggle in steroids from Mexico.  However, I'll pass on a technique a reader shared with me which he allegedly has used numerous times in the past.  This guy has a mini-truck, and one of the cross members in the frame is a hollow tube which is open at the ends.  I believe it's the transmission cross member.  Since the open pipe was circular, he bought all the various sizes of engine freeze plugs he could find.  These are malleable metal plugs that are hammered into the cast iron engine block so that if the engine overheats and the coolant starts boiling, one of the freeze plugs will pop off before the whole block cracks.  This guy found the right size freeze plug and hammered it in on one side and painted it with black rubberized undercoating material.  While down in Mexico, he just stuffed all his steroids into the pipe, filling the gaps with newspaper, so the boxes and bottles wouldn't rattle.  Then he hammered the other freeze plug in, sprayed it with undercoating, and drove across the border.
</P>
From even a close observation, the sealed pipe looks as if it's welded, shut, and Customs, isn't too  keen on chopping up a car frame with a cutting torch.  Once home, the guy took a tool with an abrasive cutting disk and sliced the freeze plug in half.  Then he used a small screwdriver to pry the two halves out.  Just keep in mind that the DEA and Customs also read this magazine, so although you now know this trick, so do they.

Since clenbuterol has anabolic properties, should I stock it with my Sustanon, use it by itself, or leave it alone?  Basically, I'm scrawny, and I want to gain weight.</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>Whatever anabolic effect clenbuterol has (and it's minimal), it's overwhelmed by the anabolic action of testosterone.  As, long as you're trying to gain weight, I don't think you really need clenbuterol.

Please help me.  I've almost given up!  I have a very high metabolism: at a bodyweight of 194, I'm at 5.40/o bodyfat.  Every time I try to get big (even when using steroids), my CPK [creatinine phosphokinase goes up to crazy levels!  Last time my bodyweight went from 194 down to 146 in Th short weeks.  My doctor said that the high CPK was eating up my muscles!  I don't want to look like an aerobics instructor.  What should I do?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>This whole situation looks weird.  Remember, I'm not a medical doctor, but it seems that your personal physician ,has given up in you.  So I'll  give you possible suggestions, from mild to wild.  First off, you need to eat more calories; try to get the extra calories form dietary fat.  Fat doesn't raise the metabolism as much as carbohydrates and protein do.  The best choice would be peanut butter, of all things, as it contains mostly monounsaturated fats.  Don't get hydrogenated peanut butter—make sure you get the type that has to be stirred.
<P>
Next, reduce the trauma caused by your workouts.  My Body-Contract Workout [<A HREF="../v48/v48_toc.htm"> Muscle Media 2000, February 1996</A>] is an excellent place to start, and you might start with just doing the straight 12 reps, with no forced reps.  Everything else in the program stays the same.  Three days a week of training is more than enough to cause growth.
<P>
Luckily for you, one of the chief benefits of using HMB is the reduction of muscle trauma, indicated by reduced CPK levels in the blood.  You should recheck your CPK levels after about two weeks of using HMB and following the modified Body-Contract Workout.  Also get a thyroid assay done to see if you're hyperthyroidal, and check your cortisol levels; when CPK is high, cortisol is also elevated.  The most effective cortisol blocker is Cytadren, but the dosage required is somewhat high-up to two grams a day for cortisol suppression.  If your cortisol is really screwy, you should discuss with your doctor the possibility of using Cytadren.
<P>
You and I both know that dropping all that bodyweight (48 lbs) is damn alarming.  You might have to see a more qualified medical doctor to remedy this.

I'm a woman, and since I began to use Nolvadex  after I read about it in the USH, I started to lose bodyfat at a very rapid rate, and I got stronger.  Can you explain to me, in full detail, the pros and cons of using Nolvadex and exactly how it works in women?  Would it be harmful to use Nolvadex for an indefinite period of time, and if I decide to go off it, what would be the best way?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>We don't know why women respond so well to Nolvadex in an anabolic sense.  Over the past 15 years, both men and women have commented that using Nolvadex accelerates fat loss.  Supposedly, lowering estrogen in the body will make the active T3 thyroid more available.  The T3 thyroid would otherwise be bound to carrier proteins.  However, we have no idea why Nolvadex increases size and strength in women since it doesn't affect testosterone levels.  Yet men don't seem to get as strong or large while using steroids if they're also using Nolvadex.
<P>
Explaining how Nolvadex works is easier.  Nolvadex is a very weak type of estrogen that can occupy the estrogen receptor, displacing natural estrogen.  Yet in the majority of individuals, Nolvadex will not impart an estrogen message to the cells.  There are a few people who will get classic estrogenic effects, but this is rare.
<P>
With all its nice performance benefits, should you continue this medication?  At the current time, the National Institute of Health (NIH) is conducting a long-term study on Nolvadex as a breast-cancer preventative.  However, some research suggests that long term use of Nolvadex can cause uterine cancer, but for women who have a history of breast cancer in their families, the benefits will probably outweigh the risks.
<P>
Generally, unless your natural estrogen level is unusually high, I don't think it's the best idea to use a medication that's been shown to have risks associated with it.  Besides, once bodyfat is under control, women really do look better with higher levels of estrogen since it affects the appearance of the skin and hair.  You might want to see what your natural estrogen level is with a blood test.  And remember: there are better drugs to combat bodyfat in women, specifically Yohimbe, with the use of either the prescription tablets (at about 20 mg a day) or the new TwinLab product called Male Fuel. (Yes--it is my opinion that Male Fuel is a good fat burner for women).

Is Winstrol-V considered  be one of the best anabolics  Does it help reduce bodyfat?  Does it have anti-aromatization properties?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>Many years ago, I had a conversation with one of the top five Olympia competitors about contest steroids.  Up to this point, he had been doing the traditional "dieting/cutting" steroids (things like Winstrol, Primobolan, Anavar, etc.) during the entire 12 weeks of dieting.  I pointed out that all those choices are just barely anabolic and that he shouldn't worry about estrogen and water retention until the last two weeks before the show.  Whatever water retention he did have from the heavy-duty drugs like the testosterone's, Anadrol, and Dianabol could be easily remedied by switching to the non-aromatizing steroids, particularly the high androgen ones (Masteron, Permastril, Parabolan, and Halotestin) and flushing the last bit of water out by using Lasix the day before the contest.  So, yes, Winstrol-V is a nice pre-contest drug, but its benefits are mostly from what it doesn't do, rather than what it does.  It's most beneficial in the last two weeks before the contest.  But then again, many pro bodybuilders will just throw it in along with another five or six steroids all at once.  It offers some very slight benefit over the 12 weeks, I but it's certainly not cost-effective.

My friends and I are in the Military.  We're pretty dedicated bodybuilders, and recently, a couple of us were thinking of doing a cycle of steroids, but we're not sure if the urine tests the military randomly give test for steroids.  Do you know anything about this that might help us out?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>The only time the military will do a steroid test is when actual steroids are found among your personal possessions.  My second wife was in the military, and one of her "friends" ratted her out, and the CO searched her locker and found steroids (the steroids were available over the counter in the country she was stationed in).  Despite this event, she was never urine tested for steroids, even though she was tested for the traditional recreational drugs.</P>

I have a heck of a time cracking open those little glass steroid ampoules without getting glass slivers inside the solution or shattering the whole thing.  I've tried using bare fingers (cut myself), paper towels, Kleenex, cloth, pliers, double pliers, needle-nose pliers, and still lost or contaminated a lot of spilled juice!  Please tell me how I can do this safely and easily.</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>You sure are determined.  The easiest way is to get either a metal fingernail file or a very fine flat jeweler's file and slightly score the glass around the break-off neck.  You don't have to file through the damn thing. just turn the clear shiny glass into a thin, dull, whitish score all around the neck.  You'll be astounded at how easily the top breaks off.   Actually, some of the European steroids include a tiny scoring file in the package.  If you "score" one, keep it for future use.  I've thrown all mine away.  Maybe I should manufacture an ampoule-scoring file key chain.  Whatta ya think?  Would it sell?

A few issues back, you wrote about a book called the MVDR, a Mexican version of a veterinary Physicians' Desk Reference.  Any news on how we can mail order this yet?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>Actually, I recently got a letter from someone who is selling this book mail order for a very reasonable price ($39.95 each, plus $8.50 shipping and handling).  If you're interested in obtaining this book, you can send a check or money order to James A. Ridgwell at PO. Box 215 Livermore, CA  94551.

<P>
<P>I need you to pay very close and special attention to what youve about to read.  Its quite important.  At the end of this article, I'm going to ask you to take some action and share your opinions with some very powerful people.  So please, if you carefully read only one article in this entire magazine, make it this one!

<P>In this column, I'm going to talk about some things that are very important to you, me, and the whole bodybuilding community.  Rest assured, I'm not writing this article simply to fill empty space in the magazine nor because I have some extra time to kill-I have something very important that I want to share with you.

<P>Okay .. are you paying attention?  Good!  Here we go.

<P>In the July issue of Muscle Media 2000, TC and I both introduced some ideas about how we might: do some things to improve bodybuilding for the benefit of everyone involved.  We spawned some controversy, thought, and discussion about what bodybuilding has become, what it could be, what it should be, and what direction we might take at this juncture to "rehabilitate" the physique-development culture.

<P>In this column, I want to expand on those ideas, review some of the things we discussed,, and share some new ideas, and I really want you to get involved. (I'll tell you how at the end of this article.)

<P>Let's start by discussing the topic of steroid/drug testing.  Since Munzer checked out, many writers have expressed that they feel testing bodybuilders for drugs will rid the "sport" of pharmaceutical abuse once and for all.  Sounds logical-right?  Well ... unfortunately, its not that simple.

<P>Drug testing may be part of the solution, but its a double-edged sword.  If the only thing you changed about bodybuilding to try to stop the abuse of all these drugs is started testing for steroids, clenbuterol, and diuretics (things you can test for), bodybuilders would just start loading up on the things you cant test for-things like growth hormone, IGF-1, insulin, and even straight testosterone. (You can take low doses of testosterone and still pass a steroid test.)

<P>It's even possible that steroid-testing could increase the dangers involved in bodybuilding!  You see, of all the drugs top bodybuilders pump their bodies full of, steroids may be the least dangerous.  Anabolic steroids have been around for a long time-theyve used by humans for almost 50 years.  Steroids are, for the most part, very "predictable." We know what they do and dont do , (although were not sure what exactly happens when bodybuilders take 1,000 times the recommended dosages, like some are doing today).

<P>There are a lot of drugs that bodybuilders use that are much more of a mystery.  For example, growth hormone has only been widely used for about eight yearstheres still a lot we dont know about it and, insulin has only been widely used in bodybuilding for a couple of years.  (Before bodybuilders, I dont think any healthy, non-diabetic individuals used insulin.)  IGF-1 and Cytadren are a total crapshootwho knows what these things do when theyre used in combination with other drugs or in high dosages?

<P>Basically, if you take away steroids and dont change anything else about bodybuilding, youre going to force these daredevils to dig up other mysterious drugs that might have anabolic, anti-catabolic, or thermogenic effectsdrugs that may very well be much more dangerous than roids!

<P>What I suggest is that we completely change how we promote and present bodybuilding.  Like I explained in the July issue of Muscle Media 2000, if we stop promoting these massive, super-duper muscle freaks as the end-all, be-all of physique development and start promoting symmetry, shape, a narrow waist, and realistic yet strong , muscular proportions, then I think we can treat the core of the problem instead of just a symptom.  Thats right, excessive drug abuse is a symptom and not the problem itself!

<P>The main problem is that the "bodybuilding industry" has warped the minds of the physique culture.  But, the good news is we can fix it!

<P>One thing we need to do is convince powerful and important people like Jim Manion, who runs the National Physique Committee (NPC), to redefine the standards by which amateur bodybuilders in the United States are judged, and they need to do the same for the pros.  They need to stop rewarding athletes for being so ridiculously cut up that you can see veins and striations over every square inch of their bodies.  The judges and everyone else know that the only way out can get that cut up is by using fat-burning drugs, like thyroid hormone and clenbuterol, and then by taking yourself into a near-death state with diuretics.  Its stupid!

<P>Also, judges should start taking points off when they see gyno and those huge distended bellies,  which are unquestionably caused by bodybuilding drug abuse!

<P>Hell Id be glad to meet with NPC judges, or even do a handbook or video, and teach them what the common signs of steroid and growth-hormone abuse look like.  (Like they dont already know.)   Ive seen it all.  I can tell if a guy is on roids form 50 feet away!

<P>Another thing that needs to be donesomething I also discussed in the July issue of MM2Kis that the magazines need to stop giving the drug freaks all the publicity.  Why dont the other mags use more photos of guys who arent dope heads?

<P>The real solution to this problem does exist.  All thats needed is some "compliance" to the new "rules."   IF the Weiders really want bodybuilding in the Olympics, this is the way.)  Start taking the emphasis off of "big and freaky" and focus the publicity and "glory" on guys and gals who dont look like theyre blown up on bucketfull of drugs.  When we do that, things will change, and theyll change fast!

<P>The Mags should feature guys like Danny Hester, Gary Gomez, and Dan Gwartney.  (You may not know these guys because, as non-drug-bloated bodybuilders, they dont get much press.)  For bodybuilding to move forward, we need to "go back."  Go back to the way bodybuilding was in the 70s where you had classic physiques like Frank Zanes and Arnold Schwarzeneggers.  I mean, take a look at Arnoldthis guy couldnt even win the Mr. California title today, much less the Mr. Olympia!  Arnold had perfect arms and massive pecs.  But he didnt have any striations really.  He was not "huge" by todays standards, but no one can tell me he wasnt inspiring!

<P>And Frank Zanethis cat was far from "freaky," but when he was in his prime, he was awesome!  That slender waist, chiseled abdominals and serratus, incredible lines, symmetry, and was cut!  (But, not ridiculously cut.)

<P>Those guys probably tinkered around with some steroids, and form what I hear (form reliable sources), they would stay off steroids virtually all year and only take them eight weeks before their contests.  And, by "taking steroids," I mean popping three Dianabol tablets a day and taking a shot of Primobolan each week.

<P>Did you know that most top bodybuilders in Arnolds day used to gain weight the last eight weeks before a contest?  Its true!  Arnold didnt get all blown up on steroids between contesthe would actual take extended periods of time off from training and then focus all his energy on building his body up right before a contest.

<P>Today, the pros think they cant go off steroids at allthey stay on them year-round, and when theyre not cut up for a contest, they look (at least in my opinion) awful! Their guts are huge; their faces are bloated; theyre smooth, fatthey look like shit!  (Thats not true for all top bodybuilders.  Some guys, like Shawn Ray, stay in pretty good shape all year, but a lot of guys, especially the super-mass monsters, are really a mess in the off-season.)

<P>You know what? The "Arnolds" and "Zanes"  of the 90s are out there.  The guys with great genetics, who, with proper training, nutrition, and supplementation, could become the new "heroes"the stars who draw new people into the "sport" and pull more fans into the arenas.  But, you know what?  These guys dont even get a chance these days.  They basically have two choicesdestroy their health and "look" in an effort to become the next mass monster, or give up any hope of becoming a star.  It shouldnt be that way.  (Its gotten to the point where Im almost embarrassed to call myself a "body-builder" because of the way the general public perceives this endeavor.)

<P>So what can you do about all this?  Well, you can get involved, and you can make a difference.  Heres what you should dowrite to the various magazine editors and publishers, and tell them what you think.  Theyre afraid if they stop running pictures of massive, bulked-up monster physiques that youll stop buying their magazines.  Tell them, instead, when they start giving credit to realistic physique role models (whether theyre natural of just have what I call a "low-dosage" look), then youll start buying their magazines again!

<P>And, feel free to write to Jim Manion, President of the NPC, and let him know what you think.  If you think my idea is stupid, write and tell him.  If you think this possible "solution" has merit, let him know.  (for your convenience, Ive included all the contact names, addresses and fax numbers youll need at the end of this column.)

<P>As far as Muscle Media 2000 goes, were going to continue to promote what I think is the "right look"a look thats muscular, powerful, and strong.  But Im not going to pay homage to the freak physiques.  I want MM2K readers to be able to compare their musculature with the bodybuilders who get most of the publicity in my magazine.  If we do this, I think well have a lot more satisfied bodybuilders out there who dont think they need to solve their "physique inadequacies" by bombarding their bodies year-round with high dosages of steroids and other drugs, and a lot more people will relate to what they see in the magazines.

<P> Right now, its gotten to the point where the physiques are sooo unrealistic.  Most people who read the muscle magazines dont even want to look like the guys in the pictures.  I thought the whole point of having a physique magazine with pictures inside was to inspire readers to get the gym, watch their diets, use supplements, and do everything they can (within reason) to build up their bodiesto inspire discipline, drive, and enthusiasm.  I dont understand how looking at page after page of guys who have more muscle in their entire bodies is going to inspire anyone.  Maybe Im missing somethingyou tell meis this what you really want?  I dont think it is.

<P>AnywayId like you to please make your voice heard on this matter.  Your opinion countsa lot!  Share your views with the import5ant and powerful people in this business, and lets see if we cant do something to change this industry for the better.  Remember, drug testing alone is not the answer.  We need to get to the root or the problem!!  If we change the standards by which we judge the "ideal" physique, bodybuilding drug abuse will decrease even without steroid testing!

<P>I can talk about this stuff till Im blue in the face, but if I dont get your support, and you dont make your voice heard, then reform, modification, improvement, and growth of our cool little physique world aint gonna happen!

<P>Until next timeBe well,

<P>Bill Phillips, Executive Editor


<P>P.S.   You might think all this sounds like Im Trying to run pro bodybuilders out of town, but just the opposite is true.  If the top dogs didnt have to go juice crazy to compete with the other top dogs, I dont think they would.  And, I strongly believe that guys like Shawn Ray, Flex Wheeler, or even Dorian Yates would look absolutely, positively awesome if they prepared for contests without drugsif they didnt use diuretics, huge doses of steroids, or anything else.  These guys are so big and muscular and have such great genetics, theyd look fantasticprobably even betterwithout drugs!  Theyd be healthier, and I think theyd be more marketable.  Believe methis is a win-win proposition.  Its long overdue, and it benefits virtually everyone involved.  Its time to put this silly "drug race" to an end, for the benefit of everyone involved in body building!  (Oh, by the way if I were judging bodybuilding, guys like Lee Lebrada and Shawn Ray would be the champions, and the other guys would be trying to trim down to look like them instead of the other way around!)

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> 
I think the article on Andreas Munzer's death in the last issue of your
 magazine was outstanding. It was the most straightforward, honest, and detailed report on this 
bodybuilding tragedy. I especially appreciated the fact that your reporter sought the input of 
various experts, such as Dr. DiPasquale, Mr. Duchaine, and other respected authorities. However, 
I noticed there was no comment from you on this issue. What do you think happened? What do you 
think caused Munzer's unfortunate death?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> 
Of course, as Dr. Vicki Douthitt reported in the last issue of Muscle Media 2000, we're all free to speculate, but because an autopsy was never performed, no one will know for certain what happened to Munzer. However, since you're looking for my opinion, based on the information I have access to, I'll give it to you: I would tend to believe that the guy basically destroyed his liver and gut with an ungodly barrage of anabolic steroids and other drugs. I don't think the Cytadren he was using was the "primary" cause of his death.
<P> 
Sources I consider reliable have told me that for 10 weeks before the Arnold Classic, Munzer was taking 40 tablets of Halotestin and 80 tablets of Stromba (oral Winstrol) a day! And, he was also reportedly using injectable steroids, oral Dianabol, insulin, thyroid, etc., etc. Remember, all this stuff has to pass through the liver, and that's just too much for that organ to handle. My source tells me Munzer was spending 10,000 Deutsche marks (about $6,200 U.S.) a month on bodybuilding drugs.
<P>
In all the years I've been studying bodybuilding, I've never heard of anyone taking anywhere near these kinds of dosages, but I don't really have any trouble believing it. I've heard for some time that the top dogs are pushing the dosages up, up, up. I'll bet Munzer's not the only one to use these crazy dosages. It's insane! It's stupid! And the bodybuilders who are doing this need 
to stop being rewarded for it.

Have you ever heard of a steroid called Andractim? If so, do you know what it is and how It's used?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>
Andractim is an unusual steroid from France manufactured by Laboratoires Besins-Iscodesco. It's actually a gel-kind of like a lotion that you simply rub on your skin. It contains the steroid androstanolone, which is basically the same as dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 
which is formed endogenously (naturally in the body) from the peripheral conversion of testosterone and by direct secretion of the testes.
<P>
DHT is also available under the name Stanolone, a water-based injectable steroid, and in a similar form as an oral steroid called Drolban (dromostanolone).
<P> 
These steroids are very strong androgens that exert significant anabolic effects while having the advantages of not being very toxic to the liver and not readily converting to estrogen in the system, which causes problems like gynecomastia and excessive water retention. However, these steroids may accelerate male-pattern balding and may cause hypertrophy of the prostate gland due 
to the high number of DHT receptors at those sites.
<P>
I don't know of many bodybuilders who use these steroids simply because they're not that widely available in the U.S. However, several people have asked about Andractim lately-apparently It's available over the counter in certain parts of France, and someone is smuggling cases of it into the U.S. Andractim certainly is a unique steroid.  It's virtually the only one I can think of that 
comes in a "rub-on" form. It seems like it would be a convenient and pleasant alternative to steroid injections for people who have an aversion to needles.

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>
My father suffers from mild liver disease. He used to drink quite heavily, but now he's stopped. He hasn't had a drink in five years, but his doctor says his liver is showing significant signs of damage. A "naturopath" put my father on a new product called "Liv.52." He said it helps correct liver dysfunction and damage. This got me thinking, Could Liv.52 help steroid users avoid some of the liver damage they might experience as a result of using certain anabolics?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>
I'm not fully convinced that Liv.52 really works, but I think there's a chance it may help some people. I'd be more inclined to believe it would help protect the liver against hepatotoxins, to prevent liver damage before it starts, rather than building the liver back up after it has already been damaged.
<P>
Liv.52 is manufactured by The Himalaya Drug Company in India as well as other countries. It contains various extracts from exotic plants. It's not really a new product; It's been used for over a decade by steroid-using athletes who believe it helps protect their livers from steroid toxins. And, I've talked to a number of athletes who say Liv.52 increases their appetite and promotes a feeling of "Well being."  A while back, it was extremely popular in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
<P>
The athletes I know who are using it take two to four tablets, three or four times a day with meals. I have no evidence to make me believe Liv.52 itself is not safe, but, like I said, I'm not 100% convinced It's all that effective, either. I guess It's like taking antioxidant 
supplements, it's probably not going to hurt you, but the extent to which it helps you is debatable.

In your last Q&A column, you mentioned a drug called Percutafeine. It sounded pretty interesting. I happen to have a brother who lives in Paris (he's in the military), and I asked him to go to a pharmacy and check it out. The pharmacist told him there are two 
topical fat-loss drugs people often confuse. One is Percutafeine, and the other is Percutacrine Thyroxinique. What's the difference?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>
Boy-this is a confusing one. I had to do some research to figure this out, but here's the deal: both Percutacrine Thyroxinique and Percutafeine are topical fat-loss drugs, and both are being used by a number of top bodybuilders. (Neither of these drugs is 
intended for injection!)
<P>
Percutacrine Thyroxinique is actually a T4 thyroid preparation that comes in glass ampoules which you break and then massage onto the Problem fat area. I've heard that It's remarkably effective, despite the fact that T3 thyroid (rather than T4) is thought to be a better fat burner. 
<P>
Percutafeine is a topical caffeine gel that, like Percutacrine, was designed to be used as a spot-reduction fat-loss aid. I've heard it works well, too.
<P>
You've got to hand it to those French drug companies, when it comes to fat-loss pharmaceuticals, they seem to be decades ahead of other countries.

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>
I found a doctor out here in California who will prescribe growth hormone for me. He said he can get any type of growth hormone from around the world. Do you know if there is one kind that's better than the others?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>
In the United States, there are two types of synthetic growth hormone available, Humatrope, made by a pharmaceutical company called Eli Lilly and Company, and Protropin, which is made by a company called Genentech. Of these, Humatrope seems to be better because its amino-acid structure (growth hormone is a protein hormone, and as such, it is made up of a chain 
of amino acids) is identical to the growth hormone your body naturally produces. Protropin has an extra amino acid (methionine), which may make it less effective.
<P>
There are a number of other brand names of growth hormone available around the world, including Saizen made by Serono Laboratories, Norditropin made by Novo Nordisk, Genotonorm made by Kabi Pharmacia, and Genotropin made by Sumitomo.
<P> 
I have a friend who has experimented extensively with every type of growth hormone you can think of, and he swears that something called Genotropin 16 IE is the best. (I can't imagine why it would be any better than Humatrope, but he swears it is.)
<P>
Genotropin 16 IE comes in a wild-looking redi-ject syringe preload, you don't have to take two separate bottles and mix them together. This stuff is available in Sweden, I believe.

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>
<B>The gym I work out at is selling a product called HMB/K Plus. It's distributed by Twenty First Century Nutrition or some-thing. Is that the good stuff?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>
HMB/K Plus is one of at least 15 products that have come out which are trying to feed off of the high demand for HMB in the bodybuilding and fitness markets. The unfortunate truth is, HMB/K Plus and virtually all the other HMB knock-off products that have 
come out over the past few months contain no beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB). (Independent analytical laboratory results confirm this.) These companies are trying to play a deceptive Name game. It's unethical and perhaps fraudulent.
<P> 
I've been aware of how unscrupulous some supplement companies are for a long time, and I've been warning consumers about disreputable distributors and manufacturers for many years now, but even I'm surprised at how low these companies are going in order to try to put some money in their pockets with this HMB craze.
<P>
Let's take a close look at HMB/K Plus. Obviously, since they call their product HMB/K Plus, you would think there is some beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate in it, but like I told you already, there isn't. On the label, they list the ingredients as "hydroxy methylbutyrate 250 mg." Sure sounds like this must be the HMB everyone is talking about, but once again, It's not.
When our lawyers contacted the representatives from Twenty First Century Nutrition, they explained the product actually contains "2-amino-3-hydroxybutyric acid." Wow! That sounds like some pretty impressive stuff! It sounds "kind of" like beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate. It must be the same stuff, or something similar, right? Well, the truth is, 2-amino-3-hydroxybutyric acid 
is nothing more than an amino acid that is commonly known as threonine. Threonine is an essential amino acid that's found in virtually all complete proteins. It's similar to other amino acids, like histadine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, etc. 
<P>
So What's so special about threonine? Well, from what I can tell, the only thing special about it is that if you use the chemical name, 
you might be able to fool some people into thinking It's the same as or similar to beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate. There is simply no comparison between threonine and HMB from a functional standpoint, especially in connection with HMB's unique ability to perform a nitrogen-sparing function in weight-training athletes.
<P> 
Basically, what you have is a deceptively labeled product; the companies distributing this stuff are either unknowingly or intentionally deceiving consumers. It's companies like these that damage the reputation of the entire supplement industry.
<P>
Here's another example, there's a company called Dexter Sports Supplements that sells a product under the brand name Power Star. They call this product "HMM!" (I don't know what the exclamation point is for, they put it in there, not me). Anyway, they used to call this stuff HMB, but then they changed the name to HMM!. On the label, it says the product contains"D-Gluconic acid calcium 
hydroxy beta-methylbutyric monohydrate." We tested this product, too, and it does not contain any HMB, HMB salts, or HMB derivatives. As a matter of fact, the name "D-Gluconic acid calcium hydroxy beta-methylbutyric monohydrate" is complete nonsense and is a mixed-up combination of multiple, unrelated chemical terms designed to fool the average consumer into believing the foregoing material is some type of HMB analog.
<P>
Two other companies that are selling a product which lists "calcium gluconate b methylbutyrate monohydrate" as an ingredient are Castlewood Nutritional Systems and the Conan Corporation. Once again, there is no such chemical composition as "calcium gluconate b methylbutyrate monohydrate." Again,  this chemical "name" is nonsense. It is a mixed-up combination of multiple, unrelated chemical terms.
<P>
The people running these companies need to wise up. I don't think they have any idea what type of legal mess they're getting themselves into. Their actions violate so many legal and ethical guidelines and statutes that I don't even have room to list them individually in this column.
<P>
I could go on and on about the other bogus HMB products that are popping up on the market every week, but the bottom line is this, if you want the "real thing," You've got to be very careful about what brands you buy.
<P> 
The two brands of HMB that my company distributes, the Metabolic Technologies, Inc. (MTI) brand and the EAS brand, contain the exact HMB compound used in all the clinical trials performed on this amino-acid metabolite. Each and every batch undergoes extensive testing to ensure purity and potency, and that's 100% guaranteed!
<P>
In the future, other reputable supplement companies will also probably work out a deal with the HMB patent holders, Metabolic Technologies, Inc., and the Iowa State University Research Foundation to distribute real HMB. For now, I'd definitely advise caution, some companies promise greater value and savings, but you may not get what you're looking for! Don't say I didn't warn you!
<P>
Now-looking into my crystal ball, I see TwinLab and Weider (two very big and powerful supplement companies) coming out with quality forms of HMB in the not-too-distant future. This just makes sense, HMB is a good product. Its positive effects on muscle metabolism and strength are documented by some pretty compelling scientific evidence. And, there are a lot of bodybuilders using HMB who are getting nice results.
<P>
My companies were the first to bring HMB to the market, but I don't mind the "big leaguers" coming in that's what they have to do. It's just good business for them. But look at What's happening, You've got these huge, multi-million-dollar powerhouse companies that are following our lead.
<P>
Although Weider Nutrition "goes with the flow," Twin seems to fight it. Their "scientific" writers have already come out and tried to "slam" HMB in several articles in Twin's magazine, <I>Muscular Development</I>. But they've been completely unsuccessful in their efforts to knock the competition (me). They've also slammed CLA, which is likewise becoming very popular with bodybuilders and other supplement users.
<P>
But now, TwinLab has apparently "seen the light" because they're planning to come out with versions of both HMB and CLA. They did the same thing with vanadyl sulfate. Their writers slammed the product time and time again, but eventually, when vanadyl sulfate became extremely popular with bodybuilders, they apparently figured if they couldn't "beat-em," they'd be financially better off "joining-em," so they introduced their own vanadyl-sulfate product.
<P>
I respect some of the people who work for Twin they've got a great company and a very nice magazine, but am I the only one who thinks this seems a little bit schizophrenic? I just don't understand why their knee-jerk reaction is to condemn anything they don't think of themselves, only to later "flip-flop." It seems to me that it hurts the credibility of Twin and their writers. If I could suggest anything to these folks (not like they're taking suggestions from me!), It's that they should keep an open mind and investigate things a little further before they condemn them. Then they wouldn't look so silly when they introduced products like HMB, CLA, and vanadyl sulfate after they've very clearly stated in writing that they don't think these supplements work. (Oh well-I'm sure there are things I do that they don't think make any sense, whatever!)

When I saw you at your "No Holds Barred" seminar in Las Vegas, you and your staff were wearing some really cool Muscle Media 2000 jackets. They were the ones that looked blue and purple, almost metallic. How can I get one of these?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>
The jackets you're talking about are the ones we call "MM2K pullover tops.' They're made out of a light nylon material that has a really unique color, it changes from blue to purple and light to dark, all depending on what light the material is in and how that 
light's being reflected.
<P>
We've never sold these jackets, we just make up a few dozen every now and then and give them away as gifts to writers, photographers, editors, and other people who work for the magazine, and whenever we go to a trade show or event, we usually hand them out to the staff that works with us.
<P>
However, we have received so many requests from people about how to get one of these jackets that I decided to have a couple hundred made up. I buy each top for $16; then it costs another $18 to have the nice, very detailed embroidery work done on the front and back. So, my cost on the jackets is $34, and that's the price I'd charge you if you wanted to get one. (I have no delusions about trying to make profits in the sports apparel business. I'm simply providing these jackets as a favor to my subscribers and readers.)
<P>
If you're interested, <B>just call 1-800-297-9776 (ask for Dept. #2620). The jacket is $34</B>, and we'll charge our standard rate of only $6.50 to ship it Federal Express, 2-day delivery. Fair enough?

A friend of mine recently came across some European nandrolone decanoate in a yellow box with black writing on it. Inside the box were ten 2-ml ampoules of oil which supposedly contained nandrolone decanoate. I'm sending a photo for your review. Does this 
look like It's real?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>
It looks real, but It's very difficult to tell these days. Steroid counterfeiters are getting awfully good at making their boxes and labels look legit. But, I know for a fact that a sample of this type of Deca was recently tested at a medical lab and confirmed to contain pure nandrolone decanoate. So, in this case, I can say with great confidence that this stuff is legitimate. Unfortunately, I don't have lab reports on the hundreds of other steroids floating around on the black market. It's a safe bet that most of them aren't real.

Have you heard anything about when that new fat-burning supplement called pyruvate might be available? I'm looking forward to giving it a try.</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>
I expected pyruvate to be available by now, but apparently, the people who have licensed the rights to distribute the product as a fat-loss supplement are anything but organized. To be honest, they don't know what in the hell they're doing. Hopefully, someone will 
introduce a quality pyruvate supplement within the next six to eight months. I'd like to try it myself to see if it really works.

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>
I saw an ad for a meal-replacement product that contains HMB. The ad claims it works better than HMB capsules. It also claims one top pro bodybuilder put on 20 lbs of muscle using this formula. Have you tried this new meal-replacement product with HMB and compared it to the capsules?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>
Keep this in mind: in advertisements, companies usually give their opinions of things and try to present compelling information to potential consumers, information they hope will convince prospects to buy.
<P>
Sometimes, advertisers "bend" the truth or exaggerate a bit. Consumers are well aware of this. It happens in all types of marketing-not just in ads for bodybuilding supplements. So It's probably a moot point to warn consumers that ads aren't always 100% factual.
<P>
Now, what are the facts regarding HMB? Well, It's certainly true that scientific studies have shown that HMB can produce positive effects on muscle metabolism that lead to increases in muscle size and strength. But, I can absolutely, positively guarantee that there's no proof I'm aware of that HMB works better if It's mixed with a meal-replacement powder.
<P>
As far as top bodybuilders putting on 20 lbs of muscle with this new HMB-fortified meal-replacement product or with HMB in any other form, I would have a really hard time believing that. I would call those results anything but "typical."
<P>
As I explained in a recent issue of Muscle Media 2000, the gains bodybuilders are getting from HMB aren't "steroid-like." (I've received extensive feedback and have documented the "real-world" results, results from guys and gals who aren't using any anabolic drugs. Unfortunately, none of them have put on 20 lbs of muscle mass using HMB.)
<P>
As I've said before, the gains I've made using HMB and the results many others have experienced are rewarding but not as dramatic as the quick gains some people have made using creatine, and they certainly aren't the type of results the top dogs get when they load up on high dosages of multiple steroids and other drugs.
<P>
If you or anyone else out there is thinking about buying HMB with the expectation of putting on 20 lbs of muscle mass, I feel I should warn you that based on the information I have access to (scientific studies and extensive feedback from HMB users), this is not going to happen. I know saying this might take some money out of my pocket because we are the main distributor of HMB at this time, but I hate to see people buy a product with unrealistic expectations only to end up disappointed.
<P>
Here's something you might find interesting, according to my numbers, HMB capsules outsell this meal-replacement powder with HMB at least ten to one! This leads me to believe consumers find a distinct advantage by using HMB in capsule form. Perhaps It's working as I suggested in the past, I believe that because HMB has such a short half-life in the body (It's only active for a 
few hours), multiple doses are needed throughout the day to maintain high blood levels. The capsules are much more versatile and can be taken often throughout the day: many people are using two capsules, six times a day, to try to keep a constant blood level of HMB. The meal-replacement powder with HMB that you asked about is apparently supposed to be used only twice a day, I don't 
see how that could allow for consistent blood levels of HMB.
<P>
The amazing results of the most recent HMB clinical study, which were presented in Washington, DC, a few weeks ago and reported in over 300 newspapers and on over 75 TV news stations, involved the use of HMB CAPSULES, not a multi-nutrient powder with HMB in it! Interesting...
<P>
And, finally, with no disrespect intended to a former colleague (I can't mention his name or the name of his product because of some trivial legal matters as I've explained in the past), I think his advertising would have more impact and credibility if he took the emphasis off top bodybuilders who are "using" and presented a more credible, believable message. Let the science sell the product, and don't exaggerate the results. (By the way, I have to run their ads in MM2K because of a contract issue.)

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>
I'm trying to get really cut up. I planned a photo shoot six weeks from now. I've been following a strict diet, and I've been working my ass off in the gym. When I started my "cutting program," I weighed 210 lbs, and I was at 11% bodyfat. My goal is to get down to 5.5% bodyfat, and I figure I will have to drop down to about 194 lbs.
<P>
For the first six weeks of my diet, I was making really good progress. I got all the way down to 7.5% bodyfat, but I've been stuck there for 3 weeks now. And I haven't lost an ounce of fat in 21 days in spite of the fact that I've cut my calories even lower and completely eliminated all fat from my diet. I was thinking about adding a thermogenic fat burner like clenbuterol. A friend told me I should probably start taking Synthroid (a thyroid hormone). What do you think?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>
The problem you're experiencing is very common. Usually, the first four to six weeks of a reduced-calorie diet combined with strength training produce dramatic fat loss. But, sometimes you "hit the wall." The "logical" solution that you have taken, lowering your calorie intake even further and eliminating fat from your diet, is actually not the right thing to do.
<P>
Studies have shown that if you consume less than ten percent of your calories from dietary fat, your ability to lose fat will actually be minimized! You see, when you consume very little dietary fat, your body will stop burning fat and may actually start converting carbohydrate calories to bodyfat. (It would be a long, complicated story to explain how and why this happens, but trust me, it does!)
<P>
Lee Labrada, one of my good friends and an extremely successful bodybuilder, discovered this years ago. He found that in the last few weeks before a contest, when he would virtually eliminate dietary fat altogether, no matter how low he took his calories nor how much aerobic work he did, he couldn't get rid of that last little bit of bodyfat around the belly and lower back. But, when he added fat back into his diet, his skin thinned out rapidly! (There is an extremely important lesson to learn here.)
<P>
You don't have to use any special supplements like MCT oils or anything like that, simply slicing up half an avocado and putting it on your salad can help. And, eating a four- to six-ounce portion of grilled salmon (a fish that contains a fair amount of "healthy fats") instead of just straight protein powder can help. Adding a tablespoon of flaxseed oil to your protein drink once or twice a day could also do the trick.
<P>
As far as clenbuterol goes, there's no doubt this stuff works. But if you take it for too long, the fat-burning and muscle-hardening effects seem to dissipate. You should only take clenbuterol for four to six weeks at a time, and you shouldn't take more than four to six tablets a day. This would speed up the rate at which your body is burning calories and would therefore allow you to lose fat faster. <P>
As far as thyroid drugs go, I've never been very crazy about them, but if I were to personally use a thyroid "supplement" as a part of a cutting cycle, it certainly wouldn't be Synthroid, that's a T4 thyroid medication, and it won't maximize thermogenesis.
<P>
The type of thyroid that stimulates fat burning is called T3 thyroid hormone. An example is Cytomel, which is very popular in bodybuilding circles. Unfortunately, most bodybuilders use way too damn much of this stuff and usually end up hypothyroidal (a condition where their bodies no longer produce an adequate amount of this hormone naturally), and then they have to take thyroid 
medication for the rest of their lives, or they experience dramatic weight fluctuations, typically gaining a lot of fat when they come off the stuff.
<P>
The trick to using thyroid hormones without screwing yourself up is to not overdo it. Cytomel is quite powerful, and a dose of 25 to 50 mcg (that's micrograms) per day is plenty!
<P> 
At that dosage, you'll likely experience a slight increase in body temperature, which means more bodyfat and dietary calories are being used to generate heat instead of being stored in the body. The right amount of T3 can stimulate oxygen consumption, as well as protein and carbohydrate metabolism. But, too much thyroid can cause a breakdown in muscle tissue, It's very tricky stuff.
<P>
Triacana, a thyroid hormone preparation which contains a precursor to T3 thyroid, is widely used as a treatment for obesity in France. It's quite effective and yet much more "forgiving" than Cytomel.
<P>
A lot of athletes have been combining Triacana with clenbuterol and reporting excellent results. You'd be surprised at the number of women's fitness competitors who are stacking "clen" with Triacana to get rid of problem bodyfat in the hips and triceps areas.
<P>
If you do end up using clenbuterol or Triacana, make sure you don't go overboard on the dosages, and be sure not to use them for extended periods of time, I think six weeks is long enough with either of those drugs.
<P>
So, to summarize, the first thing I would do is increase your fat intake to at least ten percent of your overall calories. I'd keep your protein levels high and try to keep carbohydrate levels relatively low on most days. Another thing you might try is purposely overeating once a week, taking in 4,000 calories and eating anything you want, such as a hamburger, pizza, tacos, apple pie, etc. By purposely overfeeding your body once a week, there's a chance you may be able to boost your metabolic rate or at least prevent it from going lower and lower each week so that you have to eat less and less to continue to lose fat.
<P>
I think with or without the use of clenbuterol or Triacana, you'll be able to reach your goal of taking your bodyfat down to 5.5%, keep me posted!

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>
I read in another magazine that leucine, KIC, and HMB are all pretty much the same thing. The author said to just take two or three grams of each, and You'd get good results. What if I took three grams of each? Three grams of leucine, KIC, and HMB? Would that 
produce even better results?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>
Boy, there is a lot of confusion out there about HMB! I get more questions on HMB than on any other topic. In this column, I've already talked about the problems going on with the "fake" versions of this product. I told you how this represents one ugly aspect 
of the bodybuilding industry. Now, you bring up another aspect of this business that has pissed me off for a long time, misinformation! I'm aware of the article you're talking about, and it was written by a guy who runs another supplement company, a supplement company that does not have access to real HMB but that does sell leucine and KIC.
<P>
Let's do a quick review, starting with leucine. Leucine is one of the branched-chain amino acids (BCAA's). It's an essential amino acid; that means the body can't make it on its own, it has to be provided by the food you eat or the supplements you take.
<P>	
Now, leucine has been known to be somewhat of a "special" amino acid for quite some time. Scientists have observed that it plays an important role in muscle metabolism. Leucine is oxidized mainly in muscle tissue, and in some cases, it stimulates the synthesis and inhibits the degradation of muscle protein. In conditions of severe catabolism, like following injury, trauma, surgery, sepsis, etc., leucine solutions or supplements have been shown to slow the loss of muscle tissue and perhaps stimulate the synthesis of new protein tissue under extremely stressful conditions.
<P>
Unfortunately, the results scientists have seen with leucine are not consistent at all. The results of many studies in which leucine-enriched solutions have been given to patients who are suffering catabolism have been largely negative. Some investigators have found a small improvement in nitrogen balance with leucine supplementation, which is one indicator of muscle growth, but the results have basically been hit-and-miss. And, I know of NO studies that show that leucine supplementation helps weight trainers gain muscle faster.
<P>
Still, there is something about leucine that scientists just haven't quite been able to "let go of." A lot of scientists and doctors continue to study leucine in hopes of unraveling What's behind this amino acid's hit-and-miss effects on protein metabolism.
<P>
While researching leucine, some scientists identified what they thought might be the "active component" of leucine a metabolite called KIC (ketoisocaproate). This compound seems to have an effect on preventing protein breakdown, and clinical trials with KIC seemed to produce better results than those done with leucine. But, the results with KIC were still somewhat "hit-and-miss."  Once again, NO studies involving KIC show it helps weight-training humans gain muscle faster.
<P>
But, some scientists have continued to study KIC and leucine in hopes of solving this riddle. One of these scientists is Dr. Steve Nissen, a professor at Iowa State University, and CEO of a company called Metabolic Technologies, Inc. He has been studying leucine and KIC for over 15 years, and about 8 years ago, he discovered a metabolite of KIC (which is a metabolite of a metabolite, you might say) that may very well be the "missing link" to leucine's mystic effects.
<P>
Nissen, in conjunction with other doctors and scientists (including Naji Abumrad, M.D.), has extensively evaluated HMB and its effects in vitro and in vivo over the past eight years. He and his colleagues have gathered enough evidence to convince them that HMB is the downstream metabolite of leucine that's responsible for leucine's, and maybe even all of the other BCCAs, effects on protein metabolism.
<P>
The data suggest it takes a 60-gram dose of leucine or a 20-gram dose of KIC to produce the positive effects on muscle metabolism that are seen with a 3-gram dose of HMB. Unfortunately, consuming 60 grams of leucine or 20 grams of KIC is not only impractical and very expensive but it also can cause very nasty stomach problems. Basically, It's impractical to get the positive muscle-building effects of HMB by consuming leucine and/or KIC.
<P>
In the coming months, Dr. Nissen and his colleagues plan to evaluate the effects of leucine, KIC, and HMB head to head, so they can see what effects each of these compounds has on anabolism, catabolism, etc. That should be a very interesting study, but for now, I feel confident that Dr. Nissen is probably one of the most qualified people in the world to evaluate the effects of these various compounds. I trust what he says and consider his credibility as unimpeachable.
<P>
Finally, to answer your questions, I don't think consuming three grams of leucine and KIC along with HMB is going to produce much, if any, greater effects, I would recommend that you just go with the HMB and save your money.
<P>
Of course, as research unfolds and gives us more specific answers to questions like this, we'll be sure to update you in future issues of Muscle Media 2000.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>
I was reading an article in another muscle magazine where a writer was explaining that to get really, really big, You've got to eat at least 10,000 calories a day, and you should work out for an hour in the morning and 2 hours at night, 6 days a week. He said this 
is how all the top bodybuilders built their muscle mass. He said It's B.S. that the reason the pros look like they do is because of steroid use. He explained there are tens of thousands of guys out there using steroids, and only a very, very small number have the physiques of the top bodybuilders. He said the mega-calories and long workouts are what really make the difference. What do you think?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>
Oh, Christ! I know the article you're talking about, and I know who wrote it. The guy's a moron, an out-of-shape, pathetic slob! In the last issue of my magazine, I promised I was going to try to keep a "positive attitude" and offer constructive criticism whenever possible.
<P>
Well, here's some constructive criticism for this guy, get a clue! Seriously, go take a vocational course somewhere and learn how to do something productive. I know somewhere there has got to be a Burger King looking for a night manager!
<P>
If there are top bodybuilders out there who train for 3 hours a day, 6 days a week, and consume over 10,000 calories every 24 hours, then they are obviously so loaded up on steroids, growth hormone, IGF-1, insulin, mega-dosages of thyroid, etc., etc. that they can get away with it.
<P>
If average physique enthusiasts ate like that and worked out that much, they would be so overtrained and overfed that they would look awful and feel even worse! You cannot make the mistake of assuming that what works for someone who has a completely different and artificial "metabolic environment" is going to work for the average guy.
<P>
As far as the role steroids play in the way the top dogs look, the thing you need to realize is that taking steroids is not just "taking steroids." There are many levels. Some guys just pop a few Winstrol tablets a day, take an occasional shot of Deca, and call it a cycle. Other guys throw down dosages that are 50 to 100 times greater!  It's also true that the top physiques in today's bodybuilding world have awesome genetics, not only do they have great muscle structure, their bodies also have an extraordinary ability to respond to steroids. It's possible that they have greater receptor affinity for androgens and other anabolics.
<P>
Some of the guys (and gals) who write for the various muscle magazines have virtually no place being "information providers."  Many of them don't even work out, and some of them are just bodybuilding groupies. They love hanging around physique stars, and they're so delusional they believe every word that comes out of these guys mouths. You can't do that if you want to know the real truth.
<P>
My final comment, don't believe everything you read.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> 
 <B>I'm a little confused as to where you stand on weight-gain diets. First you say your Isometric Diet is ideal for gaining weight, but in your critique of Dr. Sears' Zone Diet, you said dietary fat has a 97% conversion rate into bodyfat. So wouldn t a higher protein/higher carb, lower fat (10%) diet cause you to gain less fat and more muscle?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> 
Dietary fat promotes muscle growth. This holds true whether we're talking about laboratory rat
studies, growing babies, or bodybuilders. Most of the top strength athletes have built their muscle
mass with whole eggs, fatty red meat, and whole-fat dairy products. Years ago, Bulgarian
Olympic lifters tried a higher carb, lower fat diet, and they all lost strength. The research shows
that low-fat diets cause more oxidation of amino acids, while nitrogen retention is better on a
higher fat diet. We can quibble over the ideal fat ratio and what the qualitative breakdown may
be, but low-fat diets simply won't generate as much muscle growth as higher fat diets.
<P>
You're assuming that if you eat more protein and carbohydrate calories, you'll get a better
growth response than you would on a lower calorie diet that includes more fat calories. Many
still believe the best way to gain muscle weight is to eat the highest amount of calories possible
without gaining fat. Let's make believe you're eating 3,500 calories a day with slightly less than
350 calories (about 10%) from dietary fat. This would be about 500 calories over your
maintenance level. Would a higher fat diet (perhaps with 1,000 calories from fat), at the same
elevated calorie level, cause more fat accumulation? Yes, slightly. However, the reason the extra
protein and carbohydrate calories (consumed on the lower fat diet) didn't get converted into fat
was because the body adjusted its metabolic rate and oxidized the extra nutrients. And oxidizing
protein on a weight-gain diet is something you really don't want to do. 
<P>
It might be nice to eat more food and not worry as much about getting fat, but this increased
oxidation inhibits muscle building. Instead of increasing your daily calorie intake by 500 on a
high-carb weight-gain diet, simply increase your daily calorie intake by only 300 calories. This is
what I recommend with the Isometric Diet. Even though the overall daily calorie increase is
slightly less than the conventional higher protein, higher carb diet, you'll have higher nitrogen
retention on the higher fat diet. The immediate goal on a weight-gain diet is to improve nitrogen
retention, not simply to eat more without getting fat.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> 
<B>How long after people apply your topical Finaplix solution can they be tested and still show positive for steroids?</B><P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> 
The problem with any topically applied steroid dissolved in DMSO is that before the steroid is
pulled into general circulation, there's a possibility that some of the compound can be trapped in
the fat layer. And, fat layers have poor blood flow. 
<P>
Most users of these topical solutions tend to rub the mixture onto the thighs, as that's the most
convenient place. When using skin-fold calipers, one should remember that any additional
thickness over three millimeters is fat and water, so I have no idea how long the steroid will stay
around in these fat areas. And, if you're dieting, this fat layer will slowly  dissolve  and release
some of the Finaplix into your system, possibly months after you applied it! This is one instance
when making an injectable version would be better. Clearance times for intramuscular injections
are faster because there's more blood flow in muscle than there is in fat.
<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> 
<B>I'm having a bitch of a time finding Finaplix pellets, but my local veterinary supply
company has Synovex-H up the ying-yang. Each pellet has 100 mg of testosterone and 10 mg of
estrogen. Should I try this? Is there any way to extract the estrogen out of it?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> 
Before I answer your question, let's first discuss the positive benefits of estrogen in the male
metabolism. Bodybuilders, since the early  80's, have been aware that the extra estrogen, which
develops as a result of taking certain steroids, can cause water retention and swelling of the male
breast (gynecomastia). I recognized the problem back in 1981 when I started recommending
Nolvadex (tamoxifen citrate) to female bodybuilders who couldn't lose stubborn lower-body fat.
I assumed estrogen was the reason for the extra fat. It turned out I was wrong. However, many
steroid-using male bodybuilders began using Nolvadex to prevent  bitch tits  (gynecomastia).
<P>
The trouble is, over the years, anecdotal evidence accrued which indicated that bodybuilders
using Nolvadex weren't making the same gains as they were when they weren't taking the
anti-estrogen. Over the last year or so, we've seen research which shows that the higher
aromatizing steroids (ones that more easily convert into estrogen) cause more IGF-1 production
in the body. We also know that as men get older, there's more aromatase in the body, and
testosterone will more readily convert to estrogen. More estrogen will lead to an increase  of over
50% in the number of androgen receptors (where the testosterone attaches to the cell). Higher
estrogen levels might also increase skeletal muscle androgen receptors. It seems to be true that
female steroid users show greater comparative effects (both androgenic and anabolic) than male
bodybuilders, possibly because the increased estrogen in their bodies increases the amount of
androgen receptors throughout the body.
<P>
So there's a very good reason why Synovex-H contains testosterone and estrogen. Cattle will
grow bigger with the added estrogen. As a matter of fact, the correct ratio for maximal growth is
10:1:1. This means that for every ten parts testosterone, there should also be one part estrogen
and one part progesterone. So what does this mean for humans?
<P>
Most steroid users who get gyno probably say their gyno development was accompanied by a
period of great growth. Most of the great bodybuilders simply have surgery to remove the breast
tissue and the accompanying benign tumor. So, if you prepare a topical solution of Synovex-H
with DMSO, you'll grow better than if you used testosterone alone. However, with that much
estrogen (and in a male, ten milligrams is a lot), two things will happen: one, you'll get some
breast-tissue swelling. If you lived in France, you could get a rub-on liquid called Percutacrine
Androgenique, which is a topical DHT (dihydrotestosterone). DHT is a potent anti-estrogen, so
rubbing this onto the breast area might attenuate the swelling, but I doubt it would prevent it.
Two, all this estrogen will cause the brain to shut down the stimulating hormones that cause
testosterone secretion. In other words, your testicles will rapidly shrink. 
<P>
Back to your question: you can easily extract estrogen from the Synovex-H, as long as you know
how to read that trusty Merck Index I've told you to buy. My assistant has done a whole
step-by-step process on how to do this which will be described in his upcoming book. Although
I've promised not to spill the beans about the process, I will give you one big hint: the best
solvent for testosterone is not the best solvent for estrogen. I'll leave it at that.
<P>
Although this 10:1:1 ratio seems tempting, estrogen can do a lot of bad things to the body (in
both men and women), especially to the immune system. I'd be interested to know how the ratio
was fixed at these amounts. Perhaps significantly less estrogen could impart almost all the extra
growth benefits. And I have wondered what would happen if male bodybuilders tried using the
various OTC [over-the-counter] progesterone creams that women use. This is yet another area for
investigation...

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>
<B> I'm the guy with the  terribly arthritic spine  who wrote you before. Nothing is helping the
wasting and muscular failure in my glutes, calves, and feet. The Mayo Clinic is still screwing
around with my MRI. What can I do while I'm waiting?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> 
Since I'm not a doctor and I'm not qualified in this area, I'm at a loss. All I can tell you is that
the East German doping researchers discovered that the very androgenic steroids, with virtually
no anabolic effect, cause a significant boost in central nervous system (CNS) neuron firing and
neural recuperation in their athletes. In this country, the oral steroid fluoxymesterone (Halotestin)
is the most androgenic human-use steroid. In the veterinary market, the liquid Cheque Drops
(mibolerone) is probably the most androgenic steroid commercially available. Years ago, we had
Lilly's Drolban, a synthetic dihydrotestosterone injectable, but now it's only available as the
Belgian Masteron.
<P>
The best you can do is a Medline search on androgens and the CNS to see if you can find positive
research to show to your doctors. They might--cautiously--try writing a script for Halotestin.
Alternatively, if you went to Mexico, any doctor there would write a script for Stenox (the trade
name for fluoxymesterone), and you could bring it back legally. I should tell you that there aren't
too many steroid users who have good things to say about fluoxymesterone. Headaches are a
common complaint. Andreas Munzer supposedly used 40 five-mg tablets a day!

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>
<B>I smoked some marijuana at a party. I didn't think much of it at the time, but then I
remembered something my father told me. He told me that marijuana use increases the amount of
estrogen in your body. Is this true? Should I worry? How much will cause this effect?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> 
Many plant substances have estrogenic compounds. Scientists have documented over 300
different plants that contain estrogen-like compounds. You eat many of these plants every day.
The estrogen-like effects are self-defense mechanisms for the plant. For example, marijuana has
both a mock estrogen, which binds at the estrogen receptor and down-regulates luteinizing
hormone. It also has a prolactin blocker that prevents mothers from producing breast milk. This
results in less animals surviving to eat the plants. These estrogenic compounds are not true
estrogens, as none of them have the four-ring structure common to all steroids: they have simpler
structures consisting of only two rings. And not every estrogenic compound necessarily binds to
a recognized estrogen receptor; it may bind to one of the  orphan  receptors%the ones that seem
to have no specific hormone matched to them. 
<P>
The only way you can tell if the amount of marijuana you're using is adversely affecting you is to
perform two blood tests--one while you're using the usual amount and then a second one about
four weeks after you've stopped using marijuana. If your luteinizing hormone and testosterone
levels are elevated from the previous test, you'll have your answer. The truth is that many top
bodybuilders occasionally use marijuana. And I've seen a number of them light up right before a
workout and still train hard.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> 
<B>I've used V2G for a while now. I understand it may promote the uptake of glucose and
amino acids by muscle cells. I want to try your Isometric Diet, but should I give up the V2G? I'm
afraid that the V2G might help the fat cells absorb the fat. Is vanadyl sulfate a  double-edged 
sword like insulin?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> 
First off, we don't know if vanadyl assists in transporting amino acids across the cell
membrane. My guess is no. Vanadyl's actions take place after the glucose enters the cell, unlike
chromium, which works on the outside of the receptor. And, since vanadyl sulfate may reduce
the amount of insulin secreted, less glucose would be transported into the fat cells. So even
though I recommend eating more fat and less carbs with the Isometric Diet, the use of vanadyl
sulfate should prevent the glucose from going into the fat cells. Incidentally, the research shows
that high-carb diets elevate blood triglycerides, but I have no idea if vanadyl sulfate can reduce
those levels.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> 
<B>I'm a 60-year-old man, and my doctor put me on a light dose of testosterone. My question is
this: now that DHEA is available, would this be a good thing for me to take, considering I'm
already using testosterone?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> 
I don't know. It wouldn't hurt, but I don't think it will help that much either. DHEA is a weak
androgen, and it has a slight affinity to the androgen receptor. Like most older men, you probably
have elevated luteinizing hormone levels and low natural testosterone levels. This is called
secondary hypogonadism: you have the stimulating hormones and the raw ingredients to make
the testosterone, but the testicles still aren't secreting ideal amounts. 
<P>
So I doubt DHEA will increase your natural testosterone levels. However, there might be some unknown mechanisms in
the body that need DHEA. And not just those mechanisms related to testosterone. You could try
it along with your testosterone, but don't be surprised if nothing really happens. DHEA levels
diminish with age, and replacement testosterone therapy doesn't appear to do anything to raise it
back up. Many DHEA users report a sense of well-being at 50 mg a day, but we also get reports
of increased well-being with testosterone therapy. Since DHEA is available over the counter and
is not terribly expensive, you might want to give it a try, for a month anyway. Then if something
good happens, let me know. Of course, you'll never really know which hormone is producing
what effects.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> 
<B>I've enclosed a pamphlet on Anabolic Chem Labs' Boron Stero-Complex.  Does this stuff work?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> 
<B>No</B>. Even worse, the company is violating Federal regulations. In stating that  boron gluconate
increases testosterone levels...,  the company is making a drug-like claim. Under FDA regs, if a
product represents itself as a drug, then it is a drug and, ipso-facto, a new, unapproved one at
that. It doesn't matter that the compound is worthless--as it is. The makers of Boron
Stero-Complex can be penalized for conspiracy to defraud the public and for interstate
mislabeling. Remember, I served 30 months in Federal prison for the same violations. Even
though this particular compound is ineffective and not dangerous, the laws and sentencing are
still the same.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> 
<B>Who's going to make Flavone X?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> 
The Flavone X project is in limbo. The chemist in charge of the project has approached at least
four companies, and all of them have said nay. One chemical company in England agreed to
make it, but they would charge $400 a kilogram. Considering the daily dosage is 1.5 grams, this
price is way too high. Aldrich Chemical does list the closely related 5,7-dihydroxy-flavone (also
known as chrysin) in its catalog, but the real Flavone X is somewhat more potent than chrysin.
Still, the one by Aldrich would work, but it costs $30 a gram, so your daily cost would be $45.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> 
<B>I work in a corn factory where we produce food for pigs and chickens. I was wondering if
the amino acids we use are the same ones bodybuilders use. For example, we have methionine
and lysine. Can I use these for myself?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> 
If you check the labels on the amino-acid additive packaging, you'll probably find that the
aminos are a combination of both L (levo or left) and D (dextro or right) versions of the amino
acids. In humans (and probably also in animals), only the L type can be used by the body. All the
D aminos are excreted as urea. If you have some kind of kidney problem (as I do), you wouldn't
want to take on the extra work of metabolizing and eliminating all that urea. Besides, most
Americans use fairly good protein sources, so amino fortification really isn't necessary. 
<P>
I've always wondered why some amino-acid company hasn't produced an amino product that could
be consumed with common supermarket protein sources, such as beef, chicken, and milk. A few
capsules with a meat meal, for example, would boost the PER (protein efficiency ratio) into the
same range as egg or whey.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> 
<B>My question concerns growth hormone. The type I use is in two bottles. One is the powder,
and the other is the diluent. The instructions tell me to withdraw the same amount of diluent that
my doctor prescribed. The Humatrope says use 5 mg. How much diluent should I use?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> 
Lilly recommends between 1.5 cc's and 5 cc's of diluent for the 5 mg. You have approximately
13.3 IU's of growth hormone in the bottle (the conversion is: .375 mg = 1 IU). You haven't
specified how many milligrams/IU's per shot your doctor is recommending. If you're using the
usual four IU's each time, then you could put three cc's of diluent into the powder and inject one
cc each time, so the bottle will last one week (four IU's three times a week). The recommended
dosage (for children) is .06 mg/kg 3 times a week. So for example, the typical 200-lb (91-kg)
bodybuilder should be using about 5.5 mg each time, which is slightly more than the 5-mg
amount in the bottle. That seems damn expensive to me.

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> 
<B>What do you think of the products made by Atletika? They're marketed with a sort of
Eastern-Bloc Soviet mystique, like they're a secret Bulgarian Olympic steroid or something. I
know these are plant sterols of some kind. Do plant sterols work? The two popular ones are
Retibol and Mumie.</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> 
In years past, most scientists dismissed sterols by saying that androgen receptors won't accept
sterol structures because all sterols have additions to the basic four-ring structure. But, like I
pointed out in a previous answer, many substances in the environment (some natural, others
synthetic, like PCB [polychlorinated biphenyl]) do have estrogenic properties. Some fungal
agents have anti-androgen properties. 
<P>
Of more interest, the body has orphan receptors--spaces on the various cells that have no
identified hormone associated with them. Any person, including myself, who has derived some
benefit from saw palmetto will have to accept the fact that, somehow, certain plant sterols are
influencing various types of receptors. As to the class of compounds called  adaptagens  made
by Atletika, you'll simply have to try each compound on a trial basis and see if you experience
any positive effects. I doubt you'll see any results, though.

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>I want to build up my lower biceps: are Scott curls (a.k.a., preacher 
curls) good for that? The manager at my gym says so and tells me, "Just look at Larry Scott's 
lower biceps!"<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Gym-jock bio mechanists believe Scott curls will build the lower biceps. 
Look into any anatomy book and try to find such a thing as the lower biceps, you won't find it 
because it simply does't exist! The biceps brachii and the brachialis are linear muscles. The 
belief that you can activate a portion of these muscles without recruiting other portions belongs 
alongside the tabloid articles with such headlines as "Chocolate-Addicted Mother Gives Birth to 
Sugar-Coated Baby"! If it were possible to isolate only the lower portion of the biceps, we could 
demonstrate it in a controlled setting using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or electromyography 
(EMG). We can't.<P>
Unfortunately, the fact that there's no such thing as a lower biceps does't 't completely dispel 
the myth of the lower biceps. The guy with the 20-inch arms will tell you, 'Look at these lower 
biceps, they came from tons of preacher curls." What he's actually pointing at is the brachialis 
muscle, the workhorse of elbow flexion and the short head of the biceps.<P> 
Unlike the biceps brachii, the brachialis cross only one joint. They originate from the middle of 
the humerus (upper arm bone) and insert into the radius, one of the two forearm bones. Like the 
hamstrings, the biceps brachii cross two joints, and to be fully activated, they must be 
stretched at both ends. In the case of the Scott curl, the angle of the padded surface of the 
bench brings the shoulders forward, thus reducing the recruitment of the biceps brachii, 
particularly the long head. This condition increases the involvement of the short head of the 
biceps and the load on the brachialis muscle. The increased loading on these two elbow flexors 
stimulates growth, thus bringing about what appears to be "lower biceps" growth. So yes, Scott 
curls will help develop what you call the lower biceps.<P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>Just when I'm starting to make great gains in my arm workouts, I get 
injured with a strain, sprain, or some type of overuse injury. Of course, all the family doctor 
tells me to do is rest, which helps, but whenever I lay off, I lose all my gains. Do you have any 
practical suggestions on how I can prevent these injuries?<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>My first suggestion is for you to find a therapist who can determine 
What's really wrong with you and prescribe the appropriate treatment. When you're ready to resume 
training, here are five training tips that will help you stay injury free:<P>
% 	Perform an adequate warm-up: One reason heavy-duty bodybuilders often get heavy-duty 
      injuries is because they don't warm up. Your best bet is to perform three to five warm-up
      sets, and always perform low reps, yes, low reps. You don't want to perform high reps in your
      warm-up, even if your primary training sets require high reps. High reps elevate your 
      lactic-acid levels, which elevate your blood pH, and a high blood pH prevents your nervous 
      system from recruiting high-threshold motor units.<P> 
% 	Begin your workouts with dumbbell exercises: Dumbbells are less restrictive on the elbow 
      and shoulder joints than barbells. Forcing the joints into an unnatural movement pattern,  
      which occurs with many barbell exercises, places stress on the joints and may cause injury. 
      This is especially true with the standing barbell curl, which many bodybuilders simply 
      can't perform because of the unnatural stress it puts on the wrists and elbows.<P>
% 	Maintain proper neck alignment: Posture is essential for the prevention of many injuries, 
      particularly those to the neck. A common mistake made by many trainers is to twist the head 
      from side to side while straining for that last rep, that's asking for a trip to the 
      chiropractor. Also, you should never protract the neck (the vulture posture), a fault that 
      often occurs when performing standing and seated arm exercises. Instead, concentrate on 
      keeping your chin down and your chest high (lift up your sternum) when curling.<P> 
% 	Maintain proper wrist alignment: The effects of improper wrist alignment can be seen 
      anytime you visit a grocery store, carpel tunnel has become an epidemic among cashiers (and 
      a gold mine for therapists). To avoid chronic injury, always keep your wrists in a neutral 
      position when performing triceps work, and use wrist wraps.<P>
% 	Practice the principle of technical limit: The pathway of the bar should remain identical 
      from rep one till the end of the set. When you deviate from this pathway to continue an 
      exercise, you have exceeded the "technical limit" of the exercise and are probably placing 
      the joints in a more stressful lifting posture. Another benefit of adhering to the 
      technical limit principle is that such consistency with proper technique improves 
      concentration.<P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>What's your opinion of forced reps?<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Although forced reps have their place, I prefer to use this system:	 
   Do 4-6 RM and immediately have a partner or 2 add 10%-20% more weight to the bar so you can do 
   2-3 eccentric reps with the added weight. Repeat for two or three sets.<P>
As an alternative to increasing the weight, a training partner can manually apply resistance 
(i.e., push down on the bar or weight stack) for the eccentric portion. The additional negative 
repetitions will exhaust eccentric strength levels after you have achieved concentric muscular 
failure.<P>
The main reason I recommend that trainers use these methods as opposed to forced reps is because I
 often see "non-growers" in the gym make many mistakes when they perform forced reps. Here is a 
list of some of these mistakes:<P>
1. Too many forced reps at the end of a set. If you truly work to concentric failure, one or two, 
   at most three, forced reps are all you can handle. Yet I see people doing 8 to 10 forced reps 
   within a set of 12 reps. A good rule to remember is that if your partner is doing more work 
   than you are, you should have stopped four reps ago.<P> 
2. Anticipation of the upcoming forced reps. If you know your training partner will spot you, 
   It's more likely you'll stop working on the regular reps, and the spotter will start to work 
   too early.<P> 
3. Horrendous form on forced reps. The goal of forced reps is to prolong the duration of the 
   effort, not make it easier. One time while I was training the National Ski Team at the 
   University of Victoria, this guy, who had the physique of Jerry Seinfeld but walked with the 
   body image of Bill Kazmaier, asked me to spot him on the bench. He was very proud of the effect 
   his imaginary lat spread made on the imprint of Barry Manilow's face that decorated his reeking
   T-shirt.<P>
The bar was loaded with 225 lbs. Looking at him, I knew he couldn't even bench 165 lbs in good 
form. So I asked him how many reps he wanted to do. El Geeko answered, "Four plus two forced 
reps." I said fine and handed him the bar. He lowered the bar at the pace of a speeding bullet, 
bounced it off his sternum, then bridged off the bench, contorted his face, and raised the bar 
half an inch while emitting the Tasmanian Devil's mating call.<P> 
I proceeded to do a 225-lb upright row, of which only 40 lbs were actually lifted by El Geeko. I 
assumed he was going to rack it at this point and apologize for wasting my time. But no, he 
proceeded to lower the bar again! So I figured that if I were going to help lift it, I might as 
well help him lower it, too. Boom, I gave the bar a hammer punch, the free bar accelerated to his 
Corn Flakes box chest. Then I proceeded to do a manual isometric pushdown on the bar until the 
knurling drew a mustache on Barry Manilow's face. At this point, the skiers rushed over and got 
the bar off his chest. They were laughing so hard they had to make six or seven attempts before 
the bar was deposited properly on the racks.<P>
I suppose they didn't want their strength coach to be charged with practicing cosmetic surgery 
without a license. At the lunch that followed the training, the skiers teased me by saying I 
learned how to spot from the San Quentin "Pay-Back" Club.<P>
As Australia's leading strength coach Ian King said, the forced-rep fiends will select a load 
"based on their perception of the strength levels of their chosen partner." YouUll also notice 
they rotate the people they ask to spot them.<P>
4. High frequency of forced reps. Even though you may enjoy the endorphin high of forced reps, 
I suspect you'll also experience adrenal fatigue from high corticosteroid release, which, in the 
end, will stop muscle growth.<P>
As Franco Columbu used to say, "Forced reps are better done on your own."<P>


<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>Do you have any tricks for determining the right training rep bracket 
for an individual?<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Yes, in fact, there are a few methods. A very interesting one is the 
strength-deficit method. But before I get into that, we should look at some definitions:<P>
Maximal Strength: The peak force or torque the neuromuscular system is capable of producing in a 
single maximum voluntary contraction, irrespective of the time element. There are three types of 
maximal voluntary strength, one for each type of muscular contraction, isometric, concentric, and 
eccentric.<P>
Isometric (static) contraction: The muscle develops tension while its length remains unchanged, 
thus producing no external movement. Muscle develops tension without a change in joint angle.
In fact, the muscle belly and accompanying fascia (the fibrous tissue that encloses muscles) 
shorten internally during the process of developing tension, but this shortening in the agonist 
is countered equally by a shortening in the antagonist. In certain sporting movements such as 
moving out of the starting blocks in sprinting, an isometric contraction in the set position 
precedes a concentric contraction, but there is no external movement. <P>
Concentric Contraction: The muscle develops tension and shortens, causing movement to occur. 
During a chin-up, joint angle at the elbow is decreased from 180! to 15! as the biceps work 
concentrically, bringing the body up.<P> 
Eccentric Contraction: The muscle lengthens while producing tension, thus braking or controlling 
the speed of the movement. During a chin-up, an eccentric contraction of the biceps occurs when 
you lower the body from the completed chin-up position: the elbow joint angle increases from 15! 
to 180!. The highest forces the human body is voluntarily capable of lifting occur during the 
eccentric contraction; i.e., forces of 40% to 50% above values produced by concentric 
contractions.<P>
That leads us back to strength deficit. The definition of strength deficit is, for practical 
purposes, the difference between the maximal concentric strength and maximal eccentric strength.
The strength-deficit value can vary between 0% and 75%. In other words, if you can lift 200 lbs, 
you can lower between 200 and 350 lbs under control. Studies have shown that when you use high 
loads (85% and more of 1RM) and, of course, low reps (1-5), your concentric strength increases 
faster than your eccentric strength. By opposition, when you use standard bodybuilding methods 
(eight to ten reps), your eccentric strength improves faster than your concentric strength.
To test your strength deficit, find your concentric 1RM for a lift that trains a weak body part. 
For example, Let's say your upper pecs are lagging, test your maximum on the incline barbell press 
by lowering the bar for four seconds. Once your concentric maximum is established, wait ten 
minutes, and see how much weight you can lower under control for an eight-second count (at an 
even pace). Let's say, for instance, that you incline 200 lbs and lower (under control) only 210 
lbs. In this case, your strength deficit is 5% (10 lbs over 200 lbs). What does this mean to 
bodybuilders? Well, if your eccentric strength is poor (less than 20%), your training volume is 
probably too low, and you lift heavy loads too often. If your eccentric is too high (more than 
40%), your maximal concentric strength levels are too low, and you need to improve your neural 
drive by using multiple sets of low reps.<P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT>What is your opinion on cheat curls for developing bigger biceps?<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>The formula for mass gains is as follows: mass = load x time under 
tension, so It's normal for people to think that if they increase the amount of weight they use, 
they will develop more mass. This would be true if the time under tension were still present, but 
with cheat curls, the biceps are "loaded" for only a fraction of the time they would be if you 
were doing strict curls. Cheat curls are also potentially dangerous to the lower back and are 
effective only if the trainee lowers the supra-maximal load for a six- to eight-second count.<P>

<B>Dear Friend: <BR>
Let me ask you a question: if you had just met a great-looking girl (or guy...) or maybe even some influential businessman, who, on some level, you wanted to impress, would you tell that person you were a "bodybuilder"?</B> Think about it for a minute. If you're like most modern bodybuilders, the answer would be "no." Most likely, you'd mutter something about "working out regularly" or "keeping in shape," but you probably wouldn't use the dreaded "B" word.
<P>
What's more, some people tell me they're actually a little sheepish about buying a bodybuilding magazine and bringing it to the counter; it's almost as if they're buying a copy of <I>Enema Digest</I> or something. Others tell me they're shy about bringing a magazine to the office lest one of their co-workers thinks they're somehow stupid or, worse yet, taking "some of them there steer-oids" during a coffee break.
<P>
Why do you think that is? What's happened to this "sport," and what's happened to us?
<P>
Maybe it's the image this activity has created for itself that causes us to deny our association, like the disciple Paul denied Jesus. "No, no, I'm not one of those... Sure I work out, but I'm not one of '<I>those</I> guys.'" 
<P>
I mean, we've all overheard "normal" people talking about how grotesque some of the steroidal men and women are. And when some middle-aged husband and wife start channel surfing on a weeknight and inadvertently switch from the Home and Garden network to ESPN and see some guy doing a crab shot, eyes bulging, and looking like he just swallowed some of the nerve gas from the movie <I>The Rock</I>, Mr. and Mrs. Middle Age might just suddenly lurch up from their EZ-Boy chairs in fright, only to accidentally jettison their poodle into the fireplace.
<P>
The public equates bodybuilding with competitive bodybuilding, and when they hear a post-contest interview with some guy who's been living on egg whites and tuna for three months, dehydrated to the point of near death, he does not sound like a Harvard graduate. The interviews with the deep-voiced women don't help much either, unless the viewer happens to be a big Barry White fan.
<P>
Whatever. Competitive bodybuilding is what it is, and it's very special to the people who practice it or follow it. That particular part of the sport has its geniuses and its morons, just like every other walk of life. No matter; that's not what this editorial is about. What I'm talking about is the kind of bodybuilding practiced in the gym day in and day out by people who will most likely never compete—these are the people who are suffering from a public-image problem. On some level, we all want to be accepted by society. It's our nature, but maybe it's our curse, too.
<P>
Still, it's not just bodybuilding that's having sand kicked in its face. The ugly truth is, for whatever reason, fitness in America is suffering from some sort of public-opinion backlash. A good body is automatically assumed to be the product of chemical engineering. Either that or a buff physique is purely genetic luck... Sure, ask any slob. Spending too much time in the gym is thought to be a waste of time, as if <B>any</B> alternative, like sitting around inking in the "o's" in the latest <I>TV Guide</I>, is more productive.
<P>
Recent stories in the newspapers have revealed how the majority of Americans are sick of hearing about how they should eat. They don't want to hear about the fat in their movie popcorn or how their Chinese food will kill them faster than a chopstick impaled in their aortas by a Bruce Lee clone. The fast-food industry is hip to all this, and they've started to phase out their low-fat entrees. Suddenly, it's okay to eat crap food, and eating "healthy" is starting to become nerdish once again.
<P>
For some reason, being conscientious about almost anything is something to be ashamed of in America. Kids who do their homework and excel get picked on in school. If they want to survive, they start playing dumb. "Be mediocre in everything and blend in" is what the message seems to be. Well, I beg to differ.
<P>
I'm going to tell you why I body build and maybe why you body build and why I think it's a great thing. I'll leave America's other problems to the sociologists and psychologists and other people who are better equipped to handle these issues than I am.
<P>
I body build because it's the one place where I can let go. I have to hold back in everything else I do. I hold back when the boss tells me to do something his way when I know my way's better (not that that's ever the case with me and Bill, no siree, no friggin' way, not with Bill, never). I hold back when the pudknocker in the red Chevy cuts me off because maybe, just maybe, he's packing a gun. I even hold back in most sports. I can't flail my elbows in basketball when I come down with the rebound because I'm not Dennis Rodman, and I've got better manners. I can't elbow the second baseman as I try to steal a base because I'm not Albert Belle. 
<P>
But bodybuilding's different. It's one place I can give it my all. I can grunt, turn red, even bellow, and there's a certain satisfaction in that release. Without it, I might be a dreary little person, resigned to living a lackluster life bereft of passion. Or worse yet, I might be somewhat psychotic and be a member of one of those militia groups that has a standoff with the Feds somewhere for 2 months because I think the 55-mile-an-hour speed limit <I>sucks</I>.
<P>
I body build because I'm a warrior at heart, but there are no battles to fight, no enemies to smash. So instead, I fight my battles in the gym, but they're private. So, too, is the pride I feel. Sometimes the pain is so great I have to shout. No matter. I have my business meetings every day, interface with customers and clients, and I smile politely, but deep down, I know I'm tougher than they are. My world is different from theirs, and the life I lead outside the gym is sometimes less real than the life I lead inside the gym.
I body build because I need some discipline in my life. In today's world, there are too many distractions, too many temptations. Sometimes, when I'm feeling a little weak, I think it might be fun to go to Happy Hour every night, have my breakfasts at Dunkin' Donuts, and see what all those massage parlors on Broadway have to offer, but I know that sooner or later, I would tire of that life, and in place of my spirit, there would be a hole as big as Roseanne's mouth when she moose bellowed out the National Anthem a couple of years ago at a baseball game. 
<P>
I body build because there's no better sound in the world than the sound of those 45-lb plates making that peculiar ringing sound as they wobble. I body build because I like being in a place where everyone, regardless of what shade the cosmic computer color palette has deemed to make them, shares the same goals. 
<P>
I body build because the victories I achieve in the gym translate to all parts of my life. If I can have some level of success in the gym, I carry those feelings with me in my job and in my relationships with loved ones and the human race in general. If I improve my body, I feel a similar urge to improve my mind. Would I be so well versed in biology, chemistry, and other sciences if it weren't for bodybuilding? Probably not, and if the world ever ends and my little ragtag group of survivors has to rough out a life for itself, I'll probably be my group's Mr. Spock, the science officer, figuring out how to cure some infection using herbs or making condoms out of banana peels.
<P>
The next time I meet someone, I'm going to tell them, "Yes, even though I have miles to go in my physical and mental development before I rest, I am a bodybuilder. I make no excuses for trying to excel and push myself. And if you can't understand why I'm interested in self-improvement, why I won't accept your offer of cheesecake, or why I don't cancel my training for the next week because they're showing a PeeWee Herman film retrospective on the Fox network, that's your problem, not mine."
<P>
I body build because it doesn't make me feel mediocre. I do it because it makes me feel better than the average person, and if people feel that's un-American, well, screw 'em!
<P>
Train Hard and Be Proud!

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I talked my doctor into prescribing testosterone for me. I’m taking a 200-mg shot of testosterone enanthate each week. After reading your book
<I>(<A HREF="../bookofrs/roid.html"> Anabolic Reference Guide</A>)</I>, I noticed that it makes sense to use an anti-estrogen compound like Nolvadex along with testosterone injections. I asked my doctor about this, but he’s clueless. Is there any information you might be able to give me that would help him understand the importance of anti-estrogens along with testosterone therapy? Also, do I have to take a shot of testosterone enanthate every single week? Not only is it literally a “pain in the ass” but I have to pay my doctor each time I go in to get a shot. Isn’t there a testosterone that lasts longer?<P></B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> I think it's a good idea to use an anti-estrogen along with testosterone injections, even if you're only taking a "therapeutic dose" of 200 mg a week.<P> 
I used to think Nolvadex was the best anti-estrogen, but I'm now quite confident that a drug called Teslac is much better. Teslac (generic name, testolactone) inhibits the aromatase activity that turns testosterone into various forms of estrogen.<P> 
Even when taking a relatively low dose of testosterone enanthate, some of the testosterone will be converted to estrogen. This leads to such side effects as gynecomastia (swelling of male breast tissue—a very unpleasant side effect from steroid use), and it also causes water retention and can even cause "female-pattern" fat distribution.<P>
Now, the difference between Nolvadex and Teslac is that Nolvadex exhibits its anti-estrogenic effects by competing with estrogen at binding sites in target tissue, such as the breast. Nolvadex does not really do much to prevent the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, which is something Teslac does well.<P>
If you wanted to really fight estrogen's side effects, you could take Teslac (250 mg 4 times a day) and Nolvadex (10 to 20 mg a day). The Teslac would help prevent the conversion of testosterone to estrogen, and the Nolvadex would help keep any circulating estrogen that "snuck past" the Teslac from binding at estrogen sites like the breast.<P>
Teslac may also be an "anti-glucocorticoid"—it may also compete with cortisol-like compounds and be somewhat "anti-catabolic," although this is not known for certain.<P>
Another reason I think Teslac is better than Nolvadex is because using Teslac, along with testosterone, can dramatically increase serum testosterone levels. Let me give you an example—in a recent study where test subjects received 200 mg of testosterone enanthate a week (just like you're taking) and also used 250 mg of Teslac 4 times a day, the testosterone enanthate plus Teslac group had an increase of serum testosterone of 105% versus only 39% when testosterone enanthate was administered, at the same dosage, <I>without</I> Teslac.<P>
This offers evidence to suggest that if you use testosterone with Teslac, you could experience a 300% greater serum testosterone level than if you used testosterone by itself! This could allow you to use a lower dose of testosterone and get <I>much</I> greater effects.<P>
What happened to all that enanthate that didn't show up as serum testosterone in the non-Teslac users? It converted to estrogen! This same study showed that the people who used enanthate only had a 47% increase in serum estradiol levels—there was <I>no</I> increase in serum estradiol levels at all in the testosterone plus Teslac users!<P>
This fascinating study is described in the <I>American Journal of Cardiology</I> (Vol. 77, June 1, 1996 : 1,244). Have your doctor read a copy of this study, and then ask him if he'll prescribe Teslac for you.<P>
Also, you might have him read an article on page 1,179 of that same journal—that study describes how the use of compounds like testosterone enanthate can decrease something called lipoprotein(a), which is a risk factor for heart disease.<P>
Some scientists are proposing that testosterone therapy be used in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) levels to reduce their risk of heart disease! This goes against the current theory that the use of anabolic steroids, including testosterone, only has a negative effect on the risk of coronary-artery disease. Interesting...<P>
Now, to answer your last question, testosterone enanthate is the longest-acting injectable testosterone available in America right now. You could probably get away with taking a shot every 10 to 14 days if taking an injection weekly is really bothersome.<P>
An interesting note related to this is that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) are seeking partners for the further development, evaluation, and commercialization of something called testosterone <I>bucyclate</I>.<P>
This new injectable testosterone was invented and patented in 1980 during a joint NIH-WHO sponsored steroid-synthesis program in which the preparation of selected steroid esters was contracted by WHO and the resulting compounds screened by the Contraceptive Development Branch (CDB) of the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development at its Biological Testing Facility. Chemically, testosterone bucyclate is testosterone 17b-(trans-4-n-butyl) cyclohexyl carboxylate. This ester of the natural hormone, testosterone, exhibits prolonged activity when administered intramuscularly as an aqueous crystalline suspension in all species studied, including man. (You may only have to take a shot of this stuff once every four to six weeks!!)<P>
Basically, what you have here is a government-sponsored and codeveloped long-acting testosterone (finally, our tax dollars being well spent!).<P>
These government organizations are looking for a pharmaceutical company like Searle, Bristol-Myers, Abbott Labs, or some other major player to step in and help fund further research and development on this product.<P>
The primary interest here is using testosterone bucyclate as a birth-control injection for males. Remember, extensive studies in Europe have shown that testosterone therapy (in doses that are definitely sufficient to accelerate muscle growth) is a very safe and effective form of birth control.<P>
I wouldn't be surprised if, within the next three or four years, testosterone bucyclate were available as a form of birth control here in the United States. But, unfortunately for now, testosterone enanthate is probably your best bet.<P>
If I were to use steroids again, any steroids, Deca, Primobolan, testosterone cypionate or enanthate, I would definitely use 1,000 mg (250 mg 4 times a day) of Teslac along with them. 
Unfortunately, even though Teslac is <B>not</B> an anabolic steroid, it was put on Schedule III in 1990, with the Anabolic Steroid Control Act, so it's a bit hard to get.



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> Which do you think is the best insulin potentiator/mimicker: vanadyl sulfate, chromium picolinate, metformin, or phenformin?</B>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> All of the compounds you mentioned have been used by bodybuilders with varying degrees of success. The reason lifters are interested in insulin-mimicking supplements and drugs is because insulin is a powerful anabolic hormone that drives glucose, amino acids, and creatine into muscle tissue.<P>
Chromium picolinate and vanadyl sulfate are both effective under certain conditions. I think vanadyl sulfate probably works better for bodybuilders than chromium picolinate, but I believe chromium works better than vanadyl on people who are extremely overweight (obese). Don't ask me why—it's just an empirical observation. <P>
I would say that out of all the oral insulin mimickers available, metformin is probably the best. This drug is available over the counter in Mexico and with a prescription in the U.S.<P> 
Metformin belongs to a class of drugs called "biguanides" as does phenformin. Both metformin and phenformin increase the transport of glucose (blood sugar) into muscle cells by directly increasing insulin sensitivity. These drugs also inhibit the formation of sugar by the liver.<P>
One of the best things about metformin and phenformin is that they don't typically cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Unfortunately, phenformin has been known to produce a nasty side effect, lactic acidosis. Because of this, phenformin will never be available in the United States.<P>
One hot "steroid-free" stack that I know some natural athletes are using includes taking metformin, creatine monohydrate, and 30 to 50 grams of glucose/simple sugars 3 times a day on an empty stomach, with one serving immediately following a workout. I hear it's awesome!<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I've read that using the supplement OKG can increase nitrogen retention and muscle growth. I'm on a very limited budget, and before I buy any OKG, I thought I'd see what you think of it. Do you think it's worth the money?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> At one time, I was relatively certain that OKG might be a beneficial bodybuilding supplement, but now I really don't think it works.<P> 
I've seen studies that show OKG, when administered to sick or traumatized people, has the ability to prevent losses of nitrogen or body protein. But, for some reason, in bodybuilders, the stuff just doesn't seem to do anything—at least that's what my personal experience and the feedback from <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> readers indicate.<P>
In terms of drug-free products that have an effect on nitrogen retention and muscle growth, I'd have to say that bodybuilding's most popular supplement, creatine monohydrate, is probably as good or better in this regard than anything else out there.<P>
Even though we have extensively discussed creatine's "cell-volumizing" effects and the ability of supplemental creatine to enhance a key energy pathway in muscle tissue, I haven't really discussed creatine's ability to promote nitrogen retention. But it definitely appears that creatine has the potential to spare protein and to increase nitrogen retention in the body. Creatine appears to selectively stimulate the rate of protein synthesis of the two major contractile proteins which make up skeletal muscle—actin and myosin. This has been documented in animal studies in which the animals were fed creatine. These studies show that on a "basal diet" (where calories consumed equal calories burned), animals gained weight and showed a positive nitrogen balance.<P>
Here's something else that's quite interesting—it takes energy for a muscle cell to build itself back up after exercise. Muscle building is an energy-requiring process. And, did you know that studies have shown that 70% of muscle-protein synthesis depends on energy from the phosphocreatine pathway—an energy system that is substantially enhanced when your muscles are holding more creatine? (By the way, the other 30% depends on energy production stimulated by insulin. Could this be why Phosphagen HP, EAS' new creatine supplement that substantially enhances the release of the anabolic hormone insulin at the same time creatine is put into the system, is producing what some call "steroid-like" gains? Humm...)<P>
As I've explained before, I think creatine monohydrate is the number one supplement out—the best drug-free bodybuilding agent that's ever been available. And, I believe it has effects on performance, muscle metabolism, etc. that go far beyond the things we've discussed previously in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. There are a lot of things I think we can still learn about how creatine might positively affect muscle growth, strength, and overall health. (A recent study which is being published in <I>Clinical Science</I> shows creatine supplementation may significantly <I>improve</I> blood-lipid profiles!)<P>
That's why EAS recently signed a deal to fund a $772,000, 3-year research project which will be headed up by Dr. Paul Greenhaff of Nottingham University in England to study creatine use. Over the course of this unprecedented research project, scientists will be examining how creatine affects protein synthesis, proteolysis, nitrogen retention, performance, health, etc.<P>
Anyway, if you're trying to decide which supplements are worth your while and which ones probably aren't, I would highly recommend that you read a copy of my <I><A HREF="../nsr/nsr96.html"> 1996 Supplement Review</A></I>. In that book, I give you the lowdown on almost every supplement available. (You can find out how to get a FREE copy of that book on page 38 of this magazine.)<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I came across a newsletter yesterday that said it was legal to order prescription drugs from other countries as long as you were only ordering a personal supply. Do you know anything about this? Is it possible to get steroids from pharmacies in other countries? </B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> It is indeed possible to order prescription drugs from mail-order houses in other countries. This "loophole" was opened up back in 1988 when AIDS activists (a very powerful political group) forced the FDA to adopt new "guidelines" that made it possible for them to attain prescription drugs from other countries that were not yet approved by the FDA. Their rationale was that the FDA is so slow in approving new drugs in the United States that many AIDS patients would die before the FDA could possibly give the okay to use certain medications that might help in the treatment of AIDS—medications that are available in other countries.<P> 
Anyway, the regulations go something like this—you can order only a 90-day personal supply of any particular medication, and, supposedly, you need to be under the care of a licensed physician in the U.S. who is responsible for your treatment with the product. So, what people have been doing is contacting pharmacies in other countries and having them ship various prescription drugs to them in the United States. It's really quite simple.<P>
Unfortunately, many drugs that bodybuilders use/abuse are on what's called an "import-alert" list. These are drugs that, for one reason or another, the FDA has decided should not be allowed under this importation regulation. This includes all kinds of things—some that don't make any sense. The import-alert list prohibits the importation of certain toothpastes, soaps, supplements, etc., as well as things you might suspect they would prohibit, such as anabolic steroids.<P>
BUT, I've heard quite a few stories about people ordering things like diuretics, beta-agonists, growth hormone, insulin, GHB, DHEA, tryptophan, birth-control pills, antibiotics, ulcer medications, thyroid drugs, cortisol blockers, etc., etc. How customs agents and/or the FDA decide to snag various packages or let them go is really hard to figure out. Since the import-alert lists aren't generally made available to the public, it's difficult to tell what they're watching for and what they're not.<P>
Although some bodybuilders regularly buy from these foreign mail-order pharmacies, the primary patrons in the U.S. who take advantage of these services are AIDS patients and those into "life-extension drugs."<P>
One company that keeps an up-to-date list of foreign pharmacies that will ship orders to people in the U.S. is called Life Enhancement Products. You might try writing to them at P.O. Box 4438, Petaluma, CA 94955, or you can fax them at 707-769-8016. They'll send you a list of reputable foreign mail-order pharmacies.<P>
In addition to a list of legit foreign mail-order pharmacies, they also provide a practitioner referral listing with the names, addresses, and phone numbers of doctors around the world who specialize in life-extension medicine, hormone-replacement therapy, growth-hormone treatment, etc. If you're interested in this type of thing, you might want to check this out.<P>
In the next issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, we're going to have a feature on this whole foreign mail-order pharmacy thing. We'll bring you the latest, up-to-date news, including interviews with customs officials, FDA agents, foreign pharmacies, medical doctors, etc.<P>
We'll fill you in on <B>all</B> the details—like what would happen if a foreign pharmacy did fill your order for clenbuterol, testosterone, etc. Would Federal agents arrest you, simply send your shipment back, or would they just ignore it? The answers will fascinate you! By the way, the next issue of <I>MM2K</I> goes on sale October 1, 1996.



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>Have you ever heard of a steroid called Maxigan? Is it real or counterfeit?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> Maxigan is a veterinarian steroid available in Mexico. It's the same thing as Equipoise, which is relatively similar to Deca-Durabolin, in that it's highly anabolic and only moderately androgenic.<P>
I've never heard of Maxigan being counterfeited, but it's impossible to say for certain with all the clandestine bogus steroid plants out there.<P>
Maxigan costs about $180 U.S. for 100 ml at veterinary-supply shops in Mexico. If you've seen it on the U.S. black market for less than that, it could be a counterfeit.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I was thinking about trying a product called IGF-1A. It's made by Squib Labs, and it's supposed to be better than IGF-1. They quote your magazine in their advertisements, so I've got the feeling this stuff is legit. What do you think?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> IGF-1A is a complete and total scam. This product is distributed by Dexter Sports Supplements.There's no such drug known as IGF-1A nor a drug company by the name of "Squib Labs." The real Squibb Labs uses two "b's" in their name, not one.<P>
In the ads for IGF-1A, they do quote <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, but this is without permission, and the statements we made were about the real IGF-1—not their scam supplement product, which contains no real IGF-1 whatsoever.<P>
This is, without question, a major, major scam! I would not recommend that anyone buy this IGF-1A crap.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> Dan Duchaine and a number of other experts have recently written in your magazine (and others) and stated on audiotape interviews that I've listened to that the concept of cycling steroids (going on and off) doesn't make sense. They don't think cycling has any merit. What do you think?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> I don't agree with Dan on this topic. What I believe Dan is focusing on most when he says that cycling steroids doesn't work is the whole concept of receptor downgrading. Let me explain... A number of steroid experts (including me) have determined that after you have been taking steroids for a while, the receptor sites, which are basically little targets on cells that receive a signal from outside the cell and transfer that signal to the inside of a cell, become downgraded. That is, when you start taking steroids, your muscle cells have a high receptor affinity—they receive and transfer the signal from the steroid molecules very efficiently. However, over a period of time, these receptors downgrade, and they just don't work as well.<P>
Now, one reason I think cycling steroids is a good idea is because it might minimize receptor attenuation or down-regulation. Dan originally agreed with the theory of cycling to try to maximize receptor affinity, but he has more recently become convinced that steroid receptors down-regulate much more quickly (within a matter of weeks, not months) than we originally believed. Thus, Dan feels trying to prevent the inevitable is illogical and ineffective.<P>
If steroid receptors, which cause the muscle cell to increase protein synthesis after receiving the steroid signal, down-regulate rapidly when you start using steroids, it's quite likely that the majority of the positive effects steroids exert on muscle metabolism occur through anti-catabolic/anti-proteolytic means—steroid molecules occupy cortisol (a catabolic hormone that breaks down muscle tissue) receptor sites, so cortisol can't break down muscle tissue.<P>
The truth is, we really don't know <I>exactly</I> how fast steroid receptor sites shut down. But, receptor down-regulation is just <B>one</B> of several reasons I believe steroids should be cycled. Another reason I think you should go on and off steroids has to do with the way these drugs affect your body's ability to naturally produce testosterone. I believe that the longer you stay on steroids, the more screwed up your body's hormone feedback mechanisms get; the continual, long-term use of steroids can almost completely shut down your body's ability to naturally produce testosterone. And I think you can avoid this problem <I>if</I>you "cycle."<P>
Another reason I think cycling is important is because of the potential toxicity involved with using anabolic/androgenic steroids. Quite often, when athletes use oral or even injectable anabolic steroids, their livers have to work overtime to remove various toxins from the blood.<P>
Steroids are definitely not the only drugs that can cause the liver to work a little harder (I've seen simple antibiotics like tetracycline raise certain liver enzyme levels by 300%), but I do believe the longer you stay on steroids, the more likely it is you'll develop some type of liver damage.<P>
Perhaps the most important reason for cycling on and off steroids is to try to minimize psychological dependence on these drugs. I know a lot of bodybuilders who are "hooked" on steroids—not necessarily because the drugs are physiologically addictive but because some guys (and even some gals) get "addicted" to being big and can't stand the thought of going off steroids and losing even a few pounds. This is a very weak "place to be."<P>
So, to summarize, I believe the longer you stay on steroids, the less they're going to work, the greater the side effects will be, the greater your chances for long-term health complications, and the harder it is to "get off," so to speak.<P>
Even if some of the theories or advantages to cycling steroids cannot be validated (like the "receptor issue"), I think, overall, it just makes sense. I still believe the proper use (not abuse) of steroids for improving muscle metabolism and performance and maybe even certain health parameters involves using moderate doses of low-androgenic steroids for cycle periods of 6 to 12 weeks, followed by at least a 6- to 12-week off period before using the drugs again.<P>
I know Dan will probably argue that my beliefs on steroid cycling are "old school" and that today's steroid kamikazes have nothing to gain by going on and off steroids, but I just can't convince myself that's the case.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I read an article by John Romano in another muscle magazine that said Muscle Media 2000 has no credibility. Why would he say that?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> John who?



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I understand that using steroids can shut down the body's production of testosterone. My question and concern pertains to the use of DHEA. I've been using this hormone for a couple of months now, and I think I really do feel better while I'm on it. I'm taking 100 mg a day. My question is, by taking extra DHEA, am I shutting down my body's natural production of DHEA or testosterone?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> That's a good question, and it's one that a lot of people should be asking as there are literally tens of thousands of people who are self-administering DHEA—this stuff is extremely popular with bodybuilders and life extensionists.<P>
You're right—the production of most steroids is controlled by a "feedback loop," which means that when hormone levels get too high, the body is "told" to make less, and when hormone levels are too low, the body is "told" to make more. Cortisol, testosterone, and estrogen are all regulated by this type of feedback loop. In other words, if you take cortisol or a similar derivative such as prednisone, your body may shut off its natural production of cortisol. (By the way, <I>this</I> is an "anti-catabolic theory" that has been overlooked for quite some time—you can read more about this in a new column in the next issue of <I>MM2K</I> called "Notes from the Underground.")<P> 
Anyway, the exogenous use of numerous hormones can cause your body to stop making them. However, DHEA appears to be an exception. According to experts, there does <B>not</B> seem to be a "negative feedback reaction" for DHEA or DHEAS, which is what DHEA becomes when it's metabolized by your body (the S stands for sulfate). In other words, taking a DHEA supplement is not likely to stop your body's own production of DHEA nor testosterone, although no long-term human studies have been conducted to confirm this.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I have been reading your magazine for the past few months, and overall, I really enjoy it, and I've definitely learned some things that have helped my own efforts to build more muscle. But one thing I can't figure out is whether you're for or against the use of drugs. On one hand, you speak very highly of certain supplements and claim that with the proper knowledge and correct training, nutrition, and supplementation program, you can make significant gains naturally, but then you've also written this book on how athletes have used steroids, and you continually discuss how effective these drugs are for building muscle mass. Just exactly where do you stand—are you for or against the use of drugs?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> I stand where I always have—firmly committed to providing the truth. As for whether I am opposed to drugs or in favor of them, I'd have to say I'm in favor of the use of many drugs and am a regular user. I take aspirin if I have a headache; I often consume caffeine early in the day; I take antibiotics if I have a bacterial infection; I take Zantac sometimes when my gut starts acting up; and I even like drugs (preservatives) in my food so it doesn't rot. Make no mistake; I use a lot of drugs. However, I'm not in favor of the use of all drugs. Obviously, certain drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and even alcohol can destroy lives and negatively impact society.<P>
I think what you meant to ask was whether I'm for or against the use of anabolic steroids. That's obviously a different question than whether I'm for or against the use of drugs altogether. (I'll assume you meant to ask whether I'm for or against the use of anabolic steroids by <I>athletes</I>.) Basically, my position on anabolic steroid use is that it's becoming more and more of a problem. Although I do admit that some (very few) athletes are able to use anabolic steroids responsibly, safely, and effectively, most users are taking more risks than could possibly be countered by the gains from using these drugs. Still, I think a steroid user's greatest enemy is <I>mis</I>information, and I strive to provide accurate, honest information that can benefit bodybuilders.<P> 
My interest in drug-free supplements stems from the fact that I'm no longer interested in using steroids. (I used them on and off for several years in the mid-'80's when I was competing in bodybuilding.) Now I'm determined to make gains without steroids.<P>
But, just because I made that decision does not mean I insist everyone else does the same. There are a lot of athletes who are going to use anabolic steroids no matter what I tell them. That decision is theirs to make, not mine.<P>
I remain convinced that if athletes have access to accurate information about steroids, like what the real side effects are, what the positive effects are, and what legal issues go hand in hand with using these drugs, etc., more people will be in a position to make a responsible decision.<P>
I think almost everyone agrees that the <I>ultimate</I> solution would be to identify compounds that are <B>not</B> illegal—things that produce major positive effects on muscle size and strength—things that are even more powerful than creatine, HMB, etc. Then the whole steroid issue would look trivial. <I>If</I> we can ever find something that works as well as steroids that's legal and safe, then the whole topic will be moot.<P>
My knee-jerk reaction is to say that's impossible, but if just a few years ago you told me people would be able to use a natural supplement and make the types of gains people are making with creatine, I would have said you were crazy. I'm skeptical, but I believe it's not at all impossible that something will come along sometime in the future that will make steroids obsolete. Then we can put an end to all this controversy.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> My present goal is to lose ten pounds of bodyfat without losing any muscle mass. I'm pretty bulky, and I think I'd have good definition if I could just get rid of this layer of fat that's covering my muscles. I'm following a high-protein, low-carb, moderately low-fat diet and am consuming less calories than my body burns off each day, but I was wondering if there are any "tricks" you could share with me that would allow me to get better results faster.</B>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> Getting that muscular, "bodybuilder-like" look definitely means having low bodyfat. I know so many guys who have built up good muscle mass over several years by weight training, but they look like crap. Guys have got to be around seven percent bodyfat or lower to have that really cool, muscular, defined, <I>respectable</I> look.<P>
Of course, to get really cut up, you simply must burn more calories than you consume. But, you don't want to go on a super-low-calorie diet; otherwise, you'll sacrifice muscle tissue.<P>
I agree with what you're doing—consuming a high-protein, low-carb, moderately low-fat diet and restricting your calorie intake.<P>
The one tip I think you might want to consider is to try conducting your weight-training exercise or even aerobic exercise immediately after you wake up, after at least a ten-hour fast. When you do this, your body burns up to 200% more stored bodyfat during your exercise session and in the hours afterwards than if you were to exercise in a "fed" state.<P>
This has been documented in several clinical studies, and additional research in this area (which I have access to) will be presented next year which confirms this effect may be even greater than what scientists have speculated.<P>
Here's an example—let's say you eat your last meal at 9:00 p.m. Then you go to bed around 11:00 p.m., get up around 7:00 a.m., and immediately do 45 minutes of exercise. (It doesn't matter if it's weight training or aerobics—your body will burn big quantities of stored bodyfat either way.) Then, right after your workout, have your biggest meal of the day—eat a lot of carbs and protein.<P>
By exercising on an empty stomach, your body will have to dip deep into fat reserves to pull fuel to get you through the workout, and if you have a high-carb, high-protein meal right after you exercise, your muscles will literally suck up amino acids and glucose like a sponge—you can literally watch your muscles swell and get fuller and rounder. Very cool! This works well! Give it a try!<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I'm a 36-year-old male bodybuilder. I've never used steroids, but my doctor says I have a low normal testosterone level. My sex drive is virtually nonexistent. He says I don't need testosterone shots, but it sure would be nice if I had some type of "urge." I heard melatonin is a sex-enhancing hormone. Do you think I should take that?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> I don't think melatonin has any effect on a person's sex drive. The whole thing about melatonin being a "sex enhancer" comes down to this twisted logic: scientists have observed that laboratory animals fed melatonin may live longer. They hypothesize that perhaps the same thing will be true of human beings—that if they use melatonin, they may be able to extend their life spans. If people live longer, they theorize, then they will have more sex. I guess that's probably true—when you're dead, you don't have sex anymore. Well, I guess that's <I>almost</I> always true—there are people called necrophiliacs, but I'll let Duchaine tell you about that...<P>
Anyway, the bottom line is that I <B>don't</B> think melatonin will add any spark to your sex life.
Because you're concerned about this, I recommend that you try to find a doctor who will prescribe testosterone for you. If you "shop around," I think you'll find a cooperative M.D. to prescribe testosterone for this <I>legitimate</I> use. Many people—both men and women—find that an elevation in their testosterone levels does cause an increase in sex drive.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I've read good things about HMB in your magazine, but I also read Muscular Development, and their writers say HMB is not that great. Should I try HMB or not?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> You should decide for yourself what to do. But, keep in mind that <I>Muscular Development</I> is Twin Laboratories' (a supplement company that's in competition with my company) magazine.<P>
If you take a look at all the bodybuilding supplements on the market and compare HMB to them, you'll see there is much, much more "science" behind HMB than there is for the vast majority of so-called "bodybuilding supplements" on the market. I have been following the science behind HMB for quite some time and worked very hard to be the first to bring this product to the market.<P>
HMB is unquestionably the hottest supplement in bodybuilding right now, and in my opinion, it may be the second most effective natural bodybuilding agent you can get. (Creatine is unquestionably number one.)<P>
The writers at <I>Muscular Development</I> have taken it upon themselves to try to convince people that HMB is not an effective product. They accuse our writers of having a financial interest in HMB, which is simply not the case. Dan Duchaine, who has written about the possible benefits of HMB use by bodybuilders on several occasions, has absolutely <I>no</I> financial interest in HMB whatsoever. He gets paid a certain dollar amount to write articles, and that's it. His compensation is <B>not</B> tied to supplements that I sell in any way, shape, or form. Anthony Almada, the Research Director for EAS, has <B>never</B> received a single dollar from HMB sales. Anthony receives the same paycheck every month, whether we sell 10,000 bottles of HMB or none at all. His pay has never been tied to HMB sales.<P>
Since I'm the main distributor of HMB, I do make money off every bottle that's sold, so I obviously have a financial interest in HMB. But, I could have a financial interest in any supplement out there. I could sell virtually any supplement anyone else sells, but I'm involved in the distribution of very few products. That's because I think there are only a few products that are worth using.<P>
Anyway, just keep in mind that <I>Muscular Development</I>/TwinLab have their agenda, and they believe it's in their best interest to do whatever they can to "slam" my reputation and the reputations of other <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> writers, etc. This is called trying to build yourself up by running others down.<P> 
For those of you who read <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> and <I>Muscular Development</I> (there aren't that many, so I won't spend a whole lot of time on this topic), if you believe the "scientific writers" for <I>Muscular Development</I> have no interests in the supplement business, then I have some great land in south Florida you might want to buy!!!<P>
One last note—I have always pushed my "stuff." Everyone who follows my work knows this. I want to sell you my books, supplements, magazines, etc. I think the main difference between what I do and what many other people in this market do is I "push good stuff." I mean, I sell some really good products, <B>and</B> I stand behind anything and everything I sell with an unconditional, lifetime, money-back guarantee! Who else does that in this industry? No one! If you (or anyone else) buy something from me and you don't like it, I'll refund your money. Needless to say, the only way I make a profit is by satisfying my customers, and that means selling <I>good stuff</I>! Makes sense... huh?



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>A guy at a health-food store I shop at told me the best way to supplement DHEA is by using wild yam extracts. Is this true?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> DHEA is made commercially from a plant of the Dioscorea family (wild yams) found in abundance in Mexico. Extracts of this plant contain a steroidal saponin which may be converted in a laboratory, by a series of six to eight chemical reactions, into DHEA. A comparable series of reactions is not known to exist in nature and certainly not in the human body.<P>
Consequently, it's very unlikely and, in my opinion, impossible, for the ingestion of extracts of the Dioscorea plant (or wild yams) to lead to the formation, by metabolic transformation of the relevant plant constituent, to DHEA.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> Bill, I love your magazine. I really think it's got the best information out there, but I sometimes get tired of reading information about the same old supplements—creatine, HMB, CLA, whey protein, etc., etc. I already know these products are good. Why do I have to read about them in every issue? Why don't you write about new supplements in each issue? And why don't you ever plug products you don't sell?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B> Thanks for your positive comments. Unfortunately, new, worthwhile, exciting bodybuilding supplements only come along once in a while. There is not a new supplement discovery to write about in each issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. I'm sure you can understand that.<P>
I definitely see what you're saying—we have discussed creatine, whey protein, HMB, CLA, and such, in many issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. But, the reason we answer so many questions about these products in the magazine is because we literally get <B>hundreds and hundreds</B> of questions about these supplements. Even though some readers like yourself already know everything you care to know about these products, other people apparently don't learn as quickly as you do, or they simply want to know more about these products. And, there are new studies coming out regularly about these "same old products." I'm convinced creatine works, and I'm going to take 10 to 20 grams of this stuff a day regardless of whether I read anything exciting about it this month in the muscle magazines, and I'm sure you're the same way. But, if a new study comes out showing creatine may reduce certain risks of heart disease (which recently happened), I think that's worthy of reporting in the magazine—it's newsworthy.<P>
We definitely keep our eye out for anything new and interesting in the supplement field, and we don't focus exclusively on products I sell. For example, there's been quite a lot of news about DHEA in the past six issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. I have <B>no</B> financial interest in DHEA whatsoever—I just think it's newsworthy. It's an interesting compound.<P>
In this issue of the magazine, Dan Duchaine talks about how using various "Yohimbine-containing supplements" may help reduce bodyfat. I don't sell any Yohimbine-containing supplements and don't plan to. As a matter of fact, we gave a great plug for TwinLab (a company we're in fierce competition with), but that's cool. (Geez... I otta be about due for a "return favor" plug from Twinlab/<I>Muscular Development</I>—don't ya think? All they ever do is slam other companies' supplements. Their negativity gets old fast. Can you say "insecurity"?)<P>
In recent issues, we've talked about the possible benefits of using melatonin. I don't sell melatonin and don't plan to. We also regularly plug products like Next Nutrition's Designer Protein and TwinLab's Ripped Fuel—both are products I have no financial interest in.<P> 
I think when you look at the "big picture," you'll see that in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, we recommend quite a number of different products that we don't have any financial interest in.<P> Of course, whenever the opportunity arises, we do like to present new information on the possible benefits of products that we were first to put on the market, including creatine, HMB, CLA, etc. But, we have never contended to have a "world exclusive" on quality supplements. TwinLab now has their own version of CLA on the market (now let me see if I've got this straight... they're the <I>leaders</I> in sports nutrition... oh, I see). And, I understand Weider and TwinLab are both coming out with versions of HMB. (They are looking into getting "licensed" to sell HMB by the patent holders.)<P>
As you know, almost every supplement company sells creatine. (Unfortunately, some don't sell the highest-quality creatine products, but that's another subject altogether.)<P>
Anyway, I appreciate your input and can understand your concern—at times, the "product plugs" may seem a little extensive, but all the "muscle magazines" plug their own products. <I>Muscular Development</I> is obviously promoting their TwinLab products, <I>Muscle and Fitness</I> and <I>Flex</I> obviously promote the Weider products, which include Schiff, Tiger's Milk, American Bodybuilding (all Weider-owned companies). <I>Ironman</I> has their own supplement line called Muscle Linc, and they heavily promote their books, videos, equipment, etc., and <I>MuscleMag</I> has their MuscleTech products. (Despite what they tell you in their magazine, MuscleTech is unquestionably the "official" supplement line of <I>MuscleMag</I>. I don't know why they don't just come out and say so—it would be more straightforward to say something like, "We at <I>MuscleMag</I> believe that MuscleTech products are great, and we're proud to be associated with these products, and so on and so forth." In the long run, they'll figure that out. The truth always comes out.)<P>
Obviously, in each issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, you get much, much more than "redundant" information on the same supplement products over and over again, and it's much, much more than a vehicle to promote our products. Take a look at each issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, and really check it out. We have great articles on training, nutrition, steroids, and supplements. We have great writers like Dan Duchaine (a writer that no one in this industry would even consider letting work for their magazine before <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> was started), great young minds like Michael Mooney, expert trainers like Charles Poliquin, and TC Luoma and I pitch in some pretty novel and useful information on a regular basis.<P>
Unfortunately, the way the muscle-magazine business works, it's not possible to put out a magazine without promoting the products you sell. The economics just don't work. That's why every muscle magazine promotes products. The good news is, selling products allows us to put out very informative, helpful magazines that I think benefit a lot of readers. And, many readers pick up the various magazines specifically to shop for new bodybuilding supplements, books, equipment, and so on. Take a look at it that way and see if you don't at least agree with me "in part."

 <B>Over the last three months, I've collected the many questions I've received in the mail and on the Internet about my BODYOPUS diet. Rather than spreading the questions and answers out through a number of issues, I thought it best to devote just one column to the recurring questions. You don't need to read the <A HREF="../bookofrs/opus.html"> BODYOPUS</A> book to understand the questions, and the answers are applicable to most diets in general, especially if you're in the precontest depletion and carb-up phases. In the future, most BODYOPUS questions will be answered in my upcoming newsletter, not in this column.</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : What exactly is your BODYOPUS diet? How does it differ from other diets? And why aren't any top bodybuilders using it?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Although I describe three distinct diets in BODYOPUS, you're probably wondering about the actual BODYOPUS diet, which is a cyclic ketogenic diet. A cyclic ketogenic diet has two parts: a number of days when the dieter eats virtually no carbohydrates, followed by a shorter span, usually two days, of high-carb eating. And then the whole "cycle" is repeated.<P> 
Ketogenic diets have been around in one form or another for decades. Ketones are fats that have been reduced somewhat from the original fat structure, so the brain is able to use these fuels when glucose is not available. The brain will usually only use glucose as a fuel source, but when blood glucose falls to about 50 mg/dl, the pancreas will start secreting an anti-insulin hormone called glucagon. Glucagon will generate two major effects: it will expel any glycogen stored in the liver into the bloodstream as glucose. And it will convert fatty acids (either from body stores or dietary fats) into ketones. Usually, glucagon is considered a catabolic hormone, and the state of ketosis usually indicates either disease or starvation. But by jolting your body into short spans of ketosis, you can actually manipulate your metabolism and cause some beneficial effects.<P> 
Ketones are very inefficient fuel sources. A gram of fat converted to ketones won't yield the usual nine calories of energy. It's slightly less, about seven calories. This means more fat is needed for energy in the ketogenic state, as compared to a non-ketogenic low-calorie diet. So if a dieter needs to lose the fat in a real hurry, a ketogenic diet is the fastest way to do it. The usual math of "each pound of bodyfat lost yields 3,500 calories" doesn't work with ketones.<P>
BODYOPUS requires more discipline than other low-calorie diets, simply because the brain will send out all kinds of distress signals when blood sugar is low, hoping you'll eat some carbohydrates in response. So, if you aren't in any particular hurry to lose fat, don't bother with BODYOPUS.<P>
The cyclic ketogenic diet didn't start out as a weight-loss diet but rather as a plan to gain muscle without getting fat at the same time. And I've discovered, over the years, that many dieters found that the traditional low-calorie diets caused too much muscle-mass loss and that the cyclic ketogenic diet is the solution to preserving muscle. Granted, most of the top bodybuilders achieve a ripped condition with a low-fat, low-calorie diet. But a greater number of lesser bodybuilders never reach single-digit bodyfat percentages on the traditional diets.<P>
A cyclic ketogenic diet has additional benefits for female dieters. For some unknown reason, the BODYOPUS diet seems to better mobilize fat out of the stubborn fat areas, especially in the lower body. It might be the lack of insulin or the fat-mobilizing effects of glucagon, or an unknown mechanism may cause this benefit.<P>
I would like to point out that the most reactionary bodybuilders (a.k.a. the regular posters on the various Internet nutrition newsgroups—who hate almost anything unusual) seem to be giving the BODYOPUS diet a warm reception. The simple fact is: BODYOPUS delivers on schedule, as promised.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : What's the difference between your BODYOPUS diet and DiPasquale's Anabolic Diet?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  The diets are very similar: both are seven-day cycles of which five are "no-carb" days, so your body starts fracturing fats into another energy source—ketones. And after five days of this kind of eating, you switch over to one or two days of a high-carb diet.<P>
Both diets are based on the Rebound Training System, developed by Michael Zumpano during the late '70's. It was a melding of the popular Atkins diet (a full-time ketogenic weight-loss diet) and the glycogen supercompensation plan which was popular in the endurance sports at the same time.<P>
The Anabolic Diet is not specifically a fat-loss diet but rather a weight-gain plan. BODYOPUS is tailored for maximal fat loss, even though it could easily be modified into a weight-gain diet by simply increasing the amount of calories during the 5-day ketogenic phase by about 20% over maintenance. Actually, there's no practical upper limit of calories above maintenance, as excess fats converted to ketones can't be stored or reconverted and will be excreted in the urine.<P>
In BODYOPUS, I've tried to be very precise about the various food choices and their impact on long-range benefits. The Anabolic Diet is not at all choosy about the quality of the macronutrients and relies heavily on saturated fats in the ketogenic phase. In BODYOPUS, I suggest options that would minimize the reliance on animal fats. Although the research points out that high-fat ketogenic diets will not raise cholesterol, there are other health concerns with saturated fats, especially the highly processed ones like bacon, sausage, and Spam (which the Anabolic Diet relies on).<P>
The most precise aspects of BODYOPUS are discussed in the carbing-up (which I call Recomposition) chapters. The goal is to drive as much glucose into the muscles without spilling any over into the fat cells. Many dieters without this carb-up guidance will redeposit triglycerides and glycerol into the fat cells. Ideally, with the Recomposition carb-up, your various skin-fold millimeter readings on Friday afternoon should be almost the same on the following Monday morning, after the carb-up. The Anabolic Diet doesn't have such precision.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : If a ketogenic diet is the fastest way to lose fat, why don't I just stay in ketosis all the time, like the Atkins Diet recommends?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Glucagon is a catabolic hormone, and one of its functions is to turn amino acids into glucose. Back in the mid-'70's, I followed the Atkins Diet for my first bodybuilding contest. I got into shape, but I lost too much muscle doing it. Under continual ketosis, the muscle cells will have very little glycogen and fluids in them. Strength will be impaired because the Type II fibers need glucose and glycogen as an ATP substrate. Beyond that, we know that through an unknown mechanism, volume expansion of the muscle cell (from the storage of glycogen, fluids, electrolytes, and various substrates) will cause an anabolic stimulus. So whatever muscle is lost due to the slight catabolic effects during the 5 days of ketosis is put back on during the 48-hour carb-up.<P>
It would be interesting to find out how long a stretch of ketosis can be sustained without muscle loss after a two-day carb-up. In BODYOPUS, the dieter always maintains or increases muscle mass after the 48-hour carb-up following 5 days of ketosis. With trial and error and the use of careful weighing and skin-fold measurements, we could find the upper limit of reversible catabolism. Perhaps a dieter could double the ketosis period to 12 straight days, so the carb-up phase could reestablish initial muscle mass within 2 days. These extra days in ketosis would speed fat loss. But the dieter wouldn't be too happy going without carbs for 12 straight, no-fun days.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : In the Recomposition part of BODYOPUS, you have no recommendations on how much protein to eat at each meal. What gives?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  You're right. I seemed to have slipped up on this point. In Recomposition, I've recommended small meals every 2 hours over the first 24 hours, even waking up every 2 hours at night. Because of the secretion of both insulin and glucagon from protein consumption, more glucose will be deposited as glycogen in the muscles if you eat protein with your carb meals. The extra insulin will clear glucose out of the bloodstream faster, and the glucagon will push glycogen from the liver into the bloodstream as glucose.<P> 
If you're eating all 12 meals over the 24-hour period, simply take your bodyweight in pounds and use this as a guide for the grams of protein you'll need daily. So the typical 200-lb male dieter would need 200 grams of protein, divided into 12 portions of about 17 grams at each meal. Frankly, the one-gram-per-pound estimate is probably overkill, but hardly anybody gets fat from eating extra protein.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I'm trying to follow your BODYOPUS diet, but I can't get past the first step. I can't get into ketosis. I'm eating no carbs whatsoever. I have a glucometer, and it never drops below 70, and the Ketostix never show purple. What am I doing wrong?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  To fill in the other readers who might not know, ketosis is a metabolic state which occurs when the glucose in the blood is so low (below 50 mg/dl) that much of the fatty acids in the bloodstream (either from stored bodyfat or dietary fat) are converted into a derivative called ketones. Ketones <I>can't </I>be stored in the body. And they <I>can't</I> be reconverted to regular fats. We use two guides to see if the body is producing them. Whatever ketones can't be used as fuel are excreted in the urine. You can buy ketone-testing strips at most drugstores. These strips change in color from tan to purplish if unburned ketones are in the urine.<P>
Keep in mind that burned-up ketones will not show up as ketones in the urine. And if you're on a low-calorie diet and are moderately active during the day, most of the ketones will be used as fuel, so it might be that during the day, your Ketostix will remain tan. Usually, though, after waking up, the first urination should show some kind of purple on the Ketostix, as your activity while you're sleeping is negligible, yet your body will still produce ketones.<P>
In BODYOPUS, I recommend a daily protein percentage of 25%. At this level, most dieters will achieve a slight amount of ketosis after 48 hours, sometimes sooner if they use the over-the-counter glucose-disposal agents. But many bodybuilders try to overload the protein requirement, so they don't have to eat as much dietary fat. Bad idea. Many of the amino acids in the protein will convert to glucose. This extra glucose, along with the extra insulin secreted from the dietary protein, will stop glucagon secretion, and ketosis won't happen.<P> 
So if your Ketostix is not turning purple in the early morning, carefully look at all your food choices to be sure you aren't eating any carbohydrates whatsoever. And lower your protein to 25% or below. Actually, if you can tolerate eating virtually no protein and mostly fat (yuck!), you can establish ketosis faster and go deeper into the dark purple range in less than 48 hours. But I've yet to find a valid reason to make the state of ketosis this severe. Most of the BODYOPUS dieters seem to do best staying in the light purple, which is the "trace," range.<P>
 

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I heard about a cool trick that you can use to get into ketosis quicker than in the 48 hours you talk about in the book. I need to learn this trick because a day after I went into ketosis, I blew it and ate some carbs, and it looks like now I'm screwed for the week.<P></B>


<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  The secret to getting into ketosis is to get your blood glucose into the 50 mg/dl range. Normal blood glucose is usually between 80 mg/dl and 120 mg/dl. If you suddenly went from 80 mg to 50 mg, within a few minutes, you'd probably pass out because your brain would be starved for glucose, and the liver wouldn't have enough time to manufacture ketones. This happens when diabetics screw up their insulin injections and use too much. I've seen this happen on a number of occasions because while I was in prison, my training partner was diabetic.<P>
But in very careful moderation, tiny amounts of injectable insulin, usually the fastest-acting Humulin R, will lower blood glucose in a very controlled manner. To do this, you'll need a glucometer to keep tabs on your blood glucose, along with some Ketostix to find out when the ketones start showing up in the urine. You don't need very much insulin, only three IU's at a time. The peak activity of the insulin will happen about two hours after the injection. By using injectable insulin in this way, you should be able to descend into ketosis within eight hours.<P> 
I do know of a few BODYOPUS renegades who stay in ketosis until after the workout, then use a larger amount of insulin to drive a large amount of glucose and amino acids into the muscle and reestablish ketosis after the carb-up. And these bodybuilders do this every workout. Maybe I should change the name from BODYOPUS to DEATH-WISH DIETING.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I bought a glucometer to determine my blood glucose level. I'm on your BODYOPUS diet, and the Ketostix get into the trace range, but the glucometer has never read lower than 70. You said that ketosis starts at 50 mg. Is my glucometer broken?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  All the hand-held glucometers do point out in their instructions that there's a 10% error rate. Glucometers are mostly used by diabetics whose blood sugar is dangerously high, above 200 mg/dl. These types of diabetics would be happy to have the blood sugar stabilized to about 150 mg, give or take 20 mg or so.<P>
Everyone I know who has used a glucometer to get low readings of under 100 mg always complains about false readings. But with the 10% error, a reading of 70 mg technically means you could either have a high of 77 mg or a low of 63 mg.<P> 
This still doesn't explain your Ketostix reading of light purple. But don't knock yourself out trying to lower your blood glucose any further. We've found that as long as you reach the "trace" range on the Ketostix, all the claimed benefits of the cyclic diet will occur, even though your glucometer is telling you something else. <P>
I will mention that the first pinprick of blood used in the glucometer is not as accurate as the second drop squeezed out of the same pinprick site. And let me mention again that protein levels above 25% of your total daily calorie level will increase blood sugar from the extra glucose extracted from the protein.<P>
In most cases, the glucometer is not terribly effective on the BODYOPUS diet plan. I recommend glucometers only to dieters who are going to be experimenting with injectable insulin to hasten ketosis. It can let you know the amount of Humulin R you can tolerate at each injection.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I want to use creatine during BODYOPUS. But I've read that creatine needs insulin to work. What should I do on the no-carb days?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  I'm assuming you've previously done a loading phase of creatine, and now you're wondering about what to do with the upkeep dosage of about ten or so grams each day. I recommend that you not use creatine during the no-carb days, which would be Monday through Friday. You could use a higher amount of creatine over the two-day carb-up, and it would be doubly effective. If you add a small amount of creatine (between two or three grams) to each carb meal, within two days, I'm sure you'll more than replace any creatine lost because you didn't take it for five days. The added bonus is that this very small amount at each meal will not cause gastric upset and won't compete with the protein for transport across the intestinal wall.<P>
If you use creatine during the ketogenic phase, much of it will not get into the muscles, and you'll find that a combination of creatine and MCT oil is a most excellent laxative.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> This is a combination BODYOPUS and general carb-up question. I have Debeone from Mexico (phenformin)—the 25-mg tablets. How much should I use? When I used metformin, I used four 450-mg tablets a day. But I know Debeone is much more potent.<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Yes, we have now discovered that for non-diabetic bodybuilders, the high dosage of 1,800 mg of metformin (Glucophage) a day is effective. The estimates for phenformin have been that it's from five to ten times more potent, on a milligram-per-milligram comparison.<P>
I've found that using one 25-mg tablet 6 times a day, usually before meals, seems to instill a similar pump and vascularity to the 1,800-mg dosage of metformin. This is a total dosage of 150 mg of phenformin, which is near the 10 times greater potency predicted. If you used the time-released 50-mg Debeone capsule available in Mexico, you'd need only 3 capsules a day.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> Before the Recomposition carb-up, you recommended a whole-body depletion workout. Is this really necessary? I've tried it both ways, once with the workout and another time without it, and I seemed to get the same results from the carb-up. Why do you recommend this torture? It's a real bitch of a workout.<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  The research shows that the lower the glycogen levels in the muscles, the better the rebound into glycogen supercompensation. The measurement of glycogen in muscle is in a unit called millimoles (mml). A fully supercompensated bodybuilder can reach a very high 200 mml (per kilogram of muscle). A depleted muscle is any measurement below 75 mml, and I believe the lowest reading recorded in a healthy (endurance) athlete has been 18 mml.<P>
We could assume that after 5 days of ketosis and a few weightlifting workouts, the muscle glycogen is probably at 75 mml or below. So your question is: is the extra depletion necessary before the carb-up? Will a more depleted state pay off by boosting muscle glycogen closer to the ideal 200 mml?<P>
Frankly, I doubt very much that the size and shape of a supercompensated muscle will look all that different at the average 150 mml supercompensation compared to the top-of-the-scale 200 ml. But the real benefit of this supercompensation workout is that it's cell volumizing, triggering a mysterious anabolic stimulus. Since the whole point of a cyclic ketogenic diet is to maintain or increase muscle mass without the usual reliance on anti-catabolic drugs (including steroids), I still recommend the whole-body depletion high-rep workout in BODYOPUS, and I would say the same thing to precontest bodybuilders preparing for the traditional no carb/carb-up phase before a contest. Exhausting the muscle glycogen through exercise will intensify the enzymes that transport glucose and deposit it as glycogen. 
You don't have to make yourself sick during this whole-body workout. Shortening the rest between sets won't make the depletion any more rapid. If you don't give yourself enough time between sets to clear lactic acid out of the bloodstream, your blood pH will become acidic, and you'll throw up.<P> 


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> Your Recomposition Phase is a real pain in the ass. In the Anabolic Diet, DiPasquale tells me to eat just about anything I want—even doughnuts. Why should I bother to wake up every two hours to eat?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  The beauty of eating lots of fatty foods on a ketogenic diet is that you usually won't get fat because ketones can't be stored or reconverted to triglyceride. But during a carb-up over the weekend, you're not in ketosis, and most of the fats you eat along with your carbs have to be used as energy; otherwise they'll be stored as bodyfat. And during the weekend carb-up, you're not working out nor doing any aerobics.<P>
Some dieters can actually eat just about anything they want during the carb-up and still remain just as lean on Monday morning as they were on Friday afternoon, right before carbing up. But I've found that the majority of BODYOPUS dieters who have skin-fold readings taken on Friday afternoons changed for the worse if the dieter pigged out uncontrollably over the weekend. Remember, BODYOPUS is formulated to work like clockwork, so you can predict your fat loss on a weekly basis. If a dieter wanted to achieve a certain bodyfat percentage on a specific date, it wouldn't happen if he pigged out every weekend. Eventually, the dieter would achieve his ideal, but it wouldn't happen on schedule.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I've tried 3 times to start your BODYOPUS diet, but I always gave up and bailed out by eating some carbs within 24 hours. Can anybody follow this thing?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  If you're used to a high-carb, low-fat diet and are used to eating every two hours or so, jumping into a ketogenic diet is pure agony. This is why I discuss three distinct diets in the BODYOPUS book. To lose just a few pounds, a high-carb, low-calorie diet is more than adequate. If you have to diet for a long stretch and have a hard time sticking to the calorie amounts, the Isocaloric Diet is a nicer choice as it quells hunger better. Once you're used to a moderate-fat diet, the next step to the cyclic ketogenic diet is much easier than if you jumped from high carbs to no carbs. Try it a step at a time.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I've been doing the BODYOPUS diet for about seven weeks, and I'm stuck. The fat is coming off very slowly. My resting body temperature is 97°, down over a degree. How can I bring this back up?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  You have a catch-22 situation with BODYOPUS: the less protein and carbs you eat, the better you maintain ketosis. But dietary fat is the least oxidative of the nutrients, so your thyroid output will be impaired faster than in the other mixed-nutrient low-calorie diets. All low-calorie diets will cause thyroid attenuation eventually. In a ketogenic diet, it will happen somewhat faster. You have two choices: either use an oral thyroid medication and reestablish your previous pre-diet resting temperature or simply come off the BODYOPUS diet and eat normally for a few days until your basal body temperature returns to normal. Obviously, the two-day carb-up is not enough time to increase your thyroid levels. Let me know how long it takes to reverse this lowered body temperature. Usually, the T<FONT SIZE=-2>4</FONT>(the inactive) thyroid in the body stays fairly normal. It's the T<FONT SIZE=-2>3</FONT>, the active one, which is impaired. The cause is a lessening of the enzyme that drives the conversion: 5 deiodase. Most of this enzyme is in the liver, and it would be interesting to find out what the exact mechanism of the attenuation is. It might be glucagon or increased cortisol. With the thermogenic agents (especially DNP), the simple temperature elevation in the liver causes the impairment. But obviously, just the opposite is happening on a low-calorie diet.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I'm not gonna follow your BODYOPUS diet, but I want to use your carb-up formula for my next contest. Should I do anything different than what is suggested in the Recomposition chapters?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  In BODYOPUS, after the two-day Recomposition phase, a dieter wants to once again establish ketosis by scavenging the blood glucose until it reaches 50 mg/dl. The liver stores carbs in the form of glycogen, and as blood sugar is lowered, liver glycogen will release its stores as glucose. In a depleted state, when the whole body has very little muscle glycogen, much of the incoming carbohydrates in the form of glucose or starch will be shunted across the liver and into the bloodstream.<P> 
However, fructose, and half of sucrose (which is also part fructose) will be directly deposited as glycogen in the liver. To hasten ketosis after Recomposition, the dieter should deplete the liver of glycogen, so the extra glucose won't be leaked into the bloodstream. But when carbing-up for a bodybuilding show, you don't have to worry about reestablishing ketosis after your show, so an avoidance of fructose and sucrose wouldn't have any benefit. This means you can eat some junk food and some fruits during your carb-up.<P> 
If you aren't going to be using a diuretic, then you might want to track the carb/fluid ratio during your carb-up. The rough guide is that for every gram of carbohydrates you eat, you'll need three or four grams of fluids to store it as glycogen in the muscle. Since the Recomposition formula is a maximal supercompensation, excess fluids over your total 24-hour carbohydrate adjustment (which would be 16 grams of carbs for each pound of lean bodyweight) will spill over into the skin, making you look "smooth." Being this precise is tricky because many carb sources don't list the water content. This is why I recommend rice cakes and maltodextrin powders, as both of these high-glycemic sources have a very low moisture content, and you can drink water in controlled amounts.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>Is there any merit to doing really high-rep sets? I'm talking above 50 reps per set. By the same token, what are your thoughts on the 100-rep method?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>The 100-rep method originated in California in the late '70's. It was designed for bodybuilders who had reached a plateau in their development. The rationale behind it was to "shock" the muscles into new growth. The idea was to complete a set of 100 repetitions for every single exercise. Two to four exercises were done, and the body was trained under a split routine, divided over three or four workouts depending on the recommendations of the training guru prescribing the program. If you were able to complete less than 75 reps on your first effort, you were supposed to lighten the load and then complete the 100 reps. The proponents wanted you to be able to do at least 75 reps on your first effort and be able to complete the remaining 25 reps on your second set.<P>
I know some bodybuilders who have made tremendous gains with high reps, but they're the exception more than the rule. Take, for example, IFBB pro Nimrod King. Nimrod has been known to train his monstrous arms with plenty of sets of 25 to 35 reps. Nonetheless, most trainees would actually lose muscle mass on such a rep/set scheme.<P>
Heavyweight Mr. America, Gary Leonard, told me the story of when he saw Tom Platz full squat 225 lbs for <I>10 minutes straight!</I> Obviously, he had leg development. But Tom was also known to use a variety of rep brackets to stimulate his thigh growth.<P>
In most instances, the only people I've seen make significant gains from this type of training were people born with high levels of slow-twitch fibers and who were using plenty of androgens (you know, the Androgen Andy type who lives on testosterone suspension, Anadrol 50, and Sustanon 250).<P>
For most individuals and in most muscle groups, the weight has to be between 70% to 85% of maximum to cause gains in muscle size. When working with a load for 100 reps, you're most likely working with about 30% of your 1-rep max. Thus, the weight is too low to cause muscle growth through additional protein synthesis.<P>	
However, high-rep training (above the 20-rep mark) may stimulate low-threshold motor units, a.k.a. slow-twitch fibers, to grow. That growth may not come so much from increased protein synthesis as from increased nutrient storage (i.e., glycogen) and increased amounts of enzymes (i.e., glycogen synthetase). Unfortunately, these fibers have much less potential for growth than the fast-twitch fibers.
I think that once in a while, as a change of pace, the 100-rep method can help the mind. But I would not prescribe it as a surefire way to increase muscle size. Most trainees will get their best gains using the 6- to 12-rep range for most muscle groups.<P>
However, a good way to do a high number of reps for a single exercise is to do extended descending sets. In this method, you need a stopwatch or, preferably, someone to time you. Take a weight you can do for 20 reps maximum. Have your partner time you as soon as you start your set. Do the max amount of reps you can do, and have your partner tell you how long it took to complete the set. For example, if you did 20 reps in 70 seconds, you would rest only 70 seconds and then attempt as many reps as possible with the same load. Now, let's say on your second effort you did 16 reps in 56 seconds. You'd rest 56 seconds and again do as many reps as possible. Go on in this fashion until a total of 100 reps on that exercise have been performed. The first time, it may take you 10 sets of equal work/equal rest to complete the 100 reps. The goal is to be able to complete all 100 reps in 4 sets. When you're able to do so, increase the weight by about five percent. Try this for an occasional change of pace and to keep your workouts <I>mentally</I> as well as <I>physically</I> interesting!



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> Why do you recommend cocking the wrist back and down during curls?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>This trick was shown to me by Bill MacDonald of Fresno 13 years ago. Bill had trained a host of Mr. America contestants, including Gary Leonard. He showed this technique to me as we were discussing the effect of tempo on muscle growth. Most people unconsciously initiate the curling action by curling the wrists <I>in</I> for the entire set or when approaching fatigue. This has the effect of reducing the resistance on the arm and improving leverage. However, since some of the load is being taken by the forearm flexors, the burden on the elbow flexors (i.e., the muscles that bend your arm at the elbow—primarily the biceps muscles) diminishes.<P>
The rationale is that you prevent the use of the forearms during curls by extending the wrists down and back, and the positive consequence is that you increase the overload on the elbow flexors, which is what you really want when you do curling exercises.<P>
Your next question may be—doesn't that increase the stress on the wrists? No. In the last 13 years, none of the trainees or seminar attendees whom I've shared this tip with have ever reported wrist pain or forearm strain from it. However, you should extend the wrists down and back only in supinated (palms-up) curls. When doing reverse curls or hammer-style curls, the wrists should stay in a neutral position.
Another advantage of this style of curling is that you can extend the duration of the set simply by cocking in the wrist during the concentric action, and then lower the weight with the wrist extended down. Since you're about 15%-20% stronger with the wrist in than with it down, it'll be like having a partner apply enough pressure for a forced rep.<P>
Don't worry if your curling poundages go down. The levels of growth in your elbow flexors will overcompensate largely for the decrease in weight. Also, it's been my experience that you should be able to handle your previous weights in the new style of curling in no time.<P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>I've been taught to work one body part at a time, but it seems to make sense to me to work body parts in tandem, working, say, biceps for one exercise, then moving to triceps, and then back to biceps. What do you think? </B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>You're right. Yet, most people prefer to do standard sets in the old "I go, you go" approach. Alternating opposing muscle groups in the way you suggest is probably the most efficient way to train for the following reasons: <P>
1. 	You don't fatigue as fast. If you use the "agonist-antagonist" (e.g., bi's and tri's) alternating system, you'll drop only one rep per set (or two percent in weight) at most with each successive set. In contrast, if you use the standard set approach, you'll lose about two reps per set (or four percent of the weight). The exact physiological mechanism is yet to be determined, but one thing we know for sure is that it has a neural basis. Studies have shown that when you activate the agonists during a set, the antagonists later contract more strongly than if you had not done the agonist set first. That is why a lot of world records in the bench press are broken following a heavy set of bent-over rows performed in the warm-up room.<P>
2. 	You can double your workload within a given time frame. Let's say you want to do heavy chins for five reps per set. You know from my previous articles that if you want complete recovery between sets, you'll need to rest four to five minutes between sets. You also know that once your warm-up is over, working out longer than an hour can be very counterproductive. If it takes you 30 seconds to perform each set, you rest 5 minutes between, and you do 5 sets, almost half an hour will have gone by just doing your chins, right? But if, instead of resting 5 minutes between sets, you did 5 weighted dips after a 2.5-minute rest, then rested 2.5 minutes and went back to chins until all sets were done, you would have done twice the number of work sets within the same time period. And because of the rationale discussed in point 1, you wouldn't fatigue as quickly on your chins, thus the workload would be greater.<P>

The other benefit of the agonist-antagonist alternating principle is that it prevents injuries by ensuring that both sides of the joint receive an equal workload. In other words, you'll escape the "train-only-what-you-can-see-in-the-mirror" syndrome.<P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> How valuable are pull-ups and chin-ups in working your back? Aren't pulldowns just as good?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Chin-ups along with variations of the rowing movement make up the cornerstone of upper-back training. If you look outside of bodybuilding, the athletes with the best back development are kayakers and gymnasts. Why? Because their conditioning programs are centered around the chin-up and its variations. By the way, to make sure we're all speaking the same language, the difference between a chin-up and a pull-up is the grip. The chin-ups are done with a supinated grip; in other words, the palms are facing you. Pull-ups are done with the pronated grip; that is, the knuckles are facing you. Both are far superior to pulldowns for upper-back development for the following reasons:<P>
1.	Chin-ups or pull-ups involve more motor units than pulldowns. For any given number of reps, a chin-up will always create more demand on the motor-unit pool. Why? Because in a chin-up, you have to move around a fixed object; in pulldowns, you move a free-moving object around you. In chin-ups, you cannot use the lower back to move the load; thus, the overload on the back and upper-arm muscles is ensured.<P>
2. 	The strength gains in chin-ups and pull-ups are functional. When you improve your chin-ups, you improve your ability to do certain real-life tasks, such as climbing over a fence (which is what you may have to do after you get caught using your new-found pull-up strength to pull yourself up to peek in a window). This is one of the reasons pull-ups are preferred over pulldowns to test the functional strength of police recruits, SWAT, and Special Forces types of candidates.<P>
3.	The strength gains in chin-ups and pull-ups are transferable. If you're good at chins, you'll be good at pulldowns, too. But not vice versa. I've seen a lot of lat pulldown artists who couldn't chin to save their lives.<P> 



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> What do you think of "cheat reps"?</B> 

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>I'm adamant about proper form. Here are certain things I'd rather not see in the gym:<P>
1.	Using weights to impress other people, instead of weights to accomplish an effective overload of the muscle groups.<P>
2.	Rolling the shoulders back when doing shrugs.<P>
3.	Driving the weights with the legs when doing upright rows.<P>
4.	Spotting on the first rep of a set.<P>
5.	Spotting the eccentric portion of the lift.<P>
6.	Spotting 46% of the load during the concentric rep and hearing the geek say, "Hey man, I barely touched the bar!"<P>
7.	A guy doing the eccentric portion of the bench in 4 nanoseconds and then using the recoil force in his sunken chest to contribute 17% of the concentric force. The same guy complains that his bench hasn't gone up in three years.<P>
8.	Guys reading the sports page while doing concentration curls.<P>
9.	People carrying on a conversation during a set.<P>
10.	Guys doing alternate dumbbell curls in a form that resembles a penguin having an epileptic seizure.<P>
11.	Guys who complain they can't gain weight when they're vegetarians who do only cable curls and kickbacks.<P>
12.	Overtrained aeroba-heads who strut around like they have great bodies but actually have the limbs of Auschwitz victims and love handles reminiscent of Rush Limbaugh's.<P>
All right, so not all of them had to do with form. But I have to release my tensions somehow, don't I?

Dear Friend,<P>
Jerry Meredith of Ann Arbor, Michigan, thinks my articles just plain suck. On the other hand, Grant Tonkin of Littleton, Colorado, likes my question and answer column. He doesn't like Dan Duchaine's "Rant," though-thinks it belongs in the gutter. However, Dan's "Rant" is the first thing Mike Sedgeway of Costa Mesa, California, reads when his copy of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> finds its way to his door. Still, Mike could do with fewer articles about EAS supplements. Of course, Josh Harpster of Jamaica, New York, makes all of his decisions about what supplements to buy based on the scientific articles in <I>MM2K</I>-he thinks the magazine is perfect "as is."<P>
Editorially, Bill and I spend a lot of time trying to figure out what exactly subscribers and newsstand readers want to see. (Interestingly enough, based on our reader surveys, even those two groups have different opinions on what they like and don't 
like.) A good number of readers ask for more drug information, while an equal number of readers want to see <I>less</I>. The thing is, if we got rid of all the drug articles, we'd be, in effect, sweeping an important bodybuilding issue under the rug and pretending it didn't exist. That's what the bodybuilding-mag world was like <I>before MM2K</I> showed its sunny face. What's more, we'd only be read by choirboy types who probably took vows of celibacy years ago. On the other hand, if we published nothing but drug articles, we'd only be read by guys with sloped foreheads who just learned to walk erect this morning. Practically every topic and every area addressed in <I>MM2K</I> elicits widely varying opinions.<P>
Achieving editorial balance is extremely important, but it's also extremely difficult. It's like trying to squat 500 lbs while wearing roller blades and, at the same time, trying <I>not</I> to watch Monica Brant out of the corner of your eye while she's licking a cherry Popsicle with long strokes of her tongue... using the other hand to sensually rub suntan oil on her thong-bikini-clad, sun-kissed bee-hind... the waves lapping at her feet as she turns towards you and gives you a sultry "come-hither" look... oh, sorry, I got carried away for a minute. You get the idea-it's not an easy thing.<P>
Anyhow, that's why we have different types of writers-to achieve some sort of "editorial balance." Dan Duchaine is generally the hardcore drug guy, while Michael Mooney is the medical drug guru. Keith Klein and Will Brink are nutrition writers, while Joey Antonio and Anthony Almada are hard-science dudes, noses in test tubes, who only come up for air and to write articles for <I>MM2K</I>. Charles Poliquin and Shawn Phillips are primarily strength and training honchos, while big-daddy Bill Phillips is comfortable in all disciplines. And me? I occasionally come up with a good article, but even a <I>blind</I> stunt pilot lands a plane safely once in a while.<P>
Let me tell you what our attempts at interpreting all these mixed messages almost forced us to do. Back in 1994, we thought breifly about trying to go a little more "mainstream." After all, mainstream means lots of readers. Mainstream is where <I>Muscle & Fitness</I> lives. Moms and Pops even look at <I>Muscle & Fitness </I>while they're standing in line at the grocery store waiting to pay for a week's supply of Charmin toilet paper and bacon bits. Pop wants to look at the babes, and mom wants to know how to flatten her tummy.<P>
Luckily, like Arnold's police horse in <I>True Lies</I>, we put the brakes on that decision before we toppled off the roof of the editorial Marriott and landed on our keesters. We decided that it was wrong to try to make the whole world happy. It was wrong to go against our nature. If your heart isn't in it-if you sell out-it'll show in your work, and it'll come back to bite you on the ass. I mean, can you see Bill Phillips writing an article about "how to be more sensitive in bed" or some similar sort of drivel? I don't think so. Instead, we decided to continue to cater to the guys who had read us from day one, the hardcore guys. It's like the old saying, "<I>You dance with who brung ya to the ball.</I>"<P>
We'll never be like <I>Muscle & Fitness</I> or <I>Sports Illustrated</I> or even some jag-off magazine like <I>Penthouse</I>. We write about things that are of interest to a <I>very select</I> group of people on this earth-those people who are interested in changing the shape of their bodies, through diet, exercise, supplements, and sometimes even drugs. Our readers are people who are passionate about it and who are willing to work for it.<P>
Likewise, we don't want to turn into one of those soft, limp-wristed fitness mags. Most of the guys who read those mags don't even work out-they just think chicks (or dudes) will think they're in shape if they come over and see those mags strewn across the coffee table.<P>
Still, I gotta admit, it makes my blood boil when the local newspaper quotes <I>Fitness for Men</I> or some similarly named publication: "According to an article in <I>Fitness for Men</I>, building muscle can help old people feel more energetic." <I>Arrggghhh!</I> Somebody kill me! Help me take the dirt nap! Roll up that copy of <I>Fitness for Men</I>, shove it where the sun don't shine, fill it full of gunpowder, and strike a match. Hopefully, my charred, jet-propelled carcass will land smack dab in the middle of a manure pile. I think to myself that the pudknocker who reads <I>Fitness for Men</I> could learn as much about working out from one copy of <I>MM2K</I> as he could in a lifetime of reading his limp-wristed fitness publication! I get a little jealous about all the publicity those mags get from the general public. I sometimes wonder why the press doesn't quote us.<P>
Truth is, <I>MM2K</I> intimidates a lot of ordinary people. But, what the hell. We can't worry about the general public, and we can't make everybody happy. Bodybuilders have always been kind of an underground, secret rat-pack group that lives, breathes, and travels to the beat of a different drummer. That's you, folks, and that's who this magazine is for. If we're true to you, we'll be rewarded. Heck, we already have been. But even in our significant but small-by-global-standards fraternity of readers, we get differing viewpoints on what is or isn't a good article. When we get a number of letters telling us that <I>so and so blows</I> or that reading a particular article was equivalent to accidentally brushing your teeth with grandpa's scrotal cleansing cream and then get an equal number of letters telling us it was the best darned article they ever read... well, it gets confusing.<P> 
The point is, even in the closest family, opinions differ. Although 99% of the articles in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> are more or less related in subject matter, not everything is of interest to every reader. Obviously, some fresh-faced, hormonally charged 18-year-old bodybuilder isn't going to be overly worried about taking saw palmetto for his prostate. Likewise, some 40-year-old reader who's trying to fight off the devastating effects of some wasting disease isn't necessarily going to be interested in a diet that tells him how to get down to 5% bodyfat. And, for some reason, some readers just aren't interested in Dan Duchaine's stories about penis size or flatulence. <I>Go figure!</I><P>
Here's how we decide if an article is good enough to go into <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>: I get an article that I think is good. I give it to Bill. Bill either writes - using big, industrial-strength pencils - "This kind of blows, doesn't it?" on the top of the page, or he might write, politely, "It's not <I>entirely </I>repugnant." Then again, sometimes the big lug is really excited about an article. Nevertheless, we put aside our individual likes and dislikes and ask ourselves whether or not a significant percentage of readers would like the article. Once in awhile, we're right on. Other times, we're as far off the mark as actor/alcoholic Robert Downey, Jr. when he staggers home drunk into the wrong house. Of course, once in a while, we get an article in that everybody seems to like. When that happens, the angels sing, the birdies alight on our outstretched hands, the bunny rabbits prance around our legs, and we dance on tippie toes until the wee hours of the morning. Either that or we break open a six-pack and say, "Fuggin-A, bubba, good article." You get the picture.<P>
Of course, most of the time, an article falls right in between or maybe leans slightly to the positive side, away from the <I>sucks </I>side. It all comes down to the fact that magazines contain diverse information. A book, however, may be about one subject aimed at one particular interest group, but magazines, by their very nature, have to tackle a large number of issues. Hopefully, at least some of those articles on some of those issues appeal to all of our readers - that's what makes a successful magazine. Ultimately, it's our responsibility to provide information to all kinds of bodybuilders.<P> 
We appreciate any and all input, regardless of whether it's complimentary or scathing. Constructive criticism helps us tailor the magazine to meet your bodybuilding needs. Please keep in mind that we're looking for trends, though. For instance, if enough people think my articles suck, I'll soon be writing seafood recipes for the back page of my condo's newsletter. If, on the other hand, only a few people think I suck, then I urge those readers to just skip my articles and look for the things you do enjoy or that pertain more to your individual brand of bodybuilding. The same thing applies to the work of any writer or any particular article in <I>MM2K</I>.<P>
The bottom line is that we're absolutely, totally, and completely determined to provide you with the best damn bodybuilding magazine there ever was! A magazine that is informative, helpful, relevant, renegade, sometimes naughty, sometimes nice, but always brutally honest, straightforward, and hardcore! We don't please all the people all the time, but <B>if</B> that's what we tried to do, we wouldn't be "<I>MM2K</I>." We'd be more like some other muscle magazines... ya see?<P>
However, I think there's enough information in each and every issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> to satisfy any serious bodybuilder, and this issue is certainly no exception. If you enjoy reading about late-breaking anabolic drug developments that haven't been reported <B>anywhere</B>, take a look at our new feature entitled "Notes from the Underground" (page 108). The information it contains will soon be the topic of water-cooler discussions at gyms everywhere.<P>
If you're interested in drugs but lean more towards non-controlled bodybuilding stuff like Nolvadex, Proscar, nootropics, or any of the other non-steroidal pharmaceuticals we talk about in the pages of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, read our feature story on the overseas drug mail-order business (page 82). If you've ever wanted to get your hands on some drug that's considered to be largely harmless but don't want to contend with finding a doctor who's sympathetic to your needs who'll write a script, look no further than this article. We've uncovered the "low-down" on how people can order just about any non-controlled drug you can think of, legally, with virtually no hassle! The information in this article could change your life!<P>
There's plenty of ground-breaking nutrition and training info in this copy of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, too. Ever wonder what the hell the "homeopathic" bodybuilding supplements you see advertised are all about? Take a look at our investigative report on page 148. You'll be amazed at what some companies are getting away with. Likewise, how'd you like to be able to boost your energy levels without taking supplements... through plain old, ordinary foods? "Power Foods" (page 62) will show you how to stay energized all day long. Not one to be left out of releasing ground-breaking nutrition information, <I>MM2K</I> contributor Michael Mooney tells you how eating an everyday food that's found in just about every kitchen cupboard in America can help you heal broken-down bodybuilding joints (page 92).<P>
And, since no great issue of <I>MM2K</I> is complete without hardcore training info, read "Ab Training from Mars" (page 140) and "How to Build Awesome, 3-D Thighs in Record Time," the latter written by world-class strength guru Charles Poliquin. The tips you get from these two articles alone will propel your ab and thigh training through the roof! You'll be beggin' us to publish similar articles on other body parts so they can catch up!<P>
This issue, in my humble opinion, is so exciting, so damn good, that I could go on and on. From Bill Phillips' habitually great "Uncensored Q&A" (page 30) to the very last page, this is one exciting issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. <P>
But don't just take my word for it... turn the page, start reading, and see for yourself!<P>
Best Regards,<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I've seen some Parabolan going around the gyms up here in New York. I heard they stopped making Parabolan-does that mean all of this stuff is counterfeit?<P></B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>I have checked with Laboratoires Negma, the French drug company that makes Parabolan, and confirmed that they do indeed still make this stuff. I also recently reviewed a test from an analytical laboratory in San Diego, conducted on August 12, 1996, which showed that a sample ampoule of a product labeled as Parabolan, lot 44, with an expiration date of Dec. 96, contained the anabolic steroid trenbolone cyclohexylmethylcarbonate, which is Parabolan.
So, this test confirms that at least some of this stuff going around is legit.
Of course, it's impossible for me to say whether or not what you've seen at your gym is real, but it's certainly possible. 
By the way, Parabolan is one powerful anabolic!<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>The manager of the health-food store where I buy supplements told me there's a new "micronized" version of DHEA available. Should I be using that instead of regular DHEA?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Micronized means the DHEA has been processed into small particles which allow it to be absorbed directly from the intestinal tract into the lymphatic system, thus bypassing the liver. Metabolism of DHEA in the liver normally converts DHEA into DHEA sulfate and also metabolizes it into androgens (such as testosterone). Thus, micro-nized DHEA might be better for women who want to avoid the excessive androgenic effects of DHEA, but it's not a better choice for bodybuilders who are using this compound in hopes of increasing testosterone levels and accelerating muscle growth.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>The company I work for has a corporate "wellness center," and there's a nutritionist who works there. I was talking to her about various supplements I use. She did something called a "hair analysis" for me, where she cut a few strands of my hair, apparently took them somewhere, analyzed them, and a couple of days later, she told me she could tell from analyzing my hair that I had no nutrient deficiencies; therefore, I'm wasting my money on supplements. She said unless there's a deficiency, there's no need to use a supplement. Is it possible I could be getting all the nutrients I need just from my diet? I do try to eat right.
</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Alrighty then... hair analysis, huh? I 
didn't know anyone was still using that-what we do in our studies is have a Ugandan witch doctor come in, take pieces of your clothing and other personal property, and make a voodoo doll which captures your spirit. From there, we can study just about anything-typically we put the voodoo dolls on a Ouija Board, and if they gravitate northward, we know we're looking at Vitamin B deficiencies, and if they gravitate in a southeasterly direction, it's obvious the body has a deficiency in glucose metabolism, and so on. It's really high-tech stuff!<P>
Seriously, the nutritionist to whom you have paid a visit probably has good intentions, but... she's an idiot. Hair analysis is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a sound, scientific way to evaluate nutrient deficiencies. Even if it were, it doesn't mean you couldn't benefit from using supplements. Let me explain-dietary supplements that are efficacious (effective) work by two general "modes of action." First, there is a metabolic basis for dietary supplementation (which means you can benefit from it) if it provides a nutrient that is normally "undersupplied" to cells or, second, if it exerts a pharmacological effect on cellular processes.<P> 
In the first case, a nutrient is required by the body, and a specific concentration of this nutrient results in optimal cell function. For a supplement to exert a positive effect under this scenario, normal availability of the supplied nutrient must be sub-optimal. (Sub-optimal is not the same as "deficient.") Let's look at the nutrient creatine for example-very few athletes have what doctors would classify as a creatine deficiency, but scientific studies have shown that there is a big difference between "normal levels" and "optimal levels." Typically, you don't provide the optimal level of the nutrient creatine through your diet for it to exert maximum effects on size, muscle strength, and endurance. In this case, consuming "extra" amounts of creatine, by using a supplement, optimizes your muscle's natural ability to perform.<P>
In the second case, a dietary supplement can exert a positive metabolic effect if it contains a constituent which is normally not required by the cell but is capable of altering normal cell function. For example, the herb ephedra is metabolized into the drug ephedrine, which alters cardiac muscle function and increases the metabolic rate.<P> 
The whole concept that supplementation is merely about making up for clinical vitamin/nutrient deficiencies and whatnot is so "old school" it's ridiculous. The realities of modern-day supplementation (and not just bodybuilding supplementation) are centered on a whole different philosophy-one that is based on sound, scientific theories I would liken to the study of medicine.  It's an absolute, 100% valid, scientific fact that supplementing the diet with extra amounts of certain nutrients produces effects which cannot be achieved with even the most "perfect" or "balanced" diet.<P>
Now, if you ever want to try that voodoo-doll test, let me know...<P> 

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I once read that antibiotics like cepha-lexin kill the effects of anabolic steroids. Is there any truth to this, or is it just a rumor?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>The normal bacteria present in the intestines (the kind that doesn't make us ill but actually helps us stay healthy) produce enzymes that the liver uses to circulate steroids throughout the body. If these enzymes are not present due to a lack of intestinal bacteria (caused by cephalexin or another antibiotic), then the steroids that pass through the liver may be broken down completely and rendered useless. So it's possible that using antibiotics could reduce the effects of exogenous (from a source outside the body) anabolic steroids, especially oral anabolic steroids since they enter the liver first, before they get into the bloodstream. 
This can be a problem for some steroid users because they get bad acne on a cycle and often treat it with antibiotics. A solution might be to use injectable rather than oral anabolics if acne becomes a problem and the use of antibiotics is necessary.

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I'm very confused about how often I should train. I know some guys get good results training each body part only once a week; others work out three times a week. I've tried working each body part once every seven days, and I just don't seem to gain strength as fast as if I train more often, and my muscles just don't stay "pumped up." Sometimes I train only after soreness goes away. What causes soreness? How often do you think I should train?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>There's a great deal of confusion on this topic, but here are some things I think you can accept as fundamental truths about training frequency: first of all, how often you can train a muscle depends a lot on how hard you train it and how you work out. For example, if you don't do a lot of eccentrics (negatives) in your workouts, then you won't have the same level of muscle damage from each workout, and therefore, you can train each body part more often than once a week. On the other hand, if you do a lot of eccentric reps which cause a high level of "disruption" to muscle fibers, then you'll need more recovery time.<P>
If you're training primarily to gain strength and not muscle size, I would suggest that you use mostly concentric (positive) reps and train each major strength move, like the bench and squat, every three or four days.<P>
On the other hand, if you're training primarily to increase mass, I think your best bet is to train each body part once every five or seven days with very intense concentric and eccentric reps.<P>
Studies have shown that following a heavy bout of eccentric exercise, a number of dramatic changes take place in muscle tissue. One of the things that happens immediately after exercise is that your muscles get swollen-they get pumped up. Approximately six hours later, that pump goes away completely, but it's very interesting to note that scientists have determined that over the next three days, the muscles will once again "swell" as a result of that heavy, eccentric workout (by as much as 10%!). That swelling can even persist for several days after the soreness goes away.<P>
Another thing that happens following an intense eccentric exercise session is that the muscles exhibit a dramatic loss of strength. For example, if you did a heavy eccentric workout for your chest today, tomorrow you would probably have 35% less strength in the chest muscles, and it could easily be a week before your strength got back up to normal, much less "greater than normal."
You can gauge the damage inflicted during a workout fairly accurately by how sore you get. This soreness is not necessarily caused by the swelling, or "pump," you get in your muscles. After all, a pump is usually not associated with a feeling of soreness but rather just a nice "tight" feeling.<P>
Soreness is caused by chemicals that are released when muscle structure is damaged. Once muscle soreness is gone, it's okay to train the muscle again.<P>
Scientists aren't exactly sure what causes the swelling that persists for over a week after an eccentric workout, but this is definitely one reason we like to train-to keep our muscles looking full and tight, instead of "flat."<P>
The bottom line is that if you're doing very heavy eccentric exercises and really getting sore, train each body part only once every five to seven days. On the other hand, if you're not really stressing the negative portion of your exercises and are focusing on building strength, such as trying to get your bench press up by 50 lbs, then it's okay to train more often; in fact, this is probably a better way to gain strength rapidly.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I read some interesting information about a supplement called pregnenolone. The information I reviewed indicated that using this supplement might help boost testosterone levels and cause greater muscle growth. Do you think it would be a good idea to try supplementing pregnenolone?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Okay, let's start at the beginning... pregnenolone is a natural hormone which is a direct oxidation product of cholesterol with a formula closely related to that of the catabolic hormone cortisone. Technically, it's a steroid hormone, but remember, that includes any chemical with four carbon-ring structures attached to each other. Cortisol, DHEA, testosterone, pregnenolone, progesterone, and estrogen are all "steroid hormones" that chemically look similar to each other. Structurally, they differ only in small ways; however, even tiny changes in the chemical makeup of a substance can make an enormous difference in how it functions and what role it plays in the chemical factories of our bodies.<P>
For instance, testosterone, the "muscle-building hormone," is only slightly different from estrogen, the female hormone. Yet that slight difference causes men to grow masculine, strong bodies with facial hair and other secondary male sexual characteristics, and it causes women to develop breasts and have other feminine characteristics.<P>
So, just because something is technically classified as a "steroid" does not mean it's an anabolic steroid-the kind that builds muscle.<P>
It's true that pregnenolone is one of a few hormones that acts as a precursor to other hormones. It can convert to DHEA which can then be converted to testosterone, but pregnenolone can also be converted to progesterone (a female hormone) quite easily, and it can also end up turning into cortisol (a catabolic steroid) or aldosterone (a hormone that causes water retention).
Whether pregnenolone ends up as cortisol, estrogen, or testosterone is basically governed by the pituitary gland which coordinates the many hormones in our bodies.<P>
The pituitary gland works through very sensitive feedback loops. When the production of hormones by the adrenals or testes is too high, it sends signals to reduce production. When amounts of adrenal hormones or androgens are too low, a normal-functioning pituitary gland would again send signals, this time to stimulate further production of hormones.<P>
This is very complicated, but suffice it to say, just because you might be taking a precursor to a hormone like testosterone does not mean your body will simply convert it to testosterone just because that's what you want it to do.<P>
I'm not convinced that pregnenolone would do anything to help a bodybuilder gain more muscle size and strength. I think it's probably more likely that using pregnenolone might have just the opposite effect.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I read a newspaper article recently that said last year there was a 41% increase in prescriptions for anabolic steroids and testosterone. Are some doctors prescribing steroids to bodybuilders and other athletes? My doctor said he won't even discuss it. Do I just have a conservative physician? I told him I want to bench press 400 lbs and need testosterone.</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>There are definitely not many (if any) doctors who will prescribe anabolic steroids or testosterone (they're really the same thing) to athletes who just want to gain muscle size and strength.
However, the information you read in the newspaper about there being a dramatic increase in the amount of anabolic steroids and testosterone being prescribed for "legitimate" purposes is definitely accurate.<P>
There are basically two reasons for this-the first is that doctors are recognizing testosterone replacement therapy as a legitimate use of androgens. Estrogen replacement therapy has been a widely accepted medical practice for many years, and it appears that before too long, the fact that men go through "andropause" (a dramatic mid-life reduction in hormone output) will be widely accepted, too.<P>
I think a lot of doctors are getting over their fear of androgens. The recent New England Journal of Medicine article on the apparent safety and efficacy of these drugs (which I reported on in the last issue of <I>MM2K</I>) is sure to convince even more doctors that these medications are not the "killer drugs" the media made them out to be several years ago with all their hype and sensationalism. (Certainly, anabolic steroids are not harmless if they are abused, and this is something I've always contended and will always try to emphasize.)<P>
I think a lot of "bodybuilders" are convincing doctors that their testosterone levels are low, hence, they "qualify" for testosterone replacement therapy. Some doctors will prescribe testosterone for men with low-normal levels of testosterone, even if they're in their 20's. This is a "roundabout" way of getting legal, medically supervised steroid therapy. (I suppose it's true that out of the hundreds of thousands of guys who "bodybuild," there are a significant number who just don't have high enough levels of testosterone to respond optimally, even when the training stimulus and the nutrition program are perfectly controlled.)<P>
The second reason for an increase in testosterone/anabolic steroid prescriptions by doctors relates to the use of these medications to help AIDS patients and others who are suffering from "wasting diseases," such as cancer. One steroid, Oxandrin, has actually been approved by the FDA for promoting weight gain in "underweight" people.<P>
I think this trend will continue-more and more doctors will be prescribing anabolic steroids for one reason or another, but don't expect a physician to prescribe these drugs simply to increase your bench press-you're going to have to get more creative than that!<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I've read and enjoyed your commentaries and perspective on how bodybuilding could and should be changed for the better by modifying the judging criteria and promoting more realistic "muscle stars" in the magazine. I've never liked the grotesquely freaky bodybuilders who win most of today's top shows-they don't inspire me. As a fanatical but noncompetitive bodybuilder, I want to let you know I'll do anything I can to help support your "cause." I was just wondering, have any of the other people in the industry begun to "see the light" as a result of your interesting and thought-provoking articles on the subject?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Thank you very much for your positive feedback and support. I'm delighted to report that there are some exciting things happening in the "inner circles" of the sport that I think will yield significant changes in bodybuilding in the not-too-distant future.<P>
This reform is certainly not all due to my articles and ideas-others in the industry are pushing for reform, too, but I think my ideas have merit and could be effective.<P>
Here's one interesting development-ESPN's show called American Muscle Magazine, which is a pretty neat bodybuilding TV program, is changing its format-they're going to "tone down" their exposure of 'roided-out bodybuilding stars and are going to start focusing more, in their feature segments and in their contest coverage, on guys who don't look like they're bloated to the gills on every bodybuilding drug under the sun.<P> 
With the growing climate of disdain surrounding the abuse of anabolic steroids and other bodybuilding drugs, they have agreed with my stance that it's no longer prudent to continue publicizing events where bodybuilders are basically "forced" to abuse drugs to look like they even belong on stage with the other competitors. Starting in 1997 (which is just around the corner), American Muscle Magazine will cover only drug-tested contests and will be dropping much of the contest coverage they have regularly featured in prior years. I think this is a change for the better and an important move forward.<P>
Some of the magazines are beginning to feature more "realistic bodies," too. Ironman magazine is certainly doing this and so is Muscular Development (a little bit). I think that's good.<P>
It's so important for people like you, who read magazines like <I>MM2K</I>, to know that it's okay if you can't build 20-inch biceps-you can still be a successful bodybuilder in your own right and have self-respect, health, and admiration from others! Even if you weigh only 175 lbs, you can still have an outstanding-looking physique-one with great shape, symmetry, and muscle definition.
My plans to continue the effort to reform bodybuilding, reduce drug abuse, and make more lifters proud to call themselves "bodybuilders" include several "action items."<P>
First, we're going to continue to give drug-free bodybuilders recognition in the magazine. For example, on this issue's cover, you'll see a kid named Bill Davey. This guy is 100% drug free-he's passed numerous steroid tests at contests over the past few years, and we even had an independent lab run tests on him ourselves before we put him on the cover and gave him our "100% drug-free seal of approval."<P>
We want to show that you can build a great-looking body (maybe not 250 lbs of rock-hard mass with 2% or 3% bodyfat but a great-looking, muscular, strong body nonetheless) through proper nutrition, exercise, and supplementation.<P>
In addition, we're going to continue to sign up drug-free spokespersons to endorse <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> and EAS supplements. So far, through our spokesperson challenge, we've signed up 6 endorsers, given away 6 Corvettes (one of the "perks" of being a spokesperson), and signed six $50,000-endorsement contracts.<P>
As far as drug testing goes, as I've explained in prior issues, that could be part of the solution, but by itself, it would only create a bigger problem. If we don't start encouraging more people to emulate physiques that can be obtained without abusing bodybuilding drugs and without changing the judging criteria of competitive bodybuilding contests, drug testing is not going to help that much. But, if TV shows like ESPN's American Muscle Magazine and magazines like <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, Ironman, and Muscular Development promote more realistic physique role models, then I think we'll start to make an impact on the core of the problem.<P> 
After this, drug testing would be an important step and would be like setting a "speed limit." You see, when you set a speed limit, you know people are going to exceed that mark. But, if you don't even set a limit, people are going to push it as far as they can. I think competitive bodybuilding now is somewhat analogous to the Autobahn-it's just too tempting to see how far you can push it, and before you know it, you've gotten yourself in over your head.<P>
If you drug test, it's like setting a ceiling-a limit. Provided other things are taken into consideration, like I mentioned above, drug testing will limit the abuse of bodybuilding pharmaceuticals. It will not eliminate their use. But, it's very likely that testing for steroids, Lasix, clenbuterol, etc. would help the situation.<P>
TwinLab/Muscular Development announced in recent issues of their magazine that they're going to withdraw all support of the IFBB next year. (They were a major sponsor of the IFBB's pro bodybuilding contests in prior years.) And they've encouraged other people to do the same.<P> 
Going back to what I said a couple of issues ago about wanting to be part of the solution, not simply someone who just points out the problem and leaves it up to someone else to take care of, what I would like to do is make sponsorship moneys available to the IFBB for major bodybuilding shows like the Arnold Classic and the Mr. Olympia but insist that the money be used for drug testing. Also, I'll offer whatever assistance I can provide in terms of how to set up this drug-testing program to make it as legitimate as possible. (As you might imagine, I have a great deal of information about what drugs are being abused by bodybuilders.)
I'll pitch in $25,000 for both the Arnold Classic and the Mr. Olympia ($50,000 total) to help get this program started.
If just a couple of other companies did the same-stepped up to the plate and decided to be part of the solution instead of just pointing fingers, then I think we could really get somewhere.<P>
If we can get these things started, then I'd like to spearhead a public-relations campaign to improve the overall image of bodybuilding and bodybuilders. I don't know whether many of you have noticed, but I'm a pretty good promoter/marketer, and if I believed that bodybuilding were headed in the right direction and I really thought it stood for what it should stand for (health, pride, physical perfection, etc.), I could do one helluva job selling bodybuilding to the general public.<P> 
I'd get the "bodybuilding stars" involved in all types of "positive-image" activities. For example, if bodybuilding "got it together," the physique stars could and should be looked at as quality role models-as heroes.<P>
Literally hundreds of bodybuilders, whether they're the middleweight winner of the Mr. Houston contest or Mr. America, should be involved in programs such as Arnold Schwarzenegger's Inner-City Games, which encourages kids to get involved in sports (like bodybuilding, which helps teach discipline, commitment, and responsibility) instead of running the streets, hanging out in gangs, etc.
Bodybuilders should also be involved in charity work, such as the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and they should be "seen" on the sidelines at major sporting events, in the "inner circles" of Hollywood parties, movie premieres, etc. Things like this would help build the "celebrity status" and "respectability" of bodybuilding for the general public.<P>
Think about this-Arnold Schwarzenegger is a major player in the Planet Hollywood restaurant chain, but you know what? I've never seen any of his Arnold Classic bodybuilding champions hanging out at any of these grand openings-and I've been to quite a few of them. You know why? Because Arnold himself is probably embarrassed by what bodybuilding is/has become! If things took a turn for the better, I'm sure Arnold could be convinced to help promote these guys-have them speak at Planet Hollywood openings, sign autographs, make cameo appearances in movies, etc. These are the types of things that bring new people into our sport/activity (whatever it is).<P>
Then, if we can get these types of things going (which I'm confident we can if we get even a little support from certain people), you're going to see a whole new growth phase in bodybuilding-more guys competing, more respectability, more magazine readers (good for me-huh?!), etc.<P>
Hopefully, we can find some "champions" who have more than just massive, muscular bodies-we need to find some guys with charisma, which is what Arnold has!<P>
To wrap it up, there have been some exciting changes in bodybuilding over the past few months, and I think things are headed in the right direction. I continue to come up with ideas and act on them, and I think in the not-too-distant future, people will be proud to call themselves "bodybuilders," and literally tens of thousands of people will be "joining our ranks" every month. (It is possible!) 
I'll keep you posted on the progress or lack thereof.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I'm 37 years old. I'm the Chief Financial Officer of a Fortune 500 company. I've been fortunate enough and have worked hard enough to achieve a relatively high level of success in my field, and I'm excited about that, but I'm not excited about the way I look. I've dabbled in bodybuilding since I was a boy, but it's getting harder and harder to stay in shape. I respect the fact that you're a successful businessman and have somehow found a way to balance that with your goals as a bodybuilder. What can I do to get my sagging muscles back in shape, so I don't end up looking like all the other frumpy, middle-aged men I work with?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>The answer to your question is actually very basic-I'm sure you understand from your business endeavors that you only get out of something what you put into it. If you want to be a great businessman, you've got to work at it-much harder than the "average Joe." Likewise, if you want to have a strong, muscular body, you've got to put in the time and effort and work towards that goal as well.<P>
As far as training goes, if you hit the weight room hard for as little as 45 minutes, 3 or 4 days a week, you can get the job done. But that's only part of it. Nutrition is very important, too.<P>
For me, it's much harder to find the time and discipline to follow the nutritional guidelines that are necessary to stay lean and build muscle than it is to find time to work out.<P>
Even if you were to train six days a week for two hours per workout, if you didn't have your nutritional program in order, you wouldn't look or feel all that much better.<P>
But, with all the high-tech supplements and meal-replacement powders that are on the market today, the whole issue of optimal nutrition is easier to master.<P>
Make sure you always plan ahead-just like you plan your business schedule-give your nutrition and exercise program that same type of priority. Use protein powders, meal-replacement drinks, or have your meals prepared for you (ask your secretary or assistant to help you with it).<P>
In my 1996 Supplement Review, I go over a very detailed nutrition and supplement program as well as a fast, super-effective exercise routine.To get a free free copy of that book, follow this link.<P>
The bottom line for success in bodybuilding is very similar to the way you've achieved success in business-find the "right things to do" and then repeat them day after day, week after week.<P>
You didn't achieve your status in the corporate world overnight, nor will you achieve the perfect physique that soon, but if you stick with it, stay focused, and are determined, you'll definitely reach your goal of having a lean, strong, muscular body. And, when you reach that goal, you'll have so much more self-esteem, you'll probably be even more successful in business!<P>
Finally, I appreciate your referring to me as a "successful businessman," but I have a hard time thinking of myself that way. Despite the amount of time I spend behind a desk putting this magazine together and running my various companies, I don't think I'll ever be a sophisticated business type.<P>
Now that we're in our new corporate headquarters, some of my managers are pushing for a dress code. (They think it's a little bit of a bad example for me to be wearing oversized cotton T-shirts that say "Train Hard" on the back, shorts, and tennis shoes to managers' meetings-hey, what can I say? If I'm not comfortable, I can't focus on my work!)<P>
Anyway, they're pushing for a rule where the "executives" (which I guess would include me) have to wear ties and slacks to work, at least Monday through Thursday. So I kind of custom designed my own "corporate-bodybuilder wear" (shown in the photo to the left). Hey... I kind of dig this style. It says, "I'm a business guy and a bodybuilder"-don't you think? Maybe there's a market for this stuff-maybe I can give that Armani guy a run for his money. Maybe you'll be my first customer!<P> 
(Don't worry-I'm just kidding.)<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I was wondering if you had tried using yohimbine as a fat burner, like Dan suggested in the last issue of <I>MM2K</I>. Do you think it works?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Dan's theories are always interesting, and this one is no exception.<P> I tried using some prescription yohimbine, 5.4 mg per tablet, just to see what it felt like, so I would be "in the know."<P> 
That stuff can really give you a "hot flash"! You can definitely feel it-at least I could. It makes you kind of flushed and makes your blood pressure go up, but as you continue to use it, you get kind of used to it, and it attenuates-it doesn't cause as much of a reaction after you've used it for a week or so. I used it for only two weeks to test the acute effects.<P>
However, I work with a woman who has been on it for about a month, and she has noticed some very positive results (loss of fat from her hips), so I'm convinced there may be something to Dan's theory that yohimbine helps burn bodyfat-especially lower-body fat in women and some men. (However, yohimbine does not elevate testosterone like some marketers claim.)<P>
If you try this stuff, make sure you're not using any other central nervous system stimulants, like Ripped Fuel, Diet Fuel, caffeine, ephedrine, clenbuterol, etc. I think using yohimbine along with a central nervous system stimulant could increase your blood pressure too much all at once and cause problems.<P>
As far as the dose, I tried one and a half tablets twice daily-once in the early morning and once in the early afternoon. The woman I work with uses one tablet first thing in the morning and another tablet in the early afternoon.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I'm a 27-year-old woman "bodybuilder," I guess you'd say. I'm not into competing, but I'd love to look like Monica Brant or even half as good. I've never really had a problem like this, but over the past month, I've developed really bad acne around my chin and along my jaw line. I recently started a supplement cycle that contains creatine, whey protein, DHEA, and glutamine powder. Do you think it could be the supplements causing this problem?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Supplement, not supplements-it's the DHEA that's causing the acne; I guarantee it. Even though DHEA is more mild than steroids like Anavar, something is happening with this stuff that is causing really bad acne in some women who use it. I think DHEA causes a profound shift or imbalance in the hormonal chemistry of some women-especially if they use more than 50 mg a day.
I haven't seen this problem in men who use DHEA-it probably doesn't cause much of a change in the whole "androgenic environment" for them.
Anyway, I'd stop taking DHEA immediately, keep using the other supplements, and if the acne doesn't clear up soon or if it's really bad (potentially causing scarring), I'd see a dermatologist as soon as possible and ask if he or she will put you on a medication called Aldactone (spironolactone). Aldactone is an effective yet "forgiving" diuretic, and it's also an "anti-androgen." Your doctor should put you on 50 mg of this stuff a day for 4 to 6 weeks. This will help get your androgen levels down and resolve the problem.
By the way, because Aldactone is an anti-androgen, male bodybuilders should not use it for more than a day or two (to cut up for a contest or photo shoot)-it can cause gynecomastia and hinder muscle growth.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I've got bitch tits. They started when I hit puberty, and then I did a few steroid cycles, and they got a lot worse. I haven't been on steroids for three months, and it's still getting worse. Is there anything I can do about this besides having surgery?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Bitch tits, or gynecomastia, is (for those who don't have it) the formation of breast tissue in men; it's the most common and most disturbing feminizing side effect of anabolic steroid use, and as you pointed out, it also happens to a lot of teenagers during puberty, as the body begins cranking out testosterone and then converting some of it to estrogen.<P>
The primary cause of gynecomastia is the testosterone/estrogen ratio getting screwed up. This can happen if testosterone levels decrease and estrogen levels remain unchanged or if testosterone levels stay the same and estrogen levels increase or if estrogen levels increase more than testosterone levels. Got that? Good.<P>
As you might imagine, when a person starts administering supra-physiological doses of androgens, all kinds of hormonal imbalances can result. (By the way, supra-physiological means "above" the level which is normally produced in the body.)<P>
Anyway, what's likely happening in your case is that your body's testosterone/estrogen ratio is out of balance. Since you stopped taking steroids several months ago, it's likely that your body's natural production of testosterone is not back up to speed yet, and even if your estrogen levels aren't elevated, they're out of balance and will probably exert a greater-than-normal function and continue to cause the gynecomastia to get worse.<P> 
Another thing that can cause or aggravate gynecomastia is the use of anti-androgens such as Aldactone, which I discussed in the previous Q&A. Another anti-androgen that is being used by a lot of people who don't even know it has anti-androgenic effects is a drug called Tagamet, which is used for upper-GI disturbances, such as ulcers and heartburn. Tagamet and Aldactone decrease the circulating level and biological effectiveness of testosterone and can subsequently increase the "power" of estrogen.<P>
Using drugs like HCG which increase testosterone production in an effort to get things back in balance is kind of a doubled-edged sword. As it turns out, HCG increases estrogen levels, too.<P>
For the time being, you might try using an estrogen antagonist such as Nolvadex, which can help block the effects of estrogen at breast tissue sites until your testosterone/estrogen ratios get back to normal.<P>
Another method for keeping gynecomastia from getting worse is to use a topical DHT preparation such as Andractim. This unique "rub-on" DHT compound, which, I believe, is made in Belgium and sold in France, gets into the tissue and "occupies" estrogen receptors which prevents estrogen from "doin' its thang." It actually works quite well in a number of cases, but unfortunately, Andractim is pretty hard to get in the States.<P>
Parenteral (injectable) DHT is also effective in treating persistent gynecomastia in many cases.<P>
Although there are technically ways to prevent gynecomastia and treat it, most of the guys I know who end up getting it (there are a lot) usually end up having surgery to get rid of it for good.

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>When I first started using caffeine, it really used to boost my workout intensity, but after a while, even when I took a lot, it didn't do anything for me. Then I tried ephedrine. It worked great. All my lifts went up, and I could work out longer and harder. But then it stopped working, too. I really liked the boost those products gave me-my workouts just aren't the same without that extra "kick." Is there anything else I can take?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>What you're experiencing is not uncommon. Drugs like caffeine and ephedrine "down-regulate" after they're used for a period of time. Thus, you've got to take more and more of them to get the same effect, and eventually, it reaches a point when, at a reasonable dosage, you can't even tell you took any "upper" at all.<P>
One way to avoid this is not to use these things habitually but rather just when you really need an extra boost. But, for those of you who've already "burned out" on caffeine and ephedrine, here's a new idea-I recently heard from some bodybuilders who have switched to Nicorette-a chewing gum that contains nicotine. This drug, which is now available over the counter, was designed for people who want to quit smoking.<P>
Nicotine is what's called an "alkaloid" of tobacco. It's not the stuff that causes lung cancer from smoking-that's tar and other crap.
Small doses of nicotine have an uplifting effect on the nervous system and actually stimulate neuromuscular junctions, which means your muscle fibers may "fire" more efficiently when you pick up a weight and start lifting it. This may mean greater strength and better workouts.<P>
I would warn anyone who is using Nicorette gum, or thinking about using it, to take note of the fact that large doses of nicotine have the opposite effect-they act as a depressant and can make you weaker!<P>
I wouldn't recommend that anyone chew more than one or two pieces of the two-milligram per piece dose of this gum before a workout. (Nicorette is also available in a strength of four milligrams of nicotine per piece.)<P>
It's not unlikely that a person could continue to receive the positive "stimulatory" effects of ephedrine, caffeine, and nicotine if they use them sparingly-perhaps using them in an alternating pattern and never using them on consecutive days.<P>
I have tried Nicorette and can vouch for the fact that one piece of this gum (2 mg of nicotine), about 30 to 40 minutes before a workout, can definitely "wire" you (at least it does me) and increase strength. I don't know how long you'd have to use this stuff before it "down-regulated," but I'm not going to use it long enough to find out. I'll save it for an occasional leg workout after a 14-hour work day. (By the way-Nicorette tastes "so-so," and it costs about 40 cents per piece.)<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I've really enjoyed some of Charles Poliquin's articles about weight training in the last few issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. I'm starting to believe most everything this guy says. Am I going to find out later that he's psycho and wish I hadn't wasted my time following his theories? Bill, I trust you. Please tell me, is Poliquin for real?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Charles Poliquin is definitely for real-I know it, TC knows it, Duchaine believes it, and so do over 120 medal-winning Olympic athletes.<P>
Recently, a pro bodybuilder and friend of mine, Milos Sarcev, had the chance to work out with Charles, and he couldn't believe how much he learned about how to destroy muscle fibers through proper weight-training techniques. Now he's a "believer," too.
I've been following Poliquin's teachings/theories for years, and I've incorporated many of his ideas into my own weight-training programs, but it wasn't until just a couple of weeks ago that I actually had the chance to work out with him "one on one."<P>
I have to tell you, reading about his weight-training theories is helpful, but actually having the chance to work out with him and see him demonstrate the unique adjustments that turn ordinary exercises into extraordinary punishment is incredible.<P>
It's like reading about David Copperfield's magic tricks versus seeing them performed right in front of you-it's truly amazing! Charles is very much like a magician-as soon as you think he's pulled every rabbit out of the hat that he possibly could, he continues to amaze you by pulling out more and more tricks.<P>
After having the chance to work out with Charles, I've made some important changes in my workout program, and I've gone from being a believer in his concepts to being a big, big believer in them!<P>
Because I think Charles is probably the top training expert in the field today, I'm going to make sure we share more and more of his ideas with you in future issues of <I>MM2K</I>. And since I have recently learned what an incredible difference there is between reading about his theories (which are helpful) and being able to see all these techniques he has developed, I'm going to put together a super-high-quality training video with Charles-a training video that is far above and beyond anything else that's been on the market in terms of quality information and production. I hope to have this video available by the end of the year, and guess what? I'm going to make this video (which I'll spend literally tens of thousands of dollars producing) available to <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> readers for FREE!!!<P>
That's right-I'm not going to try to make a profit off this project at all-what it's all about is a new business theory I'm working on which I think has a lot of merit-I think I'll call it the "Phillips Goodwill Theory of Business." I figure if I help enough people in this market get what they want (enjoyable, intense workouts; gains in muscle size and strength; etc.), then I'll be guaranteed to get what I want out of my business (more customers, more <I>MM2K</I> readers, more people who buy my books and other products).<P> 
I think too many people in business (today, especially-and in the bodybuilding business, in particular) focus on "me, me, me." They go about things all wrong. They try to grow their business and make money by taking care of themselves first and their customers second. My concept is to take care of the people who read my magazine (my customers) first. It might sound like an unusual way of doing things, but I'm convinced it's the best way. It's definitely not a get-rich-quick scheme-it's a "long-haul" business strategy. But I believe in it.<P>
Anyway, back to Charles Poliquin-this guy literally charges $2,000 a day for personal training sessions! And, you know what? He's booked solid! His "clients" include dozens of gold-medal-winning Olympic athletes, champion bodybuilders, successful businessmen, and even ROYALTY!<P>
So, my advice is to follow Charles' theories which we'll be presenting in <I>MM2K</I>, and watch for details on how to get this incredible FREE training video in future issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>!<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I want your honest opinion. I want to be a female bodybuilder, and I'd estimate that I need to put on about 30 lbs of muscle to be competitive. My training partner (a man) tells me that the top girls use a lot of androgenic steroids. What and how much are they using?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  I can't tell you what the top ten at the Ms. Olympia have been using, but I do know that plenty of amateur female bodybuilders use some damn serious androgens. This list includes the heavy hitters like injectable testosterone, Anadrol 50, and Parabolan (or home-brewed Finaplix). These three are the worst offenders for androgenic side effects, but many amateur women still use these drugs. In one sense, the more androgenic drugs aren't necessarily any more "lethal" than the less androgenic steroids. But the heavy hitters will deepen your voice, increase facial and body hair growth, and make your clitoris grow, and having these physical changes will definitely affect how strangers, friends, and family members treat you. Granted, I know some female bodybuilders who enjoy the companionship of fetishists and schmoes, but generally, most women like a broader range of people for social interaction. Women who use androgenic steroids will be ostracized from many aspects of everyday society, and this is why I criticize many female bodybuilders-much of this damage is avoidable and unnecessary.<P>
But before I continue, let's take time out for a reality check. The majority of top female bodybuilders all fall into a very narrow range in terms of height and weight. Most of the professional women are between 5'2" and 5'6", and hardly any of them weigh more than 150 lbs. Granted, we do see taller and bigger women competing, but they have yet to place very high. Yes, we see and hear about the real monsters of the sport like Tina Lockwood, Karla Nelson, and Ann-Marie Crooks, but these bigger women have not placed very high in contests. Although judges reward men for just being "big," women are actually marked down if they're "too big."<P>
There are plenty of short male bodybuilders (Lee Priest, et al.) who carry quite a bit more mass on their frames than a comparable-height female bodybuilder. So, the reality is that the judges of female bodybuilding contests expect a certain degree of muscle mass, but any more than this isn't necessary to win. Although Lenda Murray is a fabulous bodybuilder, I can recite a long list of amateurs who are the same height, hold more muscle, and outweigh her by at least 25 lbs.<P>
I've been watching the Olympics over the last few weeks, and I always look at the various physiques to see if I can find worthwhile correlations to bodybuilders. Something struck me about the male gymnasts: most of them have the same kind of bodies as female bodybuilders. Most have a maximal height of about 5'5" and weigh about 150 lbs. They all have bodybuilder-type bodies-a V-taper, and they're very lean. The amazing thing is that most gymnasts rarely train with weights, and all of them are randomly tested for steroids. Considering that male gymnasts don't do squats or biceps curls, most of them have pretty good quads and biceps.<P>
What's the point of all this? Well, female bodybuilders are screwing up their diets and training. I know this because most of the great female bodybuilders have been taking an amount of anabolic steroids which results in their having a far greater testosterone level than the natural testosterone level of a male gymnast. For example, I recently looked over the drug array that a lightweight female bodybuilder was using. It included 400 mg a week of Deca-Durabolin, 20 mg a day of Dianabol, and a few hundred milligrams of Equipoise. In the old product literature included with Dianabol, Ciba pointed out that ten milligrams a day (two tablets) would give an average man full androgen replacement. This particular female bodybuilder had the androgen level of four men. To remind you: a lightweight female competitor can weigh no more than 118 lbs.<P>
My advice to you: yes, you'll likely need some kind of anabolic steroid to put another 30 lbs of muscle onto your frame. But any trainer, or even another competing female bodybuilder, is wrong if he/she says that you need a lot of androgenic steroids to get big. One of the competitors I coach wanted to increase her muscle mass, and she asked for my personal recommendation. She used a basic combination of Primobolan Depot and insulin (after her workouts). Are there better anabolics? Of course. But remember, female bodybuilders don't need as much muscle as men do. The current winner of the USA is 4'11" and 105 lbs. An Olympic female gymnast weighs only 15 lbs less on absolutely no anabolics (with virtually no weight training).<P> 
The bottom line of all this: a female bodybuilder needs very little anabolics to attain the size that judges want. But most of the top female bodybuilders will be using more, simply because it makes up for appallingly bad dieting and training. Chicken breasts, broccoli, and MCT oil will not build an optimal body. The problem is this: the top women don't follow the advice in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. Most current competing female bodybuilders don't even use creatine, which would most likely put an easy five extra pounds on. If they all followed my Isocaloric Diet and trained the way Poliquin recommends, the amount of anabolics needed would be virtually nil. In the past, I've gotten a middleweight amateur into the Olympia lineup on two Dianabol a day for just a few months during the year. And if you're very industrious and can find some of the foreign esoteric non-steroidal anabolics, you could attain most of your goals with no steroid use whatsoever.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I must have Flavone X!!! Where can I get it?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  All of the new companies proclaiming they have Flavone X (notably Pro-Pharm in Clute, Texas) don't have it! The cheapest price for chrysin (the flavone in question) is through Acros Organics, a division of Fisher Scientific. The price is $40 for 25 grams. At 1.5 grams a day, which is the projected dose, this works out to less than $2.50 a day. However, other companies buying chrysin will be marking it up, usually at least four times their wholesale cost. Suddenly, chrysin would be $10 a day. Be patient. We've recently stumbled onto a metabolite of DHEA that has just as potent anti-aromatase properties, but it will be much cheaper to produce than chrysin.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : Once and for all: how much clenbuterol should I take each day and for how long? And another thing, why is it that all the animals in the studies gained muscle on clenbuterol, yet that doesn't happen in humans?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> It seems that after about two weeks or so, clenbuterol stops elevating body temperature, and fat loss also stops around this time. Even when you follow the suggested dosing schedule used in the animal research-14 days straight and a stagger of 2 days on and then 2 days off-it hasn't really extended clenbuterol's effects all that much. I usually give this very simple and blunt advice: use as much as you can stand until it stops working. But the devoted <I>MM2K</I> reader craves more precision than that. So the real question is: how much is too much?<P> Obviously, you're using too much when the side effects put you in danger. Clenbuterol is supposed to be a pure beta2 agonist, but some beta1 receptors are stimulated, and this will elevate the heart rate and blood pressure. Most doctors will tell you that borderline hypertension starts at a blood pressure reading of above 140/90. So how much you can take will vary from individual to individual. I've seen some men hit 140/90 with 2 tablets a day, yet I've also seen a female use 10(!) tablets a day and maintain a shockingly normal 120/80. You should be charting body-temperature elevations while using any thermogenic agent. Beta agonists like ephedrine and clenbuterol both have temperature plateaus. Above a certain dosage, there is no further temperature increase. This is generally a good thing. Dinitrophenol (DNP) has no plateau. Recently, a bodybuilder overdosed and elevated his body temperature to 107°. He's alive, but he's half deaf and has impaired kidney function.<P>
Here's the odd thing about the anti-catabolic effect seen in the animal studies. The researchers were using milligrams, not micrograms, to achieve the increase of muscle. Achieving the same results by using these dosages in humans would probably kill the human subject by either a stroke or a heart attack. But the researchers did stumble onto an interesting fact: the anti-catabolic effect was not from stimulation of either beta receptor.<P>
As I'm writing this, one of my Gonzo human lab rats is using a whopping dose of 18 mg of clenbuterol a day. To keep his heart rate and blood pressure normal, he's using a prescription beta blocker. Granted, he won't get the usual temperature elevation, but he's expecting some kind of marked anti-catabolic reaction. He'll be reporting the results in the first issue of my Dirty Dieting newsletter.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : In a past <I>MM2K </I>(September 1995), Dr. Jekot mentioned how anabolic steroids could be used to treat depression. Could you please explain this process?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  I can't explain the process. And I doubt that a psychiatrist could either. Years ago, there was a great outcry over Prozac from the Scientologists, claiming that Prozac contributed to (or outright caused) suicides of many patients. The FDA still deemed Prozac safe and stated that many suicides happened because the depression was more severe than originally diagnosed, and Prozac, which is for mild depression, was misprescribed. I relate this story because if you feel that you or a close friend or relative shows signs of depression, don't assume that it's mild and that a few shots of testosterone will cure it.<P> 
With that out of the way, I can postulate on a number of mechanisms by which testosterone use might elevate mood. Now keep in mind that there is a difference between relieving depression and elevating mood. A low testosterone level will lower the red-blood-cell count (anemia) and reduce the body's ability to transport oxygen to the brain. Low testosterone will also decrease muscle mass, which will lower thyroid secretion, and it will lower estrogen (from less aromatization). Many parts of the brain have estrogen receptors, and both intelligence and libido will be negatively affected from lowered estrogen levels. It also might be that cortisol levels will cause depression if not balanced with testosterone. Post-steroid depression is very real, as ex-steroid users have unusually low serum testosterone levels. Post-menopausal women are routinely prescribed methyltestosterone along with estrogen to reestablish libido. The East Germans did research showing that androgens (and not anabolics) improved the overall tone and recuperation of the central nervous system. So, through many mechanisms and pathways, testosterone will elevate mood and, at times, cure certain types of mild depression. But this therapy shouldn't be done as a self-remedy.<P>
 

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I got this price list from a mail-order place here in America that has cool stuff like IGF-1, Nolvadex, Clomid, and other goodies. I called the place up, and they assured me that what they are doing is legal. Is this true? And will I get my goods if I order something?<P></B>


<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  No, this isn't true (it's not legal), but, yes, you'll probably get your goods. As scams go, this appears to be a simple and relatively risk free one. The owner of this particular company you mentioned was able to make about $30,000 tax free a year when he was still in high school. You could pull the same scam. Here's how it works:<P>
The problem with many bodybuilders who want to buy prescription drugs is that they won't make the effort to find the drugs. Most of my "Ask the Guru" mail are letters asking for drug sources. As I've mentioned before, there are a number of foreign pharmacies, notably in Turkey, Greece, Mexico, and Taiwan, that will sell you prescription drugs, mostly the steroid-accessory drugs like anti-estrogens, thyroids, beta agonists, etc. The majority of these drugs are not DEA regulated, nor are they on the alert list. Payment is made by either cash or U.S. Postal money order. But the majority of potential customers isn't aware of these mail-order outfits.<P> 
What you have stumbled onto with this American mail-order company is a remailing scam. Let's say you want a box of clenbuterol. The price is $20. You mail the American company the $20, plus shipping. The owner of this company deposits your money into his account. He has a bunch of price lists from foreign pharmacies, and he picks one that sells clenbuterol for $5 a box. He goes to the post office and gets a money order for the cost of a box of clenbuterol with shipping. He mails the money order out to the foreign pharmacy but puts the order in your name. The foreign pharmacy will ship the clenbuterol to your address. Everybody's happy. The scamster has just made $15 profit. The foreign pharmacy makes money, and 90+% of the time, the American customer gets his clenbuterol.<P>
So what's wrong with this scam? It's not legal for the American company to do this. In fact, it's a felony under the fraud statutes. Some of these drugs are on the alert list (or are scheduled drugs) and might be confiscated. At the very least, the buyer will lose his/her money, or worse, postal inspectors will question the addressee. And the American company will assume hardly any risk.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : I need your help. I'm 24 years old, 5'4", and 145 lbs. I'm a single mom of twin boys. I weighed 220 lbs when I gave birth, but I've lost 75 lbs. Yet I'm still at 28% bodyfat. I've tried prescription diet pills, but I'm still stuck at this weight. I go to school full-time and only make $900 a month, so I can't afford a gym membership. But I work out at home with water-filled jugs and soup cans. Is Nolvadex the solution to my problem? How much does it cost, and where can I get it?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  My business manager, Laura Moore, will be telephoning you to get you set up with a membership at Contem-porary in Buffalo, NY-a real gym which is convenient to your home and that offers child care. I'll pay for a year membership for you, along with six months of child-care costs. Also, we'll be mailing a free copy of my diet book BODYOPUS.
As to your question, I doubt Nolvadex will help with your further weight loss. But you should get some blood tests (and as a single mom, your state should have some free medical services) to check your thyroid. If prescription appetite suppressants didn't work, you might have a very slow metabolism. If your morning body temperature is less than 97.8°, you might find that you are hypothyroidal. If this is so and is confirmed by your blood tests, your doctor will have no problem writing a script for Synthroid. Between this and following any of the three diets in BODYOPUS, you should be able to get past your sticking points. All the best, and do stay in touch.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> : My wife wants to use TwinLab's Male Fuel, but the warning on the back	states that it shouldn't be used by women. Why not?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> It's not the Yohimbe that's the problem in Male Fuel but the small amount of saw-palmetto extract. There's research which shows that saw palmetto affects the dihydrotestosterone in the body by interfering with the transfer of any testosterone from the outside of the cell receptor into the nucleus of the cell. In pregnancy, a male fetus needs a small amount of DHT for full fetal development. So stopping DHT's function during pregnancy could cause malformation of the child. In all actuality, the minuscule amount of saw palmetto (100 mg per day) probably wouldn't affect a pregnancy. But who's to know beforehand? Your wife could use Twin's Yohimbe Fuel, as it has no saw palmetto in it.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I've been hearing about a fairly new drug (steroid) called methyltrienolone. One of the components is Ralgro (commonly used for cattle). So what is methyltrienolone, and how is it produced? The asking price is around $100 for 10 cc's.<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Ralgro is the trade name of an estrogenic anabolic cattle implant called zeranol. It's derived from a fungus that grows on corn. Over ten years ago, Ralgro was used by powerlifters who simply ground up the pellets using a mortar and pestle and mixed the resultant fine powder with veterinary oil-based vitamins. Although there was a slight anabolic effect, a number of users did report that it caused gynecomastia. The original reason to use Ralgro was because it was an anabolic that wasn't on the banned drug list. Since that time, zeranol has been added to the list.<P>
Methyltrienolone is a black-market mixture of Finaplix (trenbolone) and Ralgro, both ground into a powder and somewhat dissolved in oil. I say "somewhat" because only part of both steroids is dissolved, as much of the binders that make up the pellets will not dissolve. You would call this an oily suspension, and the injection site will be very slow releasing, probably irritating, and not necessarily (most probably not) sterile.<P> 
Okay, it's expensive, illegal, possibly dirty, dangerous, and might show up on a drug test for up to a year after it's injected, but is it effective? Well, probably yes. We already know that adding any type of estrogen to an anabolic will increase its effectiveness. And most steroid users already know that the trenbolones (both Parabolan and Finaplix) are very potent anabolics. Some steroid users claim that trenbolone is the most potent anabolic they've ever used. I'm predicting that the Finaplix and Ralgro combination is probably very synergistic, as the Ralgro will enhance the trenbolone effect and cause a very nice growth hormone and IGF-1 boost. However, since Ralgro acts like an estrogen and Finaplix acts like a progesterone, I would expect the potential for gynecomastia to be very high. And I would imagine that using an estrogen antagonist (Nolvadex) and a progesterone antagonist (RU 486) would defeat the synergistic effects. As long as you have $4,000 in your bank account for gyno surgery, you might grow quite well on the stuff. Just don't be crying to me if you have to get a chunk of your ass removed after you get a nasty infection. For those who are interested in such things, in the first issue of the Dirty Dieting newsletter, I'll have a step-by-step synopsis of how to convert Finaplix into methyltrienolone, the most anabolic and toxic steroid on the planet.<P>



<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> Your assistant who writes for MuscleMag talked about ipriflavone and how it's an anabolic. Could I use this instead of steroids? How much does it cost, and how much should I use?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Osteochin is its trade name in Hungary, and it costs only $8 for fifty 200-mg tablets. In Italy, the trade name is Osteofix, and thirty 200-mg tablets cost $32. Obviously, Hungary has the better buy. I'm predicting that the anabolic dosage will be about one gram a day. I would think that you'd find the anabolic action on a par with the milder anabolic steroids like Oxandrin, Winstrol, and Primobolan, all of which are only anabolic at very high milligram amounts. For most male bodybuilders, the more potent anabolic steroids will always be the best anabolic agents. However, in female bodybuilding and fitness, I believe it's possible to build a winning body in either sport with ipriflavone, insulin, and DNP.<P> 

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>I'm a very sexually active bodybuilder. I can usually have up to five or six orgasms before I lose my erection. Sometimes my girlfriend and I have long sessions twice a day. How does sex affect my testosterone level?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Your testosterone level is obviously more than fine. But you might want to pack a few meals so you can eat every two hours during those long sessions.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT>Recently, I did two cycles of testosterone. I'm 20 years old and have looked like Don Knott's bastard son all my life. After taking the testosterone, I jumped to 170 lbs. The only problem is my nipples look like pine cones. My brother calls me "milky-nips." Recommend a steroid to make it go away.<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  You must have either a high amount of estrogen receptors in your breast tissue, or you might have too much estrogen-converting enzyme. So, stay away from testosterone, and try to use the classic non-aromatizing steroids which are listed in the World Anabolic Review. However, you might never get your nipples back to normal, and you should investigate surgery. If you have insurance, your policy should cover the cost of the surgery.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I use Winstrol three times a year, and every time I do a cycle, I lose my sex drive. I used HCG (5,000 IU every 4 days), and my testicles blew up in only 4 days. But still no sex drive. I tried Endo-Pro, and I got my libido back, but now I have gyno. What should I do?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  This is very unusual. Winstrol should affect your testosterone and estrogen levels. As a matter of fact, many people with AIDS get a libido boost from Winstrol. I have a feeling that the HCG had a delayed reaction on you-the effects probably weren't caused by the Endo-Pro. In the future, you should have a blood test done towards the end of your Winstrol cycle to determine what your serum testosterone level is. It's probably within the normal range. It might be that the various steroids are working on things that we aren't aware of, including orphan receptors or nitric-oxide production. You have stumped me on this one. Nevertheless, I recommend that you switch to Clomid rather than HCG. Clomid will give you just as much of a testosterone elevation, but it's also an anti-estrogen, which should help you avoid gyno.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>I've been trying to make my upper pecs grow. My lower pecs are well developed from years of heavy benching and dipping. I've tried using incline barbell presses, but nothing happened. I'm now doing incline dumbbell presses with a pair of 100-lb weights, and I still don't feel any soreness in the upper pecs. Any suggestions?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>I would say that using the wrong grip is the main cause of improper targeting of the clavicular pectorals (a.k.a. upper pecs). Try adjusting your grip in the following way:<P>
For incline dumbbell presses: try pressing the dumbbells with a semi-supinated grip (with the palms and dumbbells facing each other) instead of the pronated (conventional, palms and weights facing away from your body) grip. If you're using a pronated grip and you're using large dumbbells, the plates literally make contact with the front delts and prevent you from lowering the weight all the way. In other words, your pecs can't get a maximal stretch. When the palms face each other, you can go down four to six inches deeper than before, thus providing greater stimulation to the pecs.<P>
For incline flyes: you'll maximize upper-pec involvement if you meet the following three conditions:<P>
1.	Set the bench at a 75° angle.<P>
2.	Grab the dumbbells using a pronated grip (palms facing away from you), instead of the standard semi-supinated grip (palms facing each other). That means throughout the movement, your thumbs will be facing the ceiling. This will force you to drop your training weight considerably, but don't worry, the load on the pecs will increase.<P>
3.	In the bottom position of the flye movement, align your elbows with your ears. (Most people align their weights and elbows with their upper pecs in this movement.)<P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> I've been training at home for the last four years, but now I'm thinking about joining a gym. Can you give me some pointers on what to look for in a quality gym?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>It all depends on your level of training knowledge. In other words, if you're very confident about setting up your own training programs or can learn a lot on your own, then only selection and variety of equipment will matter. However, if you're inexperienced, untrained, and over the age of 30, make sure you get answers to the following questions:<P>
1. What level of education do the gym's employees have? If they're not kinesiology or sport-science graduates, are they at least certified by a recognized organization such as the National Strength and Conditioning Association or the International Sport Science Associa-tion? Nonetheless, keep in mind that formal education isn't as hot as it's reputed to be. I've seen physical-education graduates who knew the distal attachment of the anconeus muscle yet didn't know how to teach a simple triceps extension. Over the years, I've met quite a few very knowledgeable trainers who were high-school dropouts, like Pierre Roy and Louie Simmons. Regardless of their lack of formal education, they had a passion for learning how to train properly. They're probably some of the best trainers in the field, and they have a track record for increasing lean body mass and strength in all their trainees.<P> 
A note regarding personal trainers: there are a large number of incompetent ones out there. Recently, while working out in a very exclusive, well-equipped gym in the Denver area, I noticed a ratio of one personal trainer to one gym member. One of the girls working as a personal trainer was wearing spandex, but she didn't look like a personal trainer-from the waist down, the best way to describe her would be "cottage cheese in fish net." You don't have to look like Mr. or Ms. Olympia to be a good personal trainer, but you should probably look like you at least work out.<P>
Regapdless of formal education, the staff should be able to administer some basic physiological tests to correctly individualize youp training program. For example, can they interpret an ECG reading during your aerobic test (a stress test)? Please note that pepforming an ECG at rest doesn't identify much in terms of potential problems. I should know-I'm part of the 1 out of 20 people who has a normal wave pattern while I'm having a heart attack. True cardiac pathology will only show up during a stress test.<P>
2. How often will they change your program? Most health clubs are just happy to get you to sign and don't give a rat's ass about whether or not you're going to make progress. Do you have access to a personal trainer? Can you bring in your own personal trainer without feeling like you're crossing the former border into East Germany? The gym may have great equipment, but the staff may consist of a full set of dorks.<P>
3. Are they prepared to deal with a medical-emergency situation? Does the staff know at least some CPR, and do they have a medical-emergency-evacuation plan? If you're over the age of 30, these may very well be important.<P> 
4. Is the weight room supervised at all times? This relates to point three. I recently heard about a case where a health club was forced to close down after a member had a stroke on the Nautilus decline-press machine, and no one noticed for 20 minutes. Because of his reclining position, the other gym members thought he was "just resting."<P>
5. Is the gym well maintained? Are the dumbbells returned to the right spot, or are they put away randomly? Are the plate racks correctly stacked? (A pet peeve of mine. Nothing pisses me off more than people who stack the plates wherever they want.) Hunting down dumbbells and plates will make you lose valuable time. Is the upholstery clean and well maintained, or does it have a lot of rips and smell like a camel's ass?<P>
6. How clean is the air? A gym visited in the winter may smell okay, but in the summer, it may remind you of the inside of an armored tank following a bean meal. Make sure the air's recycled often.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>My wrists hurt when I do upright rows. Should I stop doing this exercise, or can I just change the way I'm doing them? </B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>There are three things you can do to alleviate the stress on the wrists when doing upright rows: 
Use an EZ-curl bar, and put your hands so they're positioned as they'd be if you were curling. The angle on the bar may permit pain-free movement.<P>
Or use a cable machine, and do the movement using a rope with bulky rubber ends (the one normally used for triceps pressdowns).<P>
If you don't have an EZ-curl bar or a rope, do the rows with a regular barbell, but don't lift the bar higher than your clavicle (collarbone).

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> What's the best time of day to train in order to get the best results from my workouts? I work flexible hours, so I can train whenever I want.</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Studies have shown that maximal strength levels reach their peak values at both 3 and 11 hours after a person wakes up. In other words, if you wake up at 7:00 a.m., you'll get optimum results if you train at 10:00 a.m. or 6:00 p.m. There are numerous reasons which could explain these strength-enhanced hours-hormonal fluctuations and neural facilitation are a couple. Another reason you might want to wait a few hours after getting up before weight training is because of the temperature fluctuation of synovial fluid. Synovial fluid is, in laymen's terms, joint lubricant. Apparently, it takes about three hours before the joints reach an optimal level of warmth, and the warmer your joints are, the more you can lift and the less likely you are to injure yourself.<P> 
However, don't be overly concerned with these findings if your schedule doesn't allow you to train at these hours. Many top bodybuilders have trained at very odd times yet displayed very impressive physiques. For example, Bill Pearl trains at 3:00 a.m., as did Boyer Coe in the late '70's and early '80's.<P> 



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> Squats hurt my lower back. Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening? Am I doing something wrong?</B> 
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Okay. If you did squats with your back at a 90° angle, you'd be squatting with a perfectly straight back. However, let's say you weigh roughly 200 lbs and you squat 300 lbs but you lean forward at about a 70° angle. Research indicates that the pressure on the lower back, 5L vertebra will be roughly 1,500 lbs. Let's say you lean forward an extra 10°. The pressure on your spine would then climb up to approximately 1,980 lbs. That extra 10° lean increases the pressure almost 500 lbs or a third more in this case!
Now, the good news. With proper stretching and technical coaching, you can squat at an 80° angle, which would reduce the load on the spine to just over 1,000 lbs. Get your back to a 90° angle, and the pressure on the 5L vertebra drops to about 500 lbs-that's one-fourth of the pressure created from a squat using the same weight with a 60° lean; i.e., 1,500 fewer pounds of pressure on your spine!<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> There seems to be a difference in attaining maximal strength and maximal size, but I'm interested in gaining both. Is it possible to achieve both goals at the same time? If so, how?</B> 
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Yes, it's quite possible. You only have to look at the weightlifters and powerlifters from the 90-kg (about 200-lb) and above weight classes. They have tremendous strength levels coupled with high degrees of muscle size. The key to achieving this dual goal is in the sequencing of the training methods. If both maximal strength and maximal size are your training goals, you should always begin your weight workouts with neural training; that is, low repetitions for multiple sets. Then, once your central nervous system is excited, use that opportunity to do hypertrophy work in this enhanced neural zone. To make this clear, let's use an example of someone who can bench press 300 lbs for a single rep. The athlete would rest 3-5 minutes between work sets and only 60 seconds between warm-up sets. Here's what a training program would look like:<P> 
Warm up<BR> 
1. Empty bar for 10 reps<BR>
2. 5 x 135 lbs<BR>
3. 3 x 185 lbs<BR>
4. 1 x 225 lbs<BR>
5. 1 x 265 lbs<BR>
Neural work<P>
Perform 3 sets of 1 rep with 285 lbs. On each subsequent chest workout, add 1 single with that weight. In other words, the next time you work chest, you'd do four sets of one rep. When you can do eight singles with that weight, increase the weight.<P>
Now, move on to some "growth" work.<P>
Hypertrophy work<P>
Perform 5 sets of 5 reps with 235 lbs. When you're able to complete all sets of five reps, increase the load by five percent.
This training system was inspired by former World Weightlifting Champion Doug Hepburn. Doug published a series of lifting courses a few years ago, and they all produce results. Even though the nutritional guidelines he prescribes aren't consistent with modern findings in some instances, the training methodology is still excellent for building size and strength.<P>
These courses can be purchased from Iron Mind Enterprises at 916-265-6725 (phone) or 916-265-4876 (fax). This company also sells a wide variety of effective strengthening devices, books, courses, and videos. Give them a call, and ask for their catalogue.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> What's your opinion of the pec-dec exercise? Is it a good exercise for the chest?</B> 
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Well, the pec-dec is not going to replace the bench press as the cornerstone movement in chest development. And I believe most of the older pec-dec machines can cause long-term damage to your shoulders. With some of the older units, it was possible to do a shoulder adduction with the arm externally rotated. This is bad news if you want to remain injury free. The prime mover in the pec-dec is the pectoralis major, but the pec major is also an internal rotator of the humerus (upper-arm bone) when your arm is externally rotated. If you're trying to do a shoulder adduction with external rotation, you're placing the joint in an unnatural position. But many of the newer machines, like the Flex pec-dec, require that you grab a handle, thus more closely mimicking dumbbell flyes. These are much safer.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> What do you think of direct neck training? What do you think of neck machines? What's the best neck exercise for neck development?</B> 
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>I'm usually wary of prescribing neck exercises in writing because, unlike the elbow, the neck can produce very complex movement patterns. I don't know of a single company that produces an ideal neck-training machine which can overload the neck muscles efficiently. Considering the present state of the art in equipment, I'd recommend manual-resistance exercises for training the neck muscles, making sure the resistance is always applied at a 90° angle to the head. For anything more specific, I suggest you ask a competent chiropractor or osteopath to teach you how to train these muscles properly.<P>

		<H4><CENTER>By Bill Phillips</CENTER></H4>
<P><B>There are a multitude of roadblocks which stand between bodybuilders and their goal--muscular hypertrophy.  Among them are a lack of proper nutrition, insufficient recovery, and poor training intensity.  The latter of which is usually the last area an athlete considers to be his or her shortcoming; however, poor intensity is a major reason why weight-training athletes experience little or no progress.  It is not welcome news to the average lifter, but it is simply the truth; 9 out of 10 people who take up weightlifting don't have what it takes to push their bodies to the point where it will respond and adapt with muscle growth.</B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>M</FONT>ost athletes who are attempting to build a massive, muscular physique claim they are hard-core bodybuilders.  Numerous other weightlifters call themselves hard core either because they workout five days a week or because they perform the "advanced" workouts featured in the popular muscle mags.  The truth is, hard core has nothing to do with how often you work out, how many sets you do, or if you can do Lee Haney's back workout three days a week.  Hard core is all about <B>intensity</B>, and intensity is an elusive quality.</P>
<P><H3><CENTER>A BASIC OVERVIEW</CENTER></H3></P>
<P><B>WHY IS INTENSITY SO IMPORTANT?</B>  To understand this principle, let's examine the theory behind muscular hypertrophy.  Training with weights is meant to put a great enough demand upon muscle that they have no choice but to become larger and stronger in order to survive.  Effective weight training involves overloading and progressive resistance.  Overload indicates that unless the muscle is forced to do more than it is used to, it will not receive a stimulus to grow.  Progressive resistance involves handling a greater level of intensity each workout.  This is often accomplished by adding weight to an exercise or additional repetitions.  These are the two aspects that make up training intensity.</P>
<P>	When an athlete trains with the same weight and rep scheme over and over again, this does not subject the muscles to any stress that they are not accustomed to.  Even though the exercises might result in a great pump and soreness the next day, these workouts are not the type that induce growth and should be regarded as maintenance training at best.
<P> Consider the body's homeostatic nature.  It wants very much to stay the same.  The body maintains a consistent temperature, metabolic rate, and pH level.  Virtually all hormone and enzymatic activities are regulated so that they stay the same.  The body also attempts to maintain this homeostatic environment by limiting the level of skeletal muscle in the body.  This homeostatic nature is not easily overcome; thus convincing the body that it needs more muscle is not as easy as most "experts" would have you believe.  The fact is, giving the body the signal it needs to increase anabolism or muscle growth is not pleasant.  This type of weight training is brutal and painful, but there is no doubt that it is rewarding.</P>
<P><H3><CENTER>A LITTLE PHYSIOLOGY</CENTER></H3></P>
<P>	For weight training to create muscle hypertrophy, it must be fierce and earnest.  The intensity of the weight-training session must be so great that the skeletal muscle tissue is damaged to the point where actual microscopic tears result.  Skeletal muscle tissue is made of microscopic elongated cylindrical cells called muscle fibers or myofibers.  These fibers lie parallel to each other.  In each myofiber, there are a number of structures that control the function of that cell.  Some of the more important structures are called myofibrils which play a key role in contracting the cell.  Myofibrils are made up of two kinds of even smaller structures called myofilaments.  There are thin myofilaments (actin) and thick myofilaments (myosin).  It is the interaction of actin and myosin that allow a muscle to contract.  These two contractile proteins slide together as the muscle contracts, and they separate when a muscle relaxes.  When a muscle increases in size, it is actually caused by an increase in the diameter of actin and myosin owing to the production of more myofibrils and nutrients (glycogen and triglycerides) and energy supplying molecules (ATP and Creatine Phosphate).  The larger the actin and myosin fibers, the more forceful the contractions.  There has been some discussion that an increase in muscle size is due to longitudinal splitting of muscle fibers, followed by hypertrophy.  However, it is generally felt that the number of muscle fibers does not increase after birth.  Muscular hypertrophy in children is influenced by Human Growth Hormone and testosterone.</P>
<P>	A mature person must apply a stimulus for muscular hypertrophy to occur, unlike naturally growing children.  By mature, I mean past the age of 18 when the body usually reaches its natural growth potential.</P>
<P>	There are different types of muscle fibers that react differently to exercise.  Knowing which ones do what can aid in effective weight training.  Skeletal muscle fibers contract with different velocities depending upon their availability of ATP.  Faster contracting fibers have greater ability to split ATP.  These fibers are commonly known as Type II-B.  These muscle fibers are the "big boys."  The Type II-B fibers are fast twitch and have a low concentration of myoglobin which makes them white.  They contain large amounts of glycogen and are geared to produce ATP by anaerobic (without air) metabolism.  They fatigue quickly but provide very fast and forceful contractions when they are called upon.  These fibers are only given a signal to fire if a maximum muscle contraction is required.  Type II-B fibers react to stress (weight training) by developing larger actin and myosin myofilaments.  If you want bigger muscles, you are going to have to stimulate these fibers to their fullest.</P>
<P>	A second kind of muscle is Type I.  These fibers, slow twitch, contain large amounts of myoglobin, a reddish pigment similar to hemoglobin in blood.  Thus Type I fibers are a reddish color.  These fibers are very resistant to fatigue but contract slowly.  They work aerobically (with oxygen) and perform when a weak contraction is needed.  Generally, Type I fibers are for endurance exercise, and they respond to exercise by becoming more metabolically efficient, not larger.</P>
<P>	There is a third class of muscle fibers known at Type II-A which are often called intermediate fibers.  Type II-A are fast twitch but contain high amounts of myoglobin, so they are red.  They do not produce strong contractions and have minimal capacity for hypertrophy.  They are found in small amounts in the body and adapt by becoming more metabolically efficient.</P>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>"It is important to have at least some grasp of muscle physiology to comprehend the intense weight-training theory."</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<P>By examining the information above, we can already see why weight training that is performed with moderate to low intensity does not result in muscular hypertrophy.  The main reason for this is that the muscle fibers which are capable of becoming larger are not even being worked in some lifters' programs.</P>
<P>	Usually, skeletal muscle is made up of about half slow twitch and half fast twitch.  Occasionally, someone will have an abundance of one type.  World-class marathon runners can have up to 70% slow twitch; a world-class sprinter, i.e. Ben Johnson, could have up to 80% fast-twitch fiber.  (Consider the strength potential of fast-twitch fiber as Ben Johnson was known to do full squats with 600 pounds for reps and bench over 400 pounds for reps.)  The amount of these fibers a person has is determined genetically and can be revealed in a muscle biopsy.  Although the two fast-twitch fibers can transform between A and B, slow twitch cannot become fast twitch and vice versa.</P>
<P>	When the brain sends a signal for a muscle to contract, it enacts just enough fibers to get the job done.  When a muscle fiber is fired up, it contracts 100%.  This is known as the all-or-none principle.  There is no contraction less than 100%.  There is a variance in the number of muscle fibers that get called upon to work.  If you are just curling a five pound weight, your brain will only signal enough fibers to complete the job.  If you are curling a 20 pound weight, all available muscle fibers will be called upon to lift the weight.  Type II-B are the last ones to be called in; thus, it takes a maximum weight to bring them into action.  If the weight being lifted is moderately heavy, Type II-B fibers will be stimulated, but they will take turns contracting.  This is due to an action called asynchronous motor unit summation (AMS).  If a maximum weight is being lifted, all the muscle fibers will fire simultaneously.  In this instance, muscle fatigue sets in quickly, usually in less than five reps.  In AMS, the muscle usually gives out in less than ten reps.</P>
<P>	By using these basic facts of physiology, we can understand more about the intense weight-training theory.  Since the purpose of the hard-core bodybuilder is to gain power and mass, attacking the Type II-B fibers in indicated.  We know that these fibers are used when heavy weights are lifted in a fast manner.  The heavier the weight, the more fibers get involved.  Now think for a moment what the key aspect of intensity called overload truly means...overload means that you must lift a weight that is heavy enough to first stimulate Type II-B fibers.  If you are not lifting a maximum weight or are using a lot of machine type exercise, there is a chance that Type II-B fibers are not even being significantly activated.  Not only must the weight be heavy enough to stimulate these Type II-B fibers, but the weight must be heavy enough to activate all of them.  Remember AMS as discussed above--if the weight is fairly heavy but not a maximum, these Type II-B fibers will take turns contracting.  This is not overload.  This is simply physiology in action as the muscles are performing their designated tasks and are not being overloaded.  A true muscle overload will not occur while AMS is taking place.  There is a type of muscle fiber overload that can occur toward the last few reps if AMS is occurring and the lifter trains until failure.  Yet this type of overload only effects a small number of muscle fibers.  True overload is seen when the muscle is hit with heavy, fast, intense weight-resistant exercise.</P>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>"Lifters who train in a haphazard, unenthusiastic style are very likely not even stimulating the type of muscle fibers which have a potential to grow."</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<P>  These lifters are, at best, slightly stimulating the Type II-B fibers but are not coming close to overloading them or forcing them to grow.	There is no magical number of repetitions that maximally stimulates Type II-B fibers.  Generally, ten repetitions or less is best, but there are extenuating circumstances which may see an intense set go up to 12 and even 15 repetitions.  The legs can be worked with an occasional heavy set of 20 repetitions because they are so muscular.  More often than not, the Type II-B fibers will either suffer fatigue by the eighth repetition and on occasion, only three repetitions will do it.  The key is not so much the number of repetitions or sets but rather in the fierceness and enthusiasm with which the repetitions are performed.</P>
<P>	Overload occurs when all Type II-B fibers are stimulated simultaneously over and over again with each repetition, until they are all ready to quit.  Then, somehow, someway, the lifter pushes those fibers beyond muscle fatigue to the point at which these muscle have never been before.  It is imperative to comprehend this.  Overload does not occur simultaneous to muscle fatigue.  Muscle fatigue is the failure of the muscle to perform because it runs out of its fuel, ATP.</P>
<P>	Most lifters pick up a weight, count to eight or ten repetitions, and set the weight down.  This is not effective weight training.  Counting reps and following a certain set pattern can be a bad habit and leads to stagnant training.  Perhaps on occasion you have trained past the certain eight or ten reps and pushed your muscles to the point at which you could not lift the weight another time.  That is training to failure and is not synonymous with intensity.  Overload usually occurs after you have perceived muscle failure.  The lifter who can go beyond that point and push that muscle to a point where it has not been before is the one who will stimulate growth.  The body will have no choice but to adapt to survive.  As indicated earlier, the body does not want to do this.  The body wants to stay the same.  The mind has got to push the body past what it is capable of, and this creates weight-training intensity.  What the popular muscle mags and training courses don't want you to know is that your chances of ever achieving this level are not good.  The top muscle mags like to portray bodybuilding as a sport for everyone.  That is pretty much propaganda--the truth is that most lifter don't have the discipline, drive, nor the skill to train intensely.  Thus most athletes find themselves making no gains in size or strength, and they continually search for that elusive aspect that is holding up their program.  When you think about it, it is much easier to search for some magic pill, powder, or injection than it is to accept that you haven't been training intensely enough to stimulate muscle growth.</P>
<CENTER><H3><P>INTENSITY IS A SKILL</P></H3></CENTER>
<P>	Forget everything you thought you knew about intensity and get ready to learn what it really means.  Intense weight training is not something you just walk into the gym and automatically know how to do.  It is a skill and thus requires practice, discipline, and enthusiasm.  There are a number of methods which you can use to develop this skill to train intensely.  By practicing these skills, you will immediately notice an increase in intensity but to truly reach your potential and develop your skills to the fullest, you must continue to practice these methods for months and months.</P>
<P>	The first thing you need to do is accept the fact that your lack of weight-training intensity has limited your progress and will continue to do so unless you can master this skill.  Second, you must be ready to experience pain.  Intense weight training involves pain; it's that simple.  Although some athletes claim you get used to the pain, physiologically that just isn't possible.  The body does adapt to many senses, that is, if you are listening to especially loud music, your sense of hearing will adapt and over a period of minutes, the music does not seem as loud.  Your vision adapts;  when you walk out into a bright sunlight, it seems especially blinding, but in a matter of seconds, the light does not seem to be as bright.  Quite literally, all sensations go through some level of adaptation with the exclusion of one, pain.  Nerve receptors do not downgrade their perception of pain.  I believe this dispels the theory that these workouts are only painful for a little while.  The fact is, they hurt the first time you do them; they hurt the 100th time you do them--they are supposed to.  After getting in the proper mind set for intense weight training, it is time to go practice some skills.</P>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>"Squatting is by far the best overall body exercise you could possibly perform; it is also difficult and excruciating."</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<P>	The premier exercise for developing the skills to train intensely is the squat.  Squatting is by far the best overall body exercise you could possibly perform; it is also difficult and excruciating.  Your first assignment for increasing your overall training intensity is to take your perceived 10 rep maximum in the squat and do it 20 times.  That's right, 20 times.  For example, if during your normal workout you were accustomed to completing a tough set of squats with 275 pounds for 10 reps, your assignment is to do 275 pounds for 20 repetitions.  Believe me, if you've completed 10 reps at this weight before, you have the ability to complete 20.  Whether you can realize that ability or not, really determines if you can train with the type of intensity it takes to grow.</P>
<P>	To perform this intense set of squats, you should first thoroughly warm up by doing such exercises as the stationary bike, stretching and at least two sets of 10 to 15 repetitions with a light weight.   Once your heart rate is over 110 beats per minute and you are breathing heavily, your muscles are warm and your tendons are loosened up, it is time to step under the weight.  Load the bar with your perceived 10 rep maximum and get ready to inflict some pain.  Nothing complicated about it, just take the bar off the rack, squat to a position where the top of your thighs are parallel to the floor and drive it back up.  Take it one rep at a time, thoroughly breathing in and out between repetitions as if each were a one rep maximum.  Once you get to the 10th rep, you will naturally want to give up because that is what you have conditioned yourself to do in all your other workouts.  Once you start your 11th repetition, you can have confidence that you are leaving most all weightlifters behind you.  You are taking a step in a direction you have wanted since you began your weightlifting efforts.  You are conditioning yourself to train intensely and develop your skills so that you can be a real bodybuilder.  Perform the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th rep one at a time and breath out at least five times at the top of each rep.  If you make it to the 16th repetition, you can be sure that you are on your way to a new level of weightlifting.  By this point, your breathing is uncontrollably heavy; you will likely have tunnel vision and may not even be able to hear if your training partner is encouraging you to continue.  By the time you go down and drive out that 17th repetition, you realize that the first 16 reps were merely a prelude for overload.   The 17th, 18th, and 19th repetitions may take up to 10 seconds each as you clear your lungs completely 5 to 10 times before you can prepare yourself to bend down again and drive up that weight.  By the time you are ready to do the 20th repetition, you will likely be relying solely on the power of your mind as every muscle in your body has reached fatigue several reps ago.  How strong is your mind?  Get tough, get mean, and discover intensity as you bend down for that 20th rep and drive it back up with a scream.  As you struggle to put the squat bar back on the rack, your sense of victory may be overshadowed by fatigue and mental exhaustion.</P>
<P>	At this point, it is prudent to lie down on a bench and engage in deep breathing for at least 3 or 4 minutes.  It is not uncommon to pass out, vomit, be unable to walk, and/or have ringing in your ears.  This will all subside in a matter of minutes at which point you are likely to notice many of the others in the gym staring at you like you're crazy.  That is what you want them to think; you are crazy enough to push yourself to the point where your muscle will grow.</P>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>"Get tough, get mean, and discover intensity as you bend down for that 20th rep and drive it back up with a scream."</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<P>	This one intense set of squats is your only set on that exercise for this stage of your skill development.  It would be impossible to execute another set that was at anywhere near that level of intensity and since you are attempting to break the habit and conditioning of performing sets of less than 100% overload, do not do anymore sets of the squat at this point.  By doing this intense 20 repetitions of the squat, you will have a very clear idea of what we mean by overload and intensity.</P>
<P>	Of the few athletes who do train in this manner, the majority of them take advantage of stimulants like Dymetadrine 25, Pep-Back (a caffeine supplement), Inosine, and a lactic acid buffer like Phos Fuel.  Another common practice is to use a high-carbohydrate pre-workout drink and a recovery drink like Cytomax before, during, and after this type of intense workout as they are especially debilitating to the glucose and glycogen levels.  Your body will be overwhelmed by the demand on its glucose and glycogen reserves once you take your training to this level.</P>
<P></P>
<P>	For the next six weeks, your intensity assignment is to perform just one set of this 20 rep squat exercise two times a week in place of your usual squat sets.  Each time you perform the exercise, add additional weight.  This fulfills the progressive requirement of intensity.  Even if it is only five pounds, it still increases the intensity level by a small percentage.  If you do not have what it takes to perform this intensely, accept the fact that you are destined to be a recreational weight lifter.  The recreational weight lifter still incurs many advantages that bodybuilding offers; however, massive muscle development is not one of them.</P>
<P>	Next issue we will continue our series on developing the skills to train with true intensity, and we'll show you how to apply this newly learned intensity on your sets of 20 to sets of as few as 6 reps. We'll also show you how to apply this skill to training other body parts.</P>

<P><B><CENTER>Most bodybuilders or weight trainers in general eat a lot of food, so much so that the amount eaten by the members of a typical Southern California Gym would be enough to feed a small third-world country.  Consequently, you'd think that most bodybuilders are getting enough of the proper nutrients to maintain optimum growth.  The trouble is that the diets of most bodybuilders are so limited in their variety they just don't include all the required vitamins and minerals.  Most bodybuilders would probably be all right if they varied their diets sufficiently, but for whatever reason, most likely convenience, they don't.  That's where supplementation in the form of vitamins and minerals comes in.</CENTER></B></P>
<HR>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>M</FONT>ammoth pro bodybuilder Jim Quinn once told me, with a straight face, that he got as big as he is by eating "a hell of a lot of Twin Labs' supplements."  Just last week, even more mammoth pro bodybuilder Paul Dillett told a friend of mine that he got his arms as big as they are "by eating a lot of the right foods and vitamins."  Hell, if that's all it takes, we should learn all we can about vitamins, right?  (Now Jim, don't get mad at me--remember I paid your cab fare that one time?  And Paul, remember that time I pulled a thorn out of your paw, er...foot?)</P>
<P>	Although the two bodybuilders we mentioned may have exaggerated their effectiveness, vitamins are, by all accounts, still very important.  For instance, you may, to the best of your knowledge, be doing <I>everything</I> right.  You may know all there is to know about training, how much work your muscles can take without being overtrained, and be the most supremely dedicated individual on earth.  However, if you don't eat enough of the right nutrients, you're not going to get your muscles to grow much at all.  The best you might be able to do is alter your fat to muscle ratio.</P>
<P>	There are approximately 60 different minerals in the body, and roughly 22 are essential, meaning we need to get them through our diet.  They are essential to a variety of basic processes in the body.  Vitamins differ from minerals in that they're organic, meaning they contain carbon.  Most scientists think that there are 13 vitamins essential to human life.  Each of them carry out specific functions in the body, and when deficiencies arise, the body does not function properly.</P>
<P>	That's where vitamin supplementation comes in.  The trouble is, vitamin and mineral tablets are expensive, and the industry often perpetuates myths that try to justify their high costs.  This article will dispel some of these myths.</P>
<P>	First, let's talk about how and where vitamin tablets come from and how some companies determine what vitamins and minerals should go into their mixtures.  According to the <I>Nutrition Action Healthletter</I>, all supplement makers buy most of their vitamins and minerals from the same group of multinational manufacturers.  These companies have huge vats of powdered nutrients waiting to be shoveled into shipping containers upon order.  Each supplement company just determines how much of each different compound they want to include in their own product.  We telephoned the manufacturer of one of the most widely advertised vitamin formulas for bodybuilders, and they explained, in a voice that sounded oddly mechanical and well rehearsed, "We use formulas based on the current and most reliable available research--that is how we get the amounts for the various nutrients.  We also use the highest quality available, and we only use pharmaceutical grade ingredients.  We also try to make our products as cost-effective as possible.  We always try to pass along any savings we can to the consumer."  Oddly enough, this manufacturer's prices for its generic vitamin tablets were among the highest on the market.</P>
<P>	When this same company was asked whether they bought their "highest quality possible" products from multinational manufacturers, they quickly responded, "We are not allowed to give out that information."  <I>Yeah, and monkeys just might fly out of my butt</I>.</P>
<P>	Are there any guidelines or restrictions concerning what manufacturers can put into their products?  Not really.  Oh, there are a few government restrictions regarding folic acid (too much can mask a vitamin B-12 deficiency), and California monitors vitamin A input (too much can be toxic since this is a fat-soluble vitamin and gets stored up in bodyfat), but otherwise, they can put in just about anything they want.  </P>
<P>	Many companies can't even explain why certain nutrients are dumped into their mixtures.  According to the <I>Nutrition Action Healthletter</I>, the Shaklee company couldn't explain why their Vita-Lea pills contained certain amounts of vitamins, other than to explain that that's how their company founder, <I>a chiropractor</I>, formulated the pills decades ago.  However, Shaklee's company line is that their supplements are "based on clear scientific evidence rather than the fad of the moment," which is essentially what the bodybuilding supplement-manufacturer we called said.</P>
<P>	Other companies dictate what goes into their products by economics.  If something's cheap, they liberally add it to their pills.  If something's expensive, they reduce the amount correspondingly or exclude it altogether.  Take a look at the label of a typical vitamin tablet.  Does there seem to be a lot of B-vitamins in it?  Well, you guessed it.  Most of the B-vitamins are cheap.</P>
<P>	Just keeping up with the Joneses is another factor that determines the content of vitamin tablets.  If company A makes some claim for a particular vitamin and dumps it into their product, most likely company B will, too.</P>
<P>	By now, you must be asking yourself how it is that supplement manufacturers are able to get away with this.  Well, vitamins are considered foodstuffs by the FDA and, consequently, aren't regulated as drugs are.  A supplement manufacturer has no responsibility to prove any therapeutic benefits from any ingredient it sells.  Here are a couple of the myths that have been dreamed up to rip you off:</P>
<P></P>
<P><CENTER><H3>MYTH 1:  NATURAL VITAMINS ARE BETTER THAN LABORATORY VITAMINS</H3></CENTER></P>
<P>	A vitamin is a vitamin is a vitamin.  If you were to give a laboratory two samples of vitamin C, one of which was synthesized in the lab, and the other of which was derived from rose hips, the laboratory could not tell the difference.  Each of the molecules would have the exact same configuration of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms.  There are those, however, that believe that "naturally occurring" vitamin C tablets are better because they contain bioflavonoids, anti-oxidants that improve the absorption rate of vitamin C.  That might be true, but the average diet contains plenty of bioflavonoids in it, making any additional bioflavonoid supplementation unnecessary.</P>
<P>	If the companies can get you to believe that natural vitamins are better for you,  they can then justify the high cost by saying, "It's a far more expensive process to extract vitamin C from thousands of rose hips than it is to make it in the lab."  </P>
<P>	Even if natural vitamins were better for you, the companies still try to rip you off because most "natural" vitamins are merely synthetic vitamins that have been mixed with plant extracts or small amounts of the so-called "natural" vitamins.</P>
<P>	The only exception to this rule might be vitamin E.  Some researchers believe that natural vitamin E might be more readily utilized than synthetic vitamin E.  To find it, ignore labels that advertise "natural vitamin E."   Instead, look for the listing "d-alphatocopherol" as the only vitamin E listed.</P>
<P></P>
<P><CENTER><H3>MYTH 2: NAME BRAND VITAMINS ARE BETTER THAN STORE BRANDS</H3></CENTER></P>
<P></P>
<P>	According to the <I>Nutrition Action Healthletter</I>, Safeway's <I>Central-Vites</I> contain exactly the same amount of vitamins and minerals as <I>Centrum</I> but cost much less than the name brand.  The newsletter also found that companies like K-Mart and Wal-Mart are real sticklers for quality and that their vitamin products rate as high as some of the most expensive brands.  So why do people continue to spend more on name brands?  Probably because they have the mistaken assumption that the name brands are better.</P>
<P>	If you're willing to accept that quality doesn't have to come in a name-brand wrapper, consider buying your vitamins from large national retailers or stores with a reputation for quality in general.</P>
<P>	Granted, there are several reputable companies out there who do their homework.  According to noted nutrition specialist Dr. Scott Connelly, the proper way to gauge the needs for human nutrition involves growing human leukocytes in nutrient mixtures that contain varying amounts of vitamins and minerals.  This has been done by several reputable researchers, and the results have been incorporated in various quality vitamin supplements.</P>
<P>This article is not all-inclusive, by any stretch of the imagination.  There are seemingly countless nutrients and micronutrient available, the exact human needs of which have yet to be determined.  If you want to supplement your diet with vitamins and minerals, buy pills that seem fairly complete and follow the above guidelines.  If all of this sounds like more than you care to deal with, you can always eat healthy amounts of the "Top Ten Bodybuilding Foods" that were listed in our March-April issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>.  Bon appetit!</P>

<P><I><B>Although we won't go so far as to recommend any particular brands in this article, these are the kinds of things you should and shouldn't do when you buy your supplements:</B></I></P>
<P><H3><I>DO'S</I></H3></P>
<P>--  Take vitamins E, C, and Beta-carotene.  There's a lot of evidence that these vitamins combat free radicals in the body, which are unstable chemicals created by normal chemical processes in the body.  Free radicals can combine with other atoms or molecules creating potentially harmful compounds that can set off a chain-reaction of chemical events, the least of which is premature aging.   The chemical reactions perpetuated by the simple act of lifting weights can cause the production of free radicals.</P>
<P>-- Look for expiration dates.  Supplement manufacturers don't have any reliable way of gauging expiration dates, and the government doesn't require them to.  If a vitamin bottle is within six to nine months of its expiration date, chances are that it's been sitting on the shelf for years.</P>
<P>-- Make sure you're getting adequate amounts of certain micro-nutrients like chromium and selenium.  Studies repeatedly come out extolling the virtues of chromium for promoting muscle growth, but the jury's still out on that.  However, it's pretty much accepted that chromium aids in the absorption of glucose.  Selenium is also gaining recognition as a valuable anti-oxidant, much the same as vitamins A, E, and beta carotene.  You might also want to make sure you're getting enough choline and inositol, two nutrients that might aid in fat metabolism and that some bodybuilders swear by.</P>
<P>-- If you're female, make sure you're getting adequate amounts of calcium.  According to the National Institutes of Health, adult women should get about 1,200 milligrams a day, while post-menopausal women should get about 1,200 to 1,500 milligrams a day.</P>
<P>-- Realize that nutrition is a young and often imprecise science that has, up until recently, been largely ignored by the medical world.   According to a survey quoted in Health magazine, only 23% of medical schools require that students take a course in nutrition.   In other words, keep doing your homework, don't believe everything the manufacturers tell you, and keep a watchful eye over your pocketbook.</P>
<P><H3><I>DON'TS</I></H3></P>
<P>-- <I>Don't</I> overdose on fat-soluble vitamins like A and D.  Amounts slightly over the recommended dietary allowances (RDA) can be toxic.   Take beta-carotene instead of high doses of vitamin A.  Beta carotene is the precursor to vitamin A, and the body will use the beta-carotene to make only as much as it needs.</P>
<P>-- <I>Don't</I> worry about getting enough of the B-vitamins like B-1, B-2, B-3, and even B-12.  The first three-B vitamins are found in abundance in foods.  B-12, however essential, is stored for quite some time in the liver.  Doctors still, however, like to administer B-12 shots as "energy pick-me ups."  The only reason you generally need extra B-12 is if you're a vegetarian, suffer from pernicious anemia, or regularly provide fodder for a vampire.</P>
<P>-- <I>Don't</I> worry about small amounts of sugar in the vitamins.  The sugar helps disperse nutrients within the intestinal tract, and the amount of sugar usually doesn't amount to more than a calories' worth.</P>
<P>-- <I>Don't</I> spend too much money.  In most cases, the department store brands are just as good as the top-dollar brands.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><B>s most people know from either personal experience or reading cheap dime-store novels, Tijuana is the Mexican border town that rubs shoulders with San Diego, California.  The city's poverty is in stark contrast with the wealth of its American neighbor, and in fact, it looks more like a city from some third-world country.  Its main industry is tourism, more specifically, sailors looking for a good time, under-drinking-age  teenagers looking for booze and a place where their juvenile antics are tolerated, and people hunting for things that they can't get as easily in the states, like cheap clothing, cheap liquor, and drugs--both recreational and prescription types.
	Outside almost every business on the Avenida Revolucion, the city's main drag, is a huckster calling out to the American passers-by, each extolling the virtues of their wares.  A few years ago, before steroids became the chemical desperadoes they are today, one can almost imagine one of those hucksters standing outside one of the city's countless drugstores shouting the following:</B><P> 

	<B><I>Hey Se&ntilde;or, c'mon een, we got thee best anibolicos een town--best prices too.  Today, we geev away a Winstrol tablet to every customer, absolutely free.  Take a look.  Hey, hey se&ntilde;or!</I></B><P>   

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/tctij1.gif" ALT="[Photo of T.C. standing at US/Mexico border]"></CENTER>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>ijuana, at the urging of the Mexican government and partly in an effort to appease the American government, has tried to clean up its act.  The city is not quite the Sodom or Gomorrah it once was--the public drunkenness of tourists is no longer as tolerated; the sex for sale is no longer as out in the open; and supposedly, a new law prevents pharmacists from selling steroids to Americans without bona- fide prescriptions.</P>
<P>	From most accounts, I had heard that the latter was true--Tijuana was no longer the steroid-shopper's heaven that it once was.    Some bodybuilders say, "No man, you have to go farther south to get them."  Others, like Dan Duchaine, say that Tijuana would still sell you <EM>Mexican</EM>-manufactured steroids without a prescription, but not American or European.  Regardless of who you talked to, everyone agreed that getting caught taking them across the border would get you in big trouble--"Yeah man, they got steroid-sniffing dogs walking up and down the inspection points, and if you're wearing a Gold's Gym T-shirt, they'll strip search you, and if you're carrying anything, you'll go to jail."</P>
<P>	Being a San Diego resident, I was slightly skeptical of all of the steroid-lore regarding Tijuana.  I knew that money is a powerful force in overriding any government decrees, especially in an area as impoverished as Tijuana.  I decided to see for myself.  Armed with a camera, a tape recorder, a wad of money, and a friend who spoke Spanish (just in case we got into a sticky situation), I went into Tijuana to see if I could buy some steroids.  And to further test my assumptions,  I wore my <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> T-shirt--just the type of thing that draws the attention of the border inspectors.</P>

<P>	Joe, my Spanish-speaking translator, and I made the 20-mile drive to Tijuana on a Monday morning, reasoning that the stores would be less crowded and that perhaps we'd have a better chance of scoring some drugs if there weren't hundreds of tourists mulling around.  We parked our car on the American side of the border and walked over to the Mexican side, having to push through a rusty metal, eight-foot high turnstile to do so.  No one asked us for a passport, what our business was, or anything, for that matter.  A seemingly endless line of varying ethnic cultures streamed in, each with its own agenda.</P>
<P>	Immediately upon entering Tijuana, we felt like we were in another part of the world and maybe another time in history.  There were cripples hobbling about on crude wooden crutches, burros painted like zebras (for some unknown reason) on almost every street corner, and hundreds of vendors selling items like gaily-painted sombreros or weird ceramic artifacts.  The only thing that reminded us that it was the 20th century was the sea of yellow taxi cabs that were waiting to take tourists into the heart of the city.  We immediately learned that everything in Tijuana is negotiable, including the taxi-fare.  Almost all of them asked for five American dollars, but it only took us a minute to find one who would take us for only four dollars.</P>
<P>	We told the cab driver to take us to somewhere where we could buy <I>anibolicos</I>, and without so much as batting an eye, he took us to Third Street and Madero, which was about an eighth of a mile off Avenida Revolucion where most of the tourist industry is.  Although he didn't mention any specific pharmacy, he made a wide sweeping motion with his arm, as if to indicate we could buy <I>anibolicos</I> from any of the drugstores on the street.  Amazingly, there were anywhere from ten to fifteen small drugstores within a quarter mile stretch.</P>
<P>	Somewhat apprehensively, we walked into the closest one, the <I>Farmacia Mexicana</I>, and walked up to the counter where we were promptly greeted by two smiling women wearing lab coats.  My translator asked, in Spanish, if they sold <I>anibolicos</I>.  Immediately, one of the women walked into the storeroom and brought out an assortment of steroids, including Winstrol V, testosterone cypionate, Primoteston Depot, Primobolan Depot, and some pre-loaded Sostenon 250's and Deca-durabolin syringes.  (Although I had heard that it wasn't generally possible to buy Sostenon 250's without a prescription, the pharmacists made no such distinction.)  I also asked, in English, for clenbuterol, but they didn't recognize the name until I asked for them by their trade name of Spiropent.  Immediately, they brought out a couple of 20-tablet boxes.</P>
<P>	The entire time, neither of the women gave a clue that they thought they were doing anything under-handed, nor did they flinch when I told them I was from <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> and showed them a copy of the magazine.   Somehow, I thought that they would give me the same sort of reaction that Mike Wallace gets when he tells people he's doing a story for <I>60 Minutes</I>.  Both did, however, express amazement at the thought that <I>anibolicos</I> could help make someone look like the man on the cover of the magazine (Dave Dearth).  I asked them if they required a prescription for the drugs, and both shook their head simultaneously.  After examining the packaging, I bought a couple of boxes of Spiropent tablets (0.02 mg.) for $6.56 each (in American dollars) and a 200 mg/ml vial of testosterone cypionate for roughly $20.00.  I thanked them, took their picture, and walked out of the store, wondering if this drugstore was the rule or the exception.</P>
<P>	Next, we walked to the <I>Botica Sherr</I> drugstore immediately across the street and again asked if they sold <I>anibolicos</I> to Americans without prescriptions.  The pharmacist didn't answer us, but he brought out a large selection of different steroids.   This time, I began to ask more about prices.  The cost of a 50 ml. bottle of Winstrol V was $60, although the price was cheaper if I bought in quantity.  The same applied for the pre-loaded Deca-durabolin syringes, which sold for $20 apiece.  This surprised me since these same pre-loads sold for roughly six or seven dollars only a couple of years ago.  In fact, all the drugs I encountered used to be quite a bit cheaper.  Whether the prices had just gone up because of increased demand or whether this was just price gouging, I don't know.  Regardless, we were quickly becoming savvy steroid shoppers, and we thanked him and decided to look for a better bargain.  </P>
<P>	Our third stop was at the <I>Farmacia D'Lux</I>, on the opposite corner from our first two stops.  Again, we were presented with a wide variety of drugs, which the pharmacist, Ramon, brought out in several trips, sort of like a shoe salesman trying to satisfy a hard-to-please customer.  Although the prices were generally the same, Ramon was asking slightly less than the previous drug store for the pre-loaded Deca-durabolin.   At $18 a pop, I bought two.  After explaining who I was and what I was doing, Ramon politely agreed to answer a few of my questions, although he refused to allow me to take his picture.  </P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/farmmex.gif" ALT="[Photo of T.C.'s purchases on pharmacy counter]"></CENTER>

<P>	Ramon told us that he gets about 50 to 60 Americans a week coming in to buy anabolics, and although he claimed not to know of any laws requiring him to ask for a prescription, he said that he does use some discretion and usually refuses to sell steroids to anyone who appeared to be very young.  Generally, the drugs sold are the ones I already mentioned, plus HCG.  Other things, like exotic European steroids or growth hormones were fairly hard for the pharmacies to come by.</P>
<P>	The story was generally the same at the next two stores, although I found that the price range sometimes varied enormously, particularly when it came to the 200 mg/ml vial of Winstrol V, which one drugstore wanted $90 for.  However, I suspect that I could have negotiated the price down on almost any product I wanted to purchase.</P>
<P>	By now our minds were reeling.  Despite being told that it was very difficult to buy steroids in Mexico, we were batting a thousand: all five stores we had gone to had been more than willing to sell us anything we wanted.  We were beginning to feel that Tijuana was still a steroid shopper's paradise and started wondering about the possible implications for the 1993 IFBB North American Championships, which will be held in Tijuana in December.  However, we weren't so lucky at the sixth store.  There was a young girl behind the counter, and after asking for steroids, she smiled and went into a back room.  In her place emerged a rather gruff, red-headed woman dressed in a flashy, gold embroidered blouse who told us that they didn't carry any steroids.   Interestingly, we later went to their <I>sister store</I> across the street which carried mostly toiletries, and they told us to go back to their <I>other store</I>, and they would gladly sell us the drugs we wanted.    For some reason, the red-headed woman who had turned us down initially had not felt comfortable selling us drugs, perhaps because of my tape recorder and camera.</P>
<P>	Feeling elated at our high success rate, we stopped to have a beer at a cantina which had been brought to our attention by one of the ubiquitous street hucksters:  "<I>One dollar beers, se&ntilde;ors, and the best tequila in town</I>."  We acquiesced and were led up three flights of stairs into an extremely dark room where a naked woman was sleepily gyrating on stage.  We ordered our beers, and as I leaned forward towards Joe to discuss our next stop, an only <I>half</I>-naked woman came out of nowhere and plopped her ample buttocks onto my lap, nearly smashing my vial and pre-loaded syringes.  After I removed her from my knee, she began to whisper in my ear and said that she would perform all sorts of unspeakable acts on me in the back room for only $14, which, like everything else, I suspect was negotiable.  I declined, finished my beer, and we headed on.</P>
<P>	We only hit two more drugstores, but both were again willing to sell us whatever we wanted.  All in all, considering what we had heard, buying steroids in Tijuana was amazingly simple.  Whether the pharmacists or pharmacist's assistants were ignorant of the regulations or the ever-worsening economic times <I>negated</I> the regulations, we don't know.</P>
<P>	Still, the hardest part of the trip still lay ahead of us.  I had the steroids, but how tough was it to get it across the border?   We'd find out soon enough.  We found another cab, and in five minutes, we were waiting in line to get back into the United States.</P>
<P>	Not wishing to become Dan Duchaine's roommate in prison, I dumped all my purchases in the garbage can in a rest room, but I kept the boxes in my pocket to see what would happen.  Even though I didn't have anything illegal on me, I was still nervous.  I kept thinking that maybe they'd think I had hid the contents of the boxes somewhere on my body, and they'd want to do a strip search.  My palms began to sweat as I imagined myself naked, bent-over and hands on the wall, doing some sort of <I>Women's Physique World</I>-type of pose as some guard began a search of my body cavities.</P>
<P>	Year's ago, the border control guards would look into any packages a tourist might be carrying, but that method has since been replaced by X-ray machines similar to the type used at airports.  Every package is put on a conveyor belt and passed before an X-ray gun.  Since I wasn't carrying any packages, the machines didn't concern me.  Still, as I neared the inspection point, I began thinking that it would add to the story if I was searched or interrogated--<I>Yeah, I'll win some sort of bodybuilding equivalent to the Pulitzer Prize!</I>  Consequently, I decided <I>not</I> to try and hide my nervousness.  I thought that they would stop me for sure since I was sweating at the temples, wearing a <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> T-shirt, and wearing my Terminator sunglasses.</P>
<P>	<I>Four more people to go until my turn.  Three.  What's my lawyers name again?   Two.  And then it was my turn.</I></P>
<P>	"Citizenship?" asked the mustachioed border guard.  "Citizenship?" he again asked, this time with a little bit more irritation in his voice, as I had not begun to answer quickly enough.</P>
<P>	"U.S.," I croaked.</P>
<P>	"Next please."</P>
<P>	<I>That was it?</I>  There must be some sort of mistake.  I must not have looked like someone who worked out to him.   I was insulted.  Half-intending to demand that I be searched, I walked up to some other guards who were standing at the back of the room.  I explained who I was and what my mission was.  Both said that I couldn't talk to them, or take their pictures, for that matter.  [See the sidebar below for a subsequent interview with a customs authority.]  I did, however, ask them if guys wearing gym T-shirts, carrying absolutely no packages after a day-long shopping trip to Tijuana, raised a red flag with them.</P>
<P>	"Not really," replied one.  "Usually, the smugglers are dressed normal and look like normal people."</P>
<P>	<I>What is going on here?</I>  What this tells me is that the steroid smugglers should be as obvious as possible, wear tank-tops, Hot Skins shorts, oil up, and maybe hit a few most-muscular poses while standing in line <I>so as not to be conspicuous</I>. </P>
<P>	I still don't know what to make of my Tijuana trip.  Apparently, all the things I thought I knew about buying steroids down there were misconceptions.   Who knows?  Maybe it was just chance that I wasn't searched or interrogated.  Even though I could have theoretically waltzed through the border carrying a month's supply of steroids, I wouldn't try it, <I>even if I was a steroid user</I>--the risk is just too great.*  What I suspect that a lot of Southern California bodybuilders are doing is taking a weekly or monthly trip down to Tijuana, self-administering their shots, most likely those whose anabolic effects are fairly long-lasting, and coming back without carrying any drugs on them.</P>
<P>	Please don't let the information in this article soften your apprehensions about smuggling drugs out of Tijuana.  <I>We strongly dissuade you from trying this!</I>  We would hate to forward your <I>Muscle Media 2000's</I> to your new home in the slammer.  If the thought of that doesn't scare you, keep in mind that anything you might buy down there could be counterfeit, especially things like Winstrol V and testosterones.  At this time, about the only steroids we bought on our trip that I could tell for certain were <B>not</B> bogus were the Deca and Sostenon in the pre-loaded syringes.</P>
<P>	Nevertheless, if you do decide to visit Tijuana as a tourist and you run into an extremely friendly girl named Lorna, say hello for me.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B><I>*If you're not aware of the possible repercussions of smuggling steroids, even small amounts, read the interview with Phil Halpern, U.S. Attorney, that appeared in the August/September issue of</I></B> <B>Muscle Media 2000.</B></P>
<P></P>
<HR>
<P> --  SIDEBAR -- </P>
<P>Since the customs inspectors wouldn't or couldn't talk to me, I called Bobbie Cassidy, the Public Affairs Officer for the San Diego District of U.S. Customs.  She represents all the uniformed officers that work at the ports of entry.  </P>
<P></P>
<P><B>MM</B> - What kinds of traits or characteristics do the agents look for when it comes to steroid smugglers?</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>BC</B> - The inspectors that work the primary lines make the decision whether to refer to a secondary inspection.  That decision is based on many, many things--based on his or her own intuition that he or she develops over a period of time, based on intelligence information, based on observations of the behavior of the person.  Many, many things go into that decision, which is a fast decision [because of the number of people going through the inspection point daily].  If the person is referred to secondary inspection, he usually is met by another inspector who again begins to ask questions.  That inspector gets a little bit of a more in-depth feeling of whether a closer inspection of that person needs to be done.</P>
<P> </P>
<P><B>MM</B> - So a person could actually be physically searched?</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>BC</B> - Yes, at that point, any packages might be looked at more closely, but as well, that inspector might decide to do what we call a pat-down search, where the officer and the suspect go into a private place, and the officer actually feels the person's clothing and body with his or her hands.  Border search authority is extremely broad, and it can go as far as body cavity searches or X-ray searches without warrants.  I mean, that's how federal law is.  But it needs to be a progressive suspicion, and that's why it starts with a primary officer, and it goes through a secondary officer and etc., etc.  And if bulges are felt, it can go to a strip search to see what the bulges are.</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>MM</B> - So if a person is found to be carrying something, he or she is detained until other authorities arrive?</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>BC</B> - That depends on a number of things.  If it's a tiny little amount, and these are decisions made right on the spot, the penalties can range simply from the officer taking the steroids away from the person, and that's the end of it, or it could go to the next step whereby he could be required to pay a monetary penalty for the attempt to smuggle, and the monetary penalty is equal to the value of the steroids in the United States.  If he's in a vehicle, the vehicle is seized, pending payment of the penalty.  Then he is also subject to arrest and prosecution.  That's when we would call in the customs agents.  Then they do their interrogation.  [The agents she is referring to are the agents that work for the Office of Enforcement, which includes investigative agents that do a more comprehensive investigation.]</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>MM</B> - Do you keep statistics on this sort of thing?  I mean, have the numbers gone up or down in the last year or two?</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>BC</B> - It's not a thing we track routinely, but it's been a pretty steady thing.  When the Laboratory Milonos (a huge counterfeit steroid lab) in Tijuana was destroyed several years ago, it took a long time to get all that stuff out of the vendor's hands, so it was a while before there was a decline.  It did decline a little bit after that, at least the large commercial seizures.  But we still regularly find, several times a day, especially young men, with personal amounts in their possession.</P>

Dear Friend,<P>
I saw a man die yesterday. Other people watched him die, too. Some cried, some watched stoically as if they were watching a TV documentary instead of real life, and some even <I>laughed</I> as he died. Me? I got mad.<P>
I had flown out to San Diego for a couple of days of relaxation after a particularly rough week, and I had gone down to the ocean to watch the waves. Unlike most Southern California beaches, my favorite spot has rocky cliffs instead of sandy shores-I guess I just like the booming sound the waves make as they hit the rocks. It was an overcast day, but that didn't matter to me-cloudy or bright, there's no better place. 
A lot of other people like that spot, too, particularly skin divers, although they usually enter the water about a hundred yards north of where I was lying because the shore is much more gradual there, and the rocks aren't as intimidating. This day, however, a pair of skin divers, already wearing wet suits and tanks, jolted me out of my semi-meditative state as they passed within a few feet of me on their way down the side of the short cliff. For some strange reason, they had opted to enter the ocean from this considerably more challenging point.<P>
Both men looked to be in their mid- to late-40's The first man was lean and agile, and he hopped and skipped down the rocks as if he had done it a hundred times before. He didn't seem to feel the weight of the heavy oxygen tank. His partner, however, slightly overweight, was already breathing hard as he tried to negotiate the sharp rocks and steep incline. His face was bathed in sweat, his brow furrowed in concentration. He made it but not without losing his footing a few times. I noticed that he had dropped his mask. I yelled to him, but he couldn't hear what I said over the sound of the crashing waves. I mimed a face mask with my hands and pointed to the ground behind him. He finally understood, turned around, picked up his mask, and mouthed a "Thanks!"<P>
The tide was coming in, and the waves were fairly formidable. The heavyset man's partner entered the water and floated over the top of the waves effortlessly as he swam towards the open sea. He swam out about 50 feet, paused, and motioned, somewhat impatiently, for his friend to follow him. The heavyset man was clearly nervous. He reluctantly entered the water, and as he tried to put on his flippers, a wave knocked him over. He stood up, clearly embarrassed, and tried to get his stubborn flippers on again. Another wave knocked him over onto his butt. Somehow, the impact jarred his air tank regulator, accidentally turning it on. I could easily hear the air escape as it hissed out of the tank. He continued to struggle with the waves and his equipment while his partner, still floating offshore, seemingly became more and more irritated.<P> 
While I watched, I couldn't help thinking that the second diver clearly hadn't had any scuba lessons and that he didn't belong in the water-the ocean is a dangerous place to be if you don't know what you're doing.<P>
The heavyset man's struggle continued as I got up and went to the rest rooms that were near the top of the cliff. His antics would have been almost comical had the look on his face not been so anguished, so embarrassed. I felt sorry for him. I mean, he looked like a nice guy, and I don't like to see anyone embarrassed like that.<P>
After what couldn't have been more than two minutes, I walked back towards my spot on the rock. For some reason, a group of about ten people were leaning over the cliff and looking down at the ocean. I ran to the cliff, looked over, and there, floating on top of the water like a plastic bathtub toy, was the heavyset man. He was obviously unconscious, and his partner was trying to bring him ashore. As I stared down at his motionless body, I got the perverse image of what the sea around TWA flight 800 must have looked like when it went down-all those dead bodies, arms outstretched, floating in the water much the same way as the heavyset man...<P>
Within seconds, a couple of lifeguards were in the water, swimming their way towards the divers. By this time, the tide had come in further, and bringing the victim to shore clearly wasn't easy. Within 60 seconds, 2 more lifeguards went in the water to help. As hard as they tried, they couldn't bring him in-the waves hit the rocks and would "bounce" back, doing their best to carry the man out to sea.<P>
The rescuers continued to struggle. Minutes passed before they succeeded in dragging the unconscious man ashore. With his body awkwardly positioned on the rocks, they began doing CPR. One man worked on his chest while the other tried to breathe life back into him. I had taken CPR classes, but I've never actually had to do it-I was amazed at how brutal it was and wondered how many ribs typically get broken when someone pounds on your chest like that.<P>
Beyond that, I was shocked, frantic, and ultimately angry. The man had no business being in the ocean! He was out of shape, inexperienced, and plainly out of his league. Either he or his friend should have had the brains to stay clear.<P>
By now, a crowd  of nearly 50 or 60 people had gathered. Nearby, I heard a group of men and women in their early 20's, laughing, saying it was "just like watching <I>Baywatch</I>." If I hadn't just had a sharp reminder about how precious life was, I would have tried to kill them on the spot. Others, no doubt desensitized to real life after having spent their entire lives watching TV dramas, looked on, expressionless, as the lifeguards tried to bring the diver back to life. A few of the more sensitive among them cried.<P>
The ambulance got there about ten minutes later. The emergency medical techs made their way down the cliff with all their equipment, and each started to work on the unconscious man. Some took turns with the lifeguard giving CPR, others attached monitors, and others stuck needles in the man's arms. One man, clearly a tourist, took his video camera and tried to <I>tape</I> the rescuers' efforts to bring the victim back to life. He probably thought he'd play newsman and show it to his beer-guzzling, no doubt loutish, friends. The emergency workers ignored him, but when the moron tried to stick his camera in the face of the unconscious man's partner, who was clearly in shock, the man recoiled and lashed out at the tourist, yelling at him to "get the fuck out of my face!" I'm sure it made the camera-carrying moron's day to have captured some real-life emotion on tape.<P>
They worked on the heavyset man for almost 45 minutes, and they continued to do so even after they loaded him into the ambulance and closed the doors. Every few seconds, like clockwork, I could see the springs of the vehicle bounce as the men inside tried to start his heart.<P>
Afterwards, one of the lifeguards told me that it happened all the time: "These weekend war-riors come out, and they're not in shape to do this sort of thing."<P> 
I left the beach and went back to my hotel room. I wasn't in the mood for the ocean, for dinner, for <I>anything</I>.<P> 
The next day, I read in the paper that the man had died. His heart, probably not used to exertion, gave out. The paper gave his name and age (he was 40, but he looked older) and said that he was from Texas. He had come to San Diego to visit a friend. That's all it said; no mention of occupation, no listing of any family, and no listing of any accomplishments.<P>
It's been two weeks now, and I haven't been able to shake the image of the man's death. It comes to me, mostly at night, around 3:00 a.m., and I see him floating in the middle of the ocean, miles away from land. I have to literally shake my head hard to get the image out of my mind. It's funny what thoughts come to you in the middle of the night. It reminds me of something Hemingway said in one of his books-"It's easy to be a brave man in the daylight."<P>
His death left me with something else, though. Call it a gift. I've come to realize that when I check out, I want to have accomplished something. I want the paper to list something more than my age, hometown, and cause of death. I don't think I'll accomplish my goals in the gym, though. No matter how hard I train, no matter how many hours I put in, no one will give a rat's ass what I looked like. If I can help it, my tombstone will not read: "He looked okay with his clothes off, and his friends always called him when they needed some heavy furniture moved."<P>
Don't get me wrong, though. The hours I spend in the gym are important to me, and no one will take them away from me. The gym is <I>my</I> grid- iron-my baseball diamond-it's my "athletic endeavor." Still, that's not how I want to be remembered.<P>
No, the hours I spend in the gym won't make a difference in someone else's life, and, at the risk of sounding like some namby-pamby do-gooder, that's what I think life is all about. Maybe it's like that corny movie, <I>It's a Wonderful Life</I>. (Who am I kidding? I love that movie.) That angel-I think his name was Clarence-says something along the lines of, "Each man's life touches so many others." If you had never lived, how would the world be different? If your answer is, "No different," then brother, you've got some living to do.<P>
At the risk of sounding overly preachy, life is about being a part of something, giving pleasure in some way to some one or some thing. You don't have to discover the cure for cancer to be important. Being a devoted parent, supportive husband, wife, boyfriend, or girlfriend is a noble accomplishment. So is being a kind employer or a loyal employee. I don't care if you clean toilets at night-if you do a good job at it, you've made someone else's life a little more tolerable. And, if your life revolves around the gym, that's great, too, as long as you're willing to share your knowledge and experience with others-maybe that's your "accomplishment." Or, if you've got the kind of body that inspires others, then that's your gift.<P>
Maybe my "accomplishment" in life will be helping someone avoid the kind of fate the man in the ocean met. Maybe I can save someone from a premature death. I may be deluded, but I think this magazine is a little better because I'm a part of it. I like to think I occasionally make a few people laugh. More importantly, I like to think I've occasionally passed on some knowledge or advice that's helped people improve their training or their health or helped people with their efforts to build a better body and improve self-esteem.<P>
You know, this sport started out being about health-looking good was secondary. Bodybuilders used to be called "health nuts." Can you imagine calling a bodybuilder a health nut nowadays? Ha! That's a crock.<P>
Well, maybe it should be about health. It should be about having a body that functions as well as it looks; it should be about hearts and lungs that work as well as our muscles;      it should be about an immune system that kicks ass. It should be about people who have boundless energy who don't have to depend on stimulants. It should be about supplements or drugs that enhance health. (Don't believe for a minute that all drugs are bad-in this day and age, drugs can be used as tools to make our bodies work better.) Above all, it should be about a body that doesn't break down when a little cardiovascular stress is imposed on it.<P>
After all, we're not necessarily trying to change what bodybuilding is all about. Health doesn't need to be its sole focus, but it should definitely be a part of it.<P> 
Please, I don't want any more images of death-particularly yours-haunting me. Do your cardiovascular work, stay away from the potent diuretics and the more dangerous drugs like insulin and IGF-1, and try to eat not only to add muscle but also to enhance health.<P>

Stay well<BR> 
(I really mean it),<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>Who won the Olympia contest this year? And what did you think of the show?<P></B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Let me see... I was at that show... I didn't have my notepad with me, but I think I can almost remember what happened...<P>
In the men's division, I think Flex Wheeler got sixth, that tall black guy who kind of looks like Frankenstein (the guy with more muscle in one of his arms than I have in my entire body!) got fifth, that new guy-the really, really huge one, I think his name is Nasser El Somebody got third, the amazing Shawn Ray got second, and the other great big huge guy from England won the contest again. Oh... wait a minute... I forgot fourth place. Damn, I can't remember who got fourth. Oh... I know... it was Kim Chizevsky-it was awesome!<P>
As for the Masters Mr. Olympia, I can kind of remember that one, too. Vince Taylor won that class. (I had no idea this guy was even close to 40!) Second through 15th place is just a blur though. I think I remember seeing Robby Robinson and Ed Corney in there somewhere, but I can't be sure-I watch the movie <I>Pumping Iron</I> a lot and may be having some kind of "memory crossover" or something. I'm sorry I can't give you the exact details. (One thing about the Masters Mr. Olympia that I think is great is it proves you don't have to stop abusing steroids when you get to be 40! That's just terrific.)<P>
Seriously, if you want a recap of the Mr., Ms., or Masters Olympia contest, check out the latest issue of <I>Flex</I> magazine. They always have the best contest coverage, the greatest photos, the whole nine yards. Even though I go to these contests, I really don't pay much attention to how the competitors place or what kind of shape they're in. To be honest, I just don't care. I go to these events because there's usually a trade show along with the competition, and this is a good opportunity for me to meet a lot of people like you who read my magazine and talk with some of the people in the industry. It's usually a really hectic weekend with a lot of work but also a lot of "partying" with good friends who come in from all parts of the country.<P>
However, I think next year we're just going to all get together in Vegas and do some real partying and forgo the Olympia. The trade show is getting boring, and if you've seen the contest once (which I did years and years ago), you've seen it a thousand times.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I think <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> is a great magazine-you're really doing a good job, but why don't you have a swimsuit issue like the other magazines? I love bodybuilding, but I have to admit I like looking at those sexy pictures of beautiful fitness girls. <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> would be even better if you came out with a swimsuit issue!</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Sometimes we make jokes about the other muscle magazines' swimsuit issues and their <I>extensive </I>coverage of "fitness babes," but when you really come right down to it, there's nothing wrong with showing photos of girls with nice bodies in string bikinis. After all, the vast majority (over 90%) of the people who read muscle magazines are guys, and it's no secret that men love to look at pictures of beautiful women.<P>
It's also no secret that the "swimsuit issues" of the various muscle magazines sell <B>much</B> better than their regular issues and, of course, with increased magazine sales, you have increased profits. Now, since we're in the magazine business, too, why don't we do a swimsuit issue to boost our sales and profits? Well, <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> will never, and I repeat <I>never</I>, have a swimsuit issue nor a "bikini girls of summer" issue or anything like that. It's not our style. We <I>lead</I>... we don't follow. All the other muscle magazines have done the swimsuit issue and the fitness girl thing already. They've done it again and again and again. (I think they're overdependent on it and have worn the concept out... all emphasis = no emphasis.)<P>
For me, it's a matter of principle. Sure, we could probably sell more magazines if we put in 30 pages of girls in bikinis, but I'm just not going to do it. I'd rather use that space for informative articles and other interesting things.  Plus, I refuse to succumb to that idiotic game of "follow the leader." Like I said, we <I>innovate</I>... we don't imitate.<P>
Besides, even <B>without</B> scads of photos of girls in bikinis, our sales are better than ever! As a matter of fact, the last issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> we have final newsstand sales for beat all the other hardcore bodybuilding magazines including <I>Flex</I>, <I>Muscular Development</I>, <I>MuscleMag</I>, and <I>Ironman</I>! That's an accomplishment we're very proud of. These magazines have a long-standing tradition of strong sales and success. Of course, <I>Flex </I>magazine is backed by the Weider publishing empire which started over 50 years ago. <I>Ironman </I>was founded 60 years ago, and <I>Muscular Development</I> and <I>MuscleMag </I>have been around for a long time, too.<P>
<I>Muscle Media 2000</I> is the "new kid on the block," and when I started this magazine just a little more than four years ago, the "powers that be" in this industry literally laughed at me. They knew I didn't have a lot of money. (And let me tell you, it takes a big chunk of change to survive that first year especially! Over nine out of ten new magazines <I>fail</I>!) They laughed even harder when they found out I wasn't going to cover any bodybuilding contests or pay homage to the bodybuilding "superstars," and I was going to tell the truth about steroids, supplements, and the numerous scams that go on in the bodybuilding industry. I know very well they didn't take me seriously. After all, I had virtually no money, a completely different ideology, no experience in the magazine business, and I was only a kid (in my 20's). And, to make things even more of a long shot, I would not then, and I still won't now, accept advertising from over half the companies that want to advertise in <I>Muscle Media 2000 </I>because I think their products are a scam. (Think about it... ever seen a Cybergenics ad in <I>MM2K</I>? A Hot Stuff ad? Nope. We wouldn't accept their ads, and there are dozens of others we turn down, too! Have you noticed <I>MM2K </I>has <I>far </I>fewer ads than the other muscle magazines?)<P>
Fortunately, my ideas weren't as "off the wall" as some people thought they were, and some bodybuilders supported my new enterprise, and over the past few years, we've experienced phenomenal growth.<P>
Anyway, my goal is and always has been to produce the best bodybuilding magazine there ever was. And, even though we're improving (I was <I>almost </I>satisfied with the last issue), I know we're not there yet. There are so many things we can improve on, and believe me, we're working on it day and night!<P>
The fact that we just recently beat all our competition head to head for the first time is certainly no reason to get comfortable or think we've reached our goals. Who knows, maybe it was just luck... or <I>maybe </I>it wasn't...<P>
All right.  What the hell was your question anyway?  Oh, a swimsuit issue.  Like I said, there will be <B>no</B> swimsuit issues for <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. I think we'll leave the 30-page features of babes in string bikinis to the other mags-I think I'll stand on the sidelines while they fight it out toe to toe (or "T to A") in an effort to see who can show the most skin without getting thrown off the newsstands. We're just going to try to be the best at what we do. I'm confident that will get us where we want to go.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I was thinking about trying the Cybergenics bodybuilding supplements. What do you think - are they any good?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Now here's an interesting story... Cybergenics was a very successful company throughout the late '80's and early '90's. For awhile, they were selling millions of dollars worth of supplements each month! But, over the past couple of years, their sales have gone in the toilet, and this company, which not too long ago was pulling in a profit of over a million dollars every 30 days, recently had to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy.<P>
On a semi-related note, another company that was also a multi, multi-million dollar success not that many years ago, called National Health Products, which sold a bodybuilding supplement many of you have heard about or maybe even tried called "Hot Stuff," is in a similar situation... their sales have plummeted over the past two years, leaving the company in serious financial jeopardy. As a matter of fact, the last I heard, the president of National Health Products, a guy named Tom Ciola, threw in the towel and headed for a bunker in Belize with his family explaining that Armageddon (the end of the world) was just around the corner. (I think I missed that memo...)<P>
A lot of people were surprised that these companies hit rock bottom because they were, not too long ago, so successful with such huge profits, but I saw this coming years ago. Bodybuilding supplement consumers are getting smarter all the time. This market is more informed now than ever before. In my opinion, products like Cybergenics and Hot Stuff (which were primarily based on marketing hype, not science) only sell in a market where the consumers are <I>un</I>informed. An educated consumer is a nightmare for them.<P>
I think today's bodybuilding-supplement buyer (which probably includes you) can take a lot of the credit for helping drive the final nail in these companies' coffins by refusing to buy from them because of the way their products were marketed and the lack of research behind them. You can ensure the "death" of several other unscrupulous supplement distributors by simply not buying their products. <I>You</I> have a <I>lot</I> of power-much more than you might realize.<P>
Of course, the answer to your question is that I don't think now, nor did I ever think, that the Cybergenics products were very good.<P> 

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I noticed there's a product being advertised in the other muscle mags called "Stack 6." It's supposed to contain HMB. Does it?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>The company that's selling this product now calls itself "AmeriFIT." (It was formerly known as Strength Systems.) Those of you who have been around the industry for awhile know that Strength Systems has a reputation that's right up there (or down there) with Cybergenics'. No... that's an insult to Cybergenics... Strength Systems/AmeriFIT is truly in a class of its own.<P>
This new product of theirs, Stack 6, is supposed to contain HMB, along with a number of other ingredients. The Iowa State University Research Foundation (ISURF), which owns the patent on HMB, and Metabolic Technologies, Inc. (MTI), a company that has licensed all the rights to the ISURF HMB patents, are pursuing AmeriFIT through legal channels, but that's not your problem. I know you don't really give a damn about who's suing whom and who's doing whom an injustice, etc. You just want to know if the product works. Right?<P> 
Okay. Here's what I know about Stack 6. The label reveals that a daily dose of this product contains only half a gram of HMB. That's about one-sixth of an effective dose according to all the studies I've seen. And, the instructions for Stack 6 call for you to take the half-gram dose of HMB all at once. Anyone who knows anything about HMB understands that it has a very short half-life in the blood-it's in and out of your system within a matter of hours. That's why you need to take a dose at least three times a day (some take six).<P>
It's obvious that whoever formulated this product doesn't know a thing about HMB except that it's a hot supplement on the bodybuilding market, and there's an opportunity to make some bucks off uninformed consumers who don't know any better.<P>
So, even if Stack 6 really contains beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), which I can't confirm it does, and even if they were licensed to use this patented product, which they aren't, I would be very inclined to believe that using half a gram of HMB, once a day, wouldn't do jack squat to help you build muscle size and strength nor lose bodyfat.<P>
As virtually all of you know, in addition to being the Executive Editor of this magazine, I also have a supplement company called Experimental and Applied Sciences (EAS), and I was the first to bring HMB to the market a little over a year ago. I know the HMB research (literally hundreds of pages of it) like the back of my hand. I can guarantee that I've never seen any evidence that stated using half a gram of HMB would do <I>anything</I> to benefit people who are weight training.<P>
The only athletes I've known who've experienced good results with HMB have been using three grams per day-the amount which has been shown to produce positive results in several clinical studies. A daily dose of the HMB product we sell contains three grams of HMB and is distributed under the appropriate licenses from ISURF and MTI. And, every single batch of HMB we sell is tested and tested again to ensure purity and potency.<P>
We respect the fact that the scientists and the university that were responsible for discovering the use of this muscle-building nutrient deserve credit, and they deserve to be paid royalties on the sales of this product to help recoup their investment and give them an incentive to forge ahead with new clinical studies in hopes of coming up with new technology and new supplement products that may help folks like you and me build more muscle. As a matter of fact, my company, EAS, has funded tens of thousands of dollars worth of HMB research to help further the science in this area. The most recent clinical study we provided a research grant for showed that HMB produces dramatic results (increased lean body mass, increased strength, reduced bodyfat) in women who train with weights. All the prior studies on exercising subjects have been performed with men. This is a very important finding and one that will be presented to the scientific community within the next few months.<P>
From where I stand, there's a <I>right way</I> and a <I>wrong way</I> to do business. I think the right way is to have the utmost respect for your customers, their intelligence, and their "power" to make or break you. Also, I think it's important to respect the doctors, scientists, and universities responsible for coming up with new discoveries that can help bodybuilders. EAS has formed a strong alliance with the scientific community. Our mission is to be unparalleled in the knowledge of scientific nutritional research, in the design and formulation of effective and safe supplements, in the collaborative support of university-level clinical research on our products, and in the application of this research to the marketplace.<P>
In my opinion, AmeriFIT does business the <I>wrong way</I>. Is their "Stack 6" another supplement scam? Well, you're smart enough... you tell me.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I learned a lot from reading your <I>1996 Supplement Review</I>. Are you going to have a 1997 edition? What about the 7th edition of your <I>Anabolic Reference Guide?</I></B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>There will, indeed, be a <I>1997 Supplement Review</I>. I've been compiling information for this book ever since I finished the last one, which was just about a year ago. The all-new, completely updated <I>1997 Supplement Review</I> is going to <I>completely</I> blow the 1996 version away! This book will not only give you the latest scientific and real-world information on popular supplements like creatine, HMB, ephedra, whey protein, vanadyl sulfate, glutamine, and so on but will also give you the complete lowdown on supplements that bodybuilders have just started experimenting with, like DHEA, acetyl-L-carnitine, melatonin, chrysin, Tribestan, pyruvate, and many, many more. I also reveal what the hottest new trends in bodybuilding supplementation will be.<P> 
This book contains volumes of never-before-published information-information that could save you hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars that you might waste on supplements which don't work and also provide you with key information that could truly catapult your gains in size and strength to new levels.<P>
Not only do I completely review virtually every muscle-building and fat-burning supplement you can think of, I also thoroughly analyze some unique supplements that may help you recover from training injuries faster, help detoxify your liver (great stuff for steroid users!!), help boost your immune system, and so on. This information is very exciting for people who are dedicated to looking and feeling great.<P>
And, on top of all this, the <I>1997 Supplement Review</I> has an expanded chapter on nutrition where I reveal what I think is an amazing breakthrough technique which allows you to use food to boost the levels of virtually every anabolic hormone in your body. Trust me, this nutritional theory will change the way you go about feeding your body, forever! And the chapter on training is just as exciting. I'm serious... the information in these two chapters will help you immensely!<P>
I promise this book will give you the <I>real answers</I> to virtually every question you could possibly ask about bodybuilding supplements, and you'll get all this information in simple, straightforward language without pages of complicated, scientific "mumbo-jumbo" and irrelevant crap.<P>
Because I am just as interested as you are in building muscle, losing fat, and gaining strength, I understand you want the hardcore, unadulterated truth-nothing more, nothing less. Well, that's exactly what you'll get in this all-new, completely updated <I>1997 Supplement Review!</I> I just can't find words to express how excited I am about this new project, which I've spent literally hundreds of hours on, with substantial contributions from some of the top Ph.D.'s and scientific experts in the field of nutrition, muscle metabolism, and athletic performance.<P>
Now, I'll bet you're waiting for me to give you the price and a phone number to order this new book... right? Well, if that's what you were expecting, you're wrong. Even though the <I>1997 Supplement Review</I> will be sold for $29.95 in ads in the other muscle magazines and even though I think it is far more valuable than other bodybuilding books you'll pay $40 or $50 for, because you are an <I>MM2K</I> reader, you can get one of the first copies of the <I>1997 Supplement Review</I> for FREE! All I'll ask you to do is send me three measly bucks to help cover shipping and handling charges. Fair enough?<P> 
The <I>1997 Supplement Review</I> is in its final rounds of editing right now; then we have to wrap up the graphics and send it to the printer. I expect we'll have the book ready to go in about six weeks. Please, read that last sentence again. Don't send me your name and address and then call in a week because you haven't received your book (we typically ship orders within 24 hours by Federal Express). I'm giving you the opportunity to "reserve" one of these books from the first printing. (I don't know how many we'll sell, so I think I'll print 10,000 copies to start.) If we go through those faster than I expect (it's impossible to forecast these things), we'll order more, but that could take another month before you get your book. I'd really like to see <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> readers get all of the copies of the <I>1997 Supplement Review</I> from this first printing.<P>
Okay, if you'd like to reserve your copy of the <I>1997 Supplement Review</I>, just write down your name, address, city, state, and zip code on any piece of paper, and send it to: Mile High Publishing, P.O. Box 277, Dept. #3000, Golden, CO 80402. Be sure to include three bucks to help cover shipping and handling charges, and allow six weeks for delivery.<P>
The 7th edition of the <I>Anabolic Reference Guide</I> is also on its way, but we're not quite done with that one. I think it'll be about three or four months before that book is ready, but it's going to totally kick ass also! I'll keep you posted on exactly when we expect to complete the 7th edition of the <I>Anabolic Reference Guide</I> and how you can order it.

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I recently got a flyer about a supplement called T3FX. What do you think of this product?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>I haven't had the chance to try T3FX, but I have taken a look at the ingredients. The compound contains acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC), which is an amino acid that some marketers and writers have alleged produces steroid-like effects. One writer (for another muscle magazine) recently claimed that ALC dramatically increases testosterone levels and was "proven" to be more effective than steroids for muscle building.<P>
I've discussed this compound before in my "Uncensored Q&A" column in an effort to set the record straight. I explained that no studies I've ever reviewed show that ALC causes an <I>increase </I>in testosterone. The studies show that ALC helps prevent a <I>decrease </I>in testosterone levels in laboratory animals that are subjected to significant stress.<P>
In theory, this may mean ALC could help keep testosterone levels from falling, especially in athletes who train extremely hard. I think it's also possible that ALC might help athletes who are dieting, as this is another time when testosterone levels can go down.<P>
The T3FX product you asked about also contains phosphatidylserine (PS), which is another interesting compound. PS has been shown to possibly suppress an increase in cortisol (that catabolic hormone which breaks down muscle tissue) in people who are subjected to intense exercise stress. Unlike the ALC studies that looked at testosterone levels, which were done in <I>animals</I>, the PS studies looked at cortisol levels in <I>humans </I>and found supplementation with this compound may produce a significant effect. Thus, PS may also have a potential benefit for athletes who are training very intensely.<P>
T3FX also contains glutamine, which, by now, virtually everyone knows is a very important amino acid for proper muscle metabolism.<P>
Now, the theory behind this T3FX product appears to be that ALC might prevent a decrease in testosterone which can occur with intense exercise or overtraining, and it may prevent an increase in cortisol, which can also occur with vigorous exercise. This is not an outrageous theory-if it really works, T3FX may improve your testosterone to cortisol ratio, which could result in an increase in muscle mass.<P>
T3FX seems like a decent quality supplement, and I think it would be an interesting product to test in a double-blind university study using healthy weight trainers. I'll look into that and let you know if we can get that done.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I'm trying to get totally cut for a bodybuilding contest I've got coming up in two months. I'm happy with the amount of muscle mass I've got-I just need to lose ten pounds of fat, and I know I'll be shredded. My problem is, I can't stick to my diet. It seems that after a couple of days of really clean, strict eating, I get outrageous cravings, and sometimes I just cave in. I read about this new appetite suppressant called Redux in the newspaper. Do you think something like that could help me stick to my diet?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>The cravings you're experiencing are not at all uncommon. And, when some-   one like a bodybuilder, who is already very lean by human physiology standards, attempts to get even leaner (going from eight to four percent bodyfat), the brain puts out powerful signals to eat, eat, eat! Your brain thinks you're starving yourself to death.<P>
Of course, people understand that bodybuilders have to train hard, take supplements, and so on, but I think very few have a full appreciation of the incredible amount of discipline and the shear agony it takes to get that totally shredded, cut-up look. Sure, a lot of the top bodybuilders use fat-burning drugs like clenbuterol, ephedrine, thyroid, and so on, but even with the extra assistance of those compounds, you have to maintain a calorie intake that is below what your body requires. Of course, this is the only way you'll pull fat from those storage compartments (like around your belly and lower back) and use that "fat energy" to fuel your metabolism.<P>
There are certain ways to control your appetite without using drugs. One of them is to try to keep your blood sugar levels stable by eating a high-protein diet (which has been shown to suppress the appetite in clinical studies), but sometimes even that's not enough. Precontest or pre-photo-shoot dieting is an absolute bitch!<P>
Although we haven't talked about appetite suppressants much in <I>MM2K</I>, they are widely used by bodybuilders. The drug you mentioned, Redux, is a brand name for dexfenfluramine, which was just approved by the FDA last April. It's already an extremely popular drug, but it's not the favorite of the bodybuilders I know.<P>
A drug called Fastin (phentermine hydrochloride) seems to be the most popular appetite suppressant for precontest bodybuilders. Fastin is similar but stronger than another popular appetite suppressant called Ionamin (phentermine resin). Fastin pretty much kills your appetite, but it's not an amphetamine (like another popular diet drug called Dexedrine which works but is very addictive).<P>
One 30-mg capsule of Fastin a day, first thing in the morning, works wonders. (Of course, some pro bodybuilders take 60 mg, but I would NOT advise this as this drug is a strong central-nervous-system [CNS] stimulant.)<P>
Phentermine is available in Mexico under the brand name Diminex and also in the U.S. under the brand name Oby-Trim. It's also available under the brand name Adipex-P in 37.5-mg strength.<P>
I remember Duchaine once wrote that he thought phentermine was kind of weak, but I promise you, it gets the job done. Not only does it eliminate the cravings you get during a strict diet but also gives you such a CNS boost that it helps supercharge training sessions.<P>
Another appetite suppressant I know a lot of bodybuilders use is called Pondimin (fenfluramine hydrochloride). This drug is available in 20-mg tablets.<P>
Pondimin is not an amphetamine and does not stimulate the CNS-it's more of a  depressant than a stimulant. Pondimin should be used   with <I>extreme</I> caution by bodybuilders who are using insulin because it decreases blood sugar levels dramatically and, along with exogenous insulin use, can be very dangerous (even deadly!). The recommended dose of  Pondimin is 60 to 120 mg a day.<P>
Here's a quick rundown on some other appetite suppressants I know bodybuilders use: Sanorex (mazindol) is a powerful appetite suppressant that comes in one- and two-milligram tablets. I think this stuff overstimulates the nervous system and makes you weak, dizzy, depressed, and nauseous. This is definitely not a good choice.<P>
Desoxyn (methamphetamine hydrochloride) is a powerful appetite suppressant. This stuff comes in five-milligram tablets and has a half-life of about four hours. It's a relatively strong CNS stimulant and is quite effective, but it is known to cause dizziness, restlessness, and brutal headaches. A low dosage of five to ten milligrams in the morning and an additional five milligrams five to six hours later would be sufficient, and I don't think it should be used for more than three weeks at a time. Of course, this stuff is highly addictive as it is a methamphetamine. If you try it, make sure you eat first because it can cause all kinds of stomach disturbances and an extremely dry mouth.<P>
Another appetite suppressant called Didrex (benz-phetamine hydrochloride) is also used by some bodybuilders. This stuff is a strong CNS stimulant and comes in 25- and 50-mg tablets. Anyone who tries this stuff should only stay on it for a couple of weeks and should use only 50 mg instead of the 75- to 150-mg recommended dosage.<P>
Of course, all of these drugs should be used with extreme caution and, if at all possible, under the care of a physician. All of these medications have potential side effects like nervousness, headaches, anxiety, etc., but the latest word on Redux (dexfenfluramine) and other appetite suppressants that work through a similar mechanism is that there is an increased risk of users developing a rare type of pulmonary hypertension that's usually fatal. Of course, it certainly seems like the chances of your suffering from this rare condition are remote, but there is a risk nonetheless. Also, you really shouldn't use any of the drugs for more than four to six weeks at a time. As TC discusses in his Q&A column this issue, the prolonged use of certain appetite suppressants may increase cortisol levels.<P>
Because I know just how brutal and agonizing strict dieting is, I'm looking into a number of natural appetite suppressants-dietary supplements that wouldn't be quite as powerful as these drugs but which exert an effect that's definitely noticeable. There are two compounds that interest me in particular-the first helps reduce the overall appetite (and the "cravings" some people have for alcohol, believe it or not). The second nutrient substantially reduces cravings for high-fat foods (like peanut butter, French fries, donuts, etc.) which are common on a strict diet. My company, EAS, is planning to fund a series of clinical studies at two very prestigious universities to evaluate these supplements (which are not available at this time). Hopefully, something positive will come of this, but you never know for certain until you put it to the test.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I read about some supplements in another magazine that have supposedly been proven to work in double-blind studies. I took some advice one of your writers, Anthony Almada, shared with me and called the company up and asked them to send me copies of the studies, including information on where they were done, what doctor was in charge of the studies, and what scientific conference they were presented at. The guy I talked to got very defensive and said the studies were confidential at this time. What's that all about?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>There are a couple of things going on in the bodybuilding supplement market that you need to be aware of. First, the good news-there are legitimate scientists (some very brilliant ones at that) who are involved in some very promising research involving how to get "steroid-like" gains (at least kind of) by using supplements instead of drugs. Of course, everyone who knows anything about bodybuilding understands that creatine monohydrate is the greatest example of this-numerous studies show this stuff produces positive effects, even under the most rigorous trials. And now, some other compounds are showing promise.<P>
Supplement marketers (who, for the most part, tend to be a bunch of fuckin' scumbags) are aware of the fact that consumers are looking for products that are backed by science, and these lowlifes are trying to convince you that that's what they've got. So, they simply make up lies and say things like they've studied their products extensively in university studies, but they don't say what universities, what doctors, when, where, how, why, etc. They don't give you the facts. Why? Because they basically think you're an idiot and that you'll believe anything.<P>
Another thing some supplement marketers are doing is citing scientific references about a compound and then blowing everything out of proportion. Let me think of an example... oh, here's one: there's a supplement called OKG (ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate) which some scientific studies have shown has an effect when massive quantities are fed to very ill people who are undergoing massive muscle loss (catabolism or, more specifically, proteolysis). In this setting, OKG has the potential to produce an anti-catabolic effect-it can  stop muscle wasting and improve protein metabolism.
Now, some marketers will tell you that OKG has been "scientifically proven" to build muscle and exert powerful steroid-like effects, and they base these claims on scientific research on sick people.<P>
So basically, they're misrepresenting the science in an effort to convince you that they've got something that's "scientifically proven" even though it's not.<P>
What needs to be done (and my company will hopefully get to it soon) is to have a qualified Ph.D. or M.D. design a study to be conducted at a legitimate university which would evaluate the effects of OKG (and dozens of other supplements that are supposed to "work") on test subjects who are representative of the typical bodybuilder.<P>
This is what EAS has done with Phosphagen, Phosphagen HP, Phosphagain, and HMB. We've tested the effects <I>directly</I> on healthy, weight-training individuals and have analyzed the parameters that consumers in this market care about-things like lean body mass, strength, fat mass, endurance, health, and so on.<P>
We're now in the process of doing the same thing for several other products. These studies are performed at legitimate universities by real doctors who don't work for EAS, and then the results are presented at scientific conferences where researchers share information with one another. Then the results are written up in manuscript form and submitted to publications like the <I>International Journal of Sport Nutrition</I> (which just published a peer-reviewed, full-length paper on the positive effects of Phosphagain) or the <I>American Journal of Applied Physiology</I> (which has peer reviewed and accepted for publication a very detailed study on the positive effects of HMB) and so on.<P>
A lot of companies know supplement consumers today are looking for real science-so they'll try to convince you that's what they've got. Approach these companies with extreme caution-if they're going to bullshit you about having "scientific proof" when they don't, I wouldn't trust anything about them. As always, we'll try to keep you informed about these con artists.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>I really like using the smith machine when I bench press. It's more comfortable than the conventional bar, and I don't have to worry about balancing the weight. Should I incorporate it into my overall chest routine?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>To be frank, I don't think much of the smith machine. In fact, when I design weight rooms for clients, I never recommend that they buy a smith machine. Of course, if a dork asks me a question about chest training while I'm in the middle of my workout, I quickly recommend 10 sets of 20 reps on the smith machine.<P> 
The smith machine, because of its guiding rods, only allows for a linear movement; therefore, the joints are not used to stabilize the movement. And there's the added safety of the hooks that allow you to rack the bar when concentric muscle failure occurs. One of the reasons the smith machine has gotten so much publicity in the magazines is because, visually, it looks good. But as far as functional aspects, it scores a big zero.<P>
What most perceive as being positives with the device are in fact negatives. The perceived positives are short lived. You see, in a smith machine, the weight is stabilized for you, which limits you to just one plane of movement. In reality, however, the shoulder operates in three planes. None of the shoulder stabilizers are recruited maximally in exercises done with this device. For example, the rotator-cuff muscles don't have to fire as much because the pathway of the bar is fixed. That creates a problem when the trainee returns to "three-dimensional," free-weight training. Since the trainee has developed strength in only one dimension, because of the smith machine, it predisposes him or her to injury in the undeveloped planes of movement.<P> 
Paul Chek is a therapist who has treated numerous weightlifting injuries. He has identified what he calls the "pattern-overload syndrome." He states in his seminar and videos that the smith machine bench press is one of the most common causers of shoulder injuries: "People who use the smith machine get a pattern overload," Chek says. "The more fixed the object, the more likely you are to develop a pattern overload. This is due to the fact that training in a fixed pathway repetitively loads the same muscles, tendons, ligaments, and joints in the same pattern, encouraging micro-trauma which eventually leads to injury. If Johnny Lunchpail always uses a smith machine for his bench presses, he'll always work the same fibers of the prime movers in the bench press: the triceps brachii, pectoralis major, long head of the biceps, anterior deltoids, and serratus anterior."<P>
Because of the mechanics of the human shoulder joint, the body will alter the natural pathway of the bar during a free-weight bench press to accommodate efficient movement at the shoulder. A fixed-bar pathway does not allow variation for efficient movement of the joint, thereby predisposing the shoulder to harmful overload from the lack of accommodation. <P>
All in all, the smith machine is a training piece for dorks. If you're interested in training longevity, you're far better off sticking to the standard barbell and dumbbell exercises, or give the newer machines like the Cybex VR2 line a try.<P>



<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> What is the relationship between size and strength? How closely are the two related? Do you think it's possible to build strength without increasing size?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> Contrary to popular belief, muscle growth and muscular strength are not always related. You may look strong but not be able to play the part. If you ever get to look at the humongous arms of Paul Dillett and Vince Taylor and see the poundages they used to build them, you'll be utterly convinced that these two aspects aren't necessarily related. These famous bodybuilders use poundages that even some novice trainees with six months of experience can handle.<P>
I know of at least 2 top 10 Mr. Olympia contestants who can barely bench press 315 lbs for 8 reps in decent form. And these guys weigh more than 270 lbs. The same bench press poundages are easily handled by Olympic judokas and wrestlers who weigh 60-70 lbs less than the professional bodybuilders (of the same height). In other words, the relationship between a muscle's cross-section and its strength is fairly low initially. But the correlation increases when you consider muscle growth combined with maximal strength.<P> 
What does that mean in plain English? Well, if John has 14-inch arms and Bob has 16-inch arms, who has the strongest arms? You can't tell by looks alone. Just because John's arms are smaller doesn't mean he's weaker. You can't tell exactly which one can curl or press more until you actually test them. In other words, John may be the one who can curl more than Bob. And, with diligent training and proper nutrition, if John increases his arm circumference to the 16-inch mark like his friend Bob, then you can be sure his curling poundages went up, too. Some studies pointed out that an increase of 17% of muscle mass results in an 85% gain in maximal strength.<P>
What does this mean to you? You must strive to increase your maximal strength in bodybuilding exercises to cause muscle growth. This can be accomplished if the time under tension for every set is at least 20 seconds. Better results for growth training will occur in time-under-tension sets of 40 to 60 seconds.<P>
Can one increase strength without increasing muscle mass? Of course. If we look at the bench press, the first man to bench 600 lbs weighed in excess of 280 lbs. Nowadays, men in the 200-lb class can bench 600 lbs.<P>
World powerlifting champion Cathy Millen improved her bench-press performance from 281 lbs while weighing 165 lbs to 407 lbs at 184 lbs of bodyweight. She increased her bench press by 126 lbs while increasing her overall bodyweight by only 19 lbs, so for every pound she gained in bodyweight, her bench went up 6.6 lbs.<P>
To increase strength without increasing muscle mass, one must follow a training protocol that will tap into the high-threshold motor units. Namely, do multiple sets (6 to 12) of very low reps (1 to 3) at 90% or more of one's one-rep maximum, interspersed with long rest intervals, ranging from 3 to 5 minutes.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>In a recent bodybuilding publication, I read an article by one of your colleagues who writes on periodization of strength. He criticized a study which demonstrated that spot reduction was impossible. He stated that high reps would help burn localized fat. What do you think? Is there hope my girlfriend will be able to get rid of her saddlebags if she does high-rep lunges?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Well, let's put everything into perspective. What this author did (or attempted to do) was completely discredit the scientific basis of a study on the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of spot reducing. With his talents of trashing the credibility of the study, I'm surprised they didn't hire him to be on O.J.'s defense team. By placing doubt in the readers' minds, he preprogrammed them to accept the training concept he advocates for spot reducing-namely using extremely high reps.<P>
Now, if spot reducing were possible, you'd expect athletes who compete in unilateral sports; i.e., tennis, badminton, Olympic canoeing, etc., to have lower skin folds in the arms and scapulas that are predominantly used in these respective sports. This doesn't happen. Consider the number of hits Andre Agassi and Thomas Muster must have completed over their brilliant tennis careers. This number far exceeds the 2 to 3 sets of 100 reps performed twice weekly in the "spot-reduction" training protocol. Or look at the thousands and thousands of meters the average Olympic canoeist does over the seven- to ten-year period it takes him to reach the Olympic level. With that much volume of lat work behind him, you'd expect the subscapular skin fold to be significantly lower in the dominant arm that propels the boat. The truth of the matter is that there is <B>no</B> significant difference in skin-fold measurements in the non-dominant versus the dominant arm in Olympic canoeists, tennis players, and badminton players. Sorry to disappoint you, but there is no scientific or empirical evidence to give any sort of support to the concept of spot reducing.<P>
The best exercise your girlfriend can do to lose those saddlebags is neck exercises before every meal: when handed a plate of food, she should move her head left then right for two reps!

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> I've been using the PlateMates described in "TC Talks" (<I>MM2K</I>, August 1996). I know you're a big believer in micro-increments. Is there a place where I could get the same stuff for Olympic barbells?</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>Yes, there is. The Eleiko weightlifting company carries what they call record plates. You can order these from Sports Strength Training at 1-800-285-9634. The record plates are available in 0.25-kg, .5-kg, and 1.25-kg weights.<P> 

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> I'm interested in developing the teardrop muscle in my quads. I think it's called the vastus medialis. I really like squats. Are there any variations of the squat that may help accentuate the development of that muscle?</B> 
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>If squats are the mainstay of your leg-training routine and you want to increase the recruitment of the vastus medialis muscles, you have the choice of a) using a specific foot position or b) overloading the bottom position.<P> 
The foot position that will maximize the recruitment of the vastus medialis requires that you place the load on the arch of the foot. This is best accomplished by using a narrow stance and elevating and moving the center of gravity of the body forward by using something to elevate the heels (like a board).<P>
By doing more work in the bottom position, you'll increase the recruitment of the vastus medialis muscles since these are responsible (along with the hamstrings) for getting you out of the bottom position.<P>
Knee injuries are fairly common in American football players, and I strongly suspect that one of the major causes is the improper ratio of strength between all heads of the quadriceps and the hamstrings. This offset ratio comes from using an incomplete range of motion in squats (coming from strength coaches obsessed with claiming big numbers for their squads) and many partial movements such as hang power cleans.<P> 
Here are two techniques the Olympic athletes I coach use to develop the vastus medialis muscle.  You may want to try them.<P>
<B>Cyclist squats:</B> an Olympic-level cyclist used this technique to attain world-record performances in the track events. In this variation of the back squats, you want to use a board to rest your heels on in a narrow stance (four to six inches between the heels). A wedged board is the best type for this exercise because it will support the arch of the foot. The higher the wedge, the more recruitment of the vastus medialis. You'll also find that you'll squat more upright when using the wedged board, causing less recruitment of the gluteal muscles. As far as reps and sets are concerned, the German volume training method as explained in <I>MM2K</I>, July 1996, applies particularly well to this exercise if you're truly motivated to get this muscle to grow.
<B>One and a quarter squats:</B> this technique is used to train Olympic skiers to offset their enormous development of the vastus lateralis (the large muscle on the outside of the leg) and prepare their knees for the risky situations they often face. Squat down for a five-second count until you hit the bottom position, then come up a quarter of the way at a slow, deliberate pace. Go back down and come up until your knees are just short of lockout. That's one rep. Performing four to five sets of four to eight reps of the one and a quarter squats will stimulate your vastus medialis muscles for maximal growth.
Give each of these techniques a fair try for six different leg workouts. I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I have acne on my lower back and shoulders. I've tried special soap, and it helped only slightly. Are these pimples permanent?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> You should see a dermatologist before the pimples start scarring your skin-scarring can occur even when the pimples are clearing up. Your doctor will prescribe the appropriate therapy, which will include a mild antibiotic. But I'd like to point out a few other potential therapies that your doctor probably won't be aware of which have been used with great success by other bodybuilders with this problem. The herbal extract saw palmetto, in capsules, has a mild anti-inflammatory effect on the prostate, and we've also seen it reduce the inflammation of swollen acne.<P> 
Also, Nizoral, the prescription anti-fungal shampoo, has a topical and local anti-androgen effect on hair follicles and sebaceous (oil) glands. We've been using this shampoo not only on the hair for its DHT-blocking effects but also as a facial and body soap scrub on any problem acne areas, and we've seen improvements. Nizoral also works well at reducing the overly oily areas of skin that occur with steroid use.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I was given testo-sterone Androderm patches which deliver 2.5 mg of testosterone; however, these patches contain 12 mg of testosterone. Is it possible to break open the patches and use DMSO to use all the testosterone in the patch, or could I wear the patches longer than the directed 24 hours to absorb more? Would it be more beneficial, in regards to building muscle mass, to request testosterone injections every two weeks instead of the Androderm patches?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> You haven't included some pertinent information; i.e., your current total testosterone blood level while you're wearing the patch. The Androderm patch was the first testosterone patch commercially available in this country. It uses a somewhat crude transdermal solvent that is not terribly efficient in transferring the testosterone into the body. This patch is worn on a (shaved) scrotum because that's the most permeable skin for hormone transfer. The downside is that scrotal skin contains high amounts of 5-alpha-reductase, the enzyme which converts regular testosterone into the more androgenic, less anabolic dihydrotestosterone (DHT).<P>
The other testosterone patch, Testoderm, has a better transdermal carrier, so the patch can be worn on any part of the body. Other skin areas, though, are more resistant to hormone transference, so consequently, two patches are needed, as much of the testosterone is "lost." As patches go, the original Androderm patch has a greater release rate, better duplicating the natural circadian (24-hour interval) testosterone cycle in the body.<P> 
If you somehow scraped all the testosterone out of an Androderm patch and dissolved it in DMSO, yes, you would achieve a better transfer of the hormone. But all you'd achieve is a short increase of testosterone for about 20 minutes, and the rest of the day, you'd have a very low blood level. Drug companies avoid using DMSO as a transdermal carrier for three reasons: 1) it isn't FDA approved, 2) it's highly irritating to the skin, and 3) the garlicky aftertaste is deemed offensive. The hardest part of designing a transdermal 
carrier is getting it to work with the drug in a sustained and predictable manner. Most of these transdermal agents are exclusive to the drug companies and are patented. This way, another competing company can't market a clone Androderm patch with the same carrier.<P>
Generally speaking, testo-sterone injections tend to generate much higher blood levels than the patches do. Neither of these patches will elevate blood testosterone levels into the high (and beyond) range. A healthy young man will secrete between seven and ten milligrams of testosterone a day. Obviously, a 200-mg injection of testosterone cypionate every 2 weeks will significantly elevate blood testosterone levels compared to when you use a patch. And for anabolism, the higher the blood testosterone level, the better. The recent <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> testosterone study used 600 mg a week of testosterone which elevated blood levels to over 2,000 ng/dl; that's double the naturally occurring upper limit.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I'm terribly discouraged. Whenever I start a diet, I do well for about a month, and then I get stuck and stop losing weight. So I go off the diet and eat normally again. Of course, then I get fat again. Am I just going to be fat for the rest of my life? Would your <I>BODYOPUS</I> diet work for me?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> Virtually all weight-loss diets will stop working eventually. Even a starvation diet (no food) will stop working when you die. The obvious, simple solution for most dieters when they get stuck and stop losing weight is simply to lower the calories even more than they did initially. Unfortunately, after the calories have been reduced to a certain point, we start losing almost as much muscle as we do fat.<P> 
Your body will try to preserve itself (all of it, even the unwanted fat) by making your metabolism more efficient, so whatever calories you're consuming at the time will be enough to sustain you without causing further weight loss. The two major adjustments that lower your metabolism are reductions of thyroid and noradrenaline, so all nutrient-demanding processes such as basal body temperature and protein turnover are slowed.<P> 
The three common remedies for getting unstuck on a diet are 1) lower calories, 2) increase energy expenditure (usually with extra aerobics), or 3) drop carbs. Or if someone is absolutely panic stricken, he or she will try all three solutions at once. So let's discuss your options. The sanest advice is, start eating normally again (i.e., more calories) in hopes that your metabolism will revert to its previous higher state. The typical problem here is that the dieter assumes that by eating the previous pre-diet maintenance calorie amounts, the metabolism will reset. What usually happens, though, is a slight gain in fat because the old calorie level is now excessive. So if you're going to take a diet break, assume that your pre-diet maintenance is a little too high at first, and slowly add extra calories.<P>
Lowering calories is not a terribly bad idea as long as the initial calorie reduction was moderate. Obviously, whatever your present calorie level is, it has become your new maintenance level. So if you wanted to resume a pound-a-week fat loss, you'd need to debit your food intake by another 500 calories a day. The daily calorie amount that starts causing significant muscle loss is what I call the "catabolic threshold." It varies, however, depending on the sex, weight, and "anabolic status" of the individual, but the catabolic threshold that encompasses most of the non-monster bodybuilders is 2,000 calories for men and 1,500 for women. This means that if you get stuck at these points or below, a 500-calorie drop will mean you'll resume fat loss, but you'll also lose muscle tissue at an accelerated rate.<P>
Many nutritionists and coaches blithely recommend that dieters increase the aerobic energy expenditure each day when the diet stops working; the logic here is that this low-level energy increase will better preserve muscle-more so than reduced calories. Perhaps some textbook or research study will validate this theory, but in the real world, we've found that even moderate amounts of daily aerobics will cause your body to sacrifice a surprisingly large amount of muscle, usually greater than if you were to just reduce your calorie intake alone.<P>
You might expect that I advocate "dropping the carbs" as a means of resuming the fat loss, as I alluded to in <I>BODYOPUS</I>. At first, this option seems attractive. The higher-carb diets tend to cause the body to hold more fluids, and a lowering of dietary carbs acts like a diuretic, flushing some water out of the skin, so the scale shows an almost instant weight loss, and the drier skin can increase vascularity. However, if you're replacing the carb calories with fat calories, you'll actually have less fat loss because fat doesn't oxidize as much as carbs or protein. The bottom line is that eating dietary fat won't raise your body temperature as much as eating protein or carbohydrates. Nonetheless, as I've pointed out before, the increase of body temperature is minimal and is usually countered because dieters become more hungry (and end up eating more) on high-carb diets.<P>
Of course, replacing the carb calories with fat calories is still an attractive option since you'll have the side benefits of reducing hunger because you'll have a more stable blood sugar level, and dietary fat improves nitrogen retention, so your muscle loss will be slowed.<P> 
If you replace the carb calories with protein, you'll get a greater fat loss than with either fat or carb calories because only part of the protein (the glutamine and the branched-chain amino acids) can be used as energy, and the oxidative rate of protein is much higher than fat. Part of the protein will be converted to urea, which will be excreted.<P> 
In simple terms: replacing carb calories with fat calories will slightly lower your body temperature, but eating protein won't. If there is any drawback to eating a higher-protein diet, it's the potential of reducing nitrogen retention. It doesn't seem possible that eating more protein could result in losing more muscle than eating (of all things) fat, but it can. Many of us have done that same switch-dropped carbs and increased protein. And even if one is using anabolic steroids, muscle is lost.<P>
Am I telling you that as the stuck dieter you're completely screwed? No, because with careful planning, you can easily sustain a 12-week diet cycle and never get stuck. You should begin with a moderate-fat diet (such as the Isocaloric Diet or the Zone), and set calories at no more than ten percent below maintenance. Every morning when you wake up, take your temperature and write it down. If you find that your morning temperature has dropped by half a degree for more than 3 days, you should replace 20% of your fat calories with carbohydrates. This will slightly elevate your body temperature due to a higher oxidation of the carbs. When your morning temperature drops again three days in a row, you should replace the substituted carb amount with protein. Why? Because protein calories are inefficient energy calories, and you'll experience a resumed fat loss because much of the amino acids will be jettisoned as urea.<P>
But switching from carbs to protein won't raise your declining body temperature. Research has shown that low-calorie diets increase alpha2 receptors and cause a reduction of the thermogenic adrenalines. You can, however, block this bad action and boost your natural adrenaline by using a yohimbe supplement or prescription yohimbine.<P>
But eventually, even with a high-oxidative nutrient rate and boosted noradrenaline, your body temperature would once again try to decline because the thyroid is less active. Before you contemplate using a prescription thyroid medication, there's an herbal preparation that increases thyroid output. Enzymatic Therapy sells GugulPlus, which is 25 mg of the Indian herb guggulsterones. Guggulsterones causes an uptake of iodine in the thyroid and increases the secretion of both T4 and T3. The dosage is 25 mg 3 times a day.<P>
If your body temperature eventually declined again, you could then resort to the traditional stack of ephedrine, caffeine, and aspirin. If you've followed my previous advice exactly, at this point you can again consider lowering your calories another five percent. If you plan beforehand, you won't ever get stuck, and you should reach your diet goal on schedule with minimal loss of muscle.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I would like to know if Winstrol-V and some testosterone would make a good cycle. I'd like to use 1 cc of Winstrol-V every other day and 1 cc of testosterone once a week.<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  Let's make believe you're not in the U.S. and what you're doing isn't illegal. I have a feeling that if you tried using testosterone alone for a few weeks and then added the Winstrol-V, you wouldn't feel much difference in terms of size, although you might find a slight increase in strength. Testosterone is more anabolic and binds to the steroid receptor better than Winstrol. The better cycle would be a stagger rather than a stack. You'd have better results by using 2 cc's (400 mg) of testosterone a week, and when you want to stop using steroids, replace the testosterone each week with the Winstrol and finally taper off the Winstrol. Winstrol does not convert to estrogen (testosterone does), so by switching to Winstrol after using testosterone, your estrogen levels, which are elevated from the injected testosterone, will fall. This will allow your own testosterone to return to normal levels.<P> 
If you did both steroids at once, you'd still have elevated estrogen levels, which signals the brain to stop producing natural testosterone. Granted, many top bodybuilders do stack testosterone and Winstrol (and many other steroids), but they hardly ever stop taking steroids, so they never have to plan for maintaining size during long spans of non-steroid use.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I've heard the newest secret for dieting for a bodybuilding contest is using insulin. But I read that both you and Dr. Barry Sears tell people to lower insulin secretion. What gives? And if insulin is a good idea, how do I use it?<P></B>


<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> In this case, everybody's right. At maintenance calories and above, minimizing insulin secretion will cause less carbohydrates to be converted to triglycerides and deposited as fat. To do this, you should eat less carbohydrates and replace them with fats and protein. Or if you want to continue with your high-carb diet, you can select your carb sources so that the glycemic index rating is at 70 or below. Either of these methods will improve glycogen storage and minimize bodyfat.<P>
However, in a low-calorie situation, it appears that minimizing insulin, for most dieters, shows no physical benefit. As a matter of fact, with the higher-fat, low-calorie diet, not as much fat is lost. Yes, I've found that many women with an uneven fat distribution, where most of the bodyfat is in the lower body, do better on lowered insulin. But most men don't have this problem.<P> 
So is insulin use while dieting a good idea? Many of the top pro bodybuilders use insulin along with growth hormone, and they all swear that insulin is the chief reason their contest bodyweights are significantly higher now than in years past. Back then, everybody thought insulin just made you fat and sleepy, and nobody would ever consider using it, especially while dieting. And insulin seems doubly attractive since it's not a prescription drug, and a 10-cc bottle costs less than $20. Needles are a problem in some states, but they can always be mail ordered. Insulin is a potent anabolic hormone, and low-calorie diets usually cause some degree of muscle loss. Properly administered, insulin could potentially restore both the glycogen and the amino acids lost during dieting, so there would be no muscle loss.<P> 
Most doctors will tell you that injecting insulin when you're on a low-calorie diet (if you're not a diabetic) is reckless and dangerous. That important warning out of the way, the safest insulin to use while dieting is the fastest-acting one; e.g., Humulin R. This insulin activity lasts four hours, with an onset occurring within a half hour and the peak activity at about two hours after the injection. The potential problem with the other longer-acting insulins is that a sudden drop of blood sugar could happen at almost any point within 12 hours, especially since the dieter has reduced the amount of carbohydrates he or she ingests.<P> 
On the other hand, a 12-hour insulin activity might be beneficial if you maintained a positive nitrogen balance with just a minor lowering of blood glucose (somewhere around 75 mg/dl). Nonetheless, at the present time, we've yet to find the ideal insulin type and daily dosage to do this. So stay away from any insulin other than the "R" versions.<P>
On a low-calorie diet, it appears that the ideal time to use the Humulin R is immediately after a workout. The insulin injection should be timed so your post-workout carb meal is digested and released into the bloodstream at about two hours after the injection. We know that the quicker the post-workout meal is consumed, the better. Personally, I've been able to take an insulin shot right before my workout, train for an hour, drive home, and then slam some Gatorade before I get the insulin sugar crash. But most other insulin users inject their dosages about a half hour before the end of their workouts. The anecdotal, rough guideline that we use for adjusting the Humulin R dosage has been one IU for every 15 lbs of lean bodyweight. For the typical male bodybuilder who weighs 200 lbs at 10% bodyfat, the Humulin R dosage would be 12 IU's. The other guideline is the amount of carbohydrates needed to maintain blood glucose with the injected insulin: this has been 10 grams (40 calories) for each IU. So if you're using 12 IU's of insulin, you'll need 480 calories of carbohydrates; otherwise, your blood sugar will drop, and you won't feel all that terrific.<P>
However, I've found that these guidelines don't work well when a person is ingesting low calories. Usually, the person takes the insulin and then eats the estimated carb meal. And after two or more hours, when blood glucose begins to decline, the dieter becomes ravenous and eats more carbs. But these extra calories bring the daily calorie total up quite a bit higher than anticipated, so the diet is blown for that day. On low calories, 1 IU for every 15 lbs of lean bodyweight is too much (unless the dieter has drastically restricted his or her carbs for all other meals). So we've found, from trial and error, that on low calories, 1 IU for every 20 lbs of lean bodyweight for men and 1 IU for every 25 lbs of lean bodyweight for women seems to work best.<P> 
And the type of carbs consumed after the insulin injection has a noticeable effect on blood sugar and hunger. On maintenance calories or above, any carb source will work because you can always eat more if you start to get the shakes from low blood sugar. On low calories, you need a mixture of fast, medium, and slow-releasing carbohydrates, so as the insulin becomes active in the bloodstream, your liver is supplying glucose adequately. We usually use a mixture of rice cakes and Gatorade, yams (the canned ones, drained), and some vegetables or fruits that have a glycemic index under 50-fast, medium, and slow, respectively. The 40 calories for each IU of Humulin R still holds true, just try to split the carb amount into thirds: one third Gatorade and rice cakes, one third yams, and the last third a salad or some highly fibrous fruits (e.g., apples). Feeding your insulin spike this way will help you avoid the rampant munchies later on.<P>
Lastly, I should warn that taking insulin when you're not diabetic is not a game. The consequences are potentially fatal.

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I presently weigh 150 lbs with 10% bodyfat. I'm 16 and still growing, so my calorie intake must be higher than most 200-lb adults. Is there any way I can get rock-hard abs and bring my bodyfat percentage down to seven without starving myself?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> Since you have a pretty low bodyfat percentage already, I wouldn't recommend dieting because you're at an age when you can really build a solid foundation of muscle mass. Although it would require more discipline than what you might want to commit to, my BODYOPUS cyclic ketogenic diet would give you the best of both worlds. During the week, your daily calories can stay at the same maintenance level that you use now, and you can overeat carbohydrates on the weekends. Remember, the cyclic ketogenic diet was originally formulated as a weight-gain plan for hardgainers. The side effect is a reduction of bodyfat. Nitrogen retention is highest on the higher-fat diets, and most of your calories during the week will come from fats. All other weight-reduction plans will hinder optimal nitrogen retention (at your age) and might slow long-bone growth. So you might want to give the cyclic ketogenic diet a shot.
<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I'm told some European bodybuilders are using 
life-extension drugs in between steroid cycles, namely: Deprenyl, Hydergine, KH3, and piracetam. What are your views on these drugs?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> First, I'd like to thank Charles Poliquin for helping me answer your question. Most track and field athletes use these brain-enhancing drugs regularly. Charles pointed out that once many speed athletes are over the age of 26, they start to lose optimal nerve force (the signals between the brain and various muscle fibers). So the instant contractile engagement of the muscle fibers begins to lag. Some of these smart drugs, particularly piracetam, seem to improve speed because reaction times are better. But because most bodybuilding movements don't rely on explosive force or reaction times, these smart drugs don't appear to have much value for bodybuilders. Many great powerlifters have done their best lifts when they were in their 40's. Anabolic steroids, especially the androgenic ones, do improve neuron engagement and recuperation, and this might influence absolute strength. And we do know that after the first exhaustive set of an exercise, which engages primarily Type IIB fibers, it's extremely difficult to reengage the same Type IIB fibers on consecutive sets of the same exercise. Perhaps some of the smart drugs would allow greater Type IIB engagement on the subsequent sets. Unfortunately, I don't know of any research studies examining this effect.<P>
The use of smart drugs is more a matter of availability and economics. Over the last few years, the FDA and Customs have rejected many personal importations of these drugs, even though only one (KH3) is on the "disallowed" list. If you're going to be a human lab rat and do some self-experimentation, by all means, keep me informed of your results.
<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> We're inmates at FCI Seagoville in Texas. We have only one supplement available to us here-Muscle Charge II. The product costs $7.50 per pound, and it contains protein, vanadyl sulfate, chromium, and Smilax. What's the lowdown on this product?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> Well, it's not the worst protein product out there. But you're paying more money for some trace ingredients that aren't needed. We've found that vanadyl sulfate seems to show some muscle effects (like a better pump) at about 70 mg or more a day. If you use less than that amount, vanadyl sulfate may not be effective. The same goes for chromium: to get an effect from chromium, you would need to use at least 600 mcg a day. And Smilax is worthless. Your needs would be better served if your commissary buyer could find a brand of whey protein. You'd be getting a better protein, so the little that you use would be more bioavailable, and whey has all the ingredients for your body to make glutathione, a protein derivative that acts as a powerful antioxidant. The glutathione would help guard against the free-radical oxidation that occurs after you've eaten peroxidized fats in meat. This is important for you since you have to eat so much processed meat in prison.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> Do you know any reliable
sources for GHB?  I used to be able to get it at a health-food store near my gym, but they recently
stopped selling it.<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> <P>I don't know of any good sources for GHB, but as long as you brought it up, I do have a warning about this substance.</P>
<P>	Over the past few months, I've heard quite a few stories about bodybuilders and other GHB users forming some type of  "addiction" to this stuff.</P>
<P>	I'm not an expert on addictive drugs, but it sure seems like some GHB users get as "hooked" on this stuff as some people do on drugs like cocaine...<I>seriously!</I></P>
<P>	I've heard enough disturbing things about this GHB stuff that I would strongly encourage anyone who is using it to stop, and I would encourage anyone who hasn't tried GHB yet not to mess with it.<P>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/answr2.gif"></CENTER><P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I noticed that Dr. Mauro DiPasquale has come out with a new book about bodybuilding supplements. In his book, he contends he's the only "objective expert" in the industry. However, I also noticed he is working for Optimum Training Systems, and they sell supplements. How can he call himself objective?<P><HR>
<P></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I don't know why some people get so hung up on claiming to be "independent" or completely "objective." I even used to think it was a big deal, but the bottom line is that no one I know is completely objective, especially in bodybuilding! We all have opinions and egos; we all want to be right, especially those of use who call ourselves "experts."</P>
<P></P>
<P>I've always regarded Dr. DiPasquale as a good guy, and I still do. He's very knowledgeable, but if he's working for Optimum Training Systems (OTS), whether he admits it or not, he has a "vested interest" in the supplement business.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Dr. DiPasquale has a good reputation for telling bodybuilders what works and what doesn't. So does Dan Duchaine and, quite frankly, so do I! I think we've all been right more often than we've been wrong, and Dan and I, especially, like to be the first ones to tell our readers about something new and exciting.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Now, when we discover a supplement which we think may help bodybuilders, we don't see anything wrong with being involved in introducing that product to the consumer. For example, in this issue's "Alternatives" column, I tell you about a completely new supplement called HMB that legitimate scientific studies have shown may have a dramatic effect on your ability to gain size and muscle strength.</P>
<P></P>
<P>As I discussed in last issue's Q&A column, I don't make any secrets about my being involved in the supplement business. I'm proud of it, as a matter of fact! (I suppose I would try to hide my involvement in the supplement business if I distributed crappy, rip-off products like many of the other supplement companies do.)</P>
<P></P>
<P>Actually, I've discovered that the more supplements I distribute that actually work, the better my reputation gets. People count on me to come through with the real deal--the straightforward scoop on what to use and what not to use, and I take that responsibility <I>very seriously!</I></P>
<P></P>
<P>Anyway, my advice for Dr. DiPasquale is to just keep doing what he's done over the past decade--help athletes learn what works and what doesn't. Get off the "I'm the only honest guy out there" soapbox.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Now, as far as Dr. DiPasquale's new supplement book goes, I recently skimmed through it. Overall, it's not bad, but I did find it kind of confusing.</P>
<P></P>
<P>To be honest, I think my <B>new</B> <I>1996 Supplement Review</I> is better than DiPasquale's book (which was obviously inspired by the first <I>Natural Supplement Review</I> I wrote back in 1991).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Anyway, my new book only costs $3.00--and that's just to cover shipping and handling. The book itself is <B>FREE!</B> (Dr. DiPasquale's new supplement book costs $43.00!)</P>
<P></P>
<P>In my new, <I>1996 Supplement Review</I>, I cover every possible question you could ever ask about supplements--from protein powders to amino acids to fat burners, muscle builders, strength enhancers--everything! And, my new book is very simple and easy to read. At the end of the book, I even tell you about what are, in my opinion, the best "supplement stacks" ever designed for bodybuilders. (This info has never been put into print before!) It's a great supplement guide if I do say so myself! And, I don't spend half the book whining, bitching, and moaning and proclaiming myself as the only true expert.  No... my new <I>1996 Supplement Review</I> just gives you the straightforward, most "cutting-edge" information on supplements that may help you build muscle and burn fat! That's all that really matters, <I>isn't it?</I></P>
<P></P>
<P>If you'd like to pick up a copy of my new book, you'll find ordering information on page one of this magazine, and like I said, you can get the darn thing for only three bucks--how can you go wrong with a deal like that?! You can't!<P></P>
<P></P>
<P>(Note: You will also find an <A HREF="../nsr/nsr_of.html">order form</A> in the <A HREF="../nsr/nsr96.html"><I>1996 Supplement Review</I></A> area of the MM2K home page.)<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> If I were to go steroid shopping
in Europe, what would I find as of early 1996?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> First of all, I want to make it <I>very</I> clear that if you are planning to buy steroids in another country and bring them back into the United States, you will be committing a felony.  The Feds take smuggling (especially smuggling controlled substances) <I>very seriously.</I><P>
	If you go to a European country and buy steroids where they are legal or you have a doctor prescribe them for you in another country and have the doctor administer the steroids or you self-administer the drugs, then come back to the United States, I don't think you've broken any laws.<P>
	Anyway, I like to keep up on what's happening around the world on the steroid market just for the sake of staying informed--I've followed this issue for so long I just wouldn't feel right if I let up now.<P>
	The following is the latest information I have about steroid availability in Europe which addresses your question:<P>
	<B>Germany</B>--forget it!  Steroids are regulated in this country, just like they are in the United States.  One of the best steroids that used to be available in Germany, Primobolan 50 orals, hasn't been made in years.  Primobolan S (25-mg Primobolan tabs) are still available but only with a prescription.<P>
	<B>Belgium</B>--steroids are controlled here now, too!  If you had a prescription, you could get Stromba tabs, 50 mg Strombaject, Proviron, and Sustanon.<P>
	<B>France</B>--some parts of France are just like Mexico in that they are infested with pharmacies.  Paris Norde (North Paris) is one example.  Some pharmacists here will "bend the rules" for a little extra cash.  If you get lucky in Paris Norde, you might be able to pick up some Nilevar, Dynabolon, and some 50-mg Deca vials.  (Parabolan, a once popular French steroid, was discontinued about a year ago.)<P>
	<B>Spain</B>--your best bet in Barcelona would be to hook up with an elite bodybuilder from that country and "motivate" him to help you get plugged into the Spanish black market.  There you might find Winstrol tabs, Winstrol Depot, Primobolan Depot, Testex 250, Proviron, Testoviron Depot, Primobolan S, and Oxitisona 50 (this product was discontinued four years ago and is just about gone--the final numbers of the last batch of Oxitisona 50 are lot E-5, 12-96 Exp).<P>
	<B>Italy</B>--you need a prescription to get 'roids in this country.  But if you had one you would be able to get oxandrolone, Sustanon 250, and Clomid.<P>
	<B>Andorra</B>--this little "Principality" used to be a steroid haven back in the early '90's, but now it's <I>all dried up</I>!<P>
	<B>Switzerland</B>--you need a prescription here as well--about the only anabolic steroid that's interesting at Swiss pharmacies is Plenastril.<P>
	<B>Holland</B>--no anabolics here, but lots of Heineken and the red light district--it's too cool!!<P>
	In summary, Europe is no longer an easy place to get anabolic steroids--a lot has changed over the last few years.  Mexico, which is a lot closer, offers a pretty decent variety of anabolic steroids and many (not all) pharmacies South of the Border still sell a pretty decent selection of anabolic steroids without a prescription and at relatively reasonable prices.<P>
	I hope that answers your question!<P>
	(By the way--if you don't know what all the steroids are that I mentioned in this answer, pick up a copy of my <I>Anabolic Reference Guide</I>--that book explains everything you could ever want to know about steroids and more.  It's advertised on page 71 of this issue.)<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I read that the supplement HMB
is a metabolite of the BCAA leucine and KIC.  Can I get the effects of HMB by just taking
leucine or KIC?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> Probably not.  Researchers currently believe only 5% of dietary leucine is converted to HMB in the body.  To make 3 grams of HMB (which is believed to be the effective dose), you would have to take <B>at least</B> 60 grams of leucine or 20-60 grams of KIC per day, which is not only expensive and impractical but could cause severe stomachaches.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I've noticed there are quite a few Phosphagain "copycat" products coming out on the market. One product in particular, distributed by Strength Systems USA, supposedly works just like Phosphagain, but it's less expensive. Do you know if these other products are as good as Phosphagain?
<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> <P>Those of you who read <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> regularly have heard all about Phosphagain by now... I don't need to go on and on about how good I think this product is and how two double-blind, placebo-controlled, university studies have demonstrated the product's powerful effects. You already know all that stuff.  But I think all of these new Phosphagain "rip-off" products are worth commenting on.<P>

<P>What's going on here is that a lot of other supplement companies are convinced Phosphagain is a powerful bodybuilding formula, and it's clear consumers are impressed with this product as well.</P>

<P>Anyway, all of these other supplement companies are coming out with products which they claim are like Phosphagain for one reason... <I>Money!</I> They're simply trying to feed off the "market" Phosphagain has created.</P>

<P>It's funny to see all of these companies coming out with "<B>low-calorie</B> mass stimulators" after they have sold literally thousands of cans of <B>high-calorie</B> mass-building products over the last few years. (Pretty hypocritical, wouldn't you say?)</P>

<P>The thing about this scenario that kind of pisses me off is that Experimental and Applied Sciences (EAS), the inventor of Phosphagain, spent a tremendous amount of time and literally tens of thousands of dollars developing, formulating, and then university testing Phosphagain. And, EAS continues to allocate a percentage of their sales towards future studies, not only on Phosphagain but on other supplements that may help bodybuilders gain size and strength faster.</P>

<P>It's obvious that only through research (which costs a lot of money!) are we going to be able to advance bodybuilding supplementation--I mean really take it to the level where you can get "drug-like" effects without using illegal and possibly dangerous pharmaceutical substances.</P>

<P>EAS is a very young supplement company, but it has already spent more money on research than most bodybuilding supplement companies that have been around for over a decade! (Call a representative of Strength Systems USA and ask how much money they've spent on university research since they were founded. I'll bet the answer is not one stinking dollar!)</P>

<P>EAS's present research portfolio calls for them to spend over a million dollars over the next 18 months. And, these studies aren't just on EAS products--there are studies planned to try to discover what aspects of the muscle-building process are sensitive to nutritional intervention. Information like this has to be known before new, even better, supplements can be developed.</P>

<P>Now, when these other companies try to take sales away from EAS, what they're really doing is taking money away from research that, in the long run, could tremendously benefit bodybuilders everywhere!  So, in effect, these rip-off companies are <I>hurting</I> bodybuilders--<I>not helping them!</I></P>

<P>Of course, EAS, like any other company, is in business to make a profit. But EAS also has a true commitment to furthering the science of bodybuilding supplementation, whereas it seems many of the other companies in this industry have making money as their <I>one and only objective.</I></P>

<P>Now--back to your question:  the one company you asked about, Strength Systems USA, is one that I don't even take seriously. My opinion is that they have an awful reputation. I personally regard this company as a desperate "bottom feeder" in the supplement business.</P>

<P>There are companies I have a lower regard for than Strength Systems, but <I>there aren't many, I assure you!</I></P>

<P>You should also keep in mind that oftentimes these "knock-off products" are not at all what they're supposed to be. As I reported in a previous issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, we recently tested one of the Phosphagain "rip-off" products that is distributed by a company in the Northeast, and <I>it only contained half as much creatine as Phosphagain!</I> (Creatine is one of the most expensive and important ingredients in Phosphagain. Without it, I can't imagine that the formula would have the same effects.)</P>

<P>Sometimes when a company advertises a lower price and "better value," what you really end up getting if you buy their product is <I>ripped off.</I></P>

<P>And, in the case of Phosphagain, remember that none of these other products have been proven to be as good as or better than Phosphagain. As a matter of fact, EAS has issued a "$30,000 bounty" to any company that can prove through legitimate, published, university studies that its' formula is as good as or better than Phosphagain's! Did you know <B>not one</B> of these Phosphagain "knock-off" products has been tested in university studies like Phosphagain has?</P>

<P>The truth is, the other companies, that are trying to ride on the coattails of Phosphagain's success, probably don't even understand the science behind the product. As a matter of fact, many of the bodybuilding supplement companies in business today don't even have scientists on their staff. They think research means going to the library and looking up words in the dictionary. They're basically <I>clueless</I>!

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I recently came across a bottle of nandrolone decanoate (Deca) distributed by Steris Labs. I'm sending a sample of the box and an empty vial for you to take a look at. Can you tell if it's legit?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> The box you sent is definitely not counterfeit. The easiest way to tell with this box is that all of the copy which appears in green ink is indented onto the box. It's put on with a type of metal roller--not your standard printing press. All of the counterfeit forms of Steris I've seen have the ink just printed on the box, just like these words are printed on the piece of paper you're reading right now. </P>
<P></P>
<P>Also, on the empty vial of Deca you sent with this box is another sign that tells me this stuff is real. The entire label is varnished (glossy) except for about a one quarter-inch space where the lot number and expiration date are put on. I haven't seen any counterfeiters do this yet either.</P>
<P></P>
<P>So as far as I can tell, the box and label on this vial are legitimate. Of course, that means what was in the vial was probably real nandrolone decanoate.

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I've been trying to get that "cut" look forever. A guy at my gym suggested I try a new supplement called "Bromocriptine." He said it's really great for getting that super-hard look. Have you heard of this stuff?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> <P>Bromocriptine is not a supplement. It's a drug; it's available by prescription only in the United States, but I've heard some people are getting it through foreign mail-order sources.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Bromocriptine is an anti-Parkinson's disease drug which acts in a similar manner as L-dopa. In a recent study, Bromocriptine was shown to dramatically increase fat loss. However, I certainly would not recommend this drug to bodybuilders who want to get that solid, muscular look. I'd wait until more research is done on Bromocriptine before even thinking of messing with it. </P>
<P></P>
<P>The best way to get cut that I know of is to train hard with weights and consume a few hundred less calories per day than your body normally burns off. You're not going to get super-muscular overnight--I don't care what you take. Not even clenbuterol (which is probably the best "cutting-up" drug used by bodybuilders these days) will help you get shredded if you're consuming more calories than your body burns off each day.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> If I'm using the low-calorie lean-mass stimulator Phosphagain (which contains creatine monohydrate), do I need to take Phosphagen or Phosphagen HP (which also contain creatine monohydrate)?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> The three supplements you mentioned, or any supplement that contains an effective dose of creatine monohydrate, will probably help your bodybuilding efforts; however, you certainly don't have to use all three of the products you mentioned.<P>
	Each serving of Phosphagain contains about 7 grams of creatine monohydrate, and a heaping teaspoon of Phosphagen contains about 5 grams of creatine monohydrate, and a serving of Phosphagen HP also contains about 5 grams of creatine monohydrate.<P>
As long as you start with a "loading phase" of 20 to 30 grams of creatine monohydrate for 5 to 7 days and then go to a "maintenance dose" of 5 to 10 grams of creatine monohydrate a day, I don't really think it makes much difference where it comes from.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> What's the latest word on IGF-1? Are bodybuilders getting good results with this stuff?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I've been in touch with quite a few weight trainers who are experimenting with various forms of IGF-1, and the results are all over the board. Some guys contend the stuff is "working miracles" for them while others can't even tell they're taking it.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Of course, one of the problems you have with trying to decipher this "anecdotal" evidence is most people don't even know if the IGF-1 they're using is real or counterfeit. And, no one is still quite sure which dosages are best.</P>
<P></P>
<P>A number of human studies involving IGF-1 are in the planning stages, and I really think to figure this thing out, we're going to have to wait for the scientists to catch up with the enthusiasm of bodybuilders.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Only through detailed clinical studies will we be able to answer the most important questions about IGF-1, which are basically how much of the stuff do you have to take to promote muscle gains, and what are the side effects?</P>
<P></P>
<P>I recommend that people sit back and wait for more information on IGF-1 to become available before they bother messing with it.

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I heard testosterone injections may soon be approved in the United States as a form of male birth control. I don't understand why testosterone would be approved as a form of birth control but not approved as a muscle builder. With some of these new uses for testosterone, do you think there's any chance the laws regarding doctors prescribing steroids for bodybuilders will change?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> <P>It's been almost four years since I first wrote about the use of testosterone as a form of male birth control.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Studies have demonstrated that weekly injections of drugs like testosterone enanthate are extremely effective (similar to the birth control pill for women).</P>
<P></P>
<P>Also, the studies which evaluated testosterone's effects as a form of birth control for men have also demonstrated an extremely low incident of side effects.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Basically, researchers have determined that giving men a weekly injection of 200 mg of testosterone is pretty darn safe.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Coincidentally, 200 mg of testosterone administered each week to someone who is training with weights and consuming a nutritious diet is definitely a high enough dosage to accelerate gains in muscle size and strength in most men. I expect the FDA will approve testosterone injections as a form of birth control in the United States in the not-too-distant future. Obviously, bodybuilders will be lining up left and right to take advantage of this new opportunity to get legal testosterone injections!</P>
<P></P>
<P>But, just because the use of testosterone as a form of birth control may be approved by the FDA, this does not mean there is any hope whatsoever testosterone or other androgens (steroids) will be approved for muscle-building purposes.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I wish I could offer you some input here, but to be honest, I didn't get a very good look at the competitors in the Ms. Olympia. Yes... I was at the show and yes... I sat in the 5th row where I <I>should have</I> been able to "size up" the competitors.  Unfortunately, things didn't work out that way.<P>
Here's the story:<BR> When I'm here in Golden, I work about 70 hours a week--I really don't do anything but write, read, and move paper each day. When I go home, I try to catch a workout and just kick back.<P> 
On the rare occasion when I get out of town, I have a bad habit of going a bit "crazy." Such was the case when I went to the Olympia in Atlanta.<P>
On the day the Ms. Olympia contest was held, I ran into some old bodybuilding buddies, and we ended up hanging out at a pub drinking beer and eating Phosphagain<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP> bars all day.<P>
By the time my pals and I got to the Ms. Olympia finals and took our seats, I think we had done away with a couple of cases of Heineken, not to mention about 24 Phosphagain bars (which I think may have an effect on increasing alcohol uptake by the brain--I'm not sure--I'm going to have to ask Anthony Almada about this.)<P>
And, to make matters worse, I didn't bring my glasses (all that reading has made me nearsighted).<P>
Bottom line--<I>I couldn't tell if I was watching the damn Mr. or Ms. Olympia!</I> If you would have told me Kim Chizevsky was Dorian Yates, I would have had no good reason to argue with you!<P>
So, as far as giving you some feedback on the judging of this year's event, I'm afraid I'm about as worthless as tits on a boar.<P>
Now, if you want some feedback on the overall event--I can tell you this Olympia, like others I've attended over the past few years, was impressively well run.  I can also confirm the nightlife in Atlanta is outstanding--<I>it's a great place to party.</I><P>
Sorry I couldn't be of more help!

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> In the last issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, you mentioned you were experimenting with hydroxy citric acid (HCA)... a new "fat burner." I was wondering if you've noticed any positive results from using that supplement?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I've been using HCA regularly for about seven weeks now, and to be honest, I haven't really noticed a loss in bodyfat.Since I started taking HCA, I've kept my caloric intake pretty steady, so if the stuff produced "dramatic" results, I think I would have seen them by now.<P>I think HCA might be one of those fat-burning supplements that helps people who are extremely overweight more than people who are already lean.<P>Before and after I used HCA, my bodyfat was at about 7.5%. If I had it my way, my bodyfat would always be 6%. But once I get down below 8% bodyfat, my system fights like hell to hang onto what adipose tissue remains. So, my lack of results with HCA may not be typical of what the average, "overweight/overfat" person might experience.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> In addition to working out hard and using the right supplements, what nutritional advice can you give me to help build muscle and burn fat?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> The first thing you want to make sure you're doing is consuming meals that are balanced
in protein and carbohydrates six times a day.  A bowl of pasta is not a "meal"--neither is 15 egg
whites.<p>

	I believe there's a certain metabolic environment created when you consume a nutrient-rich, calorie-compact meal containing protein and carbohydrates that is important for optimal
amino acid and energy uptake by your muscle cells as well as proper oxidation (burning) of fat.<p>

	As far as calories go, if you're trying to build muscle and burn fat (which is basically
what I'm always trying to do), I recommend consuming a number of calories equal to your body
weight times 12.  For example, I weigh 200 pounds, so I try to consume around 2,400 or 2,500
calories a day (200 x 12). <p>

	If your main focus is to try to get cut, I recommend planning your daily calorie intake
around a number equal to your body weight times 10.  For example, if I wanted to get really cut
and not focus on gaining any more muscle size and strength for the time being, I would try to
consume around 2,000 calories a day (200 x 10).<p>

	Now, if you're trying to "bulk up" and you aren't concerned with fat loss, I recommend
consuming a number of calories equal to your body weight times 15.  For example, if I just
wanted to put on more muscle size and strength and was not concerned with losing fat (or even
gaining a little), I would consume 3,000 a day (200 x 15).<p>

	I recommend a diet that consists of around 30% to 35% protein, 45% to 50% carbs, and
around 20% fat.  (Yes, 20% fat!  Some dietary fat may be necessary to build muscle size and
strength.  If you don't believe me, try to get bigger and stronger without it!  If you lower your fat
intake down to 10% a day or less... within a week you'll probably notice a decrease in strength
and muscle fullness.)<p>

	The number of calories you're planning to consume each day should be divided by the
number of meals you're going to eat.  For example, if my goal intake is 2,500 calories a day
(which it is) and I plan on eating 6 meals, that means I should be trying to get around 400
calories per meal (give or take 100).<p>

	You can get your calories from quality whole-food sources like oatmeal, chicken, turkey,
cottage cheese, pasta, skim milk, reduced-fat cheese, lean steak, all kinds of fruits and
vegetables, or you can use a high-quality meal-replacement powder or protein supplement.<p>

	You should also drink a lot of water each day.  I try to drink at least 60 ounces of water--not pop, not milk, not juice--just water.  (Water is absorbed by your system differently than
calorie-containing fluids.)  This is to be consumed in addition to any water that might be used to
make protein drinks or anything like that.  This water can be consumed with meals or between
meals.  Drinking a lot of water helps keep your muscles properly hydrated (full of water), which
is very important on any muscle size and strength-building program.<p>

	Now, the above recommendations are "guidelines," not "etched-in-stone" rules.  You
might be one of the rare people whose metabolism is so fast you need to eat more calories per
day than what I'm recommending.  If this is the case, try starting with one of the "baseline"
numbers I recommended above and increase the number of calories you eat by 500 a day for one
week.  Then, make an evaluation--gradually "fine tune" your calorie intake until you think you're
getting the desired results.  (It's extremely helpful to keep a "nutrition log"--especially if you're
not really sure how many calories you're taking in each day.)<p>

	Now, if you're one of the rare individuals whose metabolism is especially slow, you may
have to decrease your calorie intake by 300 calories a day, a week at a time, until you start to see
the results you desire.<p>

	Give these recommendations a try--I'll bet you'll see a difference!<p>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> Which supplement works
better--creatine phosphate or creatine monohydrate?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> All of the studies which I have reviewed over the past few years that show increases in lean mass and strength have used creatine monohydrate.  I'm not aware of any studies that show taking creatine phosphate orally has any positive effects.  (I think creatine phosphate has to be injected to work.)<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> What do you think are the most
common mistakes bodybuilders make that keep them from gaining size and strength?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> First of all, I think most bodybuilders work out too often and for too long.  The amount of muscle size and strength you build is <B>not</B> determined by the amount of time you spend in the gym.  If it were, there would be a lot more big and strong bodybuilders around!<P>  
	I think short, intense workouts that give your body the proper "stimulus" for new muscle growth without dipping too far into its "recovery potential" are best.  I recommend that people only work out with weights three or four times a week and for no more than an hour at a time.<P>
	Another mistake I think bodybuilders make is they don't feed their bodies often enough throughout the day.  I believe that to keep your body in an optimal state for building new muscle tissue, you've got to have a constant influx of nutrients into the body and very stable insulin levels.  The best way to accomplish this is to eat a nutrient-rich carbohydrate and protein-containing meal around every three hours throughout the day.<P>
	Another mistake bodybuilders make is that they just don't "plan" well enough.  Remember that old saying, "If you fail to plan, you're really planning to fail"?  Well, when it comes to bodybuilding, that's completely true!  If you don't use an exercise and nutrition log, you might want to think about it.  It's a great way to keep track of your progress (or lack of progress), and it's a great tool for "troubleshooting" your bodybuilding program.<P>
	And, finally, I think many bodybuilders could make better gains if they learned how to use bodybuilding supplements properly. Unfortunately, in my opinion, there are more supplements on the market that <B>don't</B> work than ones that <B>do</B>.  You've got to have the knowledge about which ones to use and which ones to avoid.  Even if you're using the best supplements, you've got to know how to take them--even the best supplements, used in a haphazard way, will probably not produce the desired results.

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I was very sad to learn that bodybuilding legend Don Ross recently passed away of a heart attack. Has there been any more information on how this man, who was in such good shape, died so prematurely?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I was also sad to learn about the passing of Don Ross. It's too bad that things like this have to happen.</P>
<P></P>
<P>The information I have is that Don Ross died of a heart attack, just like thousands and thousands of other men do every year. If you didn't already know this, heart disease is the number one cause of death in the United States. It's a big problem!</P>
<P></P>
<P>The fact that Don Ross was lean and muscular and had exercised all his life obviously didn't make him immune to heart disease.</P>
<P></P>
<P>An autopsy revealed the main arteries around his heart were between 70% and 100% blocked. (Just because someone looks strong and healthy, it doesn't mean they are.) </P>
<P></P>
<P>Obviously, bodybuilders who use massive amounts of steroids and other dangerous drugs, with no medical supervision, are taking their chances. Also, bodybuilders who dehydrate themselves before competition, to show those last few striations, are also flirting with disaster.</P>
<P></P>
<P>And, some bodybuilders go through huge weight fluctuations in incredibly short periods of time. I've seen some top amateurs who compete at 176 pounds and balloon up to 225 pounds within a month or 2 after their competition. Some experts think losing and gaining 50 pounds in such short periods of time may be especially stressful on the heart.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Anyway, <I>most</I> people who are into physique development are also into fitness. I know I am! I don't smoke. I don't do recreational drugs. (I do drink some beer about once a month, as I described earlier in this column.) And even though I've used steroids in the past, I never used mega-dosages nor did I come close to "abusing" them.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Since I know most of you are like me in this regard (you want to look great, feel great, and live a long time), I'd encourage you, regardless of how healthy you feel, to visit your doctor regularly, and at the bare minimum, get a blood test twice a year.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Don Ross, like thousands of other men, probably didn't even know his cholesterol had been sky high for over a decade.</P>
<P></P>
<P>If you start monitoring your health at a young age (I haven't even been on this planet for three decades, and I watch my blood lipid levels like a hawk), you have an excellent chance of being able to prevent heart attacks, strokes, and other physical disasters.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Heart disease is a very treatable condition in most circumstances. There are medications available that you can take to lower your cholesterol and blood pressure. Sometimes, even if you do "eat right" and exercise, your body may still produce too much cholesterol. But, like I said, this is a condition that's usually treatable.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Anyway, I think the obvious recommendation here is that even though you're a bodybuilder and you might look great and feel good, don't assume you are "bulletproof." Check with your doctor often, and ask a lot of questions. It's simple advice, but it could very well save your life.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I recently read an article in
<I>Muscular Development</I> where Mike Mentzer predicted that Steve Blechman would take over
bodybuilding when Joe Weider retires because Steve is such a great businessman.  When Joe
steps down, will they stop publishing <I>Flex</I>?  (Aside from <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, <I>Flex</I> is my favorite
bodybuilding magazine.)<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I have no reason to believe Joe Weider is going to be retiring any time soon, and when/if he does, I'm certain <I>Flex</I> magazine will continue.</P>
<P>	I don't know if Steve Blechman will "take over" bodybuilding some day, but who knows--he might.  Both Steve Blechman and Joe Weider are brilliant businessmen--<I>far more skilled than I.</I>  I really don't know "squat" about big business--I've never read an issue of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, and I've never picked up a copy of <I>Forbes</I> magazine or <I>Business Week</I>.</P>
<P>	I don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out "who's in charge" of bodybuilding--I've got my hands full just trying to run the small business I've got and put together a good magazine.</P>
<P>	I've never really seen myself as the "business type" like Weider and Blechman--I'm really just a young guy who has always loved lifting weights; I'm obsessed with trying to build muscle and get stronger.</P>
<P>	I spend every spare minute I've got either working out or trying to learn more about how to get stronger and more muscular.</P>
<P>	The fact that I'm not a "real businessman" like Blechman and Weider is probably more than obvious--I have a lot of admiration for these dudes, but I don't necessarily ever want to be like them.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I read an article in the last issue
of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> [January 1995] about this new supplement called HMB.  I was wondering
if it's all right to use this stuff along with creatine monohydrate.  If I did "stack" these two
supplements--what type of gains do you think I would get?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I have no reason to believe it wouldn't be okay to take HMB along with creatine monohydrate--they're both naturally occurring micronutrients.  I've been using both of them for the past couple of months, and the results have been quite nice.</P>
<P>	An observation I've made about creatine monohydrate is that it seems to produce big gains in body weight the first month you use it, and then I think your muscles become pretty much "saturated" with it, and your gains kind of "level out."  However, since there is no reason to stop taking creatine monohydrate (at least no reason I know of), you don't have the same problem with it as you do with steroids.  Let me explain--any bodybuilder who is using steroids and cares at all about his or her health is, at some point, going to have to go off the drugs to let the body "normalize" and to reduce the risk of serious side effects.</P>
<P>	Now, when most bodybuilders go off steroids, they lose much of the weight and strength gains they made when they were on them.</P>
<P>	With creatine monohydrate, you can just keep taking the supplement and maintain those great gains in size and strength and perhaps make even more gains (although I doubt they would be as noticeable as they were in the first month of use). </P>
<P>	Now, with HMB use, the strength gains can be extremely noticeable in a short period of time.  The preliminary results of an HMB study that just started a few weeks ago showed that only eight days into the study, weight trainers who used three grams of HMB a day doubled their strength gains over the weight trainers who followed the same exercise and nutrition program but did not use HMB!</P>
<P>	As far as the lean-mass gains from HMB go, I think those will happen more gradually than they do with creatine monohydrate.  Remember, the initial weight gain from creatine is probably caused by a "cell-volumizing" effect--it's good solid weight that can make your muscles feel bigger and fuller, but it's not necessarily new contractile protein tissue.</P>
<P>	When I started using HMB, I put on four solid pounds the first month I was using it and noticed a significant increase in strength.  The second month I was on HMB, I gained another four pounds and continued to set new "PR's" (personal records) in lifts like the bench press and leg extension.</P>
<P>	Now, I have no evidence that my gains are "typical"--I'm certain different people will experience different results, but I believe HMB is going to be the type of supplement that produces gains over an extended period of time.</P>
<P>	In my opinion, "stacking" creatine monohydrate and HMB is a great idea!  If someone told me they were going to use only two bodybuilding supplements, those are the ones I would recommend!</P>
<P>		One last "semi-related" note--in the last issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, I reported that weight trainers who used HMB gained 55% more lean mass, in only 3 weeks, than weight trainers who did not use 3 grams of HMB.  After communicating with the doctors who performed this study, I made a very interesting discovery.  Actually, the trainers who used 3 grams of HMB a day gained anywhere between 55% and <B>300%</B> more lean mass--so when we reported "55% greater gains" in that issue, we were definitely being conservative!

    <H3>THE SCIENCE OF SUPPLEMENTS TAKES ANOTHER STEP FORWARD</H3><P>
    <H4>by Dan Duchaine</H4></CENTER>
  	<FONT SIZE=+3>1960</FONT SIZE> was the high point of anabolic development.  Doc Ziegler was handing out little blue Dianabol pills to Olympic lifters at York, Pennsylvania.  Deca Durabolin, the same anabolic steroid that pregnant women synthesize naturally, was also commercially introduced.  Both steroids were tremendous advancements over the various testosterones that athletes had been using.  There was an old saying, "If you can't grow on Deca and D-bol, then nothing's gonna' work."  And frankly, that generally remained true.  Nothing after 1960 was any better.  We got fancier steroids with less side effects.  We tried veterinary steroids.  We embraced underground "designer steroids," supposedly smuggled in from East Germany.  Growth hormone never really panned out as the great superior anabolic we all prayed for.  Clenbuterol was surprisingly effective for fat loss, and it was mildly anabolic, but it was no anabolic second coming.<P>  
	Nonetheless, in the upcoming year, 1996, we will see a bona-fide new anabolic development.  The name is HMB, short for <B>ß-Hydroxy ß-Methylbutyrate</B>. HMB is highly anti-proteolytic.  And its effects are not hearsay: they're backed up with scientific study.  This research is not the usual rat and chicken studies.  The anti-proteolytic research was done on weightlifting humans.  The HMB subjects got stronger, and they got bigger on only three grams a day!  HMB is the start of a new anabolic revolution: supplemental nutrients that deliver drug-like anabolic effects.  You can buy it NOW.  It won't break your savings account.  It's <B><I>not</I></B> an illegal steroid.  But here's the best part: HMB is, for the time being, the bodybuilder's secret.  The armchair academics will cautiously wait for follow-up studies.<P>
  Because I have been investigating the various effects of muscle trauma in the development of my Body Contract workout system, I immediately understood the anabolic effects that HMB induces.  Over the years, I've encountered a number of naysayers who have said, "Supplements don't work: they're all scams.  Just train and eat good food."  HMB relegates these reactionaries into the same class of people that belong to the Flat-Earth Society.<P>
<CENTER><H4>Most Anti-Catabolics Suck</H4></CENTER>
<HR>
	Usually I don't have much faith in any nutrient masquerading as an "anti-catabolic."  I think it's because many nutritional supplement companies have used this term in the loosest manner possible as a marketing ploy.  Catabolism, as applied to athletic performance, is when the amino acid content of the muscle cell decreases.  The active hormones that cause this to happen are <I>cortisol</I> and <I>glucagon</I>.  Cortisol secretion happens when stress and trauma are inflicted on the body.  Glucagon is elevated from variances of nutritional intake.  Up to this point, nutrient anti-catabolics have been mostly replacement nutrients.  For example, the major sacrificial aminos which are debited from a muscle cell from increased cortisol are glutamine and the branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs).  So whenever you encounter advertising copy that claims these amino acids are "anti-catabolic," there is a built-in assumption, namely, that the fortification of these amino acids will either replace or forestall their egress from the muscle.<P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H3>"This is a revolutionary way of dealing with catabolism: limit the muscle damage before cortisol can be secreted in response."</H3></CENTER><P>
<HR>
  Perhaps we could say that these types of nutrients are <I>passive</I> anti-catabolics.  The true active anti-catabolics (all are prescription drugs) deal mostly with cortisol's effects in a number of ways, not all of them successful.  Anabolic steroids block cortisol from latching onto muscle cells.  Cytadren, the Cushing Syndrome drug, attenuates cortisol secretion.  But remember: cortisol is a reaction to <I>any</I> kind of stress and trauma in the body.  And point of fact, your typical bodybuilding workout is a type of trauma that causes cortisol secretion.  Each workout sends a signal to the muscle cells to expel amino acids along with the anabolic stimulus we all strive for.  Cortisol, however, is a necessary hormone, secreted in reaction to some kind of damage.  Without cortisol, you would die, and it would be a painful death at that.  So limiting cortisol, in a performance sense, is cautiously a good thing to do, but too much inhibition will cause great pain in the joints.  Anabolic steroids combat the effects of cortisol in a very well-balanced manner, actually reducing joint inflammation.  However, this short-term solution completely ignores the reason for elevated catabolism in the first place: muscle trauma.<P>
<CENTER><H5>Qualitative Trauma</H5></CENTER>
	In my Body Contract workout system, I recognized that ultimate anabolic response from training is a give-and-take situation.  Some part of the weightlifting exercise causes muscle growth. We can't be absolutely sure what the specific anabolic stimulus is, but it seems to center around the muscle trauma happening in the eccentric (lowering) part of the weightlifting movement.  But at the same time, lifting heavy weights also causes damage to the muscle.  This combination of inflammation and microtears in the muscle fibers is the trauma that cortisol responds to.  The net anabolic response is a <I>ratio of the anabolic stimulus contrasted with catabolism</I>.  The muscle will grow when the anabolic part overwhelms the catabolic component.<P>
  When muscle growth plateaus, the cause is a rough counterbalance of opposing forces.  Many bodybuilders assume the cause of the halt of progress is because the workout is not intense enough, but I believe that in most cases there is more than enough anabolic stimulus within the typical high-intensity workout, but within the same workout, too much nonproductive (perhaps counterproductive) trauma is happening.  Some amount of inflammation and microtears is necessary for muscle cell growth.  But too much intensity will generate so much trauma that the anabolic/catabolic ratio is changed because of increased cortisol.<P>
<CENTER><H4>Changing the Anabolic/Catabolic Ratio</H4></CENTER>
<HR>
	At the various Olympic training centers, sports medicine specialists are constantly measuring athletes' blood levels to chart the various anabolic and catabolic hormones in the body.  Obviously, the individual can't significantly increase testosterone or growth hormone levels.  It's against the rules.  The alternative is to lower the cortisol, the chief catabolic hormone.  When this happens, at the same testosterone level, more anabolic activity happens because of the newly adjusted testosterone/cortisol ratio. This reasoning applies to the weightlifting workout.  To enhance the anabolic stimulus, we have two choices: either somehow instill a greater anabolic stimulus (and keep in mind that the specific anabolic stimulus is still unknown), or conversely, reduce the trauma.  Reduced trauma will cause a more favorable anabolic/catabolic ratio, and as a result, less cortisol is secreted.  This cortisol reduction causes less catabolism and magnifies the effects of both testosterone and growth hormone.  So why am I spending all this time writing about this reduction of muscle trauma?  Because HMB's anti-proteolytic properties are not the typical passive anti-proteolytic properties that we expect from non-drug sources.<P>
<IMG HEIGHT=72 ALIGN=ABSMIDDLE SRC="../images/mentor2.gif" ALT="[Mentor graphic]">   <I>HMB causes a reduction of muscle trauma!</I><P>
This is a revolutionary way of dealing with catabolism: limit the muscle damage before cortisol can be secreted in response.<P>
	How does it work?  We don't know!  Here's what I know so far.  In front of me, with the rubber-stamped "CONFIDENTIAL" on every page, I have a pre-publication human study, "The Effect of the Leucine Metabolite ß-Hydroxy ß-Methylbutyrate on Muscle Metabolism During Resistance Training."  All the subjects who used 3 grams a day of HMB gained strength and muscle over 3 weeks on a diet shockingly low in calories (less than 2,400 calories a day).  Muscle trauma was measured in two ways.  With blood tests, the enzyme creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) was measured.  High CPK levels are an indication of muscle trauma.  Also, urine samples were analyzed for 3-methylhistine (3MH) excretion.  With both trauma markers, three grams of HMB significantly reduced both CPK and 3MH.<P>
  But why does HMB work?  I have my own hypothesis.  In this human study, something very interesting happened during  the workout.  The subjects were using relatively heavy weights with repetitions averaging between three and five.  Usually in weightlifting, most of the work load is done with the fast-twitch, Type II muscle fibers.  However, HMB caused a greater engagement of the slow-twitch, Type I fibers.  This doesn't usually happen in high-tension weightlifting.<P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H3>"All the subjects who used 3 grams a day of HMB gained strength and muscle over 3 weeks on a diet shockingly low in calories..."</H3></CENTER><P>
<HR>
  I dug up another HMB study, this one on fat quality of beef that were fed HMB.  The results?  The animals had <I>greater amounts of intramuscular fat</I> than normal.  So what?  Do we want more intramuscular fat in humans?  Usually no, because deposition of intramuscular fat usually happens when the individual is immensely obese.  Usually we can't selectively load intramuscular fat without putting fat in other bad places.  But as Barry Sears, the other "fat-diet" guy, pointed out a few issues back in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, intramuscular fat is a superior energy source for ATP production, much faster and more efficient than glucose or glycogen.<P>
  I believe the real focus of the anti-proteolytic activity of HMB is related to the high amounts of intramuscular fat it facilitates, allowing the slow-twitch, Type I fibers to stay engaged during high-tension anaerobic exercise.  By spreading the tension (weight) over more muscle fibers, there is less trauma induced from less microtears during the eccentric phase.  At the start of this HMB anabolic revolution, the obvious application was for muscular growth in bodybuilders.  But I imagine that even endurance athletes would immensely benefit from increased intramuscular fat levels.<P>
<CENTER><H4>HMB HISTORY</H4></CENTER>
<HR>
	Where did HMB come from?  HMB is the twice removed metabolite of the amino acid <I>leucine</I>.  The transformation happens in the liver.  First leucine is catabolized to a leucine variant called alpha-ketoisocaproate (KIC).  We have had KIC supplements for a few years now in response to some studies indicating that KIC is anti-catabolic.  But there are problems with using it.  The average dosage to generate a small anti-catabolic effect is at least 15 grams.  Most individuals don't use nearly enough.  The more serious concern is that we now know that the next metabolite catabolized from KIC is the actual compound that instills the anti-proteolytic effect.  This is, of course, HMB.  Unfortunately, the body doesn't readily convert KIC into HMB.  The logical thing to do is isolate the HMB compound, which is what the scientists did.<P>
  HMB is an efficient anti-proteolytic. HMB is optimal with only 3 grams a day verses the 15-gram amounts needed with KIC.  We have two natural sources of HMB: grapefruit and (of all things) catfish.  But you won't see the amazing anti-proteolytic catfish and grapefruit diet anytime soon, as you need crates of each to find the three grams.<P>
<CENTER><H4>HMB Availability & Dosages</H4></CENTER>
<HR>
	This will be the year of HMB.  So where is it?  The bottleneck is the present absence of commercial availability.  Buried in the confidential papers that an unknown source lent me, I found the original cost to produce the first batch.  Fifty kilograms cost the researchers $100,000!  That's $2,000 a kilo!  In the mid-'80's, black-market steroid manufacturers could buy raw steroid ingredients for less.  The task over these last few months has been to make HMB economically viable. I know of at least three companies that are deep in development to make HMB economical.  (<I>Editors Note:</I> One thing that supplement companies which are pursuing HMB may need to know is that if they plan on selling this product as a muscle builder, they're going to have to somehow get permission from a company called Metabolic Technologies, Inc. [MTI] that has exclusively licensed the patent from the Iowa State University Research Foundation. So far, MTI is the first and only company to bring HMB to the market.)<P>
 <HR>
<CENTER><H3>"Been using it for three weeks, feels like Deca [Durabolin]."</H3></CENTER><P>
<HR>
	So three grams a day: all at once?  No. The activity of HMB has a four-hour time span.  Consequently, the logical dosage would be one gram every four hours or so.  I must tell you, initially when I encountered HMB in March of this year, I was not terribly impressed.  This was because most other so-called anti-catabolic nutrients, especially KIC, have had very unexciting results.  I had put the small amount of research that Jessica, my research assistant, found via Medline in a file and promptly forgot about it.  A few months later, I received a query from Bill Phillips asking if I would be interested in doing an article on HMB.  Scrawled across the page, handwritten, was the terse message: "Been using it for three weeks, feels like Deca [Durabolin]."  If this statement came from some advertisement from Leo Costa and his ilk, I would have never believed it, but this was a personal message from someone who knows that I'd lob a merciless flame assault over the FAX machine if I thought he was trying to pull a fast one.  And then that human HMB study arrived.  I was sold.<P>
<CENTER><H4>Will It Work For You?</H4></CENTER>
<HR>
	Time will tell.  The subjects in the HMB study were "newbies," not having worked out for at least three months.  The greatest gain was over two and a half pounds after three weeks of training.  Granted, all beginners make some kind of progress.  But other research shows that weightlifting repetitions of between three and five is not the optimal repetition range for growth.  This is the repetition range that the HMB subjects used.  I'm predicting that combining HMB with my Body Contract workout should generate even more spectacular results.  And at this moment, my East Coast assistant is going into his human lab rat mode and will do complete blood chemistries before and after HMB and Body Contract use.<P>  
	This next year is going to be tremendously exciting.  We have found a powerful anti-proteolytic nutrient that most researchers still don't know about.  We're going to have thousands of bodybuilders becoming nontraditional researchers.  And when the recognized researchers cautiously advance the concept of HMB's anti-proteolytic properties, bodybuilders will just yawn and say, "Been there, done that.  What's <I><B>really</B></I> new?"  And when HMB does make it to the commercial market and you try it, write in and let me know how it worked for you.  I have this feeling that HMB is the start of a new, glorious <B><I>anabolic revolution</I></B>.<P>

Dear Friend,<P>
I'm definitely not one of the smartest men on the planet, but I do have a great deal of <I>common sense</I>. I'm a logical man, so I struggle with things that don't make sense-they frustrate me.<P> 
One thing that's been nagging at me for many years and has become a real source of frustration lately has to do with how the "medical establishment" views folks like us who want to build more muscular, leaner, stronger physiques.<P>
Think about this: why is it that the medical community considers it perfectly normal to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day, get drunk five times a week, and consume a diet that is tantamount to timed-release suicide, but it's considered <I>abnormal</I> to want to build muscle?<P> 
Why is it considered normal to go to cosmetic surgeons and have them rebuild your face, suck out your fat, and cram a couple of 400-cc plastic bags of saline under your skin, while those who endeavor to put their time and effort into building a classical, muscular physique are considered mentally unbalanced?<P>
Why are doctors writing over 80,000 prescriptions a week for diet pills, which are unquestionably being used as "cosmetic drugs" by thousands, but you can't get a doctor to even talk about prescribing drugs for weight/muscle gain?<P>
Why is it that a person who aspires to build a strong, muscular, healthy body typically can't find a physician who knows anything about the subject or who can give a more intelligent response than, "Why on earth would you want to build more muscle? That's ridiculous!"<BR>
(It doesn't make sense... does it?)<P>
In reality, wanting to build a lean, strong, muscular body-to pursue physical perfection-is a desire that man has had for thousands of years. Ancient Greeks often depicted the human figure, through paintings or sculptures, with perfect muscular proportions.<P>
Virtually all of Michaelangelo's work, from his statue of David to his painting on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel of God creating Adam, depicted muscular, lean, proportionate figures. Artists like da Vinci often depicted heroic men with well-developed muscular physiques as well.<P> 
In modern-day times, figures who are good, of sound mind and pure soul, are depicted in much the same way as the ancient Greeks viewed their gods-with broad shoulders, a narrow waist, and muscular arms and legs. Cartoon superheroes like Batman and Superman (even those damned Ninja Turtles) are depicted with ripped abs, capped shoulders, and "V-tapers." Cinema superstars like Schwarzenegger, Stallone, and Van Damme rely on their physiques to play the part of heroes as well.<P>
Make no mistake-man's desire to build a muscular body does not emanate from insecurity or psychological abnormalities, nor is it something that was created by Joe Weider, Perry Rader, Charles Atlas, or Jack LaLanne. Man's desire to sculpt a Greek god-like physique is innate-it's as natural as his desire to be successful and provide for his family.<BR>
(This makes sense... doesn't it?)<P>
Why then is it considered so out of the ordinary, by the medical establishment, to seek the assistance of modern science to build a better body?<P>
I'm not merely referring to the use of drugs like anabolic steroids-using virtually <I>any</I> muscle-building compound, such as creatine, HMB, amino acids, etc., is something that 95+% of all doctors consider completely unnecessary and irrational.<P> 
Don't believe me? Walk into your doctor's office tomorrow and tell him/her that you want to build 18" arms and bench press 365 lbs at 5% bodyfat. Tell him what supplements you're using and which ones have worked for you. Ask your doctor to test your blood because you want to see if your cortisol levels are optimal for building muscle or to see if your testosterone levels are low, so you can determine whether you need to take testosterone. (Do it-I dare you!) Your doctor won't know what the hell you're talking about and he/she will think you're friggin' nuts!<P>
Do doctors think we (bodybuilders) are out of line because the nature of medicine in Western society is <I>exclusively</I> to treat disease? The answer to that question is a resounding NO!<P>
Think about it... literally hundreds of thousands of Americans have elective cosmetic surgery each year-surgery that is <B>not</B> necessary and does not treat, cure, nor prevent any disease.<P>
Cosmetic surgery is widely accepted, despite numerous risks that are inherent to these procedures, including infections, excessive bleeding, and the always present potential of fatalities that go hand in hand with the use of anesthetics. And, on top of all this, the outcome of cosmetic surgery often leaves patients extremely dissatisfied (and many patients end up having additional cosmetic procedures to "repair" problems from the first surgery!).<P>
And now, the medical community has clearly established a precedent for the use of cosmetic pharmaceuticals with the rampant dissemination of fat-loss drugs like Redux (dexfenfluramine). Tens of thousands of women who are not anywhere near clinically obese are being written prescriptions for this powerful appetite suppressant (which I be-lieve could have more side effects than 'roids!).<BR>   
(Do you see why I'm frustrated?)<P> 
Why on earth is it not acceptable or "allowed" for a man to have the opportunity to seek the assistance of a competent, qualified practitioner with expertise in "physique augmentation"? A doctor who would respect your individuality and freedom of choice without copping an attitude or passing judgment.<P>
If you walk into a plastic surgeon's office and say you'd like to get a nose job or some cheek implants, does he/she say, "You're not ugly enough for plastic surgery"? No. The doctor listens to what you want, why you want it, and then he or she tells you what can be done for you. And, oftentimes, the doctor will explain, "While I'm in there, I could also give you some stronger cheekbones, lift the skin around your eyes, and give you fuller lips..."<P>
Here's my solution-I believe the medical establishment should create a new class of medical doctors who specialize in physique augmentation and body-composition alterations. I'm not talking about doctors who just prescribe steroids all day-I'm referring to <I>experts</I> who would be intricately trained in every aspect of building muscle and enhancing strength while simultaneously reducing bodyfat. These doctors would be well versed in areas such as weight training, nutrition, supplementation, and pharmaceuticals. These medical specialists would work with people (like us) who want to build better bodies, for whatever reason. Maybe some want to compete in bodybuilding contests, but most won't-most will do it for much the same reasons people have plastic surgery-to look better.<P> 
A competent "physique-augmentation practitioner" would first spend time consulting with you, getting an idea of what kind of body you would like to have and also make detailed notes about what you've done, to this point, to get in shape. Then, extensive blood work would be done to evaluate hormone levels, overall health, blood lipids, etc. Body-composition measurements would also be made.<P>
Then, various strategies would be employed, such as a prescribed training and nutrition program, supplement regimen, etc. A follow-up consultation would be scheduled where your progress and health would be evaluated and monitored.<P> 
It would seem likely that, in most cases, the use of anabolic steroids or growth hormone would be a <B>last</B> resort. But in some cases, it would be warranted if the level of muscle mass and strength the subject desired to attain exceeded what their genetics would allow, even <I>with</I> a disciplined training, nutrition, and proper supplementation program. In this instance, the physique-augmentation practitioner would prescribe doses of anabolic steroids that have been shown in clinical studies (like the one recently reported in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>) to be safe and effective. Regular consultations would be scheduled to guard against side effects while trying to maximize results.<P>
The truth is that for the typical, healthy human being, the administration of steroids by a competent physician poses very few risks and, in many cases, produces tremendous results. In fact, I don't think there's really any question as to whether the use (not abuse) of most anabolic steroids is safer than the use of appetite-suppressant drugs like Redux.<P>
Also, think about the health benefits involved with the type of program a physique-augmentation practitioner would prescribe. When a women goes in to get a new set of boobs or a guy goes in to get fat sucked out of his belly, what are the health benefits? I can't think of any. But, when you're training with weights, consuming a proper diet, and using the right supplements, there's no question that your health improves dramatically. And, what adverse reactions that might occur secondary to the use of certain anabolic steroids could be dramatically offset by the health-enhancing effects of exercise and proper nutrition.<P> 
Ponder this-people suffering from low self-esteem often think that maybe getting a hair transplant (another cosmetic procedure that has its share of risks) or a nose job will change the way they view themselves or the way others view them. But, in most cases, they're wrong. If a person with a flabby, pear-shaped body has a nose job, they're still, for the most part, not going to look that great. But with the help of a physique-augmentation practitioner, they could literally transform their whole bodies, including their health, vigor, and energy and very, very likely extend their lives!<P> 
There are literally hundreds of thousands of people who are out there, right now, self-administering steroids. That's not good. Anabolic steroids can be very dangerous (as could almost any medication) if they're being used by people who don't know what the hell they're doing. That's why, for the past ten years, I've tried to do what I can to inform those individuals who are interested in steroids and other bodybuilding drugs and help them learn what the true risks and benefits are. But in recent years, this whole steroid mess has gotten much worse. Nowadays, I'd guess that over 90% of the steroids sold on the black market (which is virtually the only place people can get them) aren't even real, and some contain dangerous contaminants.<P>
Another compounding factor is that even though competitive bodybuilding isn't growing (<I>Muscle Media 2000</I> <B>isn't</B> really a magazine for competitive bodybuilders, by the way-the majority of those who read this magazine are interested in building a better body for other reasons, not to compete in a typical bodybuilding contest), the number of people who are weight training, using supplements, and following "bodybuilder-like" programs is increasing dramatically! Literally millions of people from all walks of life-Hollywood superstars, lawyers, corporate CEO's, athletes, college students, etc., want to have greater muscularity, less fat, and get better results faster from the time they spend exercising.<P>
The fact is, establishing a segment of medicine that specializes in physique augmentation or positive body-composition alterations would be a tremendously lucrative practice, not only for physicians but for drug companies as well! (The drug companies are going to be amazed when they discover the profit potential of what I'm proposing.)<P>
And, it's not like you'd have any trouble finding guys or gals who would like to be physique-augmentation practitioners-there are probably hundreds of people who read <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> alone-people who are going to college, trying to decide what career they should pursue, and so on, who could get extremely motivated about becoming a "bodybuilding doctor." I've received so many letters over the years from folks who are very passionate and excited about weight training and bodybuilding, and they want to somehow find a career that complements their interests (like I've been fortunate enough to do). Many of these people end up pursuing "sports medicine" degrees, which can lead to an exciting $30,000-a-year job putting away weights. Others become personal trainers, some pursue chiropractic medicine (because it's a little more open minded), others become pharmacists, and some become medical doctors, but most end up somewhat unfulfilled.<P>
Many of these individuals would make fantastic medical practitioners who specialize in helping people build better bodies. And, a lot of general practitioners who are  into bodybuilding would jump at the chance to undertake the required training to become a "bodybuilding doctor."<P>
This all just makes too much sense. Somewhere, somehow, something has gone wrong-I don't know if it's the negative stigma that surrounds bodybuilding because of the freakish nonsense that goes on in the upper echelon of this sport or if all the sensationalism that surrounds steroid use by athletes has warped people's minds, but something isn't right.<P>
Of course, the truth is, if competent medical professionals were in charge of administering steroids or helping people achieve their physique goals <B>without</B> the use of steroids, we could put an end to this "steroid problem" altogether.<P>
I'm not insinuating that steroids should be sold over the counter-that's not my point at all. As a matter of fact, I don't care if they remain Schedule III controlled substances. It's just that <I>if</I> someone is determined to use them in an effort to build a better body, this use should be monitored by a doctor,   not a local black-market steroid dealer.<P>
I'm not saying that sporting federations should not ban steroid use-that's a completely different subject. If the International Olympic Committee, the NFL, the NCAA, etc. want to prohibit steroid use, that's fine. Anyone who chooses to participate in any particular organized sport should follow the rules of that organization. Likewise, if the people promoting the Miss America or Miss Universe contest want to prohibit all women who have had breast augmentation surgery, then that's perfectly reasonable as well.<P>
What I <B>am</B> getting at is that our medical establishment has already set a precedent for the use of cosmetic drugs, and they have also clearly established that it's fine and dandy to seek medical help for elective cosmetic procedures. Why, then, should the medical establishment not take the same approach to physique augmentation? <I>There is no reason!</I><P>
So, what can be done about all this-what can we do to fix the system? I believe a major change in this area can be made, and I'm going to make this one of my missions in the coming years. I'll lobby Congress, petition the American Medical Association, educate drug companies, etc. I believe that within 5 years (by the time I'm in my mid-30's), there will be radical reform in this area.<P> As a matter of fact, I already have a pretty good plan under way-a plan I'll tell you about in future issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>. Under my plan, steroid <B>abuse</B> and the steroid black market will be virtually eliminated, and individuals who live in America-the freest nation on earth-will be able to exercise their independence and individuality and rightfully choose exactly what they want to do with their bodies-which is a decision that should always be made by an individual, <I>not</I> the government.<P>
What do you think? Am I nuts, or am I on track (again)? Mail or fax me your input and ideas, and I'll see if any of your insights can be put into my master plan-a master plan that I think may help solve some of bodybuilding's biggest problems and probably prevent needless deaths while enhancing the quality of life for thousands.<P>
Until next time...<P> 
Be Well,<BR>

P.S. Some people have expressed that they feel the bodybuilding industry has pushed for the illegalization of steroids in an effort to sell more "steroid-replacing supplements." You know what? I think some people might be right. I think the bodybuilding industry has taken a very hypocritical and detrimental stance on this issue by: a) lying about the fact that pro bodybuilders abuse the hell out of steroids and b) proclaiming that supplements and "championship workouts" are all that are needed to build a superhuman physique.<P>
Being in the supplement business myself, I'm not at all concerned about the possibility that if doctors could prescribe steroids for muscle building, people wouldn't use supplements. That's not at all true. As a matter of fact, I'd be thrilled if doctors understood how supplements like creatine and others can help those who exercise get better results faster, because as it stands now, most of them don't have a clue!!<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I heard that the pro bodybuilders you insulted in your last Q&A column, where you gave your brief Mr. Olympia contest commentary, were very offended by your remarks, and I understand several of them plan to kick your ass the next time you show your face at a bodybuilding contest unless you issue a formal apology. When I read your remarks, I thought they were rude and out of line. Don't you think you owe them an apology?<P></B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Oh... you're absolutely right... an apology is in order. Here goes... <BR><I>I'm so very sorry that you've taken so many bucketsful of steroids and gallons of growth hormone that you all look like circus sideshow freaks.</I><BR> Will that work?<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B> I've been reading a lot about these MuscleTech products in <I>Muscle-Mag International</I>. These supplements have really been getting a lot of hype. I have a hard time taking many of their claims seriously, but they recently alleged their new product, Creatine 6000-ES, works better than any other creatine supplement, including Phosphagen HP, which is what I use. If there's a better creatine supplement on the market, I want to use it. But I'm skeptical-I occasionally scan the newsgroups on the Internet, and I saw one person write that the publisher of <I>MuscleMag</I>, Bob Kennedy; one of their editors, Johnny Fitness; and a writer named Greg Zulak own MuscleTech. He said these guys are scumbags and are running a major scam. Do you know the inside story?</B><P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>I've been asked different versions of this question literally hundreds of times over the past few months. Let me tell you what I know... starting with Bob Kennedy, who does not fit my definition of "scumbag." I have nothing but good things to say about Bob Kennedy. He is a unique individual, an extremely hard-working man, and he has done a lot for me and many others over the years-very unselfishly. He's also got an incredible sense of humor-his personality can definitely be seen throughout the pages of <I>MuscleMag</I>. He loves bodybuilding, he enjoys being entertained and being an entertainer, and, without expected reciprocation, he has helped many in this sport/endeavor bolster their careers. As for Bob's magazine, I always enjoy reading parts of it.<P>
Now, I don't know Greg Zulak or Gino Edwards (who writes under the "tongue-in-cheek" pen name of Johnny Fitness) all that well, but what contact I have had with them has been very amicable. I have no reason to believe that these people are scumbags or that they are up to something malicious.<P>
As far as the MuscleTech products being "hyped," I suppose I agree with that, but hype or aggressive promotions alone are not inherently wrong. I think that's true whether you sell supplements, gym equipment, furniture-whatever. There is absolutely, positively nothing wrong with aggressive marketing (if there were, I'd be in big trouble because I pride myself as being a very aggressive, creative, but straightforward promoter).<P>
I can't tell you the "whole story" behind MuscleTech because I simply don't know it. To the best of my knowledge, a young gentleman by the name of Paul Gardiner (the guy who appears in the before and after ads for MuscleTech) owns the company. I believe Paul used to work at a <I>MuscleMag</I> retail store in Canada. I have no evidence that suggests any type of ownership of MuscleTech by Kennedy, Zulak, or Edwards. I asked Kennedy about it, and he told me, very convincingly, that he has no ownership interest in MuscleTech, and I'm inclined to believe him, but that doesn't mean I believe that's all there is to the story; however, I have more important things to do than play 007 and go digging around to try to figure out what the deal is. It's possible he's telling the truth when he claims he has no interest in the company whatsoever. Why <I>MuscleMag</I> runs pages and pages of editorial plugs for MuscleTech products, if they aren't getting paid something besides regular advertising rates, I have no idea.<P>
Now, I do have one major problem with this MuscleTech campaign, and that is this nonsense about their Creatine 6000-ES product being better than Phosphagen HP, and the B.S. about scientific studies that show this. One thing I can tell you, with the utmost certainty, is that it is <I>completely untrue</I> that Creatine 6000-ES has been proven to be better than Phosphagen HP in any real scientific studies-the type of studies that EAS funds, which are conducted at legitimate universities by qualified sports medicine doctors using double-blind, placebo-controlled designs.<P> 
And, I can tell you that there are now three separate university studies showing that Phosphagen HP produces significant effects-effects even greater than regular creatine monohydrate (which is a very good supplement by itself!). The first study was conducted at the University of Nebraska at Omaha with college football players. In this trial, athletes who trained with weights and used Phosphagen HP gained more size and strength, lost more fat, and could jump higher and run faster than weight trainers who used regular creatine or a placebo. The results of this study are being presented at the American College of Sports Medicine's next conference.<P>
Another study in which Phosphagen HP was compared directly to creatine monohydrate was conducted at Creighton University where it was shown that Phosphagen HP significantly enhances "anaerobic work capacity"-by over 30%-which is over twice as much as creatine monohydrate alone has been shown to do! The results of this study will be presented at the next National Strength and Con-ditioning Association scientific conference.<P>
Yet another study, conducted by Dr. Richard Kreider at the University of Memphis, indicates that Phosphagen HP produces <I>significant</I> increases in lean mass and strength. The results of this study will also be presented at the next American College of Sports Medicine conference.<P>
As I've explained to you before, there are a lot of companies out there selling creatine monohydrate products that contain added amino acids and other "creatine boosters," <B>but not a single one</B> of them has been put to the test like Phosphagen HP has.<P> 
As you probably know, ever since I've been involved with EAS, I've been allocating thousands of dollars to legitimate university research. Lately, numerous other supplement companies are claiming their products are scientifically tested, too, but in most cases, it's not true-it's just a marketing ploy.<P>
So, to wrap this up-I really don't have anything bad to say about Kennedy, Zulak, Edwards, nor <I>MuscleMag</I>. I don't have any evidence that these individuals own MuscleTech, and I don't have any problem with MuscleTech trying to sell their products. My one major complaint is the misleading comparison and unsubstantiated claim that their creatine product has been shown to be more effective than Phosphagen HP. That claim simply isn't true; as a matter of fact, if they can provide proof, in the form of real, double-blind, published university studies, that their Creatine 6000-ES product is better than Phosphagen HP, I'll cut them a check for $30,000. That's a pretty fair challenge-don't you think?<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I've been reading a lot about DHEA lately, first in your magazine and then in the newspaper. I'm a 42-year-old "recreational bodybuilder," and I'm really quite conservative when it comes to the use of medications and even supplements. I don't like to just start taking something because everyone else is. In an effort to determine if I really needed to take DHEA, I went to my doctor and asked if he could test my blood levels for the hormone to see if I'm deficient. He looked at me like I asked him for a sex-change operation-he made me feel about two inches tall. The bottom line is that he refused to run a blood test so I could gain the knowledge about my body I need to make an informed decision. It really pissed me off. So now, I'm asking if you know where I can get a blood test, and while I'm at it, do you think I should be taking DHEA anyway?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>I can completely understand your situation-over the years, I've received many letters like yours-these letters had a lot to do with the frustration (which I explained in this issue's "No Holds Barred" column) that I have with the medical community. These doctors go on TV and tell people things like, "DHEA should be used only by people who are deficient in this hormone..." Then, people like you, who are taking responsibility for their own health care, ask their doctors to help determine if they're deficient in a hormone like DHEA or testosterone or if they have high levels of cortisol, and the doctors get offended. I don't know if their egos are such that they can't accept the fact that one of their patients would even know what the hell DHEA or testosterone is or if the American Medical Association (AMA) and the insurance companies have got them by the balls so tightly that they're afraid to do anything that isn't 100% AMA standard operating procedure or that they might not get reimbursed for.<P>
I've been able to finagle my own account with MetPath Laboratories. (I can have my blood tested in any damn city in the country-I can have a lab tech come out to my office and draw my blood any time I feel like it, and I can get every test run that you can think of.)<P>
I'm fascinated by blood work. I'm always keeping an eye on my liver and kidney enzymes, cholesterol and triglyceride levels, as well as watching how my hormone levels react to different training, nutrition, and supplementation programs. It's really quite fascinating, but it is expensive-I probably spend $1,000 every 8 weeks on blood tests.<P>
As far as where you can get your blood tested, I wish I could turn you on to my source, but I had a hard enough time getting this account set up for myself-I don't want to blow it. What I would suggest is that you try seeing another doctor-make some calls, and be very honest. Try to get hooked up with a doctor who understands where you're coming from. Although most physicians will rudely reject your ideas, I'm certain that you will eventually find one who will be supportive and respectful of your desires.<P>
As far as whether I think you should be using DHEA or not, I believe that since you are over 40, you probably could benefit from taking between 50 and 200 mg of DHEA a day. Over the past six months, I've gathered a lot of feedback from readers of my magazine who are using DHEA, and there is unquestionably a connection between the age of the user and how much of a benefit he or she experiences. The older you are, the more you benefit from DHEA supplementation. Of course, this is because as you grow older, your body produces less and less DHEA. (By the way, women need less DHEA-maybe only 25 mg/day.)<P>
As long as we're on the subject of DHEA, let me tell you something about this hormone that has not been discussed much, if at all, in the many articles I've read about this compound. DHEA seems to have potent "anti-anxiety" properties. This is a very interesting effect of taking DHEA. Virtually all of us face anxiety in our lives, and for many, this anxiety leads to stress levels that raise cortisol (something that bodybuilders don't need excess amounts of circulating in their bodies). Anxiety becomes such a problem for some that they're often put on anti-anxiety drugs called benzodiazepines. Scientists have discovered that DHEA may work just as well as these potent medications, without the side effects. And, DHEA also acts as an antidepressant or mood-elevating agent.<P>
Another interesting little tidbit of info about DHEA is that it may relieve the major symptoms of Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS). It appears that women who suffer from severe PMS have a different pattern of daily DHEA production than women with no PMS.<P>
There's no doubt that DHEA is an interesting compound-one that could have a lot of applications for adults over the age of 35 or 40. Of course, don't expect your doctor to know about any of this-what's usually on his or her mind is getting you in and out of the office as fast as possible without having to answer queries from you that bring their omnipotence into question.<P> 

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I read about the EAS Grand Spokesperson Championship in the last issue of your magazine, and it sounds like a really neat contest. I was going to enter the contest, but that was right before Thanksgiving, so I decided to start after the holiday, but then I couldn't train for a whole week because I took a vacation, and then I just couldn't get started on my diet because of all the holiday parties and whatnot. I just can't see bringing a Tupperware bowl with steamed rice and grilled chicken to a Christmas party where everyone is enjoying prime rib, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie, and so on. I think once I get all of this holiday hoopla out of the way, I'll be ready to start a program and stick with it. Is it too late to get involved?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>I'd give you a bad time about your procrastination and lack of discipline <I>if</I> I didn't do the same damn thing myself. Between Thanksgiving and New Year's is a really hard time to stay focused on a strict weight-training and nutrition program. Fortunately, you can still get involved in the EAS Grand Spokesperson Champion-ship, but I wouldn't wait around any longer-I would start your program <I>immediately</I> after the holidays. Whereas Thanksgiving through New Year's may be a shitty time to start a shape-up program, the day after New Year's is an excellent time! Building a more muscular, leaner, stronger body is a fantastic New Year's Resolution, and with the holidays behind you, you have NO MORE EXCUSES!<P>
Remember why I set up this self-improvement contest to begin with-I recognize that virtually everyone needs <I>positive pressure</I> to help them achieve their goals. I know that providing you with good information about training, nutrition, and supplementation gives you the knowledge to make progress, but if I don't do something to motivate you or give you a strong incentive to put your knowledge into practice, then I'm not doing my job-I'm not helping you build a better body.<P>
Remember, in my contest, the winners will not be judged by who has the greatest physique but rather by who makes the most improvement and who can articulate, in a 400-word essay, why he/she should be the Grand Champion.<P>
I've been very encouraged by the number of people who've entered the EAS Grand Spokesperson Championship, and I've received a lot of positive feedback. People really are having fun with this, and they're doing exactly what they should be-setting goals, developing a plan, and giving their bodybuilding program a 100% all-out effort.<P>
But, let me tell you something-the number of people who <I>enter</I> this contest will be far, far greater than the number of people who <I>finish</I> it. Unfortunately, some people, no matter how much they think they want to build a stronger, more muscular physique, don't really want it bad enough. They just can't stick with it. They train hard for a couple of weeks, follow a strict diet, and then they virtually give up on themselves. Hey... if you miss a couple workouts, blow your diet for a few days, etc., don't give up! Just forget it, and get right back on your program. Don't sabotage yourself. Giving up on your program because you had a bad day, or even a bad week, is analogous to getting a flat tire on your car and, instead of just fixing it, getting out and slashing the other three.<P> 
My advice to anyone who's thinking about getting involved in the EAS Grand Spokesperson Championship, and to those who are already on their programs, is to please stick with it! After 12 weeks of strict dieting, intense training, and proper supplementation, you are going to be so proud of what you've accomplished and so elated about what you see in the mirror that it could very well change your whole life!<P> 
This contest has the largest prize package in the history of bodybuilding (over half a million dollars in prizes!). The winner will receive my Lamborghini Diablo (valued at over $200,000) and a $50,000-endorsement contract; the runner-up will win a brand-new Corvette (valued at $41,000) and a $50,000-endorsement contract; 8 other finalists will win $10,000-endorsement contracts; and 40 others will receive a free 1-year supply of their 2 favorite EAS supplements (valued at $2,000).<P>
For those of you who are competing in this contest-please realize that every day you stick with your program, your chances of winning become better and better. That's because every single day, other competitors are giving up on themselves. Remember, those who succeed persevere-they know that grand achievements are the result of <B>consistent</B> small efforts, repeated daily.<P>
Okay-enough preaching-for those of you who still might want to get involved in the EAS Grand Spokesperson Championship, call 1-800-749-5596 (ask for Dept. #4355). When you call, I'll send you a complete training, nutrition, and supplementation program (which is a great bodybuilding guide, even for those who aren't competing in the contest!). I'll also send you a complete list of the rules and regulations and a couple free samples of EAS supplements along with coupons good for $40 off of supplements like HMB, Phosphagen HP, Phosphagain 2, etc.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>I heard about the new EAS supplement BetaGen<SUP><FONT SIZE=-3>TM</FONT></SUP> and something else called Myoplex Plus Deluxe<SUP><FONT SIZE=-3>TM</FONT></SUP>. What's in these products, and how do they work?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>BetaGen is a new supplement that contains a combination of creatine and HMB (probably the two best bodybuilding supplements on the market). Not only do I think BetaGen works extremely well-enhancing size, strength, and quite possibly accelerating fat loss-but it's also very convenient and an excellent value. BetaGen comes in a delicious orange-flavored drink mix-you take 11_2 teaspoons of the powder, stir it in a little water, or add it to a protein drink or meal-replacement powder-it really is simple and easy to use.<P>
With Myoplex Plus Deluxe, you basically have a top-of-the-line meal-replacement powder with 42 grams of protein, including a high percentage of ion-exchanged whey, and you also get a dose of V2G, GKG, and CLA in each serving. Myoplex Plus Deluxe is probably the most nutritionally complete bodybuilding supplement I've ever used, and it tastes fantastic. It was not an easy task getting all of these nutrients combined into one "supershake" and making it creamy, delicious, and easy on the gut, but we did it.<P>
On the supplement program I'm using now, I have a serving of Myoplex Plus Deluxe with one serving of BetaGen in it first thing in the morning, and then I have the same thing again in the afternoon, and sometimes I have another serving of Myoplex Plus Deluxe, by itself, later in the evening. Then, right before I go to sleep, I have a serving of BetaGen mixed with our new cell-volumizing formula, CytoVol. This is a fantastic supplement program.<P>
Instead of going into lengthy explanations about these new EAS supplements, I've included a special report in the back of this magazine that has in-depth information about EAS' entire new 1997 supplement line.<P>
Please notice that this special report is what's called a "bind-in" piece. I did not take any articles out of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> to include this information. I included this report simply because we have been getting literally thousands of requests for more information on the new EAS supplement line, and I thought it would be helpful to many of our readers to include information about these products. Those of you who are not interested in supplements, don't even bother looking at this section-it's for people who have questions about what these products are, what kind of science is behind them, what is in them, and how to get them. Once again, this special report was not put in at the expense of any columns or feature articles that were scheduled for this magazine.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>The owner of my health-food store gave me some information about a supplement called Endurox. He said this stuff has been proven in scientific studies to enhance athletic performance. Do you know if it works?</B>
<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>Endurox is a form of Siberian ginseng called Ciwujia that has been heavily promoted in recent months as a performance enhancer. The claims of enhanced endurance with Endurox are not completely unsubstantiated, but most of the data, which allegedly supports the efficacy of this compound, cannot be located through the extensive research databases we have access to. I think some of these studies were done in Eastern Europe years ago.<P>
I figured a good way to determine if Endurox really works is to put it to the test in a university study, so that's what we're doing. I had EAS provide funding for a double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate anaerobic work capacity and aerobic endurance at Creighton University. We should have preliminary results of this study by the time the next issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> goes to press. The doctors who are conducting the study intend to present the findings at the next National Strength and Conditioning Association scientific conference.<P>	
I have no financial interest in Endurox whatsoever; I think it might actually work, but I'm not sure, and the data that's out there is not what I would call really compelling.<P>
As you probably know, EAS is allocating funds to advance the whole science of sports nutrition. A lot of this funding will be spent to investigate products which EAS sells or is developing, but some of it will be spent on studies like this one-studies that are designed merely to answer the question, "Does this supplement work, or doesn't it?"<P>
I'll keep you posted.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B> <B>A friend of mine recently bought 20 vials of LyphoMed Deca for $30 a piece from a guy in our gym who said that this is the most powerful brand of Deca there is and that it's definitely not counterfeit. Is this really the best stuff?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>To start with, Deca (nandrolone deca-noate) is the same molecule no matter what brand name you've got-Organon, Steris, LyphoMed, etc. It's all the same thing. That is, if it's real, and the LyphoMed that your friend just bought ain't.
LyphoMed was sold to another company called Fujisawa U.S.A. in 1990 and changed to that name in 1993. They stopped making Deca in January of 1990. The last expiration dates were 1992. 
LyphoMed Deca used to be one of the most popular brands on the black market because a wily cat in Florida was buying the stuff (out the "back door") with a pharmaceutical license he fraudulently obtained. I remember seeing that stuff floating around the gyms-you could buy a box of 25 of those suckers for a hundred bucks. That was only $4 for a 200-mg vial! But, those days are long, long gone.
Today, almost all of the steroids which are sold on the black market are fake, and some of the injectable ones, like what your friend recently got his hands on, can be very dangerous. Sometimes they just contain regular vegetable oil, which was definitely not intended to be injected into your body. Any impurities or bacteria that are in this stuff can cause terrible infections. Over the past couple of years, I've heard of a lot of guys who got abscesses in their glutes from using counterfeit, injectable steroids. These abscesses have to be "lanced" and left open for days to drain, and sometimes the infections can spread and become life threatening.
Going back to my "No Holds Barred" column in this issue of the magazine once again, my point with this whole steroid issue is that when the government clamped down on the black-market distribution of real anabolic steroids <B>and</B> also made it illegal for doctors to prescribe these drugs, they created a much bigger problem. You see, they did not squelch the <B>demand</B> for steroids; they just cut off the supply. Now there's this huge counterfeit steroid problem.
Steroids, like virtually all other drugs, should be administered under the careful scrutiny of a qualified doctor. Hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, that will be possible, and we can put this whole problem behind us. 
I wish I could keep you up to date on every counterfeit steroid that hits the market, but that's impossible. In my new book-the 7th edition of my <I>Anabolic Reference Guide</I>-I'll give you all the information I have on how to identify dangerous counterfeits and so on.

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>What do you think of the following supplements: Acetabolan, Hydroxycut, Ripped Fuel, Blue Thunder, MegaMass 2000, Male Fuel, PowerBar, Cort-Bloc, carnitine, pyruvate, and Tribestan?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>That's a great question, but unfortunately, it requires an answer that is far beyond the scope of this column. (I've got only so much space to work with here.)
I review each of these supplements and over a hundred more in my all-new, completely updated <I>1997 Supplement Review</I>. I evaluate what they do and don't do from a scientific and real-world standpoint. I also go into great detail about how you should decide what supplements are likely to work for you taking into consideration what your particular bodybuilding goals are. I tell you how to buy supplements at the lowest prices and not get ripped off. I also show you how to stack supplements to get the best results. It's really a great book, if I do say so myself (and I do).<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>I've been reading your magazine for about a year and a half, and I've noticed that you rip on people left and right; last issue you basically said Cybergenics and Hot Stuff were garbage, and you regularly implicate many others in the bodybuilding industry as being immoral, unintelligent, and have even accused some of being criminals. Sometimes I wonder who you think you are-are you so delusional that you think you're perfect and therefore see everyone else as inferior or what? I've seen some things written in the other magazines that suggest you are far from perfect, like that you've used steroids.</B>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>I'm delighted that you read my magazine, but I think you may not be reading it carefully.<P>
On a <I>regular basis</I>, I openly and candidly admit numerous things I do that are much "less than perfect."<BR> (Mother Teresa I ain't-that's for sure!)<P>
One of the things that is perceived as negative by many people is my use of steroids when I was competing in bodybuilding in the '80's, which is something I've been very honest about. But, that was such a valuable learning experience for me. How could I possibly be an expert on something if I've never experienced it? Experimenting with all different kinds of steroids back then enabled me to gain invaluable introspection and knowledge on this subject. Some view this as a negative thing-I see it as a positive experience.<P>
I think the thing that makes me an effective bodybuilding information provider-the reason literally tens of thousands of bodybuilders read every issue of <I>MM2K</I>-is because, in some way, they can relate to me. I'm not perfect, but I am "in touch" with this market because I have many of the same wants, needs, desires, etc. as my readers. I'm "barely out of my 20's" (80% of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> readers are between 20 and 35 years of age), and I see and feel the same things as many of my readers. Usually, by the time people are asking me questions about something that's new on the market or that's happening in the bodybuilding business, I've already thought of that question myself, because <I>I wanted to know</I> the answer, too. I don't think the other publishers in this industry are as close to the "core" as I am-many of them are well up in their years and are "married to their ideas" (even though their ideas are wrong) and aren't willing to change to meet the needs of the market.<P>
When I'm off base, I just admit it and take corrective action. For example, we used to run stories on those Galaxy Fitness contests which the majority of my readers hated, so we dropped 'em. Hey, it was a mistake; I admit it, and I learned from it.<P>
Also, not every supplement my company, EAS, comes out with is a hit. I think the biggest bomb we ever dropped was a supplement we called Betadrine. The stuff sucked-I admit it. So we got rid of it.<P>
Despite regularly working 80-90 hours a week, I try to live a "colorful life." (I like to "party" when I get my work done.) Sometimes this gets me "in trouble." For example, in '95, when I was supposed to be covering the Mr. Olympia contest, I went out with a bunch of friends and got drunk before the show and forgot my glasses and couldn't even see the friggin' competitors, but I came clean-I told you the truth. The next time I went to that show, I remembered my glasses, and I didn't get drunk until <B>after</B> the contest.<P> 
And you know what, sometimes I don't put my weights away after I'm done with the leg press. (I know, that's awful...)<P>
And, I have my fair share of weaknesses. For example, one thing I constantly struggle with is that somewhere deep in my subconscious I have this urge (which I keep under control <B>almost</B> all the time) to get drunk and eat pizza every Friday night and go out with every beautiful woman I see-I seem to be having a real problem with Playboy Playmates especially. (I realize I'm probably the only guy in the world who feels like this...)<P>
Oh... as far as the criticism and rumors that you see (which usually emanate from my competitors), some of them might be warranted, and some of them probably aren't. (Rumors are usually not the truth.)<P>
It is disappointing when you see people writing or saying things that are not true. Typically, they have their own agenda. These things used to really irritate me, but then I realized such attacks meant that I had reached a certain level where jealousy could rule. After that realization, I've almost grown to welcome the negative side of success. It means I have reached a higher level. I think that everyone who reaches a certain standard of success has these problems.
I don't hide behind my writers and use them as puppets like the editors of some other magazines-I just lay it on the line. I give you the real deal-the straightforward, uncensored truth-and if sometimes you think that by criticizing others, I'm trying to make myself look perfect, I encourage you to look deeper and see that, in reality, I admit error, poke fun at myself, and am constantly striving to improve.<P>
My goal is to have the best fitness and physique development magazine there ever was (we're not there yet, but I think we're on our way!). I also want to completely change the sports nutrition business and truly make it a scientifically valid and respectable industry. I want my business to be even more successful, <B>and</B> I want more muscle and less fat!<P>
When it's all said and done, I'm really probably a lot like you and am most likely no more or less perfect than you.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></B><B>For the last few weeks, I haven't been sleeping worth a damn. I was wondering if it could be because of the supplements I'm taking-I'm using glutamine, whey protein, and creatine. Could any of those supplements be causing my insomnia?</B>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT></B>I doubt it. Usually the supplements that cause insomnia are things like ephedra, guarana, and other central-nervous-system stimulants.<P>
There are so many different causes of insomnia-millions of people struggle with this problem-I have had bad cases of insomnia myself. Sometimes, things just get so hectic and my mind just won't stop thinking, so to speak, and I can't get to sleep. Sometimes it's because I'm really stressed about something (like a magazine deadline); other times it's because I'm excited (like when I think of a new promotional campaign or a new product).<P>
A lot of people use over-the-counter sleeping pills (Unisom, Sleepinal, Nytol, or Sominex), but those don't work for me-they make me feel like I have a hangover the next day.<P>
I tried prescription sleeping pills, like Halcion (no thanks... I can live without the nightmares that shit causes), and other times I've used Xanax (a very small dose-.25 mg works well), but lately, I've been using an old-fashioned remedy-I just take 3 grams of tryptophan about half an hour before I want to go to sleep, and it really works! I get a good night's sleep, and I don't have that drug-like hangover the next day.<P>
The reason tryptophan may help you get a good night's sleep is because this amino acid is a precursor to a neurotransmitter called serotonin, which is basically the chemical that helps you go to sleep. (You can read more about this subject in an article in this issue called "The Science of Sleep.")<P>
Some people get very good results using melatonin, but for some reason, it doesn't work as well for me as plain old tryptophan.<P>
Unfortunately, since 1988, the FDA has enforced a dubious state of near-total tryptophan prohibition, based on the occurrence of serious side effects traced to a single contaminated batch of the amino acid, produced by a Japanese corporation called Showa Denko. This company had altered the time-honored manufacturing procedure for tryptophan, inducing a new and untested procedure, while abbreviating an important filtering step.<P>
The adverse effects of this tainted batch of tryptophan, which unfortunately included numerous deaths, have never been linked to any other batches of tryptophan. Nevertheless, the FDA has maintained its prohibition in spite of overwhelming evidence that it is not only unnecessary but may also be forcing people to take more dangerous and expensive drugs.<P>
I order tryptophan from one of these foreign mail-order companies called Inhome Health Services, Suite 401, 302 Regent Street, London, W1R 6HH, England.<P>
Whatever you do, don't let the insomnia continue-a lack of sleep can destroy your bodybuilding efforts and knock your IQ down about 50 points. A lot of bodybuilders who suffer from a lack of energy and strength interpret this as being a sign of overtraining, but they're actually suffering from sleep deprivation.<P>
As one more alternative remedy, I've found that reading Anthony Almada's articles in back issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> produces ample sedation and usually results in deep slumber in 15-20 minutes.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>In your last Q&A, you talked about preventing injuries. However, you didn't talk about the number of reps you should do for a proper warm-up. I used to religiously warm up with 2 sets of 15-20 reps, but after your answer, I lowered the reps and increased the sets. I find this works much better and gives me a much better workout. But I'm unsure of the number of reps I should perform in my warm-up. My primary training reps range from 10-12 on medium days and 6-8 on heavy days.</B>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>The most common mistake people make when warming up is they perform way too many reps. Some sports medicine practitioners have even noted that the people who show up at their clinics often have one thing in common: they perform high reps to prepare for a max lift.<P>
The best way to warm up is to do a lot of low-rep sets. Why? When warming up for strength training or bodybuilding, the body has to know only that the weight is going to be heavy and what the range of motion is on that particular lift. If you warm up with low reps, you won't get a buildup of too many fatigue metabolites which will interfere with neural conduction. In other words, you won't burn out before you get to your heavy sets.<P>
Here are some sample plans on how to warm up for different rep ranges and strength levels.<P>
<CENTER><B>Example 1: the target is 3 x 10-12 reps @ 100 lbs</B><P>
<B>Warm-up<BR>
	40 lbs  x  5 reps<BR>
	60 lbs  x  3 reps<BR>
	75 lbs  x  1 rep<BR>
	85 lbs  x  1 rep<BR>
	95 lbs  x  1 rep</B></CENTER><P>
Rest just long enough to adjust the weight for yourself. Your partner can also go in between your warm-up sets. Rest 3 minutes after the single rep at 95 lbs. Then begin your work sets at 100 lbs.<P>
<CENTER><B>Example 2: the target is 6 x 2-3 reps @ 315 lbs</B><P>
<B>Warm-up<BR>
	45 lbs  x  2 sets  x  4 reps<BR>
	135 lbs  x  3 reps<BR>
	185 lbs  x  2 reps<BR>
	225 lbs  x  1 rep<BR>
	275 lbs  x  1 rep<BR>
	300 lbs  x 1 rep</B></CENTER><P>
Rest just long enough to adjust the weight for yourself. Your partner can also go in between your warm-up sets. Rest 3 minutes after the single rep at 300 lbs. Then begin your work sets at 315 lbs.<P>


<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> I'm preparing for a bodybuilding show, and my local university offered to monitor my body composition via underwater weighing. Is this method any good? I want to know because they charge $65.00 a pop for each test.</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> It's often stated, although erroneously, in bodybuilding and fitness magazines that underwater weighing is the best method for measuring bodyfat.
For the well-trained bodybuilder, this test isn't that valid. For example, I once tested a black bodybuilder who had won a silver medal in the Canadian Bodybuilding Championships a few days after this show. He weighed in at 242 lbs at 5'11". When we tested his bodyfat percentage with underwater weighing, it measured out to be minus six percent. How could that be? I was quite intrigued, so I did a bit of digging, and here's what I found:<P>
1)	The skeletal density of blacks is approximately ten percent higher than the skeletal density of whites.<BR>
2)	Very few exercise physiologists know that the density formulas used to estimate bodyfat percentage were derived from weighing cadavers who were, in most instances, homeless people in their 70's. (Obviously, their bone density would be quite a bit less than the average bodybuilder's.)<BR>
3)	Strength training increases bone density.<BR> 
Michael H. Stone, a prominent strength-training physiologist has reviewed the subject most extensively. He wrote a great paper on it which was published in <I>Strength and Power in Sport</I> (edited by P.V. Komi), published by Blackwell Scientific Publications for the International Olympic Committee Medical Commission.<BR>
Dr. Stone points out that:<P>
1)	Bone density is higher in athletes who are exposed to high forces (weightlifters and throwers) as compared to athletes who have an aerobic base (distance runners and soccer players).<BR>
2)	Swimmers (non-weight-bearing athletes) have the lowest bone density.<BR>
3)	Bone density is more likely to increase at weight-bearing sites (e.g., femoral neck) than at non-weight-bearing sites (e.g., mid-radius). (The femur is the thigh bone, and the radius is one of the forearm bones.)<BR>
4)	Depending on the site, junior weightlifters have bone densities 13% to 34% greater than non-athletes.<BR>
5)	Bone-mineral content is highly related to the load lifted. In other words, the stronger you are, the denser your bones are likely to be. This has been shown in both weightlifters and powerlifters.<BR>
6)	Strength training may offset the effects of osteoporosis.<BR>
7)	Strength training is far superior to aerobic training for increasing bone density.<P>
Because some of the added bodyweight you gained while on your bodybuilding program is skeletal weight (particularly if you do lots of squats and overhead work, like snatches and presses), the underwater fat test is rather useless. In fact, your best bet is to use skin-fold calipers and take measurements over ten different sites. Use only the sum of the skin folds as your gauge for bodyfat loss.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> <B>I need some help with my legs. My legs measure 26.5 inches at midpoint. My hamstrings are okay, so I don't work them much. My problem is the inside of my legs. My leg routine is as follows:<P>
	<CENTER>5 sets of squats<BR>
	5 sets of leg presses<BR>
	4 sets of leg extensions</CENTER><P>
I go to 375 lbs on the squat for 6 reps and have 9 plates on each side of the leg press for 6-8 reps. I was going to start doing my leg presses with my feet closer together and lower on the platform in order to emphasize the inside of my legs. Right now my feet are shoulder width apart and high on the platform of the leg press. Could you please help me out?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>I get this type of letter all the time, but they're difficult, if not impossible, to answer because they lack some very basic but essential information. In order to properly assess this person's question, I would need to know the following:<P>
1)	At what tempo are the reps performed?<BR>
2)	How long is the rest interval between sets?<BR>
3)	Are all these sets true work sets, or is the last one the only gut buster?<BR>
4)	How many reps are performed on the leg extensions? And what is the foot position?<BR>
5)	How deep do you go in your squats and leg presses?<BR>
6)	How much do you weigh, and what is your height?<BR>
7)	What do you mean by the inside of your thighs? Do you want to develop the adductors (the long, thin muscles that lie vertically in the inside of the thigh) or the vastus medialis muscles (the "teardrop" shaped muscles slightly above the knee)?<BR>
8)	How often do you train your legs?<P>
I don't have all the info, but I'll do my best to answer your question. Assuming that you want to emphasize the adductors in squat and leg-press training, you have to use a wide stance with the feet turned outward as much as proper ergonomics will allow.<P>
You also want to double the number of reps on every set. In this manner, you'll tap into the FOG (fast oxidative glycolytic) fibers, which will bring about greater growth. In leg training, heavy weights are not always necessary, as we can see from the size of the leg muscles of speed skaters and alpine skiers who perform a lot of work where the time under tension is elevated.<P>
Another tip that will help is that one workout out of two should be devoted to hamstrings-only training-if you are truly interested in thigh size.<P>
Don't hesitate to write me again with your question, but please include the info I need.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> I'm a trainer for the U.S. Air Force, and every month I truly enjoy reading your column and articles, but what I want to know is where do you get all this information? Do you read a lot, or is it experience, or what? What are your sources?</B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>To answer this question, I must say that <B>a)</B> I do read a lot, just in a more creative way than the average person, and <B>b)</B> I apply my readings to my work even if they're not directly related to my field of expertise.<P>
Recently, in between the prejudging and the evening show of the Mr. Olympia, I was graciously invited to go for a ride with Bill in a Gulf Stream jet, and while we were flying over the Great Lakes, we discussed the value of reading. I discovered, as both Type A-behavior people, we hate wasting time and have the habit of "listening to books" while driving in a car or during idle time. I make a point of reading or listening to three books per week. Assuming that the average person drives 30 minutes a day, if that person were to listen to informational tapes instead of garbage radio, he or she would get the equivalent of a university semester of course work in a matter of weeks.<P>
There are many areas of knowledge that we can apply to the field of exercise physiology, whether music, psychology, business, etc. One of the best books I've read over the last few years is by best-selling author and Fortune 500 companies' consultant Steven Covey: <I>The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People</I>.<P>
One of the more useful Stephen Covey quotes is, "The good is the enemy of the best." This refers to the fact that people will keep themselves busy to give themselves the illusion that they're productive. After reading this quote, I went to coach the alpine ski team at the local gym in the ski resort in Whistler. As I was coaching my athletes, I watched the average local trainees who usually get only mediocre results.<P>
These guys were doing the "good instead of the best." They never did the most result-producing tasks. As my female skiers were doing chins with 35-lb to 50-lb dumbbells, some local lift operator (a granola-eating, herbal-cigarette-smoking piece of white trash) came up and admiringly said in a voice reminiscent of Beavis': "Wow, are these ladies ever strong! I wish I could have strong lats like that." Well, at this point, one of my athletes, Stephanie, answered Dorko the Amazing Snowboard-Head (nicknamed by yours truly), "Hey Dorko, maybe your problem is all you do for your lats is the geeky lat-pulldown machine. And by the way, if you were into personal hygiene, you'd be able to pull yourself up without having to lift all the dead cells, dried sweat, and other putrid grunge your body holds on to dearly, you [expletive deleted] twirp. Get out of here before I puke on you."<P> 
People will select good exercises instead of the best ones, even while knowing that in the same time it takes them to do the good exercises, they could do the best ones and see results much faster. So for example, if they did chin-ups instead of pulldowns or squats instead of leg presses, their progress would skyrocket. If they used a variation of the deadlift instead of just leg curls, they'd also build a thick set of erector spinae (the muscles in the lower back which pull you up from a bent-over position). You get the idea.<P>
(By the way, after Dorko was torn apart by Stephanie, he ran to the showers, got a haircut, and is now over his young-adult identity crisis and works as a junior executive at Merrill Lynch under the nickname Sergeant Slaughter.)
<P> 

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> What do you think of Drs. Fleck and Kraemer's new book <I>Periodization Breakthrough!</I> I want to know if it's worth buying.</B>
 
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>In training, like in nutrition, you'll find that there are conflicting opinions on the best way to get cut. For example, Keith Klein uses a low-fat approach to dieting, while Dan Duchaine espouses a 33%-fat diet. Yet there's still some common ground; for example, both Dan and Keith will tell you to stay away from refined sugars.<P> 
You'll find the same thing with training. Some people will tell you to train using low sets (Mentzer, Jones, and Darden), while others believe in using many sets (Egger, Kubik, Hartmann, and Tünnemann), but one common ground that is emerging in bodybuilding is the need for more planned variation in training load and intensities. These variations are known as "periodization."<P>
Amusingly, a few years ago at a sports science meeting in Canada, I got into an argument with a colleague who refused to use the word periodization. He said the word was sexist and not politically correct. His rationale? Periodization will be associated with menstrual cycles: "PERIOD"-ization. What a dweeb. The etymology of periodization actually refers to the word <I>period</I> which in Finnish illustrates the seasons of the year.<P>
Both Drs. Fleck and Kraemer are among the first American exercise physiologists, after Richard Berger, to show a genuine interest in the development of effective strength-training protocols, while their colleagues were still interested in the over-studied field of aerobic training. Both authors have published extensively in the scientific peer-reviewed type of publication and have authored several books on strength training, including the best seller <I>Designing Resistance Training Programs</I>.<P> 
Dr. Fleck has worked for several years as a physiologist and consultant for elite national athletes at the United States Olympic Committee's Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. Dr. Kraemer is from Penn State and has had extensive experience both in the research and practical areas of strength training. He's also the founding editor of the <I>Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</I>. But their biggest credit is that they have been able to "translate" the scientific literature so the layman can understand the material.<P>
As one can see, the book was written by experts. The authors discuss the concepts behind training periodization, the loading parameters to be manipulated, periodization models, monitoring, and planning of training phases-weeks, intermediate cycles, and training year.<P> 
I'd say the degree of satisfaction you'll get from this book will depend on your level of expertise. Someone who works with periodization models on a daily basis (e.g., a university strength coach or a national team coach) may find it too basic, but for about 98% of the readership out there, I would rate the book highly valuable as it bridges the gap between scientific research and practical application. The concepts brought forward in the book will be of help to the fitness enthusiast, athlete, and bodybuilder alike.<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT><B> I'm a tall ectomorph, and my squat has not gone up in weeks. Any suggestions on how I can improve? At first, it went up rapidly, but now I'm at the point where I dread doing my squat workouts. It takes an ephedrine sandwich with ma-huang spread to get up for these workouts. What should I do?</B>
 
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT>First, at this point, the best way to improve your squat is to stop squatting... Yes, I am serious. Your nervous system is probably sick and tired of the movement.<P>
Second, for your slender body type, I would suggest you embark on a bent-knee deadlift specialization program. The bent-knee deadlift and back squat work basically the same muscles. Once you set a new record in the deadlift, you can return to the squat and expect an increase in squatting performance.<P>

Have a training question that you just have to have answered? Well, you're in luck! You can now set up a personal telephone consultation with Charles Poliquin by contacting Laura Moore at Guruetc (500-484-BODY) or e-mail (GURUetc@aol.com).<P>Charles Poliquin is also available for seminars. He'll be discussing Loading Parameters for Mass and Strength Training on March 1 and 2, 1997, in Montreal, Canada. Contact Natalie Delisle at 514-626-8363 or e-mail VAM@total.net for more information.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> Settle this bet for me: my friend, who is a Parillo disciple, says MCT oil is a thermogenic food, like carbs are. I remember you saying that MCT isn't thermogenic and won't raise body temperature, but Parillo says he has research to back up his claim. So who's really right?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> Calling nutrients "thermogenic" is a bit misleading as many people think of "thermogenic" only in terms of drug-like compounds like thyroid, ephedrine, and clenbuterol.<P>
Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT's) are saturated fats, but they aren't digested like most other fats. The majority of fats we eat are emulsified and taken up into the lymphatic system from the small intestine. Carbohydrates and proteins, on the other hand, travel through the small intestine and enter the portal vein, which is an expressway to the liver. MCT oils, because of their chemical structure, can be absorbed into the liver in the same way carbs and proteins are.<P>
Scientists judge whether a food is thermogenic (or not) by simply measuring the food-induced body-temperature elevation after an overnight fast. Some foods, like carbohydrates and proteins, cause a significant increase from the basal temperature after they're consumed, but most dietary fats don't.<P>
So how does this temperature elevation occur? Most of the heat is generated between the small intestine and the liver when carbohydrates and proteins are metabolized and oxidized. For example, in the small intestine, most of the glutamine (one of the amino acids in protein) is used to make ATP (the primary fuel source for every cell in the body). In this breakdown, some heat is generated. And in the liver, whenever carbs and protein are used as fuel, metabolized, or stored, some heat is generated. This heat is then dissipated throughout the body with blood circulation. Most dietary fats, since they enter circulation from the lymphatic system and not from the liver, have very little oxidation or rapid metabolization; hence, they barely elevate temperature when compared to carbohydrates and proteins. The liver will synthesize triglycerides and store them, but it won't use them as a fuel source.<P> 
Medium-chain triglycerides enter the liver and can be oxidized for energy because the liver can metabolize the MCT's into fractured fats called ketones and use them in place of glucose. Not all MCT's are converted to ketones, and the amount converted depends on the metabolic state of the individual. The chief hormone that assists the conversion is a pancreatic hormone called glucagon. How much glucagon there is in the liver depends on the amount of insulin and glucose in the blood. When glucagon is high (blood glucose at or below 50 mg/dl), the conversion of MCT's to ketones is very high. When excessive amino acids and sugars are present in a diet of carbohydrates, proteins, and long-chain fats, the liver converts a significant portion of MCT's into long-chain saturated fats.<P>
The curious thing about MCT's is that the research shows two conflicting facts. On one hand, subjects didn't shuttle MCT oils into bodyfat, and, as opposed to findings with other isocaloric diets (enough calories to maintain bodyweight), the subjects on the MCT diets lost weight. Scientists felt that much of the MCT is oxidized as an energy source, so weight is lost. So in this regard, scientists can say that MCT's raise metabolic rate. However, even though the MCT-fed subjects lost bodyweight on their isocaloric diets, the scientists can't record any significant temperature elevations, like they do when measuring subjects who eat carbohydrates and proteins.<P>
Here is where Parillo and I are both right and wrong at the same time. The consumption of MCT oils does raise the metabolic rate. If you tried two different diets, both at seemingly maintenance-calorie levels, one with MCT's and the other without, you would lose weight only on the MCT diet. But body-temperature levels would be the same on both diets throughout the day. Scientists have postulated that the oxidized heat is somehow dissipated in an unknown, unmeasurable manner. On the BODYOPUS diet, we've found that ketones will be excreted in a greater amount in the urine when carbohydrates are introduced into the body. The body doesn't readily use ketones as an energy source, and when carbohydrates are present, the body prefers glucose, not ketones, for fuel. When this happens, ketones will be more readily excreted because they can't be stored nor reconverted. What's truly happening in the MCT experiments (that show an increase of metabolic rate and no body-temperature elevation) might be a simple excretion of the ketones into the urine. The end result is a loss of usable calories and a reduction of bodyweight, with no temperature increase.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I have a question about the "Anabolic Round Table" a few issues back [<I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, September 1996]. Bruce Kneller stated that human growth hormone is a waste of money, and its ability to burn bodyfat is minimal. But I have a friend who's a national competitor, and he tells me GH [growth hormone] is an awesome fat burner and that all the pro bodybuilders are using it. How good is it really?
<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> This is a very tricky question to answer because I encounter so many people who use GH for different reasons. I have clients who aren't very athletic who are using GH for supposed longevity benefits. They're under a doctor's care, and the recommendation is to use enough GH over a week's time to reestablish the normal IGF-1 level of a healthy 20 year old. The few professional bodybuilders I know all use as much GH as they can afford. And although we've heard stories that some of the top pro bodybuilders are using 25 IUs every day, nobody I know can afford this amount. The most I've seen used, firsthand, is about ten IUs three times a week, but this particular competitor would use more if he could afford it.<P>
From your question, I'm deducing that you're considering using GH to lose some bodyfat, and someone you admire and trust has told you that GH is a staggeringly effective fat burner. GH has a similar quality to the aforementioned MCT oil: both are unusual metabolic elevators. We have research which showed that human subjects lost bodyfat while using GH, but it happened in an indirect way. In other words, the subjects didn't have increased body temperatures, so we can't say GH is a thermogenic drug.<P> 
I hate to say this, but at some dosage, GH seems to have almost magical effects. But scientific research has never generated the great end results we've seen in the bodybuilding arena. We've all seen numerous very good bodybuilders who started making significantly more money, usually from some supplement endorsement contracts, and within a few months, these competitors showed up at contests bigger and more ripped. The majority of bodybuilding experts, myself included, all seem to feel that such progress occurs because these competitors are using more GH since they can now afford more. But keep in mind that the GH is usually stacked with many other drugs. So I have no idea what minimal dosage is needed to start producing this "magic." I have plenty of friends who use four IUs of GH three times a week with virtually no changes in their bodies, but perhaps with long-term use, like a year straight, more people will see results, and I'll be proven wrong.<P>
Need I say that GH is not terribly cost effective? Both ephedrine and herbal yohimbine are potent thermogenic agents, and you can see fat-burning effects within a matter of days. Black-market clenbuterol and prescription thyroid medications can also raise body temperature and reduce bodyfat even more for only a few dollars a day. And if you're brave (or crazy) enough, 20 cents a day of dinitrophenol (DNP) will burn off at least a half a pound of fat a day without dieting; however, this drug is potentially very dangerous. Oddly enough, in the whole mix of fat burners, GH may be the least effective, but it's the safest of the lot as it doesn't raise blood pressure nor over-elevate temperature.<P>
I should add one more thing. I know a number of non-competing bodybuilders (myself included) who have both the finances and the access to GH at very good prices (about $35 for 4 IUs). None of us have bothered to buy and use this drug. Personally, at 44 years old, I don't see enough degeneration of my body from my younger years to warrant spending the money on this overpriced drug. Of course, if GH could grow hair back...<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I'm a 17-year-old bodybuilder with about 4 months of experience. I weigh 126 lbs at 5'6" with 6.5% bodyfat. I can afford about $30-$40 a month for supplements. What should I use? Also, I follow your Isocaloric Diet. Is this a good diet for me, or are there other diets that you would recommend?<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> This is a very commendable bodyfat level. However, a typical (sedentary) doctor might diagnose you as underweight and unhealthy with such a low bodyfat level. You should get some blood tests done to make sure your testosterone and growth hormone levels are at least normal and hopefully at the high ends of the scales for optimal growth. Usually adult men at this low bodyfat level have very low cholesterol levels with correspondingly low testosterone. If you can't get these blood tests (and when I was your age, I couldn't afford to), you might experiment by raising your bodyfat level slightly to around ten percent. You may find that your muscular size and strength gains will accelerate.<P> 
About your use of supplements-I'm assuming you have free access to your family's kitchen and pantry, so you should be able to consume enough supermarket proteins and vegetable oils and won't need to supplement these two macronutrients. I just hope your parents will understand and support you when you clear out the refrigerator a day after it's stocked. Because your supplement finances are so limited, I'll be giving you some unusual advice that I wouldn't give to someone else who could spend more each month. You should shop around for the best buy on creatine monohydrate. You should be able to buy about 210 grams for around $40. Use about 20 grams a day (four 5-gram servings) for 10-12 days. This loading phase should bring enough creatine into the muscles so you can "coast" for another two to three weeks without using it every day and still get all the great effects. Remember that creatine works best with high-glycemic sugars. In this case, sugary Kool-Aid will work just as well as fruit juice.<P>
My Isocaloric Diet is just about perfect for building your foundation. Since you won't be buying exotic oils like flax or hemp to get your essential fatty acids, make sure you use soy oil, as this is the best of the supermarket oils for getting these nutrients. Make it easy on your parents' grocery bill, and derive most of your protein needs from the more economical supermarket proteins like eggs and dairy products. My Isocaloric Diet happens to be the most economical of all the weight-gain diets because the one-third dietary fat portion will cost only pennies a day.<P>


<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> What do you think of Andriol (testosterone undecanoate). It's about time you got back to the steroid stuff. I didn't appreciate all that BODYOPUS crap in the October 1996 issue.<P></B>

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT>  First off, Andriol might be the newest commercial oral steroid available, but it ain't all that swell. For many years, we all (both legal and illegal steroid users) bought the great pitch that Organon gave us. And it was only when we started doing frequent drug tests that we realized that something about Andriol wasn't quite right.<P> 
Here's how this steroid is supposed to work: most steroid compounds taken orally reach the liver from the small intestine. If the steroid hasn't been modified with something called 17-alkylation, the liver will break the steroid down rapidly into metabolites that aren't very anabolic and are eventually excreted in the urine. What Organon has tried (notice "tried") to do with their oral testosterone is pick a very long-acting ester that binds to the oil carrier. They use something called testosterone undecanoate dissolved into oleic acid, the same fat in olive oil. They needed a fat that was a long carbon length, so the fat wouldn't be absorbed into the portal vein that routes directly to the liver. Long-chain triglyceride fats are mostly absorbed into the lymphatic system, bypassing the liver. Organon picked oleic acid because it's an oil that won't turn rancid (oxidize) on a room-temperature shelf, and this combination of the undecanoate ester and oleic acid seemed to work best in getting oral testosterone into the body without 17-alkylation, which puts stress on the liver. Andriol, then, appears to be a convenient, nontoxic oral testosterone. I should point out that Andriol was introduced in 1978, a decade before the first testosterone transdermal patch was commercially available.<P>
The problem is that in the real world, Andriol hasn't worked in the way Organon promised. Each capsule contains 40 mg of testosterone, and the recommended divided dosage is about 6 capsules (240 mg) a day. To remind you, the average man secretes between seven and nine milligrams of testosterone a day. So, when taking 240 mg a day, it's pretty apparent that a lot is lost along the way. This is all fine if that 240-mg amount actually raised blood testosterone levels significantly, on par with either of the two transdermal patches. In comparing the two delivery systems, both patches (having about  20 times  less  testosterone in them) consistently raise blood testosterone more than the recommended oral dosage of Andriol.<P>
In a technical sense, any steroid with an undecanoate ester dissolved into oleic acid would work. If Organon wished, they could easily make a nandrolone undecanoate capsule-an oral Durabolin (although it would be expensive). As it is, Andriol has a higher daily cost than even the transdermal patches.<P>

<B><P><FONT SIZE=+2>GURU:</FONT> I just got steroid tested for my college football team, and I tested positive for testosterone. They say I have a testosterone to epitestosterone ratio of 13 to 1. What does this all mean, and is there any way to explain it?<P></B>


<P><FONT SIZE=+2>Answer:</FONT> Here's how the testosterone test works. Whenever testosterone is produced in the body, a "shadow" of it is made that looks similar but has no hormonal properties. This shadow testosterone is called epitestosterone. Although most of the two types of testosterone get metabolized into other compounds and are excreted, small amounts of both unchanged hormones show up in the urine. Most adult men will have about twice as much epitestosterone as testosterone in their urine, so the ratio would be 1:2 (one part testosterone to two parts epitestosterone). However, a small percentage of men can routinely have a ratio of six parts testosterone to one part epitestosterone (6:1). If you're one of these individuals and routinely test out at about 6:1, there's a possibility that once in a great while, you could generate a ratio of 10:1.<P>
In most college and professional sports steroid tests, officials will allow a testosterone/epitestosterone ratio of up to 6:1 and still call it negative. If your ratio is average, near 1:2, you could use about 200 mg a week of testosterone enanthate and still stay at or under 6:1. If you go over 6:1 and have been average before, then you'll test positive for testosterone, and the sports authorities will believe you've been taking additional testosterone. However, if you've consistently had a very high ratio, near the 6:1 limit, some sports officials will allow a 10:1 ratio and still call it a negative test result.<P>
At 13:1, you've got your tit in the wringer, and basically, you're screwed. There's no explaining this away. All the other various slick ways of raising testosterone, like using HCG, Clomid, or the various anti-estrogens, will increase epitestosterone along with testosterone.<P> 
And the testers have heard almost every possible story before. Mexican wild yam root doesn't affect the ratio. Nor does sarsaparilla, smilax, DHEA, or boron. Some IOC sports officials don't look at total urine amounts; they just look at the ratios, so in the future, if you can find some injectable epitestosterone, you can make a mixture of both hormones (make sure that both are the same esters) and achieve normal-looking ratios, even when using large amounts of steroids.<P>
The shame is, at 13:1, you really weren't using all that much testosterone. You could have almost equaled the elevated serum blood levels by using one of the yet-to-be-banned anti-aromatases, such as Arimidex.<P>

		<H3><CENTER>Is it really the fountain of youth?</CENTER></H3>
		<H4><CENTER>By Dr. John Abdo</CENTER></H4>
		<H4><CENTER>Executive Producer and Host of <I>The Fitness Profile</I> Television Show</CENTER></H4>
		<P>I recently had the unique opportunity to visit the El Dorado Rejuvenation & Longevity Institute (ERLI) in Cancun, Mexico.  Many of you may have seen the ads promoting this institute in other bodybuilding magazines.  Actually, this was my first introduction to ERLI.  Guaranteed claims regarding the treatments offered by ERLI included increases in lean muscle tissue, strength, stamina, bone density, sexual potency, and reductions in bodyfat.  </P>
		<P>After that ad caught my eye several times, I contacted the president of ERLI, Howard Turney.  I introduced myself and explained to Howard my 	interests in investigating his claims to produce some segments for my television show.  Should I find the information newsworthy, I would promote his institute on my program as well as documenting it on video.  Howard responded by inviting me and my crew to visit his institute on November 6, 1993.  That weekend represented a monumental breakthrough in Howard's institute as he hosted the first annual symposium for the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M).  A myriad of research scientists, human biologists, genetic engineers, and nutritionists collaborated for the first time in history to formulate an international affiliation on anti-aging medicine and to reveal their findings to the world.  While attending the seminars, I learned that the drugs and treatments available elsewhere around the world today have proven efficacious and safe for building stronger muscles, enhancing health, and <B>prolonging</B> life in both laboratory studies and in human recipients!</P>
		<P>Dr. Ronald Klatz, ERLI medical advisor, founder of the American Longevity Research Institute, and A4M president, is one of the world's leading 	authorities on anti-aging treatments.  Klatz states, "Aging is not inevitable.  Most of the infirmities and disabilities associated with aging are, in fact, reversible when the mechanisms of human biology are understood, and the treatments are administered accordingly.  Over the years, we have made great strides in human biology, medicine, and aging.  For the first time in medical history, we are now able to utilize this knowledge to keep people younger and stronger throughout their entire life spans so that what we consider to be the normal decline in aging is not inevitable."  Klatz continues to explain, "For the athlete who 	wishes to enhance his or her performance, there are great alternatives to the use of dangerous compounds such as anabolic steroids."</P>
		<HR>
		<H2><CENTER>Hormone Replacement Therapy</CENTER></H2>
		<HR>
		<P>Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is the primary focus for the treatments administered by ERLI and A4M.  Since natural hormone levels decline or become out of balance as we age, depleted blood hormone levels are reestablished and maintained.  Accurate and sophisticated hormone/age related profiles diagnose the degree of hormonal depletion.  Then specific dosages are administered to regain normalcy.</P>
		<P>The HRT offered at ERLI is based around the administration of human Growth Hormone (hGH).  Since hGH is a master hormone, administration acts as a precursor which ultimately results in the endocrine system returning to the natural biological harmony.  The Food & Drug Administration (FDA) has approved hGH for the treatment of dwarfism in children; its applications in the treatment of aging have not yet received approval for use in the United States. However, in April 1982, the FDA issued a bulletin legalizing the use of "Approved" drugs for "Unapproved" applications and in 1988 ruled that it was legal for	an individual to import effective drugs while under a physician's care.  This importation of drugs may not exceed quantities of three month supplies and may be used only for personal administration.</P>
		<P>Taking this FDA ruling into account, Howard Turney discovered a legitimate way to launch his institute while A4M physicians can legally prescribe hGH to American patients.  Several criteria must first be met prior to acceptance on hGH treatment with ERLI and A4M.  1) You must be at least 40 years of age.  2) A thorough medical questionnaire must be completed.  3) A hormonal blood assay must be taken by an authorized A4M physician to indicate a deficient hGH level supported by a computer-generated metabolic analysis identifying the specific rate of age-related hGH decline. (HGH will not be administered to those individuals with healthy levels although other treatments are available which may enhance health and prevent age-related degenerations.)  And 4) a minimum stay of two days is required at the Cancun institute to complete patient evaluation and treatment prescription.  During the patient's stay at ERLI, in-depth	seminars are presented on all aspects of therapy as well as the legal rights regarding returning back to the U.S. with the prescribed medication.</P>
		<HR>
		<H2><CENTER>Manufacturing & Cost</CENTER></H2>
		<HR>
		<P>Prior to 1985, growth hormone had to be extracted from the pituitary glands of cadavers (dead humans).  But with genetic engineering, Genentech and Lilly began producing synthetic versions.  These two pharmaceutical companies developed synthetic growth hormone under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983. The Orphan Drug Act offers incentives for drug manufactures to develop drugs which treat fewer than 200,000 patients.  (There are only an estimated 10,000 growth-hormone-deficient children in the United States.)  The companies who participate in the Orphan Drug Act are granted a seven-year exclusive to 				manufacture and distribute.1</P>
		<P>Earlier this year, Genentech's orphan drug status expired while Lilly's is due to expire sometime in 1994.  Seven years ago, when synthetic growth hormone was exclusively offered, other pharmaceutical companies were reluctant to manufacture this hormone for monetary reasons.  But this year alone, an estimated one hundred million dollars worth of hGH sales are expected.  You can bet the competition has lined up awaiting free-market access.  This will provide additional sources of hGH and (hopefully) lower the cost as well.  The average first 3 month supply costs approximately $4,600 at ERLI.  Maintenance dosages thereafter vary per patient.</P>
		<P>Currently, hGH administration is delivered by subcutaneous injection.  However, in the near future, Dr. Klatz feels that other, more convenient methods will be available probably in the form of nasal sprays or buccal caplets.</P>
		<HR>
		<H2><CENTER>The BioMarker Study</CENTER></H2>
		<HR>
		<P>"One of the most important facets relating to A4M deals with our BioMarker program," states Dr. Vincent Giampapa, director of the Plastic Surgery Center and the National Skin Institute of Montclair, New Jersey.  Dr. Giampapa is an avid bodybuilder and martial artist whose clientele includes a variety of athletes	who have sought Giampapa's supervision after steroid abuse.  Giampapa explains, "The protocol (in general) of our testing determines age-related changes in organisms and genes on a number of levels.  As scientists, we now know of treatments which restore molecular integrity and have a profound effect on health, performance, and longevity."</P>
		<P>The American Medical Association (AMA) theorize that the aging process lies somewhere within the master mechanism of the brain which directs the aging process through its control over the body's hormonal system.  The AMA speculates that aging lies within the individual cells and is linked to genetic	coding.  Deciphering our genetic code serves a primary purpose with the BioMarker program.  Dr. Gregory Fahy, who is on the Board of Directors of the	American Red Cross and who holds a Ph.D. in pharmacology, recently made the following statement:  "The aging process is under biological control.  And since it is under biological control, it is possible to intervene."  Fahy is suggesting that genetic alteration, through the array of treatments we now have access to, can prevent aging.  Fahy adds, "Monitoring hGH levels is the basic building block which controls the aging process."  With scientists like Giampapa and Fahy, the BioMarker program is quickly establishing itself as a world-wide data bank regarding the diagnosis and treatment of age-related maladies and health restoration.</P>
		<HR>
		<H2><CENTER>Profile</CENTER></H2>
		<HR>
		<P>Human Growth Hormone is not a steroid and has none of the side effects which are reported with steroid use.  In fact, the only hGH side effect admitted by ERLI president Howard Turney is a slight retention of fluid for the first three months of treatment as the body's hormonal system rebalances itself.  Beyond that, no further negative effects occur.  (Please be advised that A4M and ERLI use very conservative dosages of hGH.  Reports of acromegalia, carpel tunnel syndrome, and other negative side effects have been reported in athletes who self-administer high dosages of hGH.)  (Editor's Note: And according to Health	magazine's article about the clinic, some of ERLI's patients have reported these negative side effects also.)</P>
		<P>Since most of the patients attending ERLI at this time are nonathletes, statistical information regarding results can only be accounted for the sedentary recipient of hGH therapy.  After only three months of treatment, current ERLI patients are experiencing a dramatic improvement in overall health and well-being.  Within 6 to 8 months, on average, an increase in lean muscle tissue of 8.8% and a 14% reduction in bodyfat are also experienced.  (Under these controlled modes of administration, the results experienced in athletes have not yet been determined.)</P>
		<P>Other benefits documented by ERLI patients read just as the ad does with improvements in muscle strength and endurance, sexual potency, bone density, cholesterol levels, skin tone, and healing capacity following an injury or surgery.</P>
		<P>Although hGH is the granddaddy of drugs at ERLI, staff clinicians prescribe a variety of other treatments which have a vast range of benefits.  These include nutrient supplementation, Smart Drugs, and immune system regulators, just to name a few.  Here's a partial list and description of others:</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Deprenyl:</B> This drug's mechanisms are more brain chemical related than hormone related.  Deprenyl has a profound effect on the many brain chemicals called neurotransmitters that carry messages from one brain cell (neuron) to another.  These brain chemicals are oxidized (degraded) into the brain by an enzyme called monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B).  Scientists have found a progressive increase in brain MAO-B activity with advancing age in humans. Deprenyl use produces a remarkable increase in libido and sexual function.  Since sex is largely an emotional response to external stimuli, researchers believe deprenyl's sexual enhancing abilities affect the physiology of one of the activation centers in the brain where sexual response is generated.  Deprenyl not only increases ones desire for sex (libido) but ability and performance are also increased.3</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>DHEA:</B> This compound is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands.  Research has found DHEA to have significant anti-obesity, anticancer, and anti-aging properties.  DHEA levels decrease with age, and there is good reason to believe that taking exogenous DHEA may extend the life	span and promote youthfulness.  Dr. Vincent Giampapa believes in DHEA and states, "Administration of DHEA, under qualified supervision, has demonstrated to be beneficial in increasing muscle size while reducing fat."  Taken orally, the mode of action for DHEA is linked to its ability to influence other hormones.  In essence, DHEA acts as an endocrine precursor producing similar (but slightly reduced) effects to that of injectable hGH.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Antioxidants:</B>  Among the many antioxidants prescribed by A4M and ERLI include Vitamins C and E, Selenium, PABA, beta-carotene, and Super Oxide Dismutase (SOD).  According to Dr. Lord Lee Benner, chairman of the World Health Foundation, antioxidants are the most effective way to control free radicals that run rampant within our bodies and destroy our cells.  Benner states, "The basics for optimum health and longevity are proper eating, exercise, nutritional supplementation, and stress reduction.  To age successfully (as Benner refers), you have to stop cellular degeneration in the beginning by limiting the ingestion of toxic materials like junk food, drugs, and alcohol, while reducing stress and consuming plenty of antioxidants through food sources and supplementation."</P>
		<HR>
		<H2><CENTER>Athletes' Warning</CENTER></H2>
		<HR>
		<P>Unfortunately, many of the compounds administered by A4M and El Dorado get into the wrong hands and are misused.  When misuse becomes documented, the momentum gained by anti-aging specialists takes an unsatisfying turn for the worse, as with the case of GHB (Gamma Hydroxy Butyrate). According to several A4M scientists, GHB, once available OTC, was the most remarkable compound for stimulating the natural release of growth hormone to	build muscle and lose fat.  GHB got misused, and as a result of overdose, two bodybuilders became hospitalized; the following week, the FDA had GHB taken	off the market.</P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I've heard that using the "Long" kind of IGF-1 produces the best results.  Do you know where I can get this stuff?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I don't know where you can get Long IGF-1 or any other kind.  I knew some guys were getting this stuff through chemical supply houses, but that avenue has dried up--as a matter of fact, a couple guys got busted for trying to buy IGF-1 from these sources.<P>
	As far as Long IGF-1 being stronger--I'm not sure if that's the case.  There is some possibility that Long IGF-1 could be the most dangerous type bodybuilders are experimenting with because it has the potential to cause systematic anaphylaxis (a type of allergic reaction that you can die from).<P>
	If I were you, I wouldn't use any type of IGF-1 until scientists answer more questions about exactly how this stuff affects human beings.

<FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT> I've read about this new supplement called CLA a few times over the past few months in <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>.  I want to try it, and I've looked everywhere--GNC, the gym I work out at, and my local health-food store.  No one even knows what this stuff is.  Do you know where I can find it, or do you have any more info on CLA?<P><HR>

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> You're right--you can't find CLA supplements at GNC or any other health-food stores or gyms that I know of.  (I think CLA supplements will probably hit the U.S. market hard within the next 8-12 months.)<P>
	CLA (which stands for conjugated linoleic acid) is a very interesting new product.  I first became interested in CLA supplementation about four or five months ago.  I literally looked all over the world trying to find this stuff and finally located a source for it in Norway.<P>  
	CLA represents a totally new kind of bodybuilding supplement--as you are probably already aware, CLA is a special type of "fatty acid" that some experts, like Dan Duchaine and myself, believe has the potential to be a potent "growth factor."<P>
	And, we aren't the only ones who are convinced CLA has potential.  I know of some very well-respected doctors and scientists who have extensively studied CLA supplementation and are convinced it can accelerate growth (in the absence of increased calories) and can help minimize weight loss which may occur subsequent to elevated levels of catabolic hormones.<P>
	These scientists aren't interested in how CLA supplementation can help bodybuilders get bigger and stronger--their interest revolves around the use of CLA as a growth factor in animals intended for meat production (such as broiler chickens).  These scientists are also interested in how CLA supplementation can be used to prevent weight loss in people who are suffering from various diseases and adverse metabolic conditions.<P>
	Over the last 6 months, I've spent at least 100 hours reading every clinical study I could find regarding CLA supplementation.<P>
	Although no clinical studies have examined what effects, if any, CLA supplementation might have on body composition or strength levels of weight trainers, I'm <I>convinced</I> CLA has tremendous potential as a bodybuilding agent.  (I recently learned that a CLA/weight trainer study is being designed, and the results from this study should be available within six months.)<P>
	I've been supplementing my diet with four grams of CLA a day for about two months, and there is no question in my mind this stuff works--it's one of the very few supplements I've used that I can honestly say produces the type of effects you can see and feel.<P>
	Of course, I have no evidence that CLA supplements will work for everyone, but this is one topic you'll be hearing more about in future issues of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>.<P>
	I tell all about CLA supplementation in my new <I>1996 Supplement Review</I>--I even show you exactly how I stack CLA with other supplements I'm using, like creatine monohydrate and HMB.  (I had planned to write about how I "stack" supplements in this issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, but to be honest, <I>we ran out of room!</I>  I hope to include that information in the next issue, but if you'd like to check out what I call my "Deluxe" bodybuilding supplement stack [a stack I think is the most powerful supplement combination ever designed], you can find it in Chapter 7 of my <I>1996 Supplement Review</I>.)
	By the way, if you haven't picked up a copy of this book yet, you should!  I think it's very important reading for all bodybuilding supplement users. And you can't beat the price: it's <B>FREE!</B> (Ordering information can be found on page one of this issue.)<P>

<A HREF="v48_a1.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> In addition to working out hard and using the right supplements, what nutritional advice can you give me to help build muscle and burn fat?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a2.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I recently read an article in
<I>Muscular Development</I> where Mike Mentzer predicted that Steve Blechman would take over
bodybuilding when Joe Weider retires because Steve is such a great businessman.  When Joe
steps down, will they stop publishing <I>Flex</I>?  (Aside from <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, <I>Flex</I> is my favorite
bodybuilding magazine.)
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a3.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> If I'm using the low-calorie
lean-mass stimulator Phosphagain<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>; (which contains creatine monohydrate), do I need to take Phosphagen<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>; or Phosphagen HP<SUP><FONT SIZE=1>tm</FONT></SUP>; (which also contain creatine monohydrate)?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a4.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> Do you know any reliable
sources for GHB?  I used to be able to get it at a health-food store near my gym, but they recently
stopped selling it.
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a5.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I read an article in the last issue
of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> [January 1995] about this new supplement called HMB.  I was wondering
if it's all right to use this stuff along with creatine monohydrate.  If I did "stack" these two
supplements--what type of gains do you think I would get?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a6.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> Which supplement works
better--creatine phosphate or creatine monohydrate?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a7.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> If I were to go steroid shopping
in Europe, what would I find as of early 1996?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a8.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I read that the supplement HMB
is a metabolite of the BCAA leucine and KIC.  Can I get the effects of HMB by just taking
leucine or KIC?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a9.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> What do you think are the most
common mistakes bodybuilders make that keep them from gaining size and strength?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a10.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I recently saw an ad for a high-calorie "weight-gain" product that caught my attention.  This ad showed some study results and claimed this was scientific proof this supplement works.  Do you know if this is true?
<P>
<A HREF="v48_a11.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've heard that using the "Long" kind of IGF-1 produces the best results.  Do you know where I can get this stuff?

<FONT SIZE=+3>A:</FONT> I'm aware of the ad and the study you're asking about.  First of all, "proof" is a very strong word--one scientific study isn't <I>proof</I> of anything.  I'm very careful when using the word "proof"--in my opinion, studies offer <I>evidence</I> that something does or doesn't work.  I think you would need a number of pretty solid studies before you could convince me they represent "proof" of anything.<P>
	In this study, weight trainers who used a high-calorie supplement made better gains than lifters who used no supplement.<P>
	Now, from a "scientific" standpoint, these results are not as valid as they could be because the two groups were not "blinded."  That is, the non-supplement users knew they weren't getting anything, and the supplement users knew they were taking something.  This leaves room for a "placebo" effect.<P>
	An inside source told me there was a third group involved in this study that just received a plain carbohydrate powder.  I'm told this "control group" experienced the same results as the weight-gainer group.  If that's true, I guess it means using a supplement that contains calories may help you get better results from your weight-training program <I>if</I> calories are the "limiting factor" in your program.  The results would also offer <I>evidence</I> that the high-calorie "gainer" supplement didn't work better than a plain carbohydrate powder.<P>
	So, I guess this means you should be sure to take in enough calories when you're trying to build muscle.  How much is <I>enough</I>?  Well, I'm convinced, for most, it's less than 3,000 calories a day.<P>

But we never, ever do nothing nice...and easy.<BR>
We like to do it nice...and rough.</I><BR>

--Tina Turner (from the song <I>Proud Mary</I>)<P></CENTER>

Dear Reader:<BR>
	<P>I'm worried.  I look around me, and I see, for the most part, gutless wonders.  Most of us are so shaking-in-our-boots terrified of offending someone that we're turning from a nation of "risk takers" into a nation of "play it safers."  Our role model is Jay Leno, whose ratings continue to rise and whose sole ambition is to get through life without pissing anyone off.</P>
<P>	Heck, who can blame him?  If you're not careful and don't adopt a bland, Wonder-Bread personality--if you take a chance--you're liable to say or do something that will oppose someone else's political, sexual, religious, fashion, sports, cooking, lawn care, or general lifestyle beliefs:  <I>"What do you mean you like the toilet paper up instead of down?  You bastard!  I'm gonna' boycott you, sue you, and maybe even call the toilet paper anti-defamation league. You'll be sorry you ever said that!"</I>  Maybe an appropriate name for our society would be the <I>Kingdom of Nice.</I></P>
<P>	Well, to put a twist on Gordon Gecko's catch-phrase of the '80's, <I>risk is good.</I>  If not for risk takers, this country wouldn't even be here.  If not for risk takers, we'd still be living in the Dark Ages.</P>
<P>	This applies to <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, too.  And excuse me (I wouldn't want to offend anyone) for blowing our horn or, more precisely, Bill Phillips' horn: a few short years ago, Bill had to make a decision: finish medical school and virtually guarantee himself a large salary, a sports car, and a nice big house in the suburbs with a blond wife (who makes a mean meat loaf), 2.2 kids, and a friggin' collie; or, open up an "office" in his mother's garage with an oil-stained floor and write a book about steroids that bodybuilders <I>might</I> actually fork over money to buy.  Needless to say, you know Bill took the road less traveled and wrote his first <I>Anabolic Reference Guide.</I>  A few years later, after some modest success, he took the ultimate gamble: he started a new bodybuilding <I>magazine.</I>  Oh, I can just imagine what his friends and advisors said:  <I>"Let me get this straight, you're gonna' start a bodybuilding magazine that doesn't cover bodybuilding shows, doesn't do stories on how Joe Blow trains his arms, and scrutinizes advertising?  Well, Billy-Boy, good luck, but can you pay me back that five bucks you owe me before you dump your savings into this venture?"</I></P>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>"If not for risk takers, this country wouldn't even be here."</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<P>	Well, you know what happened.  If not for a considerable amount of risk, <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> wouldn't be here, and Bill wouldn't be jockeying for a position with Joe Weider as bodybuilding's most influential publisher.</P>
<P>	Unfortunately, <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> has, along the way, offended some people.  Yes, yes, I know it's hard to believe, but it's true.  It seems a lot of people don't like controversy; they don't like hearing the truth.  For them, anyone who smudges their rose-colored glasses deserves to be publicly attacked and then banished.  And, perhaps even more galling to them is when people who dare to speak the truth are successful.  <I>Well boo-hoo.</I></P>
<P>	I've been pretty thick-skinned to most of these attacks, but lately, a few comments have been cast our way that have put a burr under my psychic saddle.  Witness, just a few short weeks ago, Paul Dillett's comments on the Internet Dillett blasts the new supplement HMB--inferring it is a farce--and states, <I>"Wise up people, the only "supplements" that work where you will really notice a difference beyond what you psychologically tell yourself are DRUGS!</I></P>
<P>	Well, isn't that precious.   Maybe you're right, Paul.  We should ignore scientific studies and new breakthroughs in drug-free bodybuilding. Yes, maybe you're right. Nothing works except drugs.  For those of us who choose not to use drugs, let's just give up.  Let's forget working out, turn on the tube, and spend our days whacking-off to the Baywatch girls.  Never mind that you once told a group of people at a seminar that you ate a whole lot of vitamins to get big, that you personally endorse some sort of weird-ass electrical stimulation machine in the mags, or that your whole existence as a bodybuilder depends on the very supplements you disdain (no supplements, no Joe Weider; no Joe Weider, no professional bodybuilding; no professional bodybuilding, no Paul Dillett).</P>
<P>	Needless to say, there are a lot of people who use and believe in supplements, and there are few places safer to buy them from than Bill's company.  Who else gives unconditional guarantees on supplements?</P>
<P>	I'm not going to spend this entire column ranting about Dillett. He's a great bodybuilder, but that does not make him an expert on supplements.</P>
<P>	Another round of artillery was fired (albeit weakly) at me, more or less personally, in a recent issue of <I>Muscular Development</I>.  The article, written by John Romano, was an interview with Craig Titus, and it was in response to a recent story I did about Titus' run in with the law (involving the alleged sale of the drug ecstasy and possession of steroids with intent to distribute).  It seems poor John Romano was "floored" that any writer could report on the "personal upheaval" of a fellow member of the bodybuilding community.</P>
<P>	Apparently, Titus told Romano that it was all a lie; that I was out to get him, that the DEA was out to get him, that space aliens had framed him, or whatever.  Romano even wrote that I didn't actually interview Titus to get his side of the story, even though my notes on the conversation Titus and I had are right in front of me.  Never mind the fact that I got letters from law enforcement officials, ex-friends of Titus, and guys he had allegedly sent up the river congratulating me on having the guts to write the story.</P>
<P>	Listen John, you're a fine writer; I'd like to have you write for <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, but you have to learn this one basic rule of journalism:  you can't suck up to the people you write about.  Otherwise, you end up writing pathetically myopic articles like the Titus piece.  What happened to Titus was newsworthy.  Believe it or not, there are some kids around who idolize bodybuilders and look to them as role models, and I'm one of those idealistic guys who thinks role models should have moral convictions that are as strong as their bodies.  If they don't measure up, people should know about it.</P>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>"Believe it or not, there are some kids around who idolize bodybuilders and look to them as role models..."</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
<P>	And lastly, the statement that suggests we turn our heads when someone in our "community" does wrong is ludicrous.  Yes, and likewise, Senator Packwood's mistreatment of women should have been ignored by his fellow senators, and O.J.'s "stab" at a marriage with Nicole Simpson should be ignored by his actor and ex-jock associates.  Sure, what's a little alleged killing between friends?</P>
<P>	 A couple of years ago, we took a chance and published an article by a gay doctor with AIDS.  I don't think any other mag would have touched that one with a 10-foot, nonoxinol-9-coated stick.  Instead, we took a chance.  The result?  The realization in the medical community that anabolic steroids could be a valuable treatment for AIDS patients.  Bill and I sleep pretty well at night knowing we helped prolong some lives.</P>
<P>	I could run off a string of similar incidences where taking risks paid off.  Of course, someone is always threatening a lawsuit, if not actual physical violence, against us.  Supplement companies are always angry with us for exposing their scams, and if Bill's anything like me, I'm sure he's wondered more than once what's going to happen when he turns the ignition key.  Dan Duchaine is certainly in the same leaky boat.</P>
<P>	Well, all I can say is, give us your best shot.  We're well aware of the potential risks of taking chances, and we're also aware of the rewards.  If we played it safe and were good citizens of the Kingdom of Nice, <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> would have fallen by the wayside long ago.  Instead, I think we're generally recognized by most of our readers as being straight-shooters.  And, with this trait has come what we consider to be a very faithful, loyal, and intelligent readership that most mags would sell their souls for.</P>
<P>	Taking chances applies to all things in life--even bodybuilding.  Maybe you wanted to try a new way of training or a new supplement, but the resident big guy at your gym said it wouldn't work.  Maybe you wanted to start a new diet, but your "nutritionist" said it was hogwash. Maybe you work out six days a week, but you think there might be something to this Mike Mentzer, high-intensity, couple-of-workouts-a-week thing, but you're afraid to try it.   My question is, how are you going to know if you don't take a chance?</P>
<P>	What's the absolute worst thing that could happen?  I'll answer that for you.  You could gain a pound of fat, lose a pound of muscle, or not make progress quite as quickly as before.  You could easily remedy any of those by going back to your old way of eating or training.  However, let me ask you this question: what's the <I>best</I> possible thing that could happen?  Well, the "risk" you took might pay off big time.  It might be the missing piece of the puzzle, the one thing that kicks your body into gear and starts making your ultimate goal--whatever that might be--obtainable.  </P>
<P>	Life is chance.  Life is risk.  There are no great rewards if you always play it safe.  Once in awhile, you're going to offend someone.  Once in awhile, someone's going to think you're crazy or stupid or maybe even insensitive (shudder).  Maybe.  If you can't handle it, take a back seat and let those of us who want to get down and dirty into the ball game. We might take our share of bloody noses, but once in a while, we're going to run up and down the field leaving spike marks in the opposition.  Then, when we're standing in the end zone, we'll stick our thumbs to our noses, wiggle our fingers, and give the dull, bland members of the Kingdom of Nice a good, loud raspberry.</P>

<P>Be Well!</P>

<H4>by T.C. Luoma</H4></CENTER>
	<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>t's ironic: fat is America's number one enemy, yet only a couple hundred years ago, it was one of the best genetic adaptations a person could have.   Having a "healthy" supply of fat guaranteed you'd make it through a famine or a particularly hard winter.  You could also endure long marches or treks, while those around you who weren't lucky enough to be able to store any fat fell by the wayside into the muddy ditches.  Fat kept you warm when there wasn't enough wood to start a fire, and fat made it easier to sleep on the hard, lumpy ground.</P>
<P>	Sure, all that stuff applied back in more primitive days, but it's now almost the year 2000.  We don't have periods of famine (at least not in the Western world); we have central heating, Sealy Posturepedic beds, and any long treks we take are punctuated--every 15 miles or so--by a McDonald's.  Besides, we now have a whole new aesthetic--we like lean bodies.  Men should have defined chests and abs that ripple at least a little bit.  Women want to be lean and supple like felines, and this desire becomes more pronounced with each passing year.  Where it used to be good enough to have a rear end you could bounce quarters off of, it's now required that you be able to bounce two and a half-pound weights off your butt.  The trouble is, our bodies still think we live in primitive times!  They don't know we want to get rid of the excess fat, and they're determined to hold on to it at any cost!</P>
<P>	Given the body's stubbornness in dropping what is no longer wanted, all kinds of pharmaceutical shortcuts have been proposed.  Some work pretty well, but almost all have their drawbacks.  The following guide is an attempt to separate the chaff from the wheat, so to speak.  Here, in no particular order, are what I consider to be the top six fat-burning compounds available.  I've also rated each one from both an effectiveness standpoint and a safety standpoint from one star to five where one is least and five is most.  For example, one star equals the least effective or least safe drug or supplement, while five stars denotes the most effective or the most safe drug or supplement.</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H3>CLENBUTEROL</H3></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><B>Effectiveness Rating: * * * * *</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Safety Rating: * *</B></CENTER>
<P>	Of all the fat-burners, clenbuterol is the most highly coveted--it not only burns fat but also builds lean body mass.  Who could ask for anything more?  Well, despite its positive attributes, clenbuterol has some problems.  For one, it's not available in the United States.  Two, it's a drug and is illegal to bring it into the country without a prescription.  There are other problems as well.  It has side effects that are, well, disconcerting (although admittedly, a lot of bodybuilders don't seem to mind them).  And finally, its benefits are temporary--very temporary.  Unless you stay on the stuff all the time, you'll quickly lose any lean body mass you might have acquired, and unless you modify your eating habits, you'll quickly revert to your previously "uncut" state.</P>
<P>	What exactly is this "wonder drug," and how does it work?  Clenbuterol belongs to a class of drugs called beta agonists.  Beta agonists, depending on whether they're classified as beta-1, beta-2, or even beta-3, have very specific effects on the sympathetic nervous system.  Clenbuterol, a beta-2 agonist, affects the bronchial system.  It's prescribed in Mexico and overseas as a bronchodilator, but it's not approved for use in the U.S., probably because it has a half-life of close to 60 hours (the FDA doesn't like drugs to have long half-lives).  It's also on the banned substances list of the U.S. Olympic Committee.</P>
<P>	A funny thing happened during some of the preliminary clenbuterol studies done with animals: their bronchial systems dilated alright, but they also started getting leaner and more meaty.  Countless animal studies were done on a variety of different species, and the results were always the same.  Scientists coined this phenomena as "nutrient partitioning."  Word of these studies trickled down to ranchers, and suddenly, bulked up cattle started making the stock show circuit.  Even competitors in the Junior livestock circuit began using the drug.  In 1994, a 16 year old won almost $38,000 for raising Badger, a prize steer that caused the mouths of slaughter-house executives to water.  Within days of the subsequent lab tests (which came back positive for clenbuterol use), the prize money was forfeited, and the young owner was banned for life from the stock circuit.</P>
<P>	Various cases of clenbuterol "poisoning" also began popping up in Europe.  In France, 22 patients were diagnosed with clenbuterol food poisoning after ingesting liver from clenbuterol-raised calves.  A similar case in Spain resulted in 135 cases of food poisoning.  In both cases, symptoms ranged from muscle tremors, palpitations, nervousness,  and headaches--pretty much the same symptoms clenbuterol-using athletes have experienced and shrugged off without a second thought.</P>
<P>	Anyhow, based on all the animal studies, humans, as is their nature, began extrapolating from the data.  "Hey, if it works on cows, why not me?"  Bodybuilders all over the world began using the drug and experiencing results from dosages that weren't too far off from the clinical dosages prescribed to asthma patients.</P>
<P>	Most bodybuilders take the drug in short two-day on, two-day off cycles for three weeks, followed by three weeks off to prevent receptor-cite degradation.  </P>
<P>	Interestingly enough, most researchers aren't sure how or why clenbuterol builds muscle and burns fat, but each mechanism seems to act independently of the other.  As far as building muscle, clenbuterol seems to cause hypertrophy but not hyperplasia, and the efficiency of the muscle growth depends on both protein synthesis and degradation.  It apparently suppresses degradation more, and the net effect is more muscle mass.</P>
<P>	As far as burning fat, clenbuterol seems to work by directly stimulating lipolysis in fat tissue, although this effect hasn't been shown to be consistent in all species.</P>
<P>	One of the papers I consulted for this article referred to the sudden deaths of two IFBB bodybuilders from clenbuterol, but I haven't heard anything to confirm that statement.  In fact, I haven't heard of any serious problems from clenbuterol use, although clinically, at least, the possibility of an enlarged heart in users certainly exists, and such a condition could ultimately lead to some kind of heart obstruction and subsequent death.  It could also pose a problem for athletes who compete in high-temperature environments as experiments on lab animals have shown hyperthermia to be a distinct possibility.</P>
<P>	Although I'm certainly not advocating that anyone take clenbuterol, it seems to be the most potent and interesting fat burner, at least as far as bodybuilders are concerned.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Clenbuterol Dosage: Three or four 20-mcg pills a day taken in divided doses (a typical tablet contains 20 mcg, but some formulations contain 10 mcg, and liquid solutions are available in 1 microgram, 20 micrograms, and 0.059 mg ml-1 concentrations)</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H3>DEXFENFLURAMINE</H3></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><B>Effectiveness Rating: * * * *</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Safety Rating: * * *</B></CENTER>
<P>	First, the bad news about this anti-fat drug: it's not available in the United States. (How come none of the good stuff is?)  It's been used in Europe for several years with success, but the U.S. is hesitant to approve it for use here.  When dexfenfluramine recently came up for a vote in front of an advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it was rejected by a vote of five to three.  FDA bigwigs argued that the drug can cause brain damage in humans.  It's true the drug did cause test animals to go a little wacky, but only after giving them doses that were 10 to 20 times higher than the amount that would be prescribed to humans.  </P>
<P>	Dexfenfluramine is considered hot stuff among fat-loss fans because it's a more highly evolved form of fenfluramine, the only non-amphetamine treatment (approved) for weight loss--no amphetamines, no jumpiness.   "Dex" is theorized to work against fat in a variety of ways.  One mechanism is fairly basic: it's an appetite suppressant.  By enhancing the production of serotonin--a brain chemical responsible for many pleasure sensations--the brain is convinced the stomach is full.  Of interest to bodybuilders is the fact that this appetite suppression is geared towards carbohydrates and fat instead of protein.  This means that you'd be more inclined to snack on a protein-based chicken breast rather than a loaf of insulin-increasing bread.  </P>
<P>	Of course, many of you might want something that works by magically burning fat rather than just throwing a monkey wrench into your appetite.  Well, it seems that Dex might fit this bill, too.  At least one study has shown the drug to increase the thermic effect of food, similar to what you might experience with ephedrine.  Additionally, dexfenfluramine has shown a trend in increased IGF-1 production, although that might very well be a side effect of reductions in obesity.  </P>
<P>	Another metabolic benefit seen with Dex is a reduction in insulin resistance.  Studies have shown it to reduce insulin resistance in as little as one week, independently of any weight loss.  That means your body would better metabolize high-carbohydrate foods and perhaps burn them off as opposed to storing them.</P>
<P>	Ultimately, it all comes down to whether the drug is safe.  European researchers conducted the most comprehensive long-term (one-year) study of any anorectic (appetite suppression drugs) on Dex.   They found it to be remarkably effective with minor side effects such as diarrhea, dry mouth, increased frequency of urination, and drowsiness in a small number of patients.</P>
<P>	Dexfenfluramine is sold under the brand name Redux, but whether it will be sold in the U.S. is questionable.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Dosage: 15 mg twice a day</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H3>HYDROXYCITRATE (HCA)</H3></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><B>Effectiveness Rating: * *</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Safety Rating: * * * * *</B></CENTER>
<P>	Take a look at almost any over-the-health-food-store-counter fat burner and you'll likely see HCA listed as one of the ingredients.  HCA is derived from fruits in the genus Garcinia, most often the Bridall berry.  To make a long biochemical story short, HCA supposedly works by inhibiting the suppressive action of a certain enzyme (malonyl-CoA) on fat oxidation.  In the liver, the enzyme carnitine acyltransferase limits the rate at which fat can be oxidized.  Malonyl-CoA, in turn, limits the action of carnitine acyltransferase.  HCA, however, minimizes the suppressive effects of malonyl-CoA, which allows acyltransferase to oxidize fats "at will."</P>
<P>	Aside from actually enhancing fat oxidation, HCA is also said to act as an appetite suppressant.  By converting caloric energy into glycogen (which is stored in the liver) instead of fat, a complex chemical sequence tells the body that the level of glucose and glycogen in the liver is high; consequently, it's not necessary to eat (or rather, overeat).</P>
<P>	Rats have had wonderful success using HCA (you don't see many overweight rats, do you?), but human studies are rare up to this point.  Still, it seems that HCA, especially when compared to the drug-status conferred on most of the other effective fat burners, is especially appealing.  You don't need a prescription; you won't be arrested for having it in your possession; and it doesn't seem to have any harmful side effects (other than some occasional acid indigestion for those who are sensitive to Vitamin C).</P>
<P>HCA is available in products such as Citrimax Plus and Thermo-Trim.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Dosage: 250-500 mg 3 times a day 30 minutes before meals</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H3>EPHEDRINE, CAFFEINE, AND ASPIRIN STACK</H3></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><B>Effectiveness Rating: * * * *</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Safety Rating: * *</B></CENTER>
<P>	Up until some time last year, the sale of ephedrine was unrestricted.  Now, because of a few reported deaths allegedly attributed to ephedrine (anywhere from 3 to 18 in the U.S., depending on who you ask), sales are somewhat restricted.   You can still get it in most states, but you must be 18 years old.  Many off-the-beaten-track health-food stores and highway truck stops still carry the drug under the names mini white, white crosses, or even by its regular name, ephedrine.  </P>
<P>	Ephedrine is simply an herb derived from the ephedra plant, but its main chemical constituent, ephedrine, is a beta-adrenergic agonist, kind of like clenbuterol.  It's long been regarded as a fairly potent thermogenic compound, but it was found to be extremely effective when combined with caffeine and aspirin.  It's true that caffeine is also a fairly good thermogenic compound, but it hardly measures up to ephedrine.  When the two are combined haphazardly (taken together), their thermogenic qualities are additive: one plus one equals two.  However, when the 2 are combined in fairly specific ratios--200 mg caffeine to 20 mg ephedrine--the results are supraadditive.  In other words, the effects of each are multiplied.  When aspirin--300 mg of it per each ephedrine/caffeine dose--is thrown into the equation, the results are further enhanced.</P>
<P>	Aside from "burning" fat, the ephedrine/caffeine stack has also been shown to have nutrient partitioning effects: animals fed the mixture obtained the same growth on a 20% lower energy intake but gained 10% more muscle and 30% less fat than control animals.  In humans, the ephedrine/caffeine stack was found to be as effective as dexfenfluramine over a 15-week period.</P>
<P>	How does the stack work?  No one's really sure, but there are several theories.  Aside from turning calories into heat instead of storing them as fat, the combination may actually cripple the body's ability to form fat.  Caffeine, by itself, increases blood adrenaline levels, thereby increasing lipolysis, the breakdown of fat.  How any or all of these effects are increased by combining all three drugs is not well understood.</P>
<P>	The stack, although promising, does pose some problems.  For one, both of the drugs stimulate the central nervous system, and some people are especially sensitive to the effects.  Being lean is desirable but not at the expense of being wired all the time.  Also, ephedrine has been implicated in some deaths, but truth be told, evidence suggests that overdoses of the drug were involved.</P>
<P></P>
<P>Dosage: 200 mg caffeine, 20 mg of ephedrine, and 300 mg of aspirin, 3 times a day</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H3>DHEA</H3></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><B>Effectiveness Rating: * * * *</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Safety Rating: * * * *</B></CENTER>
<P>	The adrenals are little globular glands that sit on top of the kidneys.  One of their functions is to produce a steroid called dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).  Up until a few years ago, very little was known about this steroid-like compound, except for the fact that peak serum levels in the body headed south after age 25.  In fact, if you're lucky enough to live to the age of 85, your DHEA levels probably are only about 5% of what they were when you were 25.  That's why the longevity people jumped on this drug.  They figured if they could raise levels by taking the drug, either orally or by injection, they could regain their youth.   Well, they may be at least partially right.  DHEA, even though scientists still don't know its exact physiological role, has been shown to have beneficial effects on obesity (and diabetes) in animals.  Not long ago, it was found to have the same beneficial effects in humans.</P>
<P>	Researchers have found that DHEA can significantly decrease fat mass in human subjects.  In a study conducted at Virginia Commonwealth University, a group of men were given 1,600 mg of DHEA a day (in divided doses) for 28 days.  After the test was completed, the men averaged a 31% decrease in bodyfat with no changes in weight.  This suggests that the loss in bodyfat was accompanied by a concurrent increase in muscle mass, all without adding any kind of exercise to their lifestyle or with any adverse side effects.  Hot damn!  What's more, the drug resulted in a decrease in serum cholesterol in all the men--quite rare for conventional anabolic steroids.</P>
<P>	Although the exact mechanism responsible for the loss of bodyfat is unknown, some researchers have theorized it has to do with increased insulin sensitivity.  Others have attributed its fat melting effects to its ability to increase the thermogenic properties of food.</P>
<P>Until last year, you could order DHEA from various mail-order supplement companies without getting in trouble.  Unfortunately, that's no longer the case.  As of late 1994, the government considers DHEA an anabolic steroid even though it really isn't.  Possession of it without a prescription (a foreign subscription, since it isn't available in the U.S.) is illegal.	</P>
<P></P>
<P>Dosage:  from 50 to 200 mg a day</P>
<HR>
<CENTER><H3>PYRUVATE</H3></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><B>Effectiveness Rating: * * * *</B></CENTER>
<CENTER><B>Safety Rating: * * * *</B></CENTER>
<P>	Arriving at my sixth choice for the "best fat burner" was tough.  There are several drugs/compounds out there that are purported to be effective fat burners, but all have their drawbacks: most are either illegal or haven't been approved by the FDA yet.  Others might be unsafe, and others, despite all the hype, don't seem to work that well.  Consider growth hormone, IGF-1, or some of the "cutting" steroids like Winstrol V--all seem to be remarkably effective in burning fat and have the bonus of diverting calories towards muscle instead of fat--a remarkable combination.  However, all are either illegal, difficult to get, or unsafe.  Others, like leptin, the remarkable new fat-burning hormone that leans out lab mice in a matter of days, or orlistat, the compound that prevents the body from absorbing fat, are months or years away from being introduced to the market.  The nutrient fat burners, like chromium picolinate or l-carnitine, just haven't measured up to all the hype.  After all, do you know anybody who's noticed a difference in bodyfat percentage from taking either of those two compounds?  I didn't think so.  That leaves me with a naturally occurring compound that hasn't been <I>conclusively</I> proven to be an effective, cure-all fat burner, but it has nevertheless shown promise in at least a few clinical studies: pyruvate.</P>
<P>	Pyruvate is a salt of pyruvic acid, and it's an important intermediate in protein and carbohydrate metabolism.  Scientists first became interested in using pyruvate as a supplement to prevent the fatty liver deposits seen in alcoholics.  Pyruvate prevented fatty livers, and it seemed to do so by altering both fat and carbohydrate metabolism.  Other scientists put two and two together and began testing the supplement on overweight people.  In short, researchers found that pyruvate, when substituted for glucose in the diet, resulted in an inhibition of expected stores of lipid deposition, while nitrogen stores were maintained (muscle tissue was preserved).</P>
<P>	Just how pyruvate works in humans in uncertain.  Animal studies seem to prove that pyruvate causes a decrease in overall food consumption and increased resting energy expenditure.  Human studies, however, have failed to confirm this.  One theory has to do with an increase in the "membrane potential of mitochondria" which stimulates cellular respiration, creating a bigger energy demand and thus burning up more calories.  </P>
<P>	Various studies using pyruvate as a fat-burning agent have shown positive results.  Patients taking a pyruvate supplement lost between 23% and 48% more fat than placebo groups.  Other studies have shown pyruvate supplementation to improve endurance, too, which might indicate that it's a viable ergogenic aid.</P>
<P>	Pyruvate supplements could start showing up in health-food stores soon.  This is an exciting new supplement that you may want to keep an eye on!  </P>
<P></P>
<P>Dosage:  Most studies have used between 15 and 30 grams a day, taken in divided doses with meals, but new research suggests anywhere between 2-10 grams a day may work quite well.</P>
<P>	Despite the availability of fat-loss drugs or compounds on the market (black or otherwise), there are no cure-alls. Each, with the possible exception of leptin, the fat-loss hormone of the future, has its drawbacks.  Any of the items on this list can only be regarded as tools in fighting fat.  The real trick, now as always, is to eat sensibly, eat frequently (small meals), and build enough muscle so that your body's metabolism operates efficiently.</P>

<A HREF="v47_a1.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I just got back from the Olympia in Atlanta, and I'm so upset about the judging I had to write and tell you about it. Although I have numerous problems with the judging overall, the greatest travesty was that Kim Chizevsky, who dominated the women's class, was robbed of the Ms. Olympia title--it's impossible that a person with any objectivity could give Lenda Murray the award over Kim. What the hell is going on here?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a2.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> In the last issue of <I>Muscle Media 2000</I>, you mentioned you were experimenting with hydroxy citric acid (HCA)... a new "fat burner." I was wondering if you've noticed any positive results from using that supplement?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a3.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've noticed there are quite a few Phosphagain "copycat" products coming out on the market. One product in particular, distributed by Strength Systems USA, supposedly works just like Phosphagain, but it's less expensive. Do you know if these other products are as good as Phosphagain?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a4.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I've been trying to get that "cut" look forever. A guy at my gym suggested I try a new supplement called "Bromocriptine." He said it's really great for getting that super-hard look. Have you heard of this stuff?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a5.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I heard testosterone injections may soon be approved in the United States as a form of male birth control. I don't understand why testosterone would be approved as a form of birth control but not approved as a muscle builder. With some of these new uses for testosterone, do you think there's any chance the laws regarding doctors prescribing steroids for bodybuilders will change?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a6.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> What's the latest word on IGF-1? Are bodybuilders getting good results with this stuff?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a7.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I recently came across a bottle of nandrolone decanoate (Deca) distributed by Steris Labs. I'm sending a sample of the box and an empty vial for you to take a look at. Can you tell if it's legit?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a8.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I noticed that Dr. Mauro DiPasquale has come out with a new book about bodybuilding supplements. In his book, he contends he's the only "objective expert" in the industry. However, I also noticed he is working for Optimum Training Systems, and they sell supplements. How can he call himself objective?
<P>
<A HREF="v47_a9.html"><FONT SIZE=+3>Q:</FONT></A> I was very sad to learn that bodybuilding legend Don Ross recently passed away of a heart attack. Has there been any more information on how this man, who was in such good shape, died so prematurely?

		<H3><CENTER>Mike Mentzer: A Thinking Man's Approach to Weight Training</CENTER></H3>
		<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT>sk a bodybuilder about the book <I>Atlas Shrugged</I>, and he or she might tell you it's a program for building bigger traps or that it's about the life story of a guy who didn't like sand kicked in his face.  But if you ask Mike Mentzer, you better be willing to pull up a chair because he's been a devout student of the philosophical ideologies of Ayn Rand for a number of years, and he's looking to make converts of anyone within earshot.  As a matter of fact, he has serious plans for leading a philosophical upheaval in the U.S.</P>
		<P>Most of us know Mike Mentzer as the number 1 proponent of Heavy Duty Training and as the author of three books on that subject.  He is responsible for the theory of High Intensity Training, whereby less effort is better, and defining the precise amount of effort is best.  Competitively, he won the 1976 Mr. America and the 1978 Mr. Universe, where he became the first person to ever receive a perfect score in an international competition.  He also played a pivotal role in one of bodybuilding's most regrettable debacles: the 1980 Mr. Olympia.</P>
		<P>For anyone who witnessed the contest, it was painfully apparent that Arnold's much publicized comeback at Sydney, Australia would end up in victory. He appeared casual on stage, standing relaxed, making jokes, and not even bothering to hit all the compulsory poses.  Meanwhile, a serious Mentzer had given this show his all, only to see what should have been the crowning glory of his career used as a tiny stepping stone for Arnold's burgeoning superstardom.  Mentzer gave the sport his middle finger and never competed again.</P>
		<P>Today, Mentzer lives in Southern California where he has a successful mail-order and personal-training business.  Since that day in Sydney, his life has had its tragedies and triumphs.  He talks about those, while also shedding some additional light on his theory of High Intensity Training, which is put forth so succinctly on his <I>Muscle Media 2000</I> Audiotape Interview.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Mike, for those who haven't heard the audiotape, would you briefly explain your theory of High Intensity Training.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>Most bodybuilders make the mistake of trying too many training systems, frantically going from one to another, looking for something that works.  But the fact is that there is only one valid theory of anything--electronics, engineering, astronomy, medicine, mathematics--and there can be only 	one valid theory or scientific approach in bodybuilding.  The theory of High Intensity is that <B>one and only</B> theory.  It is the only theory that has a set of principles which set forth a guideline for successful action.</P>
		<P>Now, follow me on this.  Any theory must have a starting point, a first principle.  The first step is to identify what it is you're seeking to achieve.  In this case, the answer is to build muscle.  Now, what is the stimulus responsible for this?  That stimulus is intensity--not volume or frequency but the intensity of the exercise.</P>
		<P>A lot of magazines banter about this term intensity, but most of what you read in the magazines is hogwash.  Intensity is the percentage of possible momentary muscular effort being exerted.  The closer intensity gets to 100%, the greater the stimulus.</P>
		<P>Think of this in terms of a bodybuilder who can curl 120 pounds for 10 reps.  The first rep requires the least intensity, maybe 8% to 12%.  The second may require a 20% effort; the third will be harder still until we finally get to the last possible rep the bodybuilder can perform.  That rep requires 100% effort. There is something that happens physiologically during this last rep, something that is critical to the goal, something that is responsible for switching on the growth machinery inside the body.  But in order to stimulate that response, the exercise must be carried to momentary muscular failure.</P>
		<P>Therefore, High Intensity Training involves performing the exercise to failure.  That creates the response the bodybuilder is seeking, and to stop short of that point is of no consequence whatsoever.</P>
		<P>Now, listen closely to what I'm saying.  This is very important.  To do any more than is required defeats your purpose.  High Intensity dictates brief and infrequent training.  Overtraining is the most underrated mistake in bodybuilding.  Overtraining is the worse thing a bodybuilder can do.  Overtraining means performing one set more than what is needed.  In most instances, only one set of an exercise and never more than two exercises per body part need to be performed.  Anything more is a waste of time and will lead to stagnation and overtraining.</P>
		<HR>
		<H2><CENTER>"An effective Heavy Duty workout can take as little as 17 minutes!"</CENTER></H2>
		<HR>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Your views are very specific on training.  What about your views on a nutritional program?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	As much confusion as there is about training, there is even more about nutrition.  A large part of this industry is based on the fraudulent sale of nutritional supplements.  They want you to believe that it is a highly complex subject when, in reality, it is fairly simple.</P>
		<P>All a bodybuilder should be concerned with is getting a well-balanced diet every day, a diet that supplies the body with all the vitamins and nutrients it needs.  If you drink too much water, you excrete it.  You don't have that luxury with proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.  Too much of any one of these will turn into bodyfat.</P>
		<P>It is a fact that most bodybuilders are grossly overnourished, just like they are overtrained!  Most bodybuilders eat way more than they need to sustain physical mass and contribute to the negligible amount of growth they can experience in any given day.  They overnourish themselves, and they still don't grow!  That fact demonstrates that nutrition is not the problem.  The problem is in a lack of training knowledge.</P>
		<P>The way to stimulate muscle growth is to apply 100% effort when you train, but never overtrain.  The way to eat is to provide an adequate diet,  but never overnourish.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Many multiple-set training programs are broken down in phases aimed at specifics like growth, precontest, or maintenance.  Is there a maintenance phase of High Intensity Training?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	Really, there's no physical need for a maintenance program because when you're properly regulating the volume and frequency, you'll never overtrain.  The only time this program might vary is if the goal changes.  If a person does not want maximum muscle growth, he or she can pull back a little shy of failure in a set.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	In your tape, you say you are adamantly opposed to aerobics.  You also suggest that bodybuilders begin reading philosophy books with all the time saved in their workouts.  Does this mean that you don't advocate bodybuilders taking up aerobic activities, like bike riding or in-line skating, in their free time?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	It depends on the individual.  Most bodybuilders primarily want to gain as much strength and size in as short a time as possible.  If that's the goal, then they should not do any of those activities.  The human body has a finite number of units of adaptive energy available.  If you try to divide that up between bodybuilding and aerobics, you'll get mixed results or, worse, end up losing muscle and endurance.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Your theory, while it makes perfect sense, supports a one-set formula of exercise that basically contradicts everything everyone else has ever prescribed.  How do you explain this?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	Most of what has been said has been said by people who have no background in philosophy, logic, or science.  They have applied whatever intellectual power they may have to putting forth a program, but these programs are not theory.  There is only one valid theory, and that is the theory of High Intensity Training.</P>
		<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/mm_pose.gif" ALT="[Photo of Mike Mentzer - Standing pose]"></CENTER>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	You've talked quite a bit about goals.  Have you always known what your goals have been?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	When I was younger, my career was punctuated with some self-doubt, but I've always known what I wanted.  I admit that I've taken a couple of detours, maybe made a few wrong turns along the way, but I got back on track.  I've got my mind working for me better than ever.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Was one of those wrong turns your use of recreational drugs?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	I wouldn't call what I used recreational.  I began using amphetamines years ago, in part to help with dieting and bodybuilding and also to give me enough energy to write my articles.  After the 1980 Olympia, I went into an emotional tailspin.  I lost my career, and I lost my mother and father. With all the emotional problems and the continued use of amphetamines, it became more difficult to maintain emotional control, and I went even deeper into drug use.  At the time, my intellect was not developed enough to enable me to understand all that was going on, and the emotions overwhelmed me.</P>
		<P>	Finally, I saw where it was going and could no longer deny there was a real problem.  I said to myself that it was time to stop.  That's when I discovered philosophy, and I began studying every day.  Eventually, I gained a comprehensive view of life, which is the purpose of philosophy.  It's been a process of maturation, a transition where I've gone from a person who was guided by emotions, to a person guided by philosophy.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Are you drug free now?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	Yes, and I have been for years.  I still drink a little bit, but the only drug I use is coffee.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Would you advocate amphetamines for dieting?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	I'm not dogmatic on the issue of drugs and have nothing against the advances of medical science.  A little speed will help, and probably won't hurt the individual, but it depends on the person.  It's been reported that Ayn Rand used a mild form of amphetamine for many years, and she obviously had no impairment or problem.  But she has a highly developed mind.  If you're not advanced intellectually, you can be overwhelmed, and it can create problems.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Are you happy with your life today?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>Happier than I've ever been before.  I've finally achieved a kind of maturity that can only be gained as a result of developing the mind. Until a person develops an intellect and learns how to think, he or she can't really be happy.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	It sounds like you'd prefer to talk about philosophy rather than bodybuilding, but let's get back to the sport before we finish up.  What kind of shape are you in today?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	Physically, the worst shape of my life.  While still involved in the business of bodybuilding--personal training, writing books and articles--I've put my own training on the back burner in order to devote more time to studying.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	And what is your brother doing these days?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	Ray is quite successful.  About four years ago, he became very involved in Arthur Jones' new medical rehabilitation corporation.  Now he's part owner and operator of five clinics.  He's living in Redondo Beach and still training quite hard.  He's been a bit overweight, but he's quite muscular with 20-inch arms.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	You've been in bodybuilding for more than 30 years, and you certainly have a unique perspective.  Give us your first response to the following names, so we can get a better sense of that perspective.  Ready?</P>
		<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/mmarms.gif" ALT="[Photo of Mike Mentzer]"></CENTER><BR>

		<B>MM:</B>	Mike Quinn.<BR>

		<B>MM:</B>	Betty Weider.<BR>
		<B>Mike:</B>	Childlike.<BR>
		<B>MM:</B>	Gene Mozee.<BR>
		<B>Mike:</B>	Nothing.<BR>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Okay, do you have any advice for other bodybuilders who might want to pursue philosophy?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	As a rule, bodybuilders are intellectually self-arrested.  I'd have to advise them to be very cautious in approaching philosophy.  Most people don't know how to think and can't distinguish truth.  There can be only one valid theory on anything, including life.</P>
		<P>Mine is essentially Ayn Rand's, which is that man is a heroic being whose highest moral purpose is the achievement of his own happiness, whose noblest activity is productive achievement, and whose only absolute is reason.  While I haven't been able to understand all the details and implications, I work on this every day.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Where do you see yourself five years from now?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>Where I'm at now but further ahead financially.  My ultimate goal is to make enough money, so I can help affect a cultural movement that will bring this country back to reason.  People think we need political change, but what we need is a philosophical change.</P>
		<P>Ayn Rand understood that the last intellectuals in this country were the founding fathers James Madison and Thomas Jefferson.  Since then, everything has gone downhill intellectually and culturally.  Progressively, we are losing more of our freedoms.  Unless people learn how to think, they can't understand what's going on politically, and they'll be blindly led into a state of tyranny.</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Okay.  Now, if people want to contact you for personal training or philosophy lectures, how should they do it?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>They can reach me at Gold's Gym, Venice, CA, or by calling 310-827-7661. </P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>MM:</B>	Anything you want to add?</P>
		<P></P>
		<P><B>Mike:</B>	I hope this interview helps enlighten some bodybuilders.  And for those who thought they knew me before, now you know me a little bit better.</P>

<H3>This Stuff Works - <I>BIG TIME!</I></H3><BR>
<H4>by Bill Phillips</H4></CENTER>
<CENTER><H3>Muscle Growth and Protein Turnover 101</H3></CENTER><P>
Muscles grow by a circular process of synthesizing and breaking down protein.
Remember, muscles are made up of primarily protein (amino acids) and water. The total protein
accrual or muscle growth is the balance between the amount made and the amount broken down.
If you want to build bigger, stronger muscles, you're going to have to make a significant
alteration in your body's existing protein cycle. That means you are going to have to speed up the
rate of synthesis and/or slow down the rate of breakdown.<P>
It is well known that intense weight-training exercise stimulates the body's anabolic or
muscle-building processes. Ironically, weight training also causes the breakdown of muscle
tissue.<P>
In the "ideal" situation, the increase in protein synthesis stimulated by weight training
will exceed the increase in protein breakdown, and the result will be a gain in muscle size and
strength.<P>
Usually, when you first start working out, the above scenario plays itself out--it's
common to gain muscle size and strength from almost every workout during the first few months
of training.<P>
Unfortunately, the human body is very "adaptive." As soon as your muscle size reaches a
certain point (which is probably governed by genetics), your body adapts so any increase in
protein synthesis is counterbalanced by an increase in protein breakdown. When you get to this
point, you basically have hit what bodybuilders call a "plateau"--you don't gain muscle size and
strength no matter what you do! This is your body's way of "stabilizing" itself. It's called
homeostasis.<P>
It's my belief that even if you follow the most effective training and nutrition program,
it's very unlikely you'll be able to break these plateaus without doing something to dramatically
affect the rate at which your body is building up or breaking down protein tissue. (I'm sure most
of you who've been training for a number of years would agree with me on this one.)<P>
<CENTER><H3>Why Steroids Work</H3></CENTER><P><B>The reason anabolic steroids have such a dramatic impact on muscle growth is
because they alter your body's protein balance</B>. Ironically, steroids, even though they're called
"anabolic," which means "building up," exert most of their positive effects by preventing protein
breakdown. Recent evidence demonstrates up to 75% of the muscle-building effects of steroids
are due to their ability to inhibit protein degradation. Why is this? Well, in simple terms, anabolic steroids have a way
of "shielding" muscle cells from your body's main counterregulatory hormone, cortisol. It's not important to understand that complicated issue, but it is important to understand that once you've reached a certain degree of muscular development it's very likely that you're going to have to find some way to accelerate protein synthesis or inhibit protein breakdown to keep making gains.<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/arrowpq.gif"></CENTER><P>
<CENTER><H3>Can You Increase Protein Synthesis?</H3></CENTER><P>
What are your chances of finding a new training, nutrition, or supplement program that
increases protein synthesis? Well not very good. I mean, what are you going to do--train more
often? Alright, let's say training more often does increase the rate at which your body is
synthesizing protein--those same workouts are going to increase the rate at which protein is
being broken down, too. And you have to be careful because if you train too often, you can cause
your body to break down more muscle than it builds up--this is what's often referred to as
"overtraining."<P>
Okay, let's say we try a nutritional approach. What about eating more protein? Well,
numerous studies have investigated this, and it doesn't appear that consuming super-high levels
of protein increase the synthesis of new muscle tissue.<P>
High-calorie diets aren't the answer either. And there are no supplements on the market,
at least that I'm aware of, which have been shown to increase protein synthesis. Hell... even
muscle-building drugs like anabolic steroids and clenbuterol don't exert the majority of their
effects by increasing protein synthesis!<P>
After years of studying this issue very thoroughly, I've become convinced that targeting
<B>muscle-tissue breakdown </B>is the key. I've already mentioned there is substantial evidence
"anabolic" drugs exert their effects by minimizing protein breakdown. Since we know this is the
way the most potent muscle-building agents available work, it makes sense to target this area of
the equation. <P>
<CENTER><H3>Mid-Term Review</H3></CENTER><P>
Okay... I want to make sure you're following me here. Let's do a quick review--so far,
we've learned that in order to gain muscle size, you have to speed up the rate at which your body
is building protein or slow the rate at which your body is breaking protein down. We've
discussed that it's highly unlikely such an alteration can be made, in the experienced weight
trainer, through exercise alone.<B> (Many lifters are already doing the right kinds of workouts
but are still not growing!)</B> We've also learned anabolic steroids "tip the scales" in your favor by slowing the rate at which your body breaks down protein. (Unfortunately, anabolic steroids have side effects and are illegal. And these days they're very hard to get!) We also discussed that it's extremely unlikely changing your diet or taking any particular supplements will increase the rate at which your body synthesizes protein. <P>
Well... provided you understand all of the above, the next question you've got to be
asking yourself is, "Are there any supplements that can slow the rate of protein breakdown which
will, in turn, cause an increase in muscle size?"<P>
The answer is... <B>YES!!</B> The preliminary results of a recent double-blind, placebo-
controlled university study offer strong evidence it is indeed possible to "upgrade" the body's
ability to prevent muscle-tissue breakdown which occurs subsequent to intense stress such as a
brutal weight-training workout.<P>
Now, before I tell you about this university study, I want to make it clear this is the first
time I've seen sound, scientific evidence demonstrating that the use of a particular dietary
supplement does indeed slow protein breakdown.<P>
<CENTER><H3>Evidence... Not "Speculation"</H3></CENTER><P>
Now, I think it's important you understand the difference between "scientific evidence"
and "scientific speculation." Many of the "scientifically designed" supplements sold to
bodybuilders today are based on speculation. For example, that whole thing with ornithine
alpha-ketoglutarate (OKG) was speculation. It's true some scientific studies have shown OKG
may inhibit protein breakdown in hospital patients suffering from trauma such as surgery, injury,
burns, etc. However, in the case of OKG, it was never shown this compound could increase
protein retention--it was only shown to slow tissue wasting in hospital patients. There are no
studies that show using OKG, or many of the other supplements on the market today, help weight
trainers gain size and/or strength faster. Basically, many of the "scientifically designed"
supplements out on the market are based on unsubstantiated "best-guess" theories. <P>
Unfortunately, there really haven't been a lot of research studies which have tried to
conclusively determine whether certain supplements actually help build muscle mass and
strength. The reasons for this are fairly obvious--scientific studies, especially detailed,
double-blind university studies, are very expensive to conduct. Sadly, most companies just don't
put enough money into research.<P>
I believe the study I'm going to tell you about is especially significant because it looks at
the direct effects of the use of a dietary supplement on size and muscle strength. This was an
incredibly meticulous study, and I think you'll find it to be extremely exciting--I know I did!<P>
<CENTER><H3>Here's The Scoop!</H3></CENTER><P>
On June 2, 1995, an abstract was presented at the American College of Sports Medicine
Conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota. That abstract revealed that the use of a dietary
supplement called <B>"HMB" may cause dramatic increases in size and strength in athletes who
train with weights.</B><P>
The specific purpose of this study, which was conducted by doctors at Iowa State
University, was to determine the effect of dietary supplementation of a leucine metabolite called
beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) on muscle metabolism of humans performing
resistance exercise. Based on animal data, it was hypothesized that HMB would decrease the
muscle proteolysis (protein breakdown) induced by resistance exercise, resulting in increased
muscle mass and function.<P>
(Data from animal studies have shown HMB supplementation can stimulate muscle
growth by 20-30%! Further data from these investigations have indicated the muscle growth seen
in animals being fed HMB occurred because of a decrease in protein breakdown.)<P>
Forty-one male volunteers between the ages of 19 and 29 were recruited for this study.
Each subject underwent extensive testing which included things like body composition analysis,
muscle biopsies, blood tests, and so on.<P>
Each of the 41 test subjects followed the same weight-training program which included
the use of both free weights and machines. The weight-training sessions alternated between upper
and lower body exercises, and the subjects lifted three times per week with at least one day of
rest between sessions. (These workouts were very similar to the type of training program many
bodybuilders follow.)<P>
The nutritional intake of each subject was also carefully controlled. On average, the test
subjects consumed approximately 2,400 calories a day, which was slightly less than required, and
between 117-175 grams of protein per day.<P>
Fifteen of the subjects consumed 3 grams of HMB per day; 13 consumed 1.5 grams of
HMB per day; and another group of 13 test subjects consumed no HMB at all (the control group).
<P>
The researchers monitored the test subjects extensively during this three week study, and <B>it
became extremely obvious that the use of HMB was producing dramatic results. </B><P>
By the time the study was over, the group of weight trainers using 3 grams of HMB a day
had gained almost 3 solid pounds of lean mass (55% more lean mass than the group of
non-users)! In addition, they experienced strength gains that were 295% greater than the test
subjects who followed the same workout program but did not use HMB! (The results
experienced by the group using 1.5 grams of HMB a day were significant but not as extraordinary
as the results seen in those using three grams of HMB a day.)<P>
This study also used state of the art analytical procedures in an effort to identify just
exactly how HMB might be exerting its powerful effects. For example, they measured the
amount of something called 3-methylhistidine (3-MH) that was excreted by the body each week
of the study--3-MH offers scientists a way to look at muscle protein breakdown in the body.
They also measured other markers of muscle-protein breakdown called creatine phosphokinase
(CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In addition, they measured nitrogen balance.<P>
<B>The major preliminary finding of this incredibly meticulous study was that HMB
supplementation resulted in an enhancement of muscle function in humans undergoing
resistance exercise.</B> This effect was clearly shown in the study by increases in muscle strength and is supported by trends in increased lean tissue mass, improved nitrogen retention, and decreased indicators of muscle damage. <B>Some of the most compelling evidence of improved muscle metabolism with HMB supplementation was an observed 20% decrease in 3-MH
loss in urine and a 20-60% decrease in the levels of the enzymes CPK and LDH, indicating
muscle damage in the plasma.</B> This suggests HMB somehow supports the body's ability to
minimize muscle damage associated with muscular work or stress.<P>
Although no one is exactly sure how HMB works, one hypothesis is that HMB helps
decrease muscle protein turnover. This decrease in muscle damage in turn results in a more rapid
neural recruitment by the muscle fibers and may act as a catalyst to faster increases in strength. This could explain the effect of HMB in the first week of exercise in this study, when
unsupplemented subjects lost strength while HMB supplemented subjects gained strength. With
HMB supplementation, a decrease in muscle breakdown was supported by a reduction in the
essential plasma amino acids in blood. Because these amino acid values were obtained from
subjects who fasted overnight, the major contributor to plasma amino acids was natural protein
breakdown by the body.<P>
I've learned that the doctors who conducted this study have also wrapped up three other
clinical studies on humans using HMB which support these findings. These studies will be
published in the near future.<P>
The doctors who have performed these studies believe the enhancement of muscle protein
metabolism, shown through HMB supplementation, could also have relevance in other "stress"
situations such as: malnutrition/starvation, trauma, and/or burns. Of course, further studies will be needed to determine if the dietary supplementation of HMB can support the body's ability to recover from those kinds of conditions.<P>
<CENTER><H3>Take-Home Lesson</H3></CENTER><P>
So what do the preliminary findings of this recent study mean to you and me? Well, it
looks like we've finally found a supplement we can use to support our body's ability to minimize
protein breakdown and very possibly "tip the scales" of protein balance in our favor. This could
allow us to make substantial gains in muscle size and strength--drug free!<P>
I believe this new discovery could be one of the most important findings for bodybuilders
everywhere who want to build muscle size and strength but do not want to have to turn to, or
continue to rely on, anabolic steroids and other possibly dangerous and illegal muscle-building
drugs.<P>
<CENTER><H3>All Right... Where Do I Get HMB?</H3></CENTER><P>
Obviously, every serious bodybuilder who learns about this information is going to run to
their local health-food store and ask for HMB. Wait... not so fast! You see, HMB is not available
anywhere. TwinLabs doesn't have it. Wieder doesn't have it. EAS doesn't even have it! You
can't get HMB at GNC, at any gyms or health-food stores--it's not available anywhere--at least
not yet!<P>
<B>Here's the deal</B>--Metabolic Tech-nologies, Inc. (MTI), the company which owns the
rights to HMB and who funded this recent study, has only recently, and I mean very recently (like
two weeks ago), started manufacturing HMB in any "bulk" quantities. For the last six years,
HMB has only been manufactured in small "pilot batches"--just enough HMB was
manufactured to meet the needs of those involved in the university studies.<P>
MTI is in the process of trying to "ramp-up" HMB production in anticipation of making
this supplement available on a fairly wide-scale basis within the next year.<P>
<B>So, if everything goes as planned, you should be able to buy HMB, as a dietary
supplement, at health-food stores within a year. But for now, HMB is next to impossible to
get.</B> As a matter of fact, I've been trying for months to get MTI to send me a supply for myself and only recently "scored" just three weeks ago. This stuff is harder than hell to get! (But man does it work! You can really feel it!) For those of you who are like me--who want to try HMB and can't wait until it's available in stores--I've got some good news for you.<P>
I recently met with the folks at MTI and explained some things about the "bodybuilding
world" to them. I told them how thousands of guys, just like me, are trying to build bigger,
stronger bodies, and we're all very aware that anabolic steroid use, combined with weight
training, is, to date, the superior method for doing this.<P>
I explained that most readers of Muscle Media 2000 are looking for "alternatives" to
illegal and possibly dangerous muscle-building drugs, and if they could find something, anything
at all, which might help them get better results faster, it may help deter steroid use.<P>
Of course, <B>bodybuilders don't use steroids because they want to break the law--they
use steroids because the damn things work! If bodybuilders can find "alternatives" that
work, they'll use 'em!</B> (Now, I'm not saying HMB is more powerful or even as powerful as
anabolic steroids. What I'm saying is this recent study offers strong evidence HMB may help
weight trainers gain size and muscle strength. It's too early to say exactly how much muscle mass
HMB might help you build.)<P>
To make a long story short, guess who gets to be among the first to try HMB? You! I've
secured an initial supply of HMB which I'm offering exclusively to readers of Muscle Media
2000.<P>
That's right! Look through the other muscle magazines. Check the health-food stores.
You won't find anyone else selling HMB at this time. It's not being advertised anywhere. There
are no fancy TV commercials promoting it, no slick brochures, no before and after pictures...
there's nothing! (Talk about being on the <B>inside!</B>) <P>
But here's a little bad news... I know it is a relatively common marketing technique to
enforce the idea that "supplies are limited," and sometimes that's not always true. But let me
assure you, the supply of HMB I've snatched up from MTI is indeed very limited! Like I said,
MTI is only now beginning to ramp-up production of this product. They believe it will be 6 to 10
months before their manufacturing facility is up and running at full speed.<P>
Therefore, because supplies are so limited, I suggest that anyone who wants to try HMB
sooner, rather than later, take immediate action!<P>
Also, I don't want any one person "hogging" these extremely limited supplies, so I'm
setting a strict limit of no more than 10 bottles per person. <P>
Like I said, this is an exclusive deal for Muscle Media 2000 readers only. Sure, every
bodybuilder will get to try HMB sooner or later (probably in the next 6-10 months). But for now,
there's just not enough to go around.<P>
The HMB I have acquired comes in bottles with 120 capsules--250 mg of HMB in each capsule.
The recommended serving for maximum results is three grams per day, which is equivalent to
four capsules, taken with meals, three times daily. <P>
Each 120-capsule bottle costs $34.95. This doesn't make HMB the least expensive
supplement on the market, but then, it's certainly not the most expensive. <B>(In terms of what its potential benefits may be, it could very well be the "best buy" on the supplement market
today!) </B><P>
As the manufacturing process of HMB is "streamlined," I'm told the product will likely
become less expensive. So those of you who can't afford HMB now may want to sit back and
wait about 10 months--the price should go down. This will make it an even better value.<P>
If you're on a tight budget and want to try HMB right away, I would suggest you take a
good look at the supplements you're buying now and see which ones you can do without. I'm
calling HMB a "must-use" supplement for all serious bodybuilders--right up there with
supplements like creatine monohydrate and Phosphagain.<P>
Okay... let's say you want to give HMB a try RIGHT NOW--you don't want to wait 6-10
months, and you've got the "disposable income" to spare. Here's what you  do--<B>call my
customer care department at 1-800-615-8500. (Ask for Dept. #2468.) Tell the sales
representative you speak with you're a Muscle Media 2000 reader, and you're in the door.<P>
</B><P>
Remember, whenever you buy anything from me--a book, a magazine subscription, a
supplement, etc., I offer you an unconditional, lifetime, 100% money-back guarantee. It's the
strongest guarantee you'll ever find in this business or any other, and it's definitely an indication I'm confident you'll be satisfied with your purchase. If not, you get 100% of your purchase price refunded!<P>
Before we wrap this up--let me issue a word of warning to all the bodybuilding
supplement companies out there: the nutritional uses of HMB for promoting nitrogen retention
(muscle gain) are protected by a strong patent. They're not "patent-pending"... They're patented!
The patent is owned by the Iowa State University Research Foundation (ISURF) and has been
licensed to Metabolic Technologies, Inc. under U.S. patent number 5,348,979. <B>ISURF is
affiliated with Iowa State University and spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each
year to vigorously protect the university's discoveries and patents. Don't say I didn't warn
you!</B><P>
Buyers... if you come across a supplement that is supposed to have real HMB in it and
doesn't have the U.S. patent number 5,348,979 on the label, don't buy it! It's a rip-off!<P>
As you can see, when it comes to "alternatives" to anabolic steroids and other drugs that
help you build size and strength, I would say HMB is one of the most exciting ever!<P>
Even more clinical studies are being planned to test HMB. In fact, another study
involving weight trainers is already underway! And you can bet Muscle Media 2000 will be the
first magazine to report these findings to you, so you can stay on the cutting edge!

<FONT SIZE=+3>D</FONT>r. Squat didn't look good. He didn't look like he was the doctor of
anything, much less an actual physical exercise. The "doctor," otherwise known as Fred Hatfield,
had just been named the new editor of <I>Men's Fitness</I>, the new
Weider magazine, but his normal body weight of 170 had puffed up to about 250 pounds, and not
a very pretty or healthy 250 pounds at that. Apparently, he was preparing for his assault on the
squat record and trying to break the half-ton mark (in the amount lifted--not his actual
body weight).  Regardless of his admirable goal, the phrase "morbidly obese" came to
mind, especially when Fred wheezed up the short flight of stairs like a steam locomotive that had
seen better days. As he leaned back and let unopposed gravity guide him into his chair, his
great mass accelerated at the speed of a falling object--32 feet per second. The chair groaned,
shook, and ultimately withstood the impact as Dr. Squat <I>collided</I> with it.
<P>
I marveled at the impressive engineering that must have gone into that chair.  It was probably
built to withstand earthquakes or something.  Another phrase popped into my head: <I>heart
attack</I>.<P>

       Fred had invited me over to discuss business.  He wanted me to do a voluminous
ergogenic research article (2 weeks of work for 200 bucks), but before we started to talk brass
tacks, he had to eat.  He pulled out some Three Musketeers--<I>yes,</I> candy bars! 
Inadvertently, I blurted out, "What the f---?"<P>

 "Calories are calories," responded Dr. Squat.<P>

     That was the scene that replayed itself in my mind as I recently received an ad for Fred
Hatfield's <I>Bodycraft Software</I>.  I didn't expect the software to help me lose 8.8 pounds of
fat in 35 days, but since I'm a computer software kind of guy, I shelled out the $79.95 anyway. 
Besides, if I didn't get 50% leaner and 75% stronger, I could always send the damn thing
back within 30 days and get my money back. Here's the pitch: if you have a computer, this
software will program your weekly meals and workouts according to your wants and desires. 
Need to get big?  Click your mouse here.  Need to lose weight?  Just click there.  I was hoping
there would be a "I wanna' get laid" icon, but I guess 250-pound Three Musketeers' eaters don't
think about stuff like that.  <P>

     Granted, the software claims are exaggerated, but the price isn't a total rip-off as software
goes, and the program is pretty bug-proof, attractive, and logical.  Of course, if you only train two
days a week like I do, it won't work.<P>

     Even though I can't use the software, I didn't return it.  Most consumers will probably
feel the same way about it as I do: it's not a terribly sophisticated product, but at least it's not
totally stupid.  So I filed <I>Bodycraft</I> in the lessons-learned part of my brain and forgot
about it...until I got a follow-up offer in the mail. It was a special report prepared by Fred
Hatfield, Ph.D.  I read it cover-to-cover, and then... <I>I got pissed off!</I> Here's the new
pitch: For $49.95 (a discount of $35!), I could buy...IGF!  Only it wasn't insulin-like growth
factor-1, it was IGF-<I>33</I>!  What, you ask, is IGF-33?  I had the same burning question in
mind. IGF-33 is supposedly a special whey protein with "anti-catabolic nutrients and growth
factors." <I>Yes, brother, hallelujah</I>! ...full of the "missing ingredients" that will create "daily
miracles."  <I>Amen, brother</I>!  For only $49.95, I could get all those goodies that everyone's
been lusting after for the last few months: IGF-I, IGF-II, transforming growth factor-beta,
colostrum, and alpha-ketoglutarate. Geez, would I be violating my parole if I ordered this
potent stuff?  Oh heck, I couldn't pass on this tremendous offer. Besides, if for some weird,
inexplicable reason I didn't like it, I had 30 days to return it.  I went for it.  I knew IGF-33 would
turn out to be a scam, but I wanted to know what exactly was in IGF-33 that allowed the
company to say there were anabolic drugs in it.<P>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>"IGF-33 is supposedly a special whey protein with 'anti-catabolic nutrients and growth
factors.'"</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
     And here it is in front of me.  Okay, it doesn't have a flashy label, and despite the hype, it
doesn't have a weird, ethereal glow around it, and the post office, instead of angels with golden
wings, delivered it.  Incidentally, it's not called IGF-33 but rather CO#588--Ionic Whey
Supreme.  Maybe all the money went into the ingredients and not the packaging.  Let me check
out the label:  Hmmm....let's see...<I>ionic whey concentrate, flavor, and aspartame</I>.  Hey! 
Where are the growth factors and colostrum?  Where <I>be</I> those miracles? They must
have shipped me the wrong product.  I called to check.  Nope, everything's in order.  Of course, you
didn't really think a nutritional supplement would have drugs in it, did you?  Of course not.  But
this product is being promoted as having drug-like characteristics.<P>

     Scams like this come and go all the time.  The big difference here is that Fred Hatfield,
Dr. Squat, is lending his name to the hard sell. His use of factoids and outright lies is so
great that I actually felt embarrassed for him when I read the accompanying literature.  Beyond
that, Fred made it personal when he mentioned me, referring to me as that "locked-up steroid
peddler." Towards the end of the pitch, Dr. Squat reminds us that he's lifted 1,014 pounds,
so he knows what works.  He also claims to have used IGF-33 to set his squat record.  I flashed
back to the candy-bar episode where he told me "calories are calories."  Gee, I didn't know ionic
whey protein was even available back then.  Maybe the Three Musketeers thing was just a ploy.<P>

     In a very narrow technical sense (about as narrow as the legal ground <I>Bodycraft</I> is
walking on), all whey proteins will have minuscule amounts of IGF-1. Colostrum is the initial
form of milk produced right after birth.  I imagine some of the milk used in cheese making must
be from colostrum-producing cows.   Eventually, the liquid whey will be refined into a powdered
whey protein.  How much IGF-1 is in the end product?  I don't have any idea, but I'd guess the
amount to be in pictograms (a pictogram is a trillionth of a gram).  Let's ignore the fact that all
studies involving IGF in humans used an average dose of 18 milligrams.  For a very short time,
newborn babies can consume IGF-containing colostrum milk, and the IGF will reach the
bloodstream intact because the newborn's small intestine doesn't yet contain the necessary
enzymes to break down IGF peptides.  Peptide hormones are very long, complicated chains of
amino acids.  The chief ones are insulin, growth hormone, and IGF.  Ever wonder why we have
no oral versions of these hormones?  Simple.  Adults have fully functioning enzyme systems that
will break down the peptides into individual amino acids, so whatever microscopic amount of
IGF contained in whey will be handily converted into ordinary amino acids by your gut.<P>

Perhaps you're wondering how the marketers of this product can get away with making
these outrageous claims.  Isn't it against the law?  Here's how it works. The FDA has some
very specific laws about the sales of unapproved drugs.  According to the FDA, a drug is any
substance that makes a "function or structure" change or <I>claims to do so</I>.  This would
disallow substances like GHB and clenbuterol.  But remember, the substance doesn't have to be
an actual drug.  If the product has drug-like claims on the label or in the advertising, then in a
legal sense, the substance is a drug even if the product is totally ineffective.  The latest legislation
regarding dietary supplements does allow "function or structure" claims <I>if</I> there is
substantiation to back up those claims.  Substantiation means reliable clinical studies.  For
example,  someone might say the regular use of antioxidant vitamins may reduce a person's
chances of getting cancer--that's kind of a drug-like claim, but since it can be backed up by
<I>substantiation</I>, you can legally make that claim.<P>

     If you have no substantiation, the only way to make claims such as, "you'll get bigger,
leaner, and stronger" is to make the claim as part of a training and supplement <I>system</I>. 
For example, IGF-33 makes a whopping-big dose of claims: get stronger, gain muscle, have
energy, reduce pain, promote healing, have better mental arousal, make your bowels move with
the regularity of a Japanese commuter train...  Alright, I threw that last one in, but you get the
picture.  Alphasport (the makers of IGF-33 and <I>Bodycraft Software</I>) is implying that
all these benefits are because of the system, not just the supplement.  Suddenly, these drug-like
claims are now out of the FDA realm of regulation.  Claims for a system, in this case an
integrated eating, training, and supplement package like <I>Bodycraft</I>/IGF-33, are now also
under the scrutiny of another agency, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).  What's the
difference?  If you arouse the interest of the FDA, you might end up with a criminal indictment
for mislabeling.  The FTC, on the other hand, might impose a civil infraction on you, along with
a fine or a criminal indictment for consumer fraud or perhaps both.  However, the FTC doesn't
make a habit of cruising all the mags for fraudulent advertising.  Yes, <I>Bodycraft
Software's</I> claim of making me lose 8.8 pounds of fat in 35 days seems unbelievable, but
until the FTC gets a series of consumer complaints about the product, it's business as usual.<P>

     You might wonder why I'm picking on Fred Hatfield when there are many potential
targets out there, some far more deserving than Dr. Squat.  There are a couple of reasons.  Other
than the fact that he pissed me off (he should have said <I>formerly</I> locked-up,
<I>ex</I>-steroid peddler), I know he wasn't using it when he set his squat record.  Beyond that, I
also happen to sell a whey protein product, but I happen to play by the rules.  Barring that,
IGF-33 isn't a very interesting product.  It's not a drug; it's just protein.  Sure, some of the unusual
peptide structures in whey protein seem to enhance the immune system (a fact that's been
validated by research), but just eating whey won't make you bigger, stronger, or leaner.  It
happens to be one of the best of the current protein supplements, and numerous companies
produce quality whey proteins.  Regardless, it won't "protect your muscles from melting away,"
"give you more energy," or "give you better mental focus."<P>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>"...he pissed me off... he should have said <I>formerly</I> locked-up,
<I>ex</I>-steroid peddler."</CENTER></H2>
<HR>
     Most whey proteins cost less than $30 for a 2-pound container, so I have no idea why
IGF-33 costs $49.95 for an equivalent amount.  Remember, it's nothing more than whey
concentrate, flavor, and aspartame.  There isn't even any alpha-ketoglutarate on the label, even
though the special report seems to imply that it is in the product.  I've got a certain amount of
experience pricing such items, so I'd guess the actual cost to Alphasport per container of IGF-33
is less than $9, and that includes the container.<P>

     IGF-33's main selling point is the "golden" reputation of Dr. Squat.  He wants you to use
deductive reasoning to figure out that his product is great: if you presume, as he wants you to,
that he is great, that he knows what works, and that he used the product to achieve his greatness;
ergo, you can achieve greatness if you buy the product.  Contrast all that with my tarnished reputation.
Rather than being great, I'm generally perceived as being a world-class pain in the ass.  I've designed two
products, and they're both very popular and very effective.  However, I don't think anyone bought them
because of my reputation.  I present products that I think are the best.  And yes, I have a new supplement
in the works (ID3, pronounced Eye-Dee Cubed) that also has a very specific eating plan (the Isometric Diet)
and training system (the Body Contract). Alphasport has a system to sell, and so do I.  Except for having
what I consider to be a good deal of integrity, I'm not that different from Dr. Squat.<P>

     In my subconscious, where the demon lives, I know I could make a lot more money if I
just, you know, loosened up a bit regarding my advertising.  Sure, a combination of drug-like
claims, overt sexual titillation, and a little hypocritical posturing of some spokesperson who's
obviously on steroids would do wonders for my business.  After all, it's the de facto advertising
standard in the health-food business.  If it didn't work, supplement companies would resort to
other tactics.  Look at it this way: many of the potential supplement consumers aren't terribly
sophisticated.  In the past, I've always used a very low-key approach with my supplements,
naively assuming a superior product will succeed in the market place.  I think, at least initially, it
was my knee-jerk reaction to the original Cybergenics sales pitch.  Years ago, many of us in the
business thought that basically Cybergenics was shit and didn't work as claimed.  Surely, it was
only a matter of time before savvy consumers would wise up, and Cybergenics would be out of
business.  Just the opposite happened.  Hundreds of thousands of consumers thought otherwise. 
Scott Chinery [the former owner of Cybergenics] bought exotic sports cars.  I bought a
moped.<P>

     As a part-time supplement businessman, my intent is to formulate unique products, ones
I'll use myself because I couldn't find anything else like them on the market.  But because I
usually keep that demon in the back of my mind confined, I'm the worst possible choice for
writing advertising copy.  I'm afraid I'm a bit too laid back and too honest.  I think it's an
admirable stance, albeit not a very lucrative one.  Unfortunately, the run-of-the-mill customer is
usually attracted to exaggerated claims.  That simply means that someone else gets the money. 
Although there's no rule that says the best product can't have the best advertising campaign, it
happens far too infrequently for my tastes.  Usually, nice guys go broke.  In a few years, I'll need
a kidney transplant.  Consequently, I'm uninsurable.  So being nice not only makes me broke but
potentially dead.  With all that in mind, don't expect the ID3 ad campaign to be low key.  [By the
way, ID3 isn't available yet, but it'll be out soon!]<P>

     Why is it that health-food supplements are singled out for exaggerated and borderline
false claims?  I constantly see television ads for foods of questionable value (whether milk, pork,
Ovaltine, or mainstream weight-loss systems, all of which, in my mind, are just as odious as
health-food claims).  Whole milk does not "make a body good," but most consumers don't bitch
about it.  <P>

     During an interview with one of my local newspapers, the <I>LA Weekly</I>, the
reporter asked if I had a problem with steroid-using athletes hawking health-food supplements. 
No, not generally, and I'll tell you why.  The subliminal message in using a professional
bodybuilder in a supplement advertisement is that his or her "greatness" was achieved from the
use of the product. Obviously, most of the consumers buying the various health-food
supplements won't achieve the exaggerated claims presented.  After going through a few
containers, even the most <I>Gomer-esque</I> consumer will figure out that protein powder
alone, or whatever, won't turn him or her into a bodybuilding champion.  Still, people will
continue to buy the products simply because they like them, and they feel happier when they're
using them.  And if they don't like them, most of the major supplement manufacturers offer some
kind of money-back guarantee.  <P>

     On the other hand, consider the professional basketball star who pulls in millions for
endorsing soda pop, which is mostly sugar and water.  Try telling any of the soda pop makers that
you didn't find the product particularly refreshing--you feel that Mr. Basketball Star mislead you
and that you want your money back.  Just imagine the response.<P>

     To be competitive in the supplement business, I have to follow rules and regulations. 
And as long as my competitors follow the same rules, it's a fair game.  The marketers of IGF-33
don't follow the rules.  They present false claims that hook the wallets of unwary customers, so
they can be pulled in and gutted on the gore-stained dock of Dr. Squat.  They're taking money
away from me.  And I don't like losing a sale, especially when I was fouled.<P>

Pompous Asshole or <B>Genius Know-It-All?</B> Subjective, <B>Objective...</B> what's the difference?<P>

and other organizations by building networks of researchers and
policymakers focused on the social dimensions of economic change.<p> CPRN
organizes research programs that involve interjurisdictional
collaboration, multi-year planning, and/or interdisciplinary work in order
to produce new insights about economic and social issues important to the
well-being of Canadians. 
<p>
CPRN is currently operating Three Networks - on Family, Work, and
Health, as well as a special project on the non-profit sector.

<strong>Financial Information:</strong><br>
<P>
The fiscal year ends on June 30. Copies of the annual reports for 1994-95 and 1995-96 are available on request from
<i><a href="mailto:glacelle.cprn@idrc.ca">glacelle.cprn@idrc.ca</a></i>.  The <a href=anncont.htm>1995-96 Annual Report</a> is also available here at our web site.
<P>
CPRN has succeeded in part because of the in-kind contributions from the Board of Directors and its numerous Steering, Advisory and Editorial Committees. However, no organization can function without money.
<P>
CPRN is funded three levels of support.  The core funding comes from a contribution agreement created by six federal agencies for a period of five years, which expires on March 31, 2000. Project funding comes from a combination of provincial and federal agencies, foundations and corporations.  General financial support is provided by a number of major Canadian corporations. In the year ending June 30, 1996, CPRN had a total turnover of $2 million -- it had raised $1.25 in project and general support for each dollar of core funding.

<center><h2>Assessing the Scope for Community Action:<br>
A Baseline Study of the Non-Profit Sector </h2></center>
<p>
Nonprofit organizations are major providers of family supports and health services.  They employ about 1.3 million Canadians in paid work, and another 4.5 million as volunteers.  They also form the nucleus of what we call civic community -- they provide the place where citizens collaborate for purposes of leisure, pleasure, and social commitment.   Total revenues of the sector are equivalent to about 12 percent of GDP.   The sector is currently undergoing its own transformation as governments cut back on grants and transfers, while the need for social services is expanding rapidly.
<P>
Because so much of the activity of the sector is informal, and because the sector has its roots in Church-related charitable activity, it has never been given a clear legal or political identity.  For regulatory and tax purposes, it is treated as almost corporate or as a residual.  From the perspective of the sector, it is society's response to problems which cannot be treated elsewhere.  Yet, relatively little is known about the sector, and there is no generally accepted framework for tracking what is happening there.
<P>
The Kahanoff Foundation has undertaken to fund a series of research and public education activities that will improve the formal knowledge base about Canada's nonprofit sector, and will broaden the understanding of the role it plays in our civil society.  As a first step in this initiative, The Kahanoff Foundation asked CPRN to undertake a study which would assess the existing knowledge base and set some direction for future research and policy analysis.  To that end, CPRN has commissioned three technical papers, listed in the Box.  These papers are to be reviewed at a Roundtable in January 1997 and then published.  In addition, the project Director, Ron Hirshhorn will prepare a contextual study summarizing the results for a more general audience.

<center><h2>The Society We Want</h2></center>

CPRN's Family Network has launched a public dialogue entitled <EM>The Society We Want</EM>. The dialogue offers citizens a neutral, independent forum to engage with one another, struggling with some of the crucial issues and choices facing Canadians in the process of social policy reform and working towards resolution and public judgment.
<p>
Five issues are currently included in a discussion leaders' guide created by CPRN. These are: Our 
Children, Health, Work, The Social Safety Net, and the Role of Government. The choices and fact 
sheets presented for each issue offer a springboard for informed discussion and the opportunity to 
clarify values and develop new options. Feedback from each discussion will be sent to a data bank and 
made publicly available to all researchers.
<p>
Outreach for this dialogue is achieved through partnerships with other national non-profit organizations 
and other interested groups and individuals. Current partner organizations include the Community 
Foundations of Canada, the United Way of Canada/Centraide, the YWCA of/du Canada, Frontier 
College, the Imagine Program of the Canadian Centre for Philanthropy, Nirvcentre, the Anglican Church 
of Canada, the Catholic Women's League of Canada, and the World Interfaith Association. Other 
partners and participants are being encouraged to organize discussions as well.
<p>
Five regional orientation workshops were held across Canada earlier this year to teach local afffiliates of our partners how to use the tool-kit and to give them a first-hand experience of working through difficult choices. These included workshops held in Toronto, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Halifax, and Montreal. Each local partner will be recruiting discussion leaders and organizing discussion groups with their members over the coming year.
<p>
For further information, please contact the Program Coordinator, Mary Lewis <a href="mailto:maryl@lewiscoll.com">by email</a> or by phone at 416-533-2168. Copies of the tool-kit, The Society We Want: A Discussion Leader's Guide, are available with other CPRN materials at <a href="http://fox.nstn.ca/~renouf/cprn.html">Renouf Publishing </a>.

WORKING PAPER CALLS FOR FIRST MINISTERS<br>
TO REBUILD TRUST AND RENEW FEDERALISM</H2>
<p>
<H3><EM>Australian Experience Shows Turnaround Possible</EM></H3>
</center>

If Canada is to have a workable social union, First Ministers must begin to create mechanisms for
cooperative decision-making and genuine power sharing, according to a working paper, <i>Building Blocks
for Canada's New Social Union</i>. The Paper was released today by Canadian 
Policy Research Networks (CPRN).<p>

"Canada lags behind Australia and others in the evolution of effective intergovernmental machinery,"
says Margaret Biggs, author of the paper. "As a result, the overall workability and cohesion of the
federation have suffered. The public has grown increasingly 
disillusioned."<p>

The paper argues that the introduction of the Canada Health and Social Transfer (CHST) has brought
these issues to a head. The CHST ushered in a new era of significantly reduced federal financial
contributions and has forced a rethinking of the values and priorities that underlie civil society in
Canada. Just when the future unity of the country is being called into question, the social order that has
come to personify Canadians' sense of themselves and their country, appears to be unravelling.<p>

The paper sees the CHST as an "opportunity to reconstruct a shared understanding of the country's
aspirations," describing it as a "transitional device through which the makings of a new social union
can be explored." The upcoming First Ministers' Conference is an 
opportunity to begin this important process.<p>

<i>Building Blocks for Canada's New Social Union</i> assesses the mechanisms and governing structures for a more decentralized social union. Evidence and insights are drawn from six case studies: three in Canada (the Canada Assistance Plan, education and the Agreement on Internal Trade) and three international (the European Community, Germany and Australia).<p>

A key finding is that the new forum for intergovernmental dialogue and decision making in Australia
has succeeded in rebuilding trust and spearheading important policy reforms. This has been
accomplished without creating a new layer of government or bureaucracy, or the inflexibility of
unanimity-based decision-making.<p>

The case studies also demonstrate how First Ministers have been the driving force behind successful
intergovernmental collaboration in Australia as well as education reforms and the Agreement on
Internal Trade in Canada.<p>

The study cautions that public participation and democratic accountability must not be sacrificed to the
exigencies of intergovernmental decision making. According to the paper, "public engagement and
accountability must be the cornerstone of a renewed social union in Canada."<p>

The study builds on an earlier CPRN report "Exploring Canadian Values" by Suzanne Peters, Director
of CPRN's Family Network. According to Dr. Peters, "the record of public judgment makes it clear that
Canadians care deeply about the social union. They are tired of governments squabbling and want
social programs that work and are fair to all Canadians."<p>

Judith Maxwell, President of CPRN, says that "it is the social union that is most central to Canadians'
sense of identity and security. It is the social union that has come to personify the 'worst practices' of
intergovernmental relations in Canada." She goes on to add that "the social union is important not just
for 'feel good' reasons. Skills, knowledge and social cohesion are key to wealth creation in the new
global economy."<p>

The paper identifies ten essential building blocks for rebuilding the social union. A key finding is the
importance of monitoring performance and progress. Biggs writes that, "early initiative to produce
national performance indicators on policy outcomes, and social indicators on social trends, would
strengthen the accountability and consistency of government services while allowing local flexibility
and innovation."<p>

Another critical building block highlighted in the paper is a set of neutral mechanisms to interpret
and/or enforce compliance to agreed upon norms. Such mechanisms are found to be instrumental in
securing intergovernmental cooperation and strengthening the integrity of the decision-making process.<p>

"Early action on the social union is needed to signal a break from the past, and a future built on
partnership, performance and democratic accountability," says Ms. Biggs. "This breakthrough is within
the collective reach of Canadian governments. It would provide Canadians everywhere with a
workable and meaningful vision of the country."<p>

CPRN is a national, not-for-profit, "virtual" research institute designed to address the social dimensions
of the economic agenda by generating excellent research and fostering public debate. Margaret Biggs
has worked as a Research Fellow at CPRN.<p>

<center><h2>Press Release - July, 1996<br><BR>
Max Bell Foundation Awards Grant to the <BR>
Health Network of CPRN</H2>
</center><P>
Judith Maxwell, President of the Canadian Policy Research Networks (CPRN), is pleased to
announce that a three-year grant for $125,000 has been received from the Max Bell Foundation
in support of the development of robust health policy research capacity within the Health
Network of CPRN.
<P>
A non-profit, independent policy research organization, CPRN's mission is to create knowledge
and lead public debate on social and economic issues important to the well being of Canadians. 
It is a "virtual" institute, which organizes its research into three domains: Family, Work and
Health.
<P>
The Health Network, under the direction of Marcus Hollander, is based in Victoria, B.C.  It seeks
to help make the Canadian health system more efficient, effective, equitable, affordable, and
responsive to client/consumer needs, and to lead the public debate on the future of the health
system in Canada.
<P>
"The Max Bell Foundation grant will enable the Health Network to build its research capacity,
and thus to help identify sustainable policies and practices to improve the health of Canadians"
says Judith Maxwell.
<P>
The Health Network of the CPRN is independent of the influence of special interest groups, and
works with government officials, care providers and the public to find constructive solutions to
current dilemmas in the health sector.  Findings are widely disseminated through an Internet Web
site, publication of Working Papers, Studies, and Synthesis reports, presentations at conferences,
symposia, workshops and through news releases, press conferences, interviews and other
speaking engagements.
<P>
As part of the "virtual institute" of CPRN, the Health Network relies extensively on developing
networks with key researchers, from a wide range of disciplines, form across Canada, through
extensive use of the Internet.
<P>
Funding for the first year, will be directed to feasibility studies.

<td align=top> <center><h2>A CPRN Discussion Group</h2></center>
CPRN welcomes members and friends of all networks to use this listserv as a means of discussing policy research approaches, identifying new issues, announcing events or publications, asking for references or related work, and engaging debate on issues related to the research programs of our three networks or related projects.  If you wish to participate, please fill out the registration form, below. Initially, we will have one site for all contributors, but before long we will break into one site for each network.
<p>
We hope you'll find this discussion site a useful vehicle to get-up-to-date on issues and events related to policy, meet potential colleagues, and generate the synergies by which we can all do better work. This site is expected to be primarily of interest to policy makers, academics, and front line practitioners who want to explore issues related to work, health, and family, but others are welcome to contribute. However, postings not relevant to these general objectives will be screened out by the list moderators. Please return to our homepage in order to get a better idea of the mission and mandate of CPRN and the research programs underway in each of the networks. 
<p>
The discussion group will be in the form of a "moderated listserv". That is, all participants will need to apply for inclusion in the group and all mail should be sent to "mbeebe@islandnet.com" (without the quotes) and the list maintainer will then send your comment to the list for distribution to all subscribers. In this way, the discussion will only be viewed by subscribers.
<P>
First, a few general guidelines/rules.
<p>
1) ALWAYS put your name and e-mail address at the end of every posting. It is important that people be able to contact you privately if they wish, and  some mail systems do not identify the writer anywhere in the header. 
<p>
2) Please include a meaningful subject heading, so that people will know whether your message deals with a topic of interest to them.
<p>
3) If you are replying to someone else's posting, briefly quote or summarize that posting before you offer your reply. Doing so will make your message clearer and avoid confusion, especially for new subscribers who may not have read the original message. Since a number of topics are likely to be discussed on the list at any given moment, even long-time subscribers may not remember what prompted your remarks unless you remind them. 
<p>
4) Most importantly, please treat the ideas and efforts of others with respect. We should all expect to encounter individuals whose ideas vary from our own.  This is to be expected when dealing with people whose life experiences vary widely. Debate on issues is welcome here, but not diatribe or attack. 
<p>
5) Be conservative with your quotes. Quote only text from earlier messages, which is required to put your own message in context. This will make your own  message easier to read. Please avoid messages which require the reader to wade through old text in a search for the new material.

<center><h2>About the Family Network</h2></center>

<P>
Families are important to the social and economic well-being of
Canada.  A new urgency to understand families has emerged in the
1990s.  Changing family membership, cutbacks in public spending,
and more difficult labour market conditions put new pressures
on every member of the family. Popularized by the media, debates
about &quot;family values&quot; have captured the public imagination.
 In addition, the majority of families now struggle to balance
two jobs and the sharing of tasks in the home.  
<P>
Contacts with front-line workers and advocates make it clear that
there are many myths about family and social policy issues. The
persistent stereotype of unmarried teen moms dependent on long-term
social assistance stands in sharp contrast to the actual social
assistance population of  twenty and thirty-something divorced
women using family benefits for periods of less than three years.
Similarly, the complexity of the relationship between the family
and the state needs to be acknowledged.  Rather than falling into
a nostalgia trap which assumes that families have operated in
isolation, we need to recognize that many families over many periods
have relied on a variety of state and community supports.
<P>
The Family Network has positioned itself to create a participatory
process which fosters innovative research and a new platform for
inquiry.  Its Research Agenda will focus on two areas: 1) The bases of 
social cohesion, including the policy context of families and 2) the social 
and economic dynamics of contemporary family life.
<p>
<p>
<strong>The Director</strong><br>

<P>
Suzanne Peters is Director of the Family Network, Canadian Policy
Research Networks.  Over the last 15 years, she has established
a strong track record in the social policy field, as a commentator
and speaker, consultant, public servant, academic, and most recently,
as executive director of a non-profit institute, The Policy Research

<h3>Research Agenda: Economic and Social Dynamics of Families</h3>
<P>
<strong>Overview</strong>
<P>
The major focus of the Network in coming years will be the examination
of the social and economic dynamics of families.  The Network
will characterize the determinants of families' strengths and
weaknesses, and their impacts on the health and well-being of individual
members.  We will explore the coping strategies and mechanisms
by which families demonstrate the resiliency to &quot;bounce back&quot;
in difficult circumstances, the ways in which public policies
can best support these adaptations, and the impacts of these changes
on women, men, children, and more extended kin.
<P>
The Network is particularly interested in contributing to our
understanding of how sole support families, low wage families,
minority families, and other marginalized families cope with the
difficulties imposed by the current socio-economic environment;
and to discover how public policies can help to buffer the negative
impacts of these changes on families and individuals.  Most broadly,
the Network wants to explore how the activities of families may
lay the foundation for social cohesion/fragmentation, inclusion/exclusion,
and democratization/restriction in Canadian society.
<P>
To achieve this, the Network wants to complement studies of changes
in overall family structures and incomes with research on transactions
and activities taking place in families.  Studying these transactions
opens up the &quot;black box&quot; of the family, expanding the
focus of research from the family as a closed unit to the complexity
of family interactions and their impacts on individual family
members.
<P>
For this purpose, transactions are defined as the transfer of
resources among individuals to meet needs.  These transfers may
involve money, advice, household help, emotional caring, and other
formal and informal ways by which individuals may support one
another.  The concern will be on both family transactions within
households, and where appropriate, among households, including
inter-generational, custodial/noncustodial, and other cases where
important family transfers may take place.  The broad objective
is to understand the role played by these private, non-market transfers
in underpinning our economy and fostering the well-being of our citizens.
<P>
In conceptualizing transactions, the approach is socio-ecological.
 Transactions do not occur in isolation, but in response to the
availability of external resources mediated by changes in the
economy and society.  A preliminary conceptual paper framing these
issues has been funded on contract from Human Resources Development
Canada and is available from the Network.
<P>
From this starting point, and others, the Network will undertake
a series of methodologically diverse studies.  The research explores
the adaptations taking place in families under a series of restructuring
conditions.  This research is envisioned within three broad themes:
1) family restructuring, 2) economic restructuring, and 3) public
policy restructuring.  The first theme, family restructuring,
is focused on the changing nature of roles, social relationships,
and expectations in our society as they affect families.  The
second theme, economic restructuring, is focused on how the changing
nature of work affects families, including unemployment, precarious
employment, and polarization in the labour market. The third theme,
impacts of public policies, is focused on changes in the availability
and mix of federal, provincial, and municipal policies as they
affect families' strengths, weaknesses and overall resiliency
in difficult circumstances.
<P>
The Network is concerned to undertake original projects rather
than to update or expand upon existing studies.  For this reason,
we anticipate commissioning several conceptual papers during our
first year of operation in order to build the foundation for future
projects which will be empirical or applied policy analysis. The
work will be organized in four overlapping stages as illustrated
by the following pyramid.  Each is described in greater detail
under each section. Information on the process of project selection
and direction as well as contact numbers for participation in
the Network can be found below.

<h2> Research in Progress <br>
 1995-1997</h2></center>
<P><a name="#top_page">
The Family Network is stirring up the policy debate with pioneering approaches to social research.  Two broad themes shape the research.   The first is social cohesion and the policy context of families.  The second is the social and economic dynamics of families.  Both are described below.
<P>
<h3>The Policy Context of Families</h3>
<P>
The first part of the Family Network's research agenda looks at the broad outlines of social policy change.  Responding to the 1995 budget announcement of the Canada Health and Social Transfer, and to ongoing changes in provincial policies and programs, the Network has focused on four key projects: <EM>Exploring Canadian Values</EM>, by Suzanne Peters; <EM>The Society We Want</EM>, a public dialogue process; <EM>Building Blocks for Canada's New Social Union</EM>, by Margaret Biggs; and feasibility work for a multi-jurisdictional inventory of social policy initiatives.  
<P>
<em>Exploring Canadian Values</em>
<P>
This report by Suzanne Peters, Director of the Family Network, shows that Canadians share an abiding sense of collective responsibility for their fellow citizens, while at the same time wanting governments to design and deliver programs that are more effective and efficient.  Canadians want programs to be adequate, integrated, and to invest in people.  They also want  greater citizen engagement and increased accountability.  The report has had a significant impact on the public debate, sparking renewed interest in national standards, new mechanisms of governance, and in the means for citizen engagement. 
<P>
Looking ahead, CPRN is planning a project examining the myths and stereotypes that shape social values and the public's capacity to understand and deliberate upon the common principles that should shape the new social union. 
<P>
<EM>The Society We Want</EM><P>
One of the key findings of <EM>Exploring Canadian Values</EM>was that Canadians want to be part of the process of social policy change. They want opportunities to deliberate and move toward more informed public judgment.  To respond to this desire for democratic engagement, CPRN has created a public dialogue process called The Society We Want. 
<P>
Five issue guides -- Our Children, Work, Health, The Social Safety Net and The Role of Government -- are available to support an extended discussion by groups of 10 to 12 citizens.  A feedback form is then returned to CPRN and archived at Carleton University.  The discussion groups are being organized by 12 national non-profit organizations who have partnered with CPRN to promote public dialogue. This work  was supported by the Laidlaw Foundation, the Walter and Duncan Gordon Charitable Foundation, and the J.W. McConnell Family Foundation.
<P>
In 1996-97, funding by the Trillium  Foundation will enable CPRN to deepen its partnerships, extend the dialogue to some groups not yet involved, and assess the capacity for public dialogue to build alliances and stimulate social cohesion.
<P>
<EM>Building Blocks for Canada's New Social Union </EM>
<P>
Margaret Biggs, a Research Fellow over the last year, has written a  paper which sets out the building blocks for creating and managing a renewed social union in Canada.  The paper is intended to help governments frame their discussions about how to maintain a shared national (not federal) dimension to social policy across the country and how to enhance the participation and transparency that are essential for democracy.   Questions addressed include: What would be the governing structures for a more decentralized and much leaner social safety net?  How would citizens be able to influence the shape of this new social union?  And what would be the intergovernmental process that would coordinate the actions of federal, provincial, and territorial governments who share responsibility for social programming?   
<P>
<EM>Catalogue of Social Policy Initiatives </EM>
<P>
Margaret Biggs, with summer intern Katherine Pestieau, have developed a feasibility and pilot study of how to conduct a cross-jurisdictional inventory of social policy initiatives across Canada.  The pilot study has focused on innovations in welfare-to-work programs.  The project is designed to describe social policy initiatives and to display them in a systematic format for use by  policy makers, governments, and citizens.  The results will be reviewed at a Roundtable of the potential users in September.
<P>
<EM>What is the best policy mix for Canada's children?</EM>
<P>
In the current policy environment, a new premium has to be placed on the development of intergovernmental decision-making structures, and on efforts to ensure that expenditure reduction will be governed by a drive to improve the effectiveness of expenditures.  One of the most serious gaps in public policy in Canada is a focus on children.  This project will examine the effectiveness of various forms of  income support and social services for children, in order to a) provide a balanced information base for policy debate about how best to address the poverty and risks faced by too many of Canada's children; and b) establish the accountability mechanisms and the intergovernmental machinery required to ensure that these policies and programs actually generate positive outcomes for children.  This work will be supported by the Laidlaw Foundation, and by corporate funders of CPRN.
<P>
<h3>Social and Economic Dynamics of Families</h3>
<P>
The second major focus of the Family Network is the social and economic dynamics of families.  Network members are working to understand the determinants of families' strengths and weaknesses, including their impacts on the health and well-being of individual members.    
<P>
The Network is particularly interested in understanding how sole-support, low-wage, minority , and other marginalized families cope with the difficulties imposed by the current social-economic environment; and to discover how public policies can help to buffer the negative impacts of these changes on families and individuals.  Most broadly, the Network wants to explore how the activities of families may lay the foundation for social cohesion.
<P> 
The Network is engaged in two related projects, including a symposium on Families and Well-being, planned for late 1996; and an Interview Study of Labour Supply and Family Resiliency by M-J Wason.
<P>
<em>Families and Well-being</em>
<P>
Five issue papers will define cutting-edge issues.  Two papers --  Poverty and Relative Income  and  Labour Supply -- are now in progress. Three others are to be commissioned : Dynamics Surrounding Children, Caregiving, and a Methodology Paper: 
<UL>
<LI>
<EM>Poverty and Relative Income.</EM> Dr. David Cheal, Professor at the University of Winnipeg and Research Fellow with CPRN since September 1995, is exploring whether family members share access to resources and the impacts of different patterns of sharing and non-sharing on families and individuals in them.  He will examine the relationship of money and time, since family members may be impoverished by a shortage of one or both. </UL>
<UL><LI>
<EM>Labour Market Attachment.</EM> Dr. Frances Woolley of Carleton University will explore families' decisions regarding participation in the labour market.  How do decisions about whether to look for work and whether to work full-time or part-time relate to the dynamics within families.  These decisions may include varying expenditure patterns, use of savings, strategies for investments, and pooling of time within and across households. </UL>
<UL><LI>
<EM>Dynamics Surrounding Children.</EM> Both private and collective responsibilities for families need to be examined, particularly in light of renewed discussion of a targeted child benefit.  Can we articulate the needs of children in isolation from their family context?  How can the state respond unless it acknowledges that the poverty of children is also the poverty of their parents? In terms of conceptualizing inter-generational conflict, is it the middle generation that is in conflict with others, or are seniors and youth in conflict with one another? For example, will families pick up the difference as state support for higher education disappears?  Will adult members trade off their RRSPs in order to invest in children's education? </UL>
<UL><LI>
<EM>Caregiving.</EM> The focus here is not just on seniors, but special caregiving needs more broadly, including individuals with disabilities and medically fragile children.   Key questions are: "How do investments in caregiving affect other areas of family dynamics and investments?"   What should be the tax treatment of caregiving costs and responsibilities?  This work will draw on existing studies at other institutes. </UL>
<UL><LI>
<EM>Methodology Paper.</EM> The methodological issues of studying transactions, including the comparative advantages of qualitative and quantitative approaches, will be outlined.  The paper will suggest how to make best use of ongoing surveys, for example. </UL>
<P>
<EM>Labour Supply and Family Resiliency</EM>
<P>
M-J Wason, a CPRN Research Associate, has completed interviewing families in Surrey, B.C. to ask them how they cope with labour market disruptions (loss of a job or declines in earnings).  There were one-on-one interviews with individual family members, including the children over the age of 6, and focus groups with families in different labour market situations.  The work has been sensitive to differences between common-law and legal families, blended families, and step families.  This project has been supported by the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Province of British Columbia Ministry of Social Services, Statistics Canada, and Human Resources Development Canada.

<CENTER><H2><STRONG>CPRN FAMILY NEWSLETTER No. 4 - July, 1996</STRONG> </H2></CENTER>
<P>
CPRN is now 18 months old, and the Family Network has been leading the way with influential publications and pioneering approaches to social research.
<P>
Previous Newsletters have focused on the Network plans for the social and economic dynamics of families.  This research is driven by a desire to explore the elements of family resiliency, by identifying the dynamics of transactions within the family and between family members and others kin or non-kin.  For more details, see p. 3.
<P>
In the past year, a second theme has been developed the basis of social cohesion.  It focuses on the policy context of families.  Work to date has concentrated on the identification of fundamental social values and the challenges to governance created by the changes in federal transfers to provinces, and the further decentralization of social programs.
<P>
In this Newsletter Suzanne Peters provides a summary of the research completed to date and outlines plans for the coming year.
<P>
<STRONG><H3>THE POLICY CONTEXT OF FAMILIES</H3> </STRONG>
<P>
The first part of the Family Network's research agenda looks at the broad outlines of social policy change.  Over the last year, responding to the 1995 budget announcement of the Canada Health and Social Transfer, and to ongoing changes in provincial policies and programs, the Network has focused on four key projects: Exploring Canadian Values, by Suzanne Peters; The Society We Want, a public dialogue process; Building Blocks for Canada's New Social Union, by Margaret Biggs; and feasibility work for an inventory of social policy innovations.
<P>
<STRONG>Exploring Canadian Values </STRONG>
<P>
Released in December 1995, this report by Suzanne Peters, Director of the Family Network, shows that Canadians share an abiding sense of collective responsibility for their fellow citizens, while at the same time wanting governments to design and deliver programs that are more effective and efficient.   Canadians want programs to be adequate, integrated, and to invest in people.  They also want  greater citizen engagement and increased accountability. Building on this report, Suzanne Peters and Judith Maxwell, President of CPRN, have been presenting findings to both federal and provincial policymakers and to the general public.  The report has had a significant impact on the public and policy debate and has sparked renewed interest in national standards, new mechanisms of governance, and in the means for citizen engagement. 
<P>
Looking ahead, CPRN is planning a July 1997 report on Canadians' emerging public judgment as a contribution to the negotiation of mutual principles and the elements of a new social union.  In the current climate, Canadians need opportunities to deliberate the issues and have their voices heard.  Over the coming year, research to be undertaken by Suzanne Peters will explore the 1995 data more deeply, as well as analyze the results of the 1996 wave of the public dialogue process (see The Society We Want). The focus will be on the myths, stereotypes, and misinformation that shape the public's capacity to understand and deliberate these issues.  This report will provide a mirror for a wider population of Canadians to hold up and reflect upon the changes taking place in the social safety net.  The scope of the research plan will  depend on available resources.
<P>
<STRONG>Quebec Partners</STRONG>
<P>
As participants in the Family Network and its Steering Committee, the Quebec Partenariat de recherche sociale are strengthening ties with CPRN. The Partenariat,  a multidisciplinary initiative strives to build links among policymakers, family organizations, and academics.  While the Partenariat's work is generally less policy focused than that undertaken by the Family Network, they are interested in learning how to transfer knowledge to policymakers.  Plans are underway for a  Spring 97 colloquium on family policy that will interest members of the Family Network.  For more information, contact Monique Provost, co-ordonnatrice de Partenariat, 514-841-4001 or by email Monique_Provost@INRS-Culture.UQuebec.CA
<P>
<STRONG>The Society We Want</STRONG>
<P>
One of the key findings of  Exploring Canadian Values was that Canadians want a greater sense of democratic engagement in the decisions that affect them.  People want to be part of the process of social policy change. They want opportunities to deliberate and move toward more informed public judgment.
<P>
Based on the advice of the project Advisory Committee, a second phase of this project over the past five months has focused on creating a public dialogue process on The Society We Want. Discussions will be based on a dialogue kit containing five issue guides: Our Children, Work, Health, the Social Safety Net and the Role of Government.  Each issue guide forms the basis for a two-hour discussion by groups of 10 to 12 citizens.  A feedback form is then returned to CPRN and archived at Carleton University.  The discussion groups are organized by 12 national non-profit organizations who have partnered with CPRN to promote public dialogue.
<P>
This work, funded by the Laidlaw Foundation, the Walter and Duncan Gordon Charitable Foundation, and the J.W. McConnell Family Foundation, has included:
<P><PRE>
	Nov-Dec 95		Press Release and Briefings 
	Nov 95 - Feb 96		Partnership Development
	Feb 96			Kit for Discussion Leaders with five Issue Guides
	Feb-April 96		Five Regional Orientation sessions 
	March - ongoing		Group Discussions in Process
	May 96			Partnership Meeting
	Sept. 30, 1996		Cutoff for First Wave Results
</PRE><P>
A proposal for two years of work has been circulated, which would allow CPRN to deepen its partnerships, extend the public dialogue, allow for the analysis of follow-up data, develop the cornerstone for a potential infrastructure for public dialogue in Canada, and inform urgent policy decisions by bringing forth the voices of citizens in a deliberative process.
<P>
<STRONG>Governance and Accountability in a New Social Union </STRONG>
<P>
Under the leadership of Margaret Biggs, a Fellow with the Family Network, CPRN turned its attention in September 1995 to the machinery of the social union, which we define as the web of citizen rights and obligations that give effect to our shared sense of social purpose and common citizenship.  This project included a March 1996 workshop attended by federal and provincial policymakers, academics, and front-line practitioners.  
<P>
Questions addressed include: What would be the governing structures for a more decentralized and much leaner social safety net?  How would citizens be able to influence the shape of this new social union?  And what would be the intergovernmental process that would coordinate the actions of federal, provincial, and territorial governments who share responsibility for social programming?
<P>
In the resulting paper, released in June 1996, Margaret Biggs has adopted a case study approach, looking at the Canadian experience in areas such as social assistance, education, and internal trade, as well as the experience of intergovernmental decision making in the European Community, Germany, and Australia.  
<P>
The paper sets out the building blocks for creating and managing a renewed social union in Canada.  It is intended to help governments frame their discussions about how to maintain a shared national (not federal) dimension to social policy across the country and how to enhance the participation and transparency that are essential for democracy.  The paper is also designed to help citizens and interested groups to participate in the rather difficult debate that lies ahead.
<P>
<STRONG>Catalogue of Public Policy Innovations </STRONG>
<P>
In February 1995, the Steering Committee identified the need for better information related to social policy changes.  An inventory was seen as a first step in making sense of the shifting policy scene.  
<P>
Over the summer of 1996, Katherine Pestieau will be working as a CPRN summer intern under the supervision of Margaret Biggs to develop a feasibility and pilot study of how to conduct a cross-jurisdictional inventory of social policy innovations in Canada.  The pilot study will focus on innovations in welfare-to-work programs.  
<P>
The project proposes to gather and describe social policy innovations and to display them in a systematic format.  It should provide a precious reference point for those manoeuvring in a tight fiscal environment and with little access to what is happening in other jurisdictions.  It can serve policymakers, governments, and citizens in their desire to understand programs and attain accountability.
<P>
<H3><STRONG>SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DYNAMICS</STRONG></H3>
<P>
The second major focus of the Family Network is the social and economic dynamics of families.  Here Network members are working to understand the determinants of families' strengths and weaknesses, and their impacts on the health and well-being of individual members.  We are looking at the coping strategies and mechanisms by which families demonstrate the resiliency to "bounce back" in difficult circumstances, the ways in which public policies can best support these adaptations, and the impacts of these changes on women, men, children, and more extended kin.   
<P>
The Network is particularly interested in understanding how sole-support families, low-wage families, minority families, and other marginalized families cope with the difficulties imposed by the current social-economic environment; and to discover how public policies can help to buffer the negative impacts of these changes on families and individuals.  Most broadly, the Network wants to explore how the activities of families may lay the foundation for social cohesion/fragmentation, inclusion/exclusion, and democratization/restriction in Canadian society.
 <P>
Work on these dynamics links back to the Values project.  While values may suggest a commitment to investments in social policy, behaviour may in fact be drifting or shifting away as cuts are made and the economy becomes more uncertain.  It will be very important to nail down prevailing attitudes/expectations for the future and contrast them to behaviour as a link between the two parts of the Family Network agenda.  
<P>
Trends related to the growing uncertainty families experience in a changing economy may be surprising.  For example, families may experience a diminished subjective well-being as they struggle with job losses and changes.  Even those families that succeed in income or labour market terms may not be resilient in other ways. Studies going back to the Great Depression have suggested social-psychological effects on families.   One new area for study is the impact of female unemployment, as we see a growing rationalization of the economy that affects women's attachment to the labour market.
<P>
The Network Newsletter No. 3 in July 1995 laid out this research program broadly.  To date, three projects are in progress:
<P>
<LI>	a Working Paper by Suzanne Peters that presents a conceptual framework;
<LI>	a set of four issue papers and a symposium on Families and Well-being, planned for Fall 1996; and
<LI>	an Interview Study of Labour Supply and Family Resiliency by M-J Wason.
<P>
<STRONG>Transactions Framework Paper</STRONG>
<P>
Family Transactions: Stage One Conceptual Framework, by Suzanne Peters, will be released in En-glish and French by HRDC as a Research Paper 96-3E, in its Applied Research Series.  All HRDC Papers are available by contacting the publication coordinator by fax at (819) 953-8584.  Drawing from this work, CPRN will release a different version of this same working paper later this summer, Examining the Concept of Transactions as the Basis for Studying the Social and Economic Dynamics of Families.  This work builds on a February 1995 workshop, as well as a literature search conducted by researcher assistants Mary Bunch and Michele Fisher.
<P>
<STRONG>Issue Papers and Symposium</STRONG>
<P>
An October 1995 workshop helped to lay the plans for five issue papers, which will define cutting-edge issues on the research frontier.  While they may draw on existing literature, they are chiefly "think pieces", not reviews.  
<P>
The five issue papers anticipated include Poverty and Relative Income, Labour Supply, Dynamics Surrounding Families, Caregiving, and a Methodology Paper: 
<P>
<STRONG>Poverty and Relative Income</STRONG>
<P>
Dr. David Cheal, Professor at the University of Winnipeg and Research Fellow with CPRN since September 1995, is writing the issue paper on Poverty and Relative Income.  The focus here is whether family members share access to resources and the impacts of different patterns of sharing and non-sharing on families and individuals in them.  Both of these issues must be examined with regard to the relationship of money and time, since family members may be poor not only on one of these indices, but both.
<P>
<STRONG>Labour Market Attachment</STRONG>
<P>
This paper will explore the characteristics of families' transactions regarding the labour market, examining both families with stable employment and those faced with employment disruption such as a job loss or changes to non-standard work.  It will ask about the dynamics within and across different families, including how time and money are allocated.  These decisions may include varying expenditure patterns, use of savings, strategies for investments, and pooling of time.  How do these dynamics affect the capacity of individual family members to retain labour market status or to amplify skills?  What meaning do families attach to these dynamics?  What are the costs and benefits of different family strategies?  What sort of policies would make families better able to adapt and cope?
<P>
<STRONG>Dynamics Surrounding Children</STRONG>
<P>
Both private family and collective responsibility for families need to be examined, particularly in light of renewed discussion of a targeted child benefit.  Can we articulate the needs of children without assuming an atomized, defamilized child?  How can the state respond unless it acknowledges that the poverty of children is also the poverty of their parents? In terms of conceptualizing intergenera-tional conflict, is it the middle generation that is in conflict with others, not seniors and youth in conflict with one another? Are dynamics asymme-trical over time in that families construct a quid pro quo of benefits?  For example, will families pick up the difference as state support for higher education disappears?  Will adult members trade off their RRSPs in order to invest in children's education?
<P>
<STRONG>Caregiving</STRONG>
<P>
The focus here is not just on seniors, but special caregiving needs more broadly, including individuals with disabilities and medically fragile children.  A key question is: "How do investments in caregiving affect other areas of family dynamics and investments?" While this may not be addressed by existing literature, it is critical to think conceptually about this question and to define the research frontier. We need to ask about how to address  the tax treatment of caregiving costs and responsibilities.  This work will draw on existing studies at other institutes, including the Carnet Network at the U of T and the Roeher Institute. 
<P>
<STRONG>Methodology Paper</STRONG>
<P>
The methodological issues of studying transactions, including the comparative advantages of qualitative and quantitative approaches, will be outlined.  This paper will suggest how to make best use of ongoing surveys, but also suggest the rich advantages of qualitative work.  It is clear there is a policy advantage in representative information, but the majority of surveys provide information only at a particular point in time. 
<P>
<STRONG>Interview Study of Labour Supply and Family Resiliency</STRONG>
<P>
This study involves a rich qualitative look at the kinds of transactions undertaken by families that may buffer labour market disruptions and offer a foundation for greater resiliency.
<P>
M-J Wason, the principal investigator and a CPRN Research Associate, will be looking at families in a single community, including interviews with individual family members, family focus groups, and groups with families in different relationships to the labour market.
<P>
The work is exploratory in nature, focused on identifying the different transactions and dynamics that make it possible for families to be resilient, both in participating in the labour market and in achieving well-being, despite increasing economic and policy uncertainty.   
<P>
This study will build a base line to inform the 1998 General Social Survey and other later work.  It will be sensitive to differences between common-law and legal families, blended families, and step families.  Exploring these different family arrangements will offer a view of heterogeneous family dynamics and our first understanding of the ways families "transact", including the ways in which these dynamics affect the life chances of individual family members.  
<P>
The study will offer rich ideas for what researchers may want to do when data become available from the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics.
<P>
<STRONG>Review and Editorial Process</STRONG>
<P>
CPRN has developed review guidelines and a review process for all three networks, to ensure the highest quality work.  Network Directors  will be soliciting the assistance of external reviewers to read and comment on all papers before publication.  These reviews will then be considered by the Editorial Committee of each Network, including CPRN's President, the Network Director, one CPRN external Board member, and two external members.

Inc.</h2></center><br>JUNE, 
1995<p><h3>Introducing CPRN</h3>by Judith Maxwell<p>I am pleased to open 
this third newsletter of the Family Network with a real sense of 
momentum.  The Family Network is now securely attached to the CPRN 
(Canadian Policy Research Networks, Inc.), founded in February 1995.  The 
CPRN is a new national non-profit organization designed with two 
objectives in mind.  First, it will undertake original policy research 
that would not otherwise be done in Canada because of its size, 
complexity, innovation, and multi-disciplinarity.  Second, it will build 
communication between front-line practitioners, researchers, and policy 
advisors to governments.<p>The times demand both creativity and 
cost-effectiveness in research that cuts across disciplines, sectors and 
jurisdictions.  The CPRN responds to this need by:<p><li>pooling the 
energies of researchers from different disciplines and institutions.<p> 
<li>creating a level playing field where the contributions of 
researchers, policy advisers, and other key stakeholders will be 
respected,<p><li>building real bridges between creative professionals and 
policy makers in search of practical solutions, and,<li>capitalizing on 
the scope for cost-effective research through strategic alliances with 
funders and research organizations.<p><i>Governance</i><p>The CPRN is a 
not-for-profit corporation with a Board of Directors representing key 
funders, scholars and social groups.  The coordinating office is based in 
Ottawa.  Each Network is led by a Research Director and guided by a 
Steering Committee composed of funders, scholars and experts from the 
private sector.<p>The coordinating and networking costs are funded by a 
group of six federal government departments and agencies under a five 
year contribution agreement.  Direct research costs will be funded on a 
project-specific basis, once the Steering Committee and other interested 
parties have agreed on the research priorities.  The project specific 
funding will come from provincial and federal departments and agencies, 
and foundations and corporations in the private sector.<p><br>The 
research agenda will be circulated widely in order to encourage broad 
participation by scholars and funders.  Where necessary, a request for 
proposals will be advertised in order to solicit proposals for review by 
the Research Director and the Steering 
Committee.<p><i>Networking</i><p>Each Network will operate through 
Internet, creating a shared electronic workspace for the researchers to 
interact on a daily basis.  A bulletin board will be established where 
researchers can establish their credentials by posting their vita in the 
area of interest to the Network.  Researchers or funders seeking 
information on a particular topic can post questions.  Newsletters and 
work in progress will be posted to share information on the agenda.  
Research results will also be circulated. Participants have the option to 
engage as a listener or as an active contributor to the research 
process.<p>Each Network will hold workshops of core researchers and their 
peers about twice a year.  Research design will be assessed and 
validated, research priorities will be argued, and work in progress will 
be presented for validation.<p>Each Network will be searching for one or 
more Research Fellows -- scholars with a strong track record pertinent to 
the current agenda of the Network.  Research Fellows will be invited to 
participate in the deliberations of the Steering Committee, act as a 
mentor for the program, supervise graduate students working in the area, 
and contribute his\her own research.<p>The Networks will publish their 
results electronically and in hard copy in order to make them accessible 
to the research community and to a broader public audience.  The 
publications will include Newsletters, Working Papers, and an Annual 
Report of the CPRN.  The President and the Research Directors will also 
present the results to key audiences across Canada.<p><p><i>Research 
Plans</i><p>The Family Network is directed by Suzanne Peters, President 
of the Policy Research Group in Toronto (speters@the-wire.com).  The 
research agenda discussed later in this newsletter has been developed 
through extensive discussions with researchers and policy makers, 
including two workshops held in 1994 and 1995.<p>The first Project in the 
Work Network is focused on Training.   It is directed by Gordon 
Betcherman, Executive Director of the Human Resources Group at Ekos 
Research Associates in Ottawa.  This project is organized in two Blocks.  
Block 1 is examining the shifts in occupational skill structure of 
employment, with special emphasis on the skill content of jobs, 
technological change, the location of jobs, and youth employment.  Block 
2 will assess what kind of training works and for whom.  It is based on a 
national survey which will link firms and employees.  The survey will be 
supplemented with related case studies.  Future project interests 
include: 1) worker adjustment in the public sector, and 2) the impact of 
globalization on work.<p>The Health Network, which is still in early 
stages of development, will be directed by Marcus Hollander, who will be 
based in Victoria, British Columbia.  The agenda will develop from the 
following areas of specialization:  tools for analyzing the 
cost-effectiveness of health services (derived from the <a 
href="#1">Sustainable Health Care for Canada</a> project); evaluation of 
new systems of governance in the Canadian health care system -- with a 
special focus on regionalization;  and building a capacity to measure 
costs of continuing care -- with a special focus on home care and 
informal care.  CPRN is also the coordinating agency for economic 
research on HIV\AIDS, on behalf of Health Canada.<p>CPRN will consider 
adding other Networks to the portfolio should the demand 
arise.<p>Financial support is being provided by:<p><li>Federal 
departments and agencies including:  Human Resources Development, Health 
Canada, Citizenship and Immigration, Transport Canada, Fisheries and 
Oceans, and the Canadian International Development 
Agency.<p><li>Provincial departments and agencies in Ontario, British 
Columbia, Saskatchewan, and New Brunswick.<p><li>Private funding will be 
solicited in 1995 and onwards from foundations and corporations who share 
CPRN's interest in ensuring that Canadians are well informed about the 
social dimensions of economic change.<p><center><h3>Milestones for the

<p><table border=1><tr><td>The Family Network is 
pleased to announce two exciting new projects:<p><b>A Study of Sole 
Support Mothers on Social Assistance in Ontario</b><p>Sole support 
mothers are the group most likely to face barriers to employment. The 
objectives of this project are to identify those barriers and suggest 
solutions for the reform of programs and policies. The project involves 
focus groups with sole support mothers in three Ontario communities, 
including those who either receive Family Benefits, participate in 
JobLink Training, or are currently employed. Front line service providers 
working with these women will also be canvassed. Links to quantitative 
data from a client survey will be explored. The Principal Investigators 
are Marion Lynn at Trent University and Milana Todoroff at York 
University. Project Advisors are Martin Dooley at McMaster University and 
Pat Evans at York University. The project is being undertaken on contract 
with the Ontario Ministry of Community and Social Services.<p><b>The 
Canada Health and Social Transfer: Building New Foundations for 
Well-Being</b><p>With the introduction of Bill C-76, Canadians entered a 
debate that is likely to reshape our sense of ourselves and our nation. 
The Family Network has initiated a project to inform the process as 
federal and provincial governments consider the implications of a new 
block transfer to cover health, social programs, and education. The 
urgency of articulating the core commitments of Canadians - what they 
hold dear, what tradeoffs and sacrifices they are willing to make, and 
what they see as an achievable optimal level of well-being -- has never 
been greater. Nor has the creation of social indicators which can help to 
assess impacts and achieve these commitments ever been more relevant. In 
that context, this project works on three prongs, including: a) a review 
of public opinion poll data over the last fifteen years, b) focus groups 
across Canada, and c) a review of potential social indicators. The Family 
Network is commissioning relevant tasks to academic researchers and 
organizations with particular expertise to complete this project within 
very tight deadlines. The project is advised by members of the Network 
and funders, including provincial and federal governments and private 
foundations.</td></tr></table><h3>Background Rationale for Studying 
Transactions</h3><i>(This is an edited text from a paper, Family 
Transactions: A Conceptual Framework prepared for HRDC)</i><p><i>by 
Suzanne Peters</i><p>The search for a new conceptual framework for 
studying families stems from four interwoven phenomena.  These include: 
1) recent changes in the social, economic, and political environment in 
which families operate, 2) recent changes in the structure and activities 
undertaken by families, 3) recent theoretical shifts in sociology and 
economics, and 4) recent demands for more policy relevant 
research.<p><i>First</i>, socio-economic changes including new 
technologies, economic restructuring, urban development, the creation of 
a multi-ethnic society, rising crime rates, the feminist movement, 
emerging children's rights, and other facets of contemporary society have 
had important impacts on families.  As a consequence, we live in a 
society in which our myths stand in sharp contrast to family realities.  
Eighty-seven percent of Canadians see themselves as living in some kind 
of family structure, but most of us live in families very different from 
the ones we grew up in.  We need a conceptual framework that can 
recognize and untangle the impacts of these complex environmental changes 
on families.<p><i>Second</i>, changes in family structure and activities 
point to a gap in our current conceptual apparatus.  Change in family 
structure, perhaps the most well-documented area of family information 
today, still leaves open many questions. We know, for instance, that the 
proportion of traditional nuclear families has declined to 16 percent in 
Canada, that dual earner families have risen to 54 percent, and that sole 
support parent families now make up a significant minority at 13 percent 
of all families in Canada.  Within these broad patterns, our 
understanding has little texture and depth.  We do not know, for 
instance, about the actual economic and caring arrangements that take 
place in families in the face of new structures.  We lack information on 
the changed employment circumstances of families in the face of economic 
restructuring (particularly the adaptation to non-standard jobs), on the 
ways they cope with unemployment, on how they manage on social 
assistance, and on how custodial and non-custodial households organize 
child rearing responsibilities.<p><i>Third</i>, pent-up frustration about 
the current state of theory in family studies also underpins the search 
for a new conceptual <a href="#2">framework.</a>  For the most part, 
traditional perspectives in economics, sociology, and other disciplines 
have treated the family as a unified whole.  These perspectives see the 
family as a simple, cohesive unit, rather than in terms of the interwoven 
agency of particular family members.  As such, these perspectives have 
been limited in their capacity to capture family dynamics. Today, 
building on recent feminist scholarship and an emerging collectivist 
perspective within mainstream economics, the "black box" of families has 
been opened to reveal new areas of inquiry.<p>A new generation of models 
has emerged which explore: 1) how individual family members negotiate 
differences in resources, 2) how external social factors related to 
status, education, income, and power have the potential to shape these 
negotiations, and 3) how outcomes differ for family members, including 
differences for age groups and genders, depending on the course of these 
transactions.  A full conceptual framework on family transactions must 
also broaden its questions to ask: 4) how children and elders act as 
independent agents in household negotiations, 5) how transactions across 
different households shape total family well-being, and 6) how 
transactions in particular "at risk" groups compare to population norms.  
While barriers persist in the data and human resources to achieve this 
research agenda, new intellectual perspectives are engaged in finding 
ways to explore these questions.<p><i>Fourth</i>, the rationale for a 
transactions approach to studying families rests on its capacity to 
inform policy development and policy decisions.  Transactions are 
interesting to policy makers because, on the one hand, they may be 
influenced by policies, and on the other hand, their outcomes may 
generate demands for social policy and program interventions.  Social 
policy may be able to create an environment which promotes equitable 
transactions within families that would support the autonomy and 
diversity of families and individuals within families across Canada. The 
issue is to identify which transactions are relevant to Canadian social 
policy in this way.<p>A transactions approach aids in identification of 
policy issues in three respects:<p>1)the development of new policy 
criteria,<br>2)the provision of information for particular kinds of 
policy decisions, and<br>3)the creation of a system of national social 
accounts.<p><i>Policy criteria</i><br>A transactions approach supports 
the development of new policy criteria by revealing the impacts of 
policies on individuals within and in relation to families. In terms of 
general policy criteria, conventional approaches and data are generally 
adequate for the purposes of addressing the family as a cohesive unit.  
That is, they offer information about the relative income of different 
families under different policy regimes.  These data do not, however, 
resolve questions about the impacts of policies on the distribution of 
state resources within families, the efficiency of policy in reaching 
particular target groups, the adaptability of policy to different kinds 
of family circumstances, the effects of policies on social solidarity in 
families, and the ability of policy to support broad social replacement 
in families. By taking the agency and individuality of each family member 
into account, the transactions approach garners information to inform 
criteria related to individual equity, effectiveness, flexibility, 
adaptability, and other issues related to how policies affect the lives 
of individuals in relation to families.<p><i>Policy initiatives</i><br>A 
transactions approach has the potential to inform new kinds of policy 
initiatives. These include initiatives related to inter-generational 
equity, the best interests of children, child support guidelines 
(particularly its taxation), child development, the availability of 
social assistance benefits to youth no longer living at home, support for 
individuals with disabilities in families, and others.<p><i>Towards 
social accounts</i></br>Finally, a transactions approach can help 
establish a foundation for a system of National Social Accounts in 
Canada.  As the supposedly linear relationship between economic 
"progress" and well-being is increasingly questioned - in light of 
declining security, labour market polarization, diminishing real incomes, 
disappearing community structures, and emerging boundaries between have 
and have-not individuals and nations - a search has been initiated for an 
acceptable set of social indicators.<p>Seen as complementary to 
traditional measures of productivity, these social indicators have the 
potential to inform analysis of the tradeoffs in economic and social 
policy and to lay the groundwork for new international agreements with 
regard to trade, financial flows of capital, and labour market standards. 
This was a fundamental concern at the Copenhagen social summit, and is 
likely to recur as governments seek ways to understand the wider 
ramifications of global economic restructuring. A transactions approach 
creates knowledge about the value of private, non-market activities, 
conceptualized in language parallel to that used in economic accounting 
systems.  An integrated socio-economic accounting system could consider 
both market and non-market activities, examine both production and 
consumption, assess paid and unpaid time as inputs, and identify 
commodities not only in terms of manufactured goods and market services, 
but also in terms of non-market production. In conceptualizing a 
transactions approach, the goal is not only to understand the family and 
its particular dynamics, but to consider the implications of this 
approach from a broad socio-economic perspective.<p>As the Network 
undertakes the study of the social and economic dynamics of families, 
efforts to foster a transactions approach will be embedded within 
and complement other approaches taken to the issue.  As will be seen 
below, this includes the use of existing and new longitudinal data 
sources, but also the attempt to stimulate the collection of data which 
focuses on the ways in which individuals in families undertake 
transactions.<p><h3>Research Agenda: Economic and Social Dynamics of 
Families</h3><b>Overview</b><p>The major focus of the Network in coming 
years will be the examination of the social and economic dynamics of 
families.  The Network will characterize the determinants of families' 
strengths and weaknesses, and their impacts on the health and well-being 
of individual members.  We will explore the coping strategies and 
mechanisms by which families demonstrate the resiliency to "bounce back" 
in difficult circumstances, the ways in which public policies can best 
support these adaptations, and the impacts of these changes on women, 
men, children, and more extended kin.<p>The Network is particularly 
interested in contributing to our understanding of how sole support 
families, low wage families, minority families, and other marginalized 
families cope with the difficulties imposed by the current 
social-economic environment; and to discover how public policies can help 
to buffer the negative impacts of these changes on families and 
individuals.  Most broadly, the Network wants to explore how the 
activities of families may lay the foundation for social 
cohesion/fragmentation, inclusion/exclusion, and 
democratization/restriction in Canadian society.<p>To achieve this, the 
Network wants to complement studies of changes in overall family 
structures and incomes with research on transactions and activities 
taking place in families.  Studying these transactions opens up the 
"black box" of the family, expanding the focus of research from the 
family as a closed unit to the complexity of family interactions and 
their impacts on individual family members.<p>For this purpose, 
transactions are defined as the transfer of resources among individuals 
to meet needs.  These transfers may involve money, advice, household 
help, emotional caring, and other formal and informal ways by which 
individuals may support one another.  The concern will be on both family 
transactions within households, and where appropriate, among households, 
including inter-generational, custodial/noncustodial, and other cases 
where important family transfers may take place.  The broad objective is 
to understand the role played by these private, non-market transfers in 
underpinning our economy and fostering well-being of our citizens.<p>In 
conceptualizing transactions, the approach is socio-ecological.  
Transactions do not occur in isolation, but in response to the 
availability of external resources mediated by changes in the economy and 
society.  A preliminary conceptual paper framing these issues has been 
funded on contract from Human Resources Development Canada and is 
available from the Network.<p>From this starting point, and others, the 
Network will undertake a series of methodologically diverse studies.  The 
research explores the adaptations taking place in families under a series 
of restructuring conditions.  This research is envisioned within three 
broad themes: 1) family restructuring, 2) economic restructuring, and 3) 
public policy restructuring.  The first theme, family restructuring, is 
focused on the changing nature of roles, social relationships, and 
expectations in our society as they affect families.  The second theme, 
economic restructuring, is focused on how the changing nature of work 
affects families, including unemployment, precarious employment, and 
polarization in the labour market. The third theme, impacts of public 
policies, is focused on changes in the availability and mix of federal, 
provincial, and municipal policies as they affect families' strengths, 
weaknesses and overall resiliency in difficult circumstances.<p>The 
Network is concerned to undertake original projects rather than to update 
or expand upon existing studies.  For this reason, we anticipate 
commissioning several conceptual papers during our first year of 
operation in order to build the foundation for future projects which will 
be empirical or applied policy analysis. The work will be organized in 
four overlapping stages as illustrated by the following pyramid.  Each is 
described in greater detail in ensuing sections Information on the 
process of project selection and direction as well as contact numbers for 
participation in the Network can be found below. <p><b>Chart 1: Research

<h2> FAMILY RESEARCHERS NETWORK NEWSLETTER</h2>
JULY, 1994
<p>
<i>By Judith Maxwell</i><p>
 In the ten months since Newsletter Number 1, the
 Network has attracted more researchers and policy analysts, and,
thanks to an excellent workshop in Calgary on June 9, 1994, a
research agenda has begun to take shape.<p>

This Newsletter reports on the Calgary workshop and sets out next steps in 
formalizing
the Network. By now you should have received a copy of Suzanne
Peters' Discussion Paper, &quot;Reframing Family Policy Research,&quot;
used as background for the workshop. (If you have not, and would
like one, just call.)<p>

What emerged from Calgary was a rich array
of ideas and the first steps in building new relationships that
cross disciplines and institutions. There was also a strong sense
that new research on the family has the potential to meet the
needs of federal and provincial policy makers: the need for better
base-line data; and the need for more insights into the coping
strategies of families. How do families manage in times of stress?
How do they respond to support systems in the community and in
the tax transfer system? Within the family, who is transacting
with whom and about what?
<p>
In order to move the Family Network forward,
Suzanne Peters is mapping the potential agenda (set out below)
and it will be discussed at further workshops in Ottawa in July,
and in several provinces in the fall.
<p>
I would like to acknowledge
financial support for the Discussion Paper and for the workshop,
given by the J.W. McConnell Family Foundation and Human Resources
Development Canada.<p>

<h3>Characteristics of a Network</h3>
The Network could
develop in two ways. The first would be fairly informal and low-key,
creating opportunities for exchange across disciplines and encouraging
synergies between projects. The second would be more ambitious
and would involve special funding for a specific, policy-driven
research agenda for a two to three year period. At this stage,
we are striving for the more ambitious option, with the informal
option as a fall-back position.<p>

The key ingredients for a successful
Network are: good people, complementarity of skills and belief
systems, inclusiveness, mechanisms for sharing information (including
regular face-to-face meetings), coordination, and a commitment
to a common agenda.<p>
<ul>
<li>Good people will be prepared to make a commitment
if they believe the Network is sustainable and if there is clear
evidence that their own research will be enriched.  
<li>Complementarity
is essential to provoke debate and ensure that the various disciplines
can learn from each other's models and methodologies. There was
a strong sense, for example, that both sociology and economics
have created baseline knowledge on the family which can be mined
to support work in the other discipline.  
<li>Inclusiveness is intended
to create room for all researchers and policy makers with an interest
in the family. Anyone can join to be part of the grapevine, as
long as they are prepared to share information. Some will be active
as advisers and to do peer review. Still others will be actively
engaged in research linked directly to Network activity. Over
time, people will probably move from one category to another.
The active researchers may work in clusters or as part of a larger
team.  
<li>Mechanisms for sharing information will include Email,
this Newsletter (which should become more frequent), sharing of
vitaes on the family, and workshops at regular intervals. Other
possibilities include a bulletin board and a series of working
papers. 
<li>Coordination will be done through my office, assuming
that we can raise the necessary funds. 
<li>Commitment to a common
agenda is part of the more ambitious vision of the Network. It
would make the research problem-driven - directly focused on deliverables
which will inform policy. Some deliverables may be relatively
short-term, but there is a strong interest in longer-range data
development.
</ul>
Until the research agenda has been tested in dialogue
with researchers and with the policy community, we can only speculate
on the size and scope of the work of the Network.
<p>
Funding for the
research would probably be done in layers, building on the capacity
of the researchers to qualify for grants and to make use of their
own research time. If there is a strong policy interest, there
should be scope for project-specific funding from federal, provincial
and private sources. Ideally, the Network should have some core
support for a period of five years, so that it can sustain the
activity between projects, and give the participants an incentive
to invest for the longer term.

<h3>A Research Agenda on the Family</h3>
<i>by Suzanne Peters</i><p>
The Calgary workshop offered an
important opportunity to expand the scope of inquiry and to sharpen
questions raised in the initial discussion paper. The following
notes cluster these ideas around five central themes. In each
case, description of the key issue is followed by a brief synopsis
of a proposed research strategy and of the potential policy implications
of the research.
<p>
This proposed agenda reflects an overall consensus
among workshop participants that dynamic, longitudinal quantita-tive
survey data should be complemented by qualitative in-depth interviews
and case studies. In this spirit, these clusters are intended
to include not only discrete central projects which would unfold
under the aegis of the Network, but also ancillary work which
could be undertaken by its members.
<p>
Over an initial five-year span,
projects would be staged to meet both short- and long-term objectives.
Follow-up and development of projects in the longer term would
also be critical. 
<p>
<h3>1. Definitions of Family</h3> 
<i>Issues:</i> The discussion
paper identified a number of limitations in how current statistical
research defines family membership and classifies family types.
Workshop participants agreed on the need to put some concerted
effort into generating a better conceptual and methodological
schema for identifying family membership and its implications.
<p>
The consensus was that the Network would need to develop definitions
for different purposes which could be used consistently across
a range of projects and disciplines. Rather than family structures,
the emphasis would be on those behaviours demonstrated in a particular
kind of family relationship. For example, the definition of family
behaviours to be captured in studying child care might be different
than that used to study elder care, but it was important that
researchers in each independent interest area employ similar definitions.
It also was seen as important to achieve congruence across study
areas in order that the family arrangements in one study area
could be understood in relation to others.
<p> 
<i>Research Strategy:</i>
To achieve this, workshop participants pointed to the need to
take an inductive approach through a one-time survey which could
help to identify the ways in which different individuals participate
in families. By taking the individual as the starting point, it
should be possible to construct an analysis of the different family
arrangements in which an individual participates. <p>
<i>Thus, rather
than beginning with structural a priori categories based on residence,
kin ties, or other definitions which treat inclusion in the family
as an either/or nominal variable, this strategy opens up the possibility
of treating &quot;family&quot; as an interval variable.</i> That is,
one can identify variations in the intensity of family inter-action
depending on the nature and range of inter-actions surrounding
a particular &quot;family&quot; behaviour, for instance parenting.
<p>
From
this one could construct a measure of the &quot;degree of family
intensity.&quot; Again, using parenting behaviour as an example,
this would allow one to ask about: a) a range of parenting behaviours,
including component parts such as economic, time, emotional, and
other dimensions; b) intensities of each behaviour; c) how these
behaviours are organized within and across households (including
not only custodial and non-custodial households), but others;
d) how these behaviours are organized among kin and non-kin; and
e) other related elements.
<p>
This one-time survey would be used to
capture the chief family behaviours and their frequencies across
and within households which include kin and non-kin ties, for
instance:<br>
<ul>parenting<br>    
extended child care<br>    
<br>altruism    
<br>elderly care    
<br>economic transfers within generations    
<br>economic transfers across generations 
</ul>
<p>
A one-time survey of this type would permit
the Network to &quot;clear the underbrush&quot; of definitional
inconsistencies, and offer powerful data on the different kinds
of familial arrangements engaged in by Canadians and their intensity.
<p>
It would also allow a potential range of most typical family patterns
to be identified, to be used both to construct categories for
later longitudinal research and to inform the approach to be taken
within more in-depth and case study analysis. 
<p>
<i>Policy Implications:</i>
The chief objective of this first step would be to create the
basis for a wide range of ensuing studies. At the same time, it
would have the capacity to inform policy decisions related to
custody and access, child support, income support, health home
care services, and other program areas.<p>

<h3>2. Transactions Within</h3>

<i>Families  Issues:</i> Building on knowledge related to the patterns
by which individuals organize their money, time, and social capital
in a variety of &quot;family arrangements,&quot; a second cluster
of projects would examine how these transactions vary over time,
both within and across households, and their corresponding impacts.
In this sense, a set of projects on familial transactions would
allow for the density of family relationships as &quot;inputs&quot;
to be examined in relation to their later &quot;outputs&quot;
in terms of costs and benefits on different family members. 
<p>
This would involve building on the collective and non-cooperative models
of households in order to understand the impacts of different
patterns of expenditure/ consumption and decision-making in different
familial arrangements across different densities. 
<p>
<i>Research Strategies:</i>
A set of projects on transactions of this kind would involve longitudinal
analysis of the relative duration of transactions, a better understanding
of the contents of those transactions, identification of the parties
with whom they take place, their variation over time, and the
relative benefit of different forms of transaction to different
family members.<p>

The analysis would need to include specific reference
to income, source of income, labour force, occupational, and other
variables (inputs) which could potentially explain different forms
of family organization and intensity (outcomes). 
<p>
The assessment
of outcomes would need to incorporate a range of personal variables
related to the potential costs and benefits of different forms
of family organization and intensity on different family members,
especially women and children. This would require a sensitive
exploration of time allocation as both a quantitative and qualitative
variable in light of income and other factors. Outcomes for children
would need to go beyond traditional measures of school grades
to include other age-appropriate measures. 
<p>
At the same time, a
number of related case studies would need to be conceptualized
to expand the analysis of processes surrounding family transactions
and their impacts, including studies which examine patterns of
communication, decision-making, religiosity, and other value orientations.
<p>
This offers an important focus on emerging and changing components
of family organization and intensity over time, including impacts
of second and ensuing births, divorce and separation, death, different
custody arrangements, new caring demands for children, responsibilities
for disabled and elderly, mobility and distance from extended
kin, and others. <p>
<i>Policy Implications:</i> The research would inform
a wide range of policy decisions related to custody and access,
child support, income support, health home care services, same
sex family benefits, and others.<p>

<h3>3. Impact of Economic Restructuring</h3>

<i>Issues:</i> Research to explore the reorganization of family behaviours
in relation to changed circumstances, including labour force entry
and departure, especially involuntary unemployment and social
assistance entry; the changing working environment, including
lower wages, fewer benefits, increased part-time work, increased
self-employment, evolution of home-based work, increased service
employment, and other aspects of the contingent work environment.<p>

This cluster would ask questions surrounding who bears the short-term
costs of restructuring; what are its long-term consequences; which
families by age, family status, income, occupation, etc., are
most affected; how families make strategic investments in training,
household care, and labour market participation to avoid or minimize
risk; how families construct coping strategies to buffer the impacts
of negative changes, including changing consumption/expenditure
patterns, debt, caring arrangements, etc; how families demonstrate
resiliency in adverse circumstances; the consequences of family
adaptations on the long-term well-being of different family members,
especially children.<p>

<i>Research Strategies:</i> Needs a survey over-sampling
the population affected by current labour market changes. Case
studies are required to explore the ways individuals and family
organization/intensities respond to changing income and employment
opportunities. Requires a focus on vulnerable groups: younger
population, special needs, including disability. <p>

<i>Policy Questions:</i>
Unemployment insurance levels and eligibility; benefits for part-time
work; wage and benefit controls; social assistance eligibility
and supplementary benefits; income and other support for minimum
wage workers; child care subsidies in job search and training;
apprenticeship and job entry programs; health insurance, transportation,
clothing allowance, budget management, parenting information,
and other specific supports for low-income earners, including
unemployed and disabled workers; head-start and other enrichment
programs; in-home care and home visiting programs for vulnerable
mothers and children.<p>

<h3>4. Responses to Government Programs</h3>
<i>Issues:</i>
Research to examine the reorganization of family behaviours and
intensities across different policy regimes, including: a) changes
at the federal and provincial levels over time; and b) variations
in response to different provincial/local policies and programs.
<p>
Not just income adjustments and consumption responses, but emphasis
on responsibilities and relationships, and how these interact
with income, home care, and other supports available to families.
<p>
<i>Research Strategies:</i> Builds upon existing cross-sectional work
on poverty and income dynamics.  Could offer new power through
longitudinal research on the impacts of programs and interventions
over time, could capitalize on ongoing evaluation studies and
offer a strategy to create baselines and sharpen comparative outcome
measures. Case studies would explore the awareness and sensitivity
of recipients to changing policy and program criteria and levels.
<p>
<i>Policy Questions:</i> Examines the impacts of divorce property and
income regimes, income assistance, child support, taxation, child
care, pension, and other policies. Case study evidence can reveal
the dynamics of decisions and the optimal channels to encourage
decisions which achieve long-term benefits.<p>

<h3>5. Influence of Culture and Community</h3> 
<i>Issues:</i> The research cluster would explore the influence
of cultural and community circumstances on the organization of
family behaviours, transactions, and intensities; how do decisions
related to training, labour market participation, household caring,
and other elements of transaction and investment vary by these
social, cultural and other conditions; what resources do individuals
and families require to make optimal investments and avoid risk.
<p>
<i>Research Strategies:</i> Requires either over-sampling or case-study
development across a range of cultural, ethnic, racial, disability,
or other minority groups. <p>

<i>Policy Questions:</i> In offering a focus
on the micro cultures of particular families, this research offers
a path to providing appropriate, flexible and useful supports
specific to cultural, religious and other value orientations.
Addresses questions related to individualized funding and accessibility
requirements.

<td align=top> <center><h2>A CPRN Discussion Group</h2></center>
CPRN welcomes members and friends of all networks to use this listserv as a means of discussing policy research approaches, identifying new issues, announcing events or publications, asking for references or related work, and engaging debate on issues related to the research programs of our three networks or related projects.  If you wish to participate, please fill out the registration form, below. Initially, we will have one site for all contributors, but before long we will break into one site for each network.
<p>
We hope you'll find this discussion site a useful vehicle to get-up-to-date on issues and events related to policy, meet potential colleagues, and generate the synergies by which we can all do better work. This site is expected to be primarily of interest to policy makers, academics, and front line practitioners who want to explore issues related to work, health, and family, but others are welcome to contribute. However, postings not relevant to these general objectives will be screened out by the list moderators. Please return to our homepage in order to get a better idea of the mission and mandate of CPRN and the research programs underway in each of the networks. 
<p>
The discussion group will be in the form of a "moderated listserv". That is, all participants will need to apply for inclusion in the group and all mail should be sent to "mbeebe@islandnet.com" (without the quotes) and the list maintainer will then send your comment to the list for distribution to all subscribers. In this way, the discussion will only be viewed by subscribers.
<P>
First, a few general guidelines/rules.
<p>
1) ALWAYS put your name and e-mail address at the end of every posting. It is important that people be able to contact you privately if they wish, and  some mail systems do not identify the writer anywhere in the header. 
<p>
2) Please include a meaningful subject heading, so that people will know whether your message deals with a topic of interest to them.
<p>
3) If you are replying to someone else's posting, briefly quote or summarize that posting before you offer your reply. Doing so will make your message clearer and avoid confusion, especially for new subscribers who may not have read the original message. Since a number of topics are likely to be discussed on the list at any given moment, even long-time subscribers may not remember what prompted your remarks unless you remind them. 
<p>
4) Most importantly, please treat the ideas and efforts of others with respect. We should all expect to encounter individuals whose ideas vary from our own.  This is to be expected when dealing with people whose life experiences vary widely. Debate on issues is welcome here, but not diatribe or attack. 
<p>
5) Be conservative with your quotes. Quote only text from earlier messages, which is required to put your own message in context. This will make your own  message easier to read. Please avoid messages which require the reader to wade through old text in a search for the new material.

<h2>Introducing the Work Network</h2>
</center>

<P>
The objective of the Work Network is to undertake original, high-quality
research on major issues pertaining to work and employment.  Broad
areas of interest include labour market trends, human resource
management and industrial relations, and the nature of work.
<P>
The program for this Network starts with the assumption that work
and employment are changing in important ways.  A priority, then,
is to advance our understanding of these changes and what individuals,
employers, unions and other associations, and government can do
to increase the likelihood that all Canadians will benefit.
<P>
The core activity of the Work Network is high-quality research.
 The research function will include the following features:
<ul>
  <li> a program typically organized in projects on particular themes
that bring together an integrated body of analysis;

  <li> research themes selected on the basis of &quot;real-world&quot;
relevance, existing information gaps, and suitability to the &quot;network&quot;
format;

  <li> methodologies and researchers drawn from economics, human resource
management/industrial relations, and any other disciplines that
can make a contribution to the topics being researched; and

  <li> a strong empirical orientation, using quantitative and qualitative
data as required.
</ul>
<P>
Communications are also essential for the Network to achieve its
goals.  This communications role entails both the diffusion of
the research as well as a facility for engendering constructive
debate about its real-world implications.  The Network will aim
to engage researchers, the policy community, the &quot;stakeholders&quot;
in the world of work, and other parts of the interested public.
 This will require that the research is not only technically sound
but also that it is presented in an accessible fashion.
<P>
A fundamental principle of the Work Network is to complement rather
than compete with existing research initiatives in the field of
labour and employment.  Certainly, there are a number of institutions
(and researchers) around the country already making important
contributions.  Prominent examples include:
<ul>
  <li> academic research, including the associations such as the Canadian
Economics Association and the Canadian Industrial Relations Association;

  <li> the Canadian Employment Research Forum which provides a setting
for the discussion of applied employment research by the research
and policy communities, and the Canadian Workplace Research Network; and

  <li> other research organizations, for example, the C.D. Howe Institute,
the Institute for Research on Public Policy, and the Conference
Board that either undertake or sponsor labour market research.
</ul>
<P>
The distinction between the CPRN Work Network and the existing
research capacity is the Work Network's focus on developing and
undertaking large-scale projects where researchers around the
country are brought together to study selected issues that, together,
will result in an integrated and comprehensive body of analysis.
 This combination of large-scale projects, a focus on specific
themes, a purposeful and integrated research plan, a prominent
policy orientation, and an emphasis on accessibility define the
Work Network's uniqueness.
<p>

<strong>The Director</strong>
<P>
Gordon Betcherman is Director of the Work Network, Canadian Policy
Research Networks and Executive Director of the Human Resource
Group at Ekos Research Associates. Previously, he was a Senior
Fellow in the School of Industrial Relations, Queen's University
(1992 to 1994) and a Research Director at the Economic Council
of Canada (1987 to 1992). Dr. Betcherman is a Visiting Fellow
at the School of Policy Studies, Queen's University, a Director
of the Canadian Workplace Research Network, a member of the Statistics 
Canada Advisory Committee on Labour Statistics, and a Co-editor of

<P>
<h3>Network activities</h3>
<P>
Currently, the Work Network is engaged in a project on Training and a project on the Future of Work.
<P>
<b>The Training Project</b> was initiated because of the economic and
policy importance of training and the shortage of policy-relevant
Canadian research.  
It includes sponsorship from Human Resources
Development Canada, the Canadian Labour Force Development Board,
and provincial agencies from British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Ontario,
and New Brunswick.  The Project has an advisory committee with
representation from each of these funders as well as representatives
of business, labour, and the education sector, and experts drawn
from the research community.
The study includes two research blocks:
<ul>
  <li>The Changing Employment Structure
<P>
A critical question regarding training is &quot;training for what?&quot;
 This block addresses that question in focusing on how labour
demand is shifting.  There are four studies being undertaken:
 (1) the changing occupational and skill structure; (2) the skill
and employment effects of technological change; (3) the location
patterns of employment; and (4) youth employment.
<P>
  <li> Workplace Training
<P>
It is widely agreed that workplace training is becoming more important
both for the economic performance of business and for the labour
market prospects of individuals.  However, there are important
gaps in our knowledge of this training.  Using new data from surveys
and case studies, this block will generate original information
and analysis on training activities in the Canadian workplace,
the training decisions that employers and employees make, and
the impacts of training.
</ul>
     
The Training Project is in its final stage.  Reports are in the review process with expected 
publication of six working papers/studies and a synthesis report in the second half of 1996.<p>

<b>The Future of Work Project</b> examines the issue with particular attention on how globalization, technological change, and social change may be altering the meaning of work, the types of work, the nature of the employment contract, workplace and 
industrial relations models, and appropriate public policy responses.  The project is funded by Industry Canada.
<p>
A roundtable was held in April to discuss the future of work.  The discussion was initiated by an 
issues paper entitled <a href="futrwork.htm">The Future of Work</a> by Gordon Betcherman and 
Kathryn McMullen.
<p>
The final report will be published in the second half of 1996.

<center><h2>Future Research</h2></center>
<P>
In the upcoming months, the Work Network will focus on three goals.
 The first is the successful completion of the Training Project
and the release of the planned reports.
<P>
The second is the establishment of network &quot;institutions&quot;
to provide a stable framework for our work over the next number
of years.  One critical institution will be a steering committee
that will provide guidance, advice, and feedback on the network's
activities.  The reach of this committee will go beyond individual
projects to consider the longer-term direction of the network.
 Another important set of institutions to be developed involve
communication vehicles (verbal, electronic, and printed) that
will serve the network's needs for diffusing research and facilitating
debate.
<P>
The third goal is to develop the research agenda that will guide
the next generation of network activities.
<p>
<h3>Human Resources in Government</h3>
The restructuring imposed by fiscal restraint and the changing nature of government is forcing a 
fundamental rethinking of human resource strategies in public administration.
<p>
The project will address these core issues: the future skill requirements 
of public 
administration; the public sector workplace models that can meet the emerging demands for 
knowledge, service, and efficiency; and how the public sector labour market can adjust 
simultaneously to downsizing and renewal.
<p>
Contact <a href="mailto:glacelle.cprn@idrc.ca">glacelle.cprn@idrc.ca</a> for a copy of the 
proposal summary.
<p>
<h3>Globalization and the Canadian Labour Market</h3>
How is globalization affecting employment and what types of institutional
arrangements would best suit equity and efficiency objectives in a more
global environment?
<p>
<h3>Human Resource Issues in the Small Firm Sector</h3>
This study will examine job creation, job quality, and public issues associated with the 
small-firm sector in Canada.  The motivation is the evidence that small firms are accounting for 
an increasingly large share of total employment in Canada
<p> 
If you wish to participate in 
these new projects, please send your vita or a note about your interests to the Network Director,

</td><td align=top><CENTER><h3><a name="top_page"> Fewer</a> Job Opportunities for Unskilled Workers<br>As Computer Use Spread<br></h3><H4>Unskilled Workers Left Behind As Workplaces Go "High-tech"</H4>Ottawa, January 15, 1997 </center><P>
Computers are changing workplaces across the country, but they are creating winners and losers in the process.  In a Canadian Policy Research Networks Inc. (CPRN) study released today, hard survey evidence covering 15 years’ experience of computerization of Canadian businesses shows that unskilled workers are being left behind as workplaces go "high-tech". 
<P>
The report, <I>Skill and Employment Effects of Computer-Based Technology  - The Results of the Working with Technology - Survey III</I>, provides new evidence that computer systems are eliminating low-skilled jobs, concentrating new job opportunities in highly skilled technical areas, and that training opportunities are primarily for workers who are already highly skilled and relatively well paid.  
<P>
The Working with Technology Survey has been carried out three times and has now tracked the computerization of Canadian industry since the early 1980s.  It  has documented the steady increase in computer use through time.  The percentage of employees working with computers rose from 16 percent in the mid-1980s, to 37 percent in the early 1990s, to 43 percent in 1994.  As this figure has climbed, employment and the nature of work have been dramatically affected.             
<P>
Now that computer technologies have spread more deeply into workplaces, organizations are beginning to transform themselves around the technologies, says Kathryn McMullen, a research associate with CPRN and author of the study.  For some workers, that’s good news as their work becomes more challenging and as the demand for their skills increases.  For others, however, it’s bad news.  They lack the skills needed in these re-vamped workplaces and are seeing their positions eliminated.  
<P>
The survey shows that the types of jobs being created by the new technologies are predominantly in applied sciences and engineering.  The kinds of jobs being eliminated, however, are very different.  They are mostly semi-skilled and unskilled positions.  And, unlike the 1980s when office technology was rarely used by managers and professionals, the most recent evidence indicates that computers are a central part of working life for these groups and the result is a significant displacement of clerical workers.    
<P>
Many of the workers who are being displaced by the new technologies must shift to other industry sectors that still use workers with relatively few skills.  But, often this work is low-wage, part-time or temporary, and offers few of the benefits they had previously.
<P>
Whatever their skill level, those workers who remain after computerization are also seeing the skill   requirements for their jobs rise as a result of the new computer systems.  While most organizations reported providing training when putting computer technologies in place, that training tended to focus on the highly skilled employees.    
<P>
“As companies adapt to computer technologies and as workplaces are restructured in the process, employment opportunities for semi-skilled and unskilled workers are disappearing in many sectors,” says Judith Maxwell, president of CPRN.  “These kinds of workers are not being provided with the skills they need to move into the newly created positions.  This is one of the factors contributing to a growing gap between the haves and the have-nots in Canadian society.”
<P>
In addition to documenting these effects of computer-based technologies, the study identifies some of the policy implications.  “Clearly, in order to be able to compete for ‘good’ jobs, individuals need to be equipped with strong computer skills,” McMullen notes.  “But, for many, that means that literacy, numeracy, and communication skills must be strengthened first.”

</td><td align=top><CENTER><h3><a name="top_page">Skill</a> and Employment Effects of Computer Based Technologies</h3><H4>The Results of Working with Technology - Survey III</H4>Kathryn McMullen*</center><P>
The on-going spread of computer-based technologies over the past two decades is resulting in fundamental changes in the nature of work.  The Working with Technology Survey III (WWTS III) provides evidence that the more widespread use of computers in the workplace is affecting both the occupational composition of employment and the skill requirements of jobs.  The WWTS III collected information from a sample of 263 business establishments in Canada on the introduction and use of computer-based technologies over the 1992-94 period and on the occupational and skill impacts of those technologies.  
<P>
The survey was conducted twice previously, in 1985 and 1991.  It has documented the on-going spread of computer use across Canadian business establishments and the increasing intensity of use within establishments since the early 1980s.  Early applications consisted largely of the introduction of stand-alone technologies, creating “islands” of automation.  By the late 1980s, computer use had begun to shift to include higher proportions of data and communications networks.  In the earlier period, the greatest skill impacts were felt by clerical and secretarial workers; by the end of the decade, large impacts were felt by managerial and professional/technical employees.  
<P>
The intensity of computer use has increased steadily through time, rising from an establishment mean of 16 per cent of employees working with computers in 1985, to 37 per cent in 1991, to 43 per cent in 1994.  A process of skills upgrading within business establishments is occurring as a result of this intensification of computer use. 
<P>
Skills upgrading is evident in two ways.  The first is in terms of occupational upgrading.  The Working with Technology Survey asked respondents to identify any job-types that were either created or eliminated when computer-based technologies were put in place (including new, expanded and upgraded applications).  
<P>
Distinct patterns characterize the patterns of job-type creation and elimination <a href="mcmlchte.htm">(Figure 1)</a>.  Professional positions accounted for over half of the jobs that were created but for only 7 per cent of those that were eliminated.  That stands in sharp contrast to the situation for intermediate skill job-types, which accounted for 60 per cent of the job-types that were eliminated, but for only 11 per cent of those that were created.  With respect to occupation type, positions in the natural and applied sciences and engineering accounted for the great majority of positions created, with most of these consisting of positions for computer professional, technical, and managerial workers.  In contrast, just over half of the job-types that were eliminated consisted of clerical occupations, predominantly those requiring general office skills, office equipment operators, and finance and insurance clerks.
<P>
Upskillling is evident within jobs as well.  Respondents to the Working with Technology Survey provided estimates of the extent to which skills were changing on three dimensions   know-how, problem-solving and autonomy.  While all skill levels saw increases in skill requirements on all three dimensions, the increases were greatest for skills relating to technical know-how for professional and skilled technical workers.  Intermediate-level and unskilled workers also experienced some increase in skill requirements relating to problem-solving, which is consistent with the movement down the corporate hierarchy of decision-making responsibility.
<P>
Both effects the shift to higher-skilled occupations and increases in skill requirements were most pronounced in establishments that ranked high in terms of intensity of computer use.
<P>
While the majority of respondents reported providing training when putting computer-based technologies in place, the training tended to focus on software applications and skilled technical employees.  Other adjustment measures include hiring, employee transfers, and out-sourcing/contracting out.  Establishments experiencing large increases in skill requirements relating to know-how tended to use both hiring and employee transfers as a means of adjustment more than establishments reporting little change on this skill dimension.  
<P>
A key conclusion is that the on-going deepening of use of computer-based technologies within organizations is resulting in a transformation of the skills structure and in a widespread process of upskilling of jobs through both an occupational shift to high-skill jobs and an increase in skill requirements, especially for know-how, that is evident across the occupational spectrum.  As a result, employment opportunities are disappearing for intermediate and unskilled workers in many sectors, notably those that are intensive users of computer-based technologies. Further, unskilled workers are not being provided with the skills to move into the newly-created positions.  When introducing or expanding computer systems, employers focus on up-grading the skills of technical workers.  
<P>
That means the labour market will have to continue to absorb displaced workers who lack the skills and qualifications needed in a computer-based economy.  For many , that will mean a shift to other industry sectors that continue to employ large percentages of low-skill, and often, low-wage, workers.  But the Working with Technology Survey evidence suggests that even many of these jobs may disappear as traditionally low-wage sectors move toward greater use of computers in the workplace.  To definitively answer that question, a larger survey that is representative of the full industrial, regional, and size composition of Canadian business is needed.    
<P>
Last, in order to be able to compete for “good” jobs, individuals need to be equipped with strong computer skills.  For many, that means that literacy, numeracy, and communication skills must be strengthened first.

</td><td align=top><CENTER><h3><a name="top_page">Communication Breakdown Between Youth and Employers</a><br>Leads to High Unemployment</h3>Ottawa, January 18, 1997 </center><P>
Why is the jobless rate for Canadian youth so persistently high? This is the question posed by <I>Youth and Work in Troubled Times: A Report on Canada in the 1990s</I>, published today by the Canadian Policy Research Networks Inc. (CPRN).
<P>
"Young people are finding it harder than ever to find jobs that provide a decent income and entry into a career," says Richard Marquardt, an Ottawa-based researcher and author of the CPRN Working Paper W 01. "This is especially true of youth without postsecondary qualifications, but even these are no guarantee."
<P>
The research looks at what is happening to Canadian youth as they make their way into the job market. It addresses the current transition patterns from school to work, the labour market experiences of young people as they make these transitions, and brings into focus some key issues for policymakers.
<P>
"Prior to this study, the limited information available about the difficulties faced by youth as they leave school and enter the work force had been scattered across many sources," says Judith Maxwell, President of CPRN. "We felt that it was important to pull this information together. The employment experiences of youth reflect the changing structure of the labour market -- a labour market that is very different than it was a decade ago." 
<P>
The study indicates that there has been a substantial decline in traditional entry-level jobs in the goods-producing industries as well as in public administration, health and social services, and education. The major growth areas for young people have been in service industries. While some of these have been in managerial and professional occupations, many of them have been in sales and services -- predominantly part-time or temporary jobs, with low wages and few or no benefits.
<P>
<I>Youth and Work in Troubled Times</I> suggests the need for greater social cooperation around the school-to-work transition. Cooperative-education and other business-education partnerships play important roles in informing students about the skills needed upon entering the job market. In addition, entry-level training programs can ease the school-to-work transition. Currently, training programs for youth in Canada are limited, and the study found that well-educated young males working in larger firms receive the majority of training offered by employers.
<P>
Marquardt writes that, "a number of policy approaches can be used to improve access to education and training opportunities for youth. These include renewed ‘stay-in-school’ initiatives; improved early childhood education, especially for disadvantaged groups; re-examination of the benefits associated with ‘income contingent repayment loans’ to assist more youth to complete postsecondary studies; and increased flexibility in program delivery to allow students to hold jobs while in school."
<P>
Another critical issue is the rapidly declining level of public expenditures for postsecondary education. While the importance of postsecondary education is increasing dramatically, public funding is plummeting. This threatens to lead to a sharper class division in Canada.
<P>
"We cannot allow the education system to become inaccessible to Canadian youth," says Maxwell. "Young people are the future of this country -- the future of the work force. Governments and employers must acknowledge that this is a crisis situation and take immediate action to address it."
<P>
<I>Youth and Work in Troubled Times: A Report on Canada in the 1990s</I> is one of several publications prepared for CPRN’s Employment and Training Project. The synthesis report on training for the new economy, will be published in the spring of 1997. The project was funded by Human Resources Development Canada, the Canadian Labour Force Development Board, the New Brunswick Labour Force Development Board and the provinces of British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario.

<H4>Changing Patterns of School-to-Work Transition</H4>
<P>
Since the early 1980s, the school-to-work transition typically experienced by Canadian youth has become longer and is often interrupted by spells of unemployment.  Youth (aged 15-24) are staying in school longer, returning more frequently to school from the labour market, and, at the same time, increasing their level of participation in the labour force, combining school and work in many different ways.  These prolonged and circuitous transition paths are associated with delayed transitions in other dimensions of achieving adult independence, particularly in departure from the family home, marriage, and parenthood.
<P>
<H4>Rising Youth Unemployment</H4>
<P>
<a name="text_2">At</a> the same time, the unemployment rate of youth has continued to rise over the past quarter-century.  In 1995, it was 15.6 percent, compared to 9.5 percent for all age groups.  The experience of unemployment leads some young people to return to school for more credentials.  Others simply lower their aspirations.
<P>
Those with lower levels of educational attainment tend to experience unemployment more frequently and for longer periods <a href="marque.htm">(Figure 1)</a>; moreover, their unemployment rates remain higher as they age.  For those with college- and university-level qualifications, there is a gradual decline in the incidence of unemployment spells with years of experience in the labour market.
<P>
The employment experiences of youth reflect the changing structure of the labour market.  There has been a substantial decline in traditional entry-level jobs in the goods-producing industries as well as in public administration, health and social services, and education.  The major growth areas in employment for young people have been in service industries   in sales and service occupations and in managerial and professional occupations.
<P>
Over time, young people with postsecondary qualifications generally move into career jobs appropriate to their level and field of study, while a significant number of those with a high school diploma or less remain in the lower-tier service jobs characteristic of the student labour market.
<P>
Non-standard forms of employment of youth, particularly part-time and temporary jobs, have increased significantly in the 1980s and 1990s, and now amount to well over half of all youth employment.  Although students account for much of this employment, a rising proportion of it is involuntary.  This trend has continued even during the recent economic recovery.  It appears to be a long-term trend reflecting growing employer preference for flexibility and limited commitment.
<P>
Absolute and relative earnings of young people decreased significantly during the 1980s.  For example, between 1981 and 1992 the real annual earnings of young men aged 17-24 who were working full time and full year declined by over 18 percent.  There is also evidence of a gradual divergence of incomes by level of educational attainment, especially a growing disadvantage for workers with a high school diploma or less, and an increasing premium for completion of postsecondary programs.
<P>
Training programs for youth are quite limited in Canada.  The onus remains on individuals even after they leave school to acquire most of the skills they need.  Among employed youth, most employer-based training is received by already well-educated young male workers in large firms.  This pattern may widen the degree of labour market polarization, contributing to the skills and credentials of those who are already advantaged.
<P>
<H4>Policy Implications</H4>
<P>
These findings highlight two key areas of concern: a growing level of social polarization affecting young people even more seriously than older age groups, and an inadequate level of social cooperation among key stakeholders in the school-to-work transition process of Canadian youth.
<P>
Of special concern is the declining level of public expenditure for postsecondary education.  As the importance of postsecondary education is increasing, public funding for it is decreasing.  In the absence of alternative forms of labour-market training for youth, this threatens to lead to sharper class divisions in Canadian society.
<P>
Canada does not have a tradition of social cooperation around education and training.  The result has been poor communication between the supply and demand sides of the labour market.  Students and educators do not get adequate information about the changing nature of labour demand; employers are not aware of the knowledge, skills, and values that students completing different kinds of programs have to offer.  Employers do not take sufficient responsibility for training and education.  Educators are often suspicious of programs directly related to training for the labour market.  Governments, meanwhile, are increasingly incapacitated by their fiscal problems.  The onus then falls upon individuals to make risky choices about how much to invest in education, and which field of study and specialization to choose.  As the pace of economic and technological change accelerates, this lack of social cooperation becomes a critical problem.
<P>
A number of policy approaches can be used to improve access to education and training opportunities for youth.  These include renewed “stay-in-school” initiatives; improved early childhood education, especially for disadvantaged groups; re-examination of the benefits associated with “income contingent repayment loans” to assist more youth to complete postsecondary studies; and increased flexibility in program delivery to allow students to hold jobs while in school.
<P>
There is also a need for greater social cooperation around the school-to-work transition.  Young people need better career education and up-to-date vocational counselling.  Cooperative education and more business-education partnerships can play important roles in informing students about the kinds of skills needed in the labour market and good entry-level training programs can facilitate the transition from school to work.

<td align=top> <center><h2>A CPRN Discussion Group</h2></center>
CPRN welcomes members and friends of all networks to use this listserv as a means of discussing policy research approaches, identifying new issues, announcing events or publications, asking for references or related work, and engaging debate on issues related to the research programs of our three networks or related projects.  If you wish to participate, please fill out the registration form, below. Initially, we will have one site for all contributors, but before long we will break into one site for each network.
<p>
We hope you'll find this discussion site a useful vehicle to get-up-to-date on issues and events related to policy, meet potential colleagues, and generate the synergies by which we can all do better work. This site is expected to be primarily of interest to policy makers, academics, and front line practitioners who want to explore issues related to work, health, and family, but others are welcome to contribute. However, postings not relevant to these general objectives will be screened out by the list moderators. Please return to our homepage in order to get a better idea of the mission and mandate of CPRN and the research programs underway in each of the networks. 
<p>
The discussion group will be in the form of a "moderated listserv". That is, all participants will need to apply for inclusion in the group and all mail should be sent to "mbeebe@islandnet.com" (without the quotes) and the list maintainer will then send your comment to the list for distribution to all subscribers. In this way, the discussion will only be viewed by subscribers.
<P>
First, a few general guidelines/rules.
<p>
1) ALWAYS put your name and e-mail address at the end of every posting. It is important that people be able to contact you privately if they wish, and  some mail systems do not identify the writer anywhere in the header. 
<p>
2) Please include a meaningful subject heading, so that people will know whether your message deals with a topic of interest to them.
<p>
3) If you are replying to someone else's posting, briefly quote or summarize that posting before you offer your reply. Doing so will make your message clearer and avoid confusion, especially for new subscribers who may not have read the original message. Since a number of topics are likely to be discussed on the list at any given moment, even long-time subscribers may not remember what prompted your remarks unless you remind them. 
<p>
4) Most importantly, please treat the ideas and efforts of others with respect. We should all expect to encounter individuals whose ideas vary from our own.  This is to be expected when dealing with people whose life experiences vary widely. Debate on issues is welcome here, but not diatribe or attack. 
<p>
5) Be conservative with your quotes. Quote only text from earlier messages, which is required to put your own message in context. This will make your own  message easier to read. Please avoid messages which require the reader to wade through old text in a search for the new material.

<center><h2>About the Health Network</h2></center>
<P>
Provinces and the federal government are trying to reinvent Canada's
health system in response to stresses from four directions: fiscal
cutbacks, a lack of knowledge about the links between health and
health care, ethical dilemmas in rationing health care services,
and the contradictory incentives built into the rules and regulations
governing health care delivery. Citizens are deeply concerned
that the process of reinvention will jeopardize quality and/or
access to a system they value highly.
<P>
The Health Network is dedicated to research that helps governments
deal with these stresses by filling gaps in our knowledge with
respect to costs, incentives and effective practices in health
services. In particular, the Network  mobilizes teams of researchers
from across Canada, and abroad, with expertise in economic, financial,
administrative and organizational analysis, as well as in the
studies of the efficiency and effectiveness of health systems.
The Network builds upon the knowledge base created by the<I> Sustainable
Health Care for Canada</I><B> </B>report published in January,
1995. It is funded, at least in part, through competitions held
by health research funding agencies.
<P>
The Health Network has two unique qualities. The first is its
national perspective. It works from the assumption that many health
policy issues are common to most provinces and that each  has
much to learn from the innovations and experiences of others.
The second quality is its preoccupation with costs and cost-effectiveness.
In an era of fiscal restraint,  decision makers at all levels
of the health system need better information for resource allocation.
<P>
<strong>The Director</strong>
<P>
Marcus Hollander is Director of the Health Network, Canadian Policy
Research Networks. He has been a leader and innovator in the health
field for over 20 years as a researcher, policy  analyst and administrator.
He has held a variety of positions, including Director of Research
and Planning for the Alcohol and Drug Commission of British Columbia,
Senior Consultant in Policy and Planning for the British Columbia
Ministry of Health, and Visiting Research Fellow at Statistics
Canada. As an administrator, he has been responsible for the operational
management of the Continuing Care service delivery system in British
Columbia. Mr Hollander holds Master's degrees in Sociology and
in Health Services Planning and Administration. He is currently completing
a Doctoral degree in health and social policy at the University of
Victoria and he holds faculty appointments at Simon Fraser University and
the University of British Columbia.

<center><h2>Research In Progress</h2></center>
<P>
The Health Network is currently addressing the following issues.
<P>
<strong>Regionalization </strong><br>
<P>
A comprehensive evaluation of regionalization of health systems
in several provinces is being submitted for funding by governments
and granting agencies. The objective is to identify efficient
practices in health services. The team includes specialists in
health economics, political science, law, sociology and administration.
The impacts on cost, health and administrative systems will be
evaluated, using case study methodology.
<P>
<strong>Benchmark Costs of Home Care</strong><br>
<P>
In partnership with the Canadian Association for Community Care,
this study proposes to compare the cost of institutional and home
care in five provinces, for two groups of patients: seniors and
children. By collecting client-specific data, the study will examine
both formal and informal services used, identifying the source
and the cost. Work will begin as soon as funding is confirmed.
A number of provinces have expressed interest in funding and participating
in the study.
<P>
<strong>Pilot Resource Allocation Model</strong><br>
<P>
The Resource Allocation Framework developed for the Sustainable
Health Care report can be adapted to assist in decisions with
respect to the reconfiguration of health services and facilities.
The model has the capacity to link resource use with costs and
outcomes and thus spell out the consequences of a reorganization
for the health system. It is proposed to apply the model to a
district in Ontario to test its use as a planning tool for wider
implementation across the country.
<P>
<strong>Models of the Future Health Care System</strong>
<p>
Many commentators are putting forward models or solutions for the
health care system, based on their own interests/perspective. To
create an overall system perspective which analyzes the implicit
and explicit consequences of these models, CPRN will commission key
groups to prepare papers on a) their vision of the future of the system, 
and b) their plan for implementation of the vision. The papers will be 
presented and given critical assessment at forum of health experts; the 
results will be published to provoke wider discussion.
<p>
<strong>Other Potential Projects</strong>
<P>
Work is being completed on the following projects: an extensive
literature review of the cost-effectiveness of continuing-care
services, the pros and cons of regionalization in health care,
a discussion and empirical review of the concept of &quot;need&quot;
in planning health services and a review of the interface between
research and decision making.
<P>
If you wish to participate in any of these projects, send a note to Marcus Hollander, 
the Network Director,&nbsp;<address>
<a href="mailto:mjhollan@islandnet.com">mjhollan@islandnet.com</a></address>.

This site is expected to be primarily of interest to policy makers, academics, and front line practitioners who want to explore issues related to work, health, and family, but others are welcome to contribute. However, postings not relevant to these general objectives will be screened out by the list moderators. Please return to our homepage in order to get a better idea of the mission and mandate of CPRN and the research programs underway in each of the networks. 
<p>
The discussion group will be in the form of a "moderated listserv". That is, all participants will need to apply for inclusion in the group and all mail should be sent to "mbeebe@islandnet.com" (without the quotes) and the list maintainer will then send your comment to the list for distribution to all subscribers. In this way, the discussion will only be viewed by subscribers.
<P>
First, a few general guidelines/rules.
<p>
1) ALWAYS put your name and e-mail address at the end of every posting. It is important that people be able to contact you privately if they wish, and  some mail systems do not identify the writer anywhere in the header. 
<p>
2) Please include a meaningful subject heading, so that people will know whether your message deals with a topic of interest to them.
<p>
3) If you are replying to someone else's posting, briefly quote or summarize that posting before you offer your reply. Doing so will make your message clearer and avoid confusion, especially for new subscribers who may not have read the original message. Since a number of topics are likely to be discussed on the list at any given moment, even long-time subscribers may not remember what prompted your remarks unless you remind them. 
<p>
4) Most importantly, please treat the ideas and efforts of others with respect. We should all expect to encounter individuals whose ideas vary from our own.  This is to be expected when dealing with people whose life experiences vary widely. Debate on issues is welcome here, but not diatribe or attack. 
<p>
5) Be conservative with your quotes. Quote only text from earlier messages, which is required to put your own message in context. This will make your own  message easier to read. Please avoid messages which require the reader to wade through old text in a search for the new material.
