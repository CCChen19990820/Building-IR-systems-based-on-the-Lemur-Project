<EM>
Text of a fax received on 10 May 1996 from Mr K. Rajan, Secretary to the Government of India, Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Ministry of Agriculture, New Delhi:</P>
<P></EM>
1.	In continuation of the earlier declaration made regarding provisional freedom from rinderpest of the three zones comprised of 20 States and two island territories (see <EM>
Disease Information</EM>
, <STRONG>
8 </STRONG>
[42], 133-134), the Government of India now declares its territory consisting of the States of Maharashtra and Goa also provisionally free from rinderpest.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="A09_180.GIF" BORDER=1></P>
<P>2.	The bovine population in these two States is approximately 22 million and the small ruminant population is approximately 11 million. There is no evidence to suggest that rinderpest has been found in Maharashtra during the last 30 months or in Goa since 1990. The last outbreak of rinderpest among bovines in Maharashtra, in which 2 animals died, was recorded in October 1993. The last outbreak in small ruminants in this State was in July 1993.</P>
<P>3.	The generalised vaccination work on bovines was discontinued in Maharashtra from September 1994, except in the districts of Nasik and Dhule, where the vaccination work ended in November 1995. Use of rinderpest vaccine in small ruminants for controlling peste des petits ruminants continued in Maharashtra until January 1996.</P>
<P>4.	Vaccination in ruminant populations is being carried out within a belt 30 km wide in the districts of Maharashtra bordering Zone C States and a belt 10 km wide in the border districts of Goa, with the aim of maintaining a sanitary cordon.</P>
<P>5.	Both States have a well organised network of veterinary institutions for monitoring, reporting and investigation of the disease and intensive surveillance work is being carried out. Seromonitoring of vaccinated animals is also being carried out using the ELISA technique, and the results are considered satisfactory. Border control measures for migrating animals have been effectively enforced using the existing legislative measures.</P>
<P>6.	No incidence of rinderpest has been reported in Zones A, B or D since they were declared provisionally free from rinderpest.</P>
<P>7.	In all the States / Union Territories of Zone C, except for Tamil Nadu, where there is still sporadic occurrence of rinderpest, there has been no incidence of rinderpest for one year.</P>
<P>8.	Mass vaccination against rinderpest is in progress in Tamil Nadu.</P>
<P>Considering the above, the Government of India declares the States of Maharashtra and Goa provisionally free from rinderpest and adds them to Zone B.</P>

<EM>
Final date of previous report period: </STRONG>
</EM>
18 July 1995 (see <EM>

<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Final date of this report period: </STRONG>

3 April 1996.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Geographical identification of the outbreaks: </STRONG>
</EM>
State of Chihuahua.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comments concerning affected population: </STRONG>
</EM>
none of the animals found to be seropositive presented clinical signs, even after having received an immunosuppressive treatment. Their seropositive status was attributed to cross reactions.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comments concerning diagnosis: </STRONG>
</EM>
serological testing of 3,001 samples from equids (donkeys, horses, mules) indicated a seroprevalence of 0.14‰. The sera which reacted to <EM>
Trypanosoma equiperdum </EM>
were submitted to the National Institute of Epidemiological Reference and Diagnosis of the Ministry of Health for confirmation. This institute found a reaction to <EM>
T. cruzi </EM>
in 12 sera, thus indicating the possibility of cross reactions. Attempts to isolate the causal agent of dourine in seropositive or immunosuppressed animals were unsuccessful.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Control measures taken during report period: </STRONG>
</EM>
epidemiological surveillance through serological monitoring of equids in the State of Chihuahua and other parts of the country is still in force.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Conclusions: </STRONG>
</EM>
the lack of clinical evidence and the possibility of cross reactions between <EM>
T. equiperdum </EM>
and other antigenically indistinguishable <EM>
Trypanosoma </EM>
suggest that dourine is still an exotic disease for Mexico. Furthermore, immunosuppression experimentally induced in equids reacting positively to <EM>
T. equiperdum </EM>
did not result in any clinical expression of the disease. Lastly, all attempts to isolate the causal agent were unsuccessful.</P>

</CENTER>
<P></STRONG>
<EM>
   </P>
<P></EM>
The United Kingdom Minister of Health announced on 20 March 1996 that an independent advisory Committee had advised the Government that 10 cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), a human disease with effects similar to those of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, have been identified with a previously unrecognised and consistent disease pattern. Although there was no scientific proof that BSE can be transmitted to humans by beef, the Committee concluded that the most likely explanation to date was that these cases were linked to exposure to BSE before the introduction of the 1989 ban in the United Kingdom on using certain bovine tissues for human food. The Committee recommended that certain additional preventive measures be taken, including the deboning of carcasses from cattle aged over 30 months in specially licensed plants. The United Kingdom Government accepted the recommendations, which will be put into effect as soon as possible.</P>
<P>The announcement has caused considerable worldwide publicity and concern, and repercussions in Europe regarding beef consumption and trade.</P>
<P>The following is a brief summary of international reporting and activities regarding BSE.</P>
<P>OIE Member Countries including the United Kingdom and affected countries with a low incidence of BSE continue, through the OIE, to provide Veterinary Services and International Organisations with information about disease occurrence (see table on page 34), methods they use for control, research on the disease and information about its possible relation to similar diseases in other species including humans.</P>
<P>The OIE convened BSE experts twice in 1990 and once in 1991. The purpose of these meetings was to inform the world's Veterinary Services on what was known about this recently emerging disease and to formulate recommended importation procedures for animals and animal products, including semen and embryos. These procedures were adopted by the OIE International Committee in May 1992 and incorporated into the periodically revised OIE <EM>
International Animal Health Code</EM>
, the agreed text for the purpose.</P>
<P>In 1994, the OIE reconvened an expert group in order to determine if there was any new epidemiological or research information on BSE which would lead to considering revision of the chapter on the disease in the <EM>
International Animal Health Code</EM>
. Twenty-five specialists and observers from nine countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Commission, including experts on CJD, participated in the meeting.</P>

<P>The group recognised that the United Kingdom was the only country with a high incidence of BSE. They expressed satisfaction that as an apparent result of a 1988 ban on the feeding of ruminant origin feed to ruminants, the rate of infection had continued to decline in the United Kingdom. They were of the opinion at the time that similar measures taken by other countries where cases had been diagnosed were appropriate for the prevention of spread and/or for the eventual eradication of the disease.</P>
<P>Experimental transmission of BSE and similar diseases between species had been achieved. At the time there was no clear evidence that natural transmission of BSE to cattle other than by infected feed occurred. Research on alternate infection routes continued but because of a very long incubation period results were still pending.</P>
<P>From the beginning of the BSE outbreaks in Europe, the theoretical risk of BSE transmission to humans had not been discounted and had been considered in all national control programmes for the disease. Research continued with this possibility in mind. Epidemiological studies on BSE compared with CJD in humans at the time showed no relationship. The policy of all the infected countries to minimise the risk of contamination of human food and pharmaceuticals was the only acceptable measure which could then be taken. In light of new information on BSE the group in 1994 recommended amendment of the <EM>
International Animal Health Code</EM>
, which was approved by the International Committee in May 1995.</P>
<P>The WHO has also</P>
<P> been active in this field, in close cooperation with, and with the participation of, the OIE. The WHO held consultations in 1991 and 1993 to examine, and advise countries on, existing knowledge about the use of animal tissues as animal feed and human food, and in the preparation of medicinal and other products for human and animal use.</P>
<P>In May 1995, the WHO again held a consultation on public health issues related to human and animal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Some apparent dietary CJD links noted in a United Kingdom analysis were considered to be due to recall bias, and not to indicate a causal association. The consultation concluded at the time that available data suggested that all mammals including humans should be regarded as potentially susceptible to BSE if sufficiently exposed, that current control policies were considered adequate to minimise the risk of exposure to animals and man, and that epidemiological data in Europe did not indicate a change in the incidence of CJD in humans that could be attributed to BSE.</P>
<P>In an effort to assist unaffected countries at possible risk, the OIE, in February 1996, sponsored a training course on the diagnosis of BSE for 14 Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Baltic countries, held in Vladimir, Russia.</P>
<P>The international activities which have been conducted by the European Union are not included in this summary.</P>
<P>As can be seen in the attached update of the number of BSE cases worldwide reported to the OIE, the incidence of the disease in the United Kingdom continued to decline in 1995.</P>
<P>Considering the recent findings in the United Kingdom, both the OIE and WHO are proposing new expert meetings related to their responsibilities with the disease.</P>

Comments concerning affected population: </STRONG>
</EM>
the disease has spilled from its sporadic base to a highly susceptible population of cattle which had not experienced foot and mouth disease (FMD) and/or FMD vaccination for a long time, hence leading to an epidemic.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comments concerning diagnosis: </STRONG>
</EM>
foot and mouth disease virus types SAT 2 and O isolated by the OIE World Reference Laboratory for Foot and Mouth Disease (Pirbright, United Kingdom).</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comments to date concerning epidemiology of the disease: </STRONG>
</EM>
due to movement of local cattle by communal grazers within common border areas of Rwanda/Tanzania/Uganda where foot and mouth disease is currently enzootic, coupled with illegal slaughter of cattle in some abattoirs, the disease has increased in frequency in the highly susceptible cattle.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Control measures taken to date: </STRONG>
</EM>
quarantine restrictions have been put in place and the Government is devising ways of settling communal grazers in the region. Education of farmers and administrators on transmission and control is in progress. Ring vaccination followed by a bi-annual effective block control strategy will soon be implemented.</P>

Maladies transmissibles qui sont consid&eacute;r&eacute;es comme importantes du point de vue socio-&eacute;conomique et/ou sanitaire au niveau national et dont les effets sur le commerce international des animaux et des produits d'origine animale ne sont pas n&eacute;gligeables. Ces maladies font g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement l'objet d'un rapport annuel, mais dans certains cas, selon la p&eacute;riodicit&eacute; pr&eacute;vue par les dispositions des articles 1.2.0.2 et 1.2.0.3 du <EM>Code zoo-sanitaire international</EM>, elles peuvent faire l'objet de rapports plus fr&eacute;quents.

10 f&eacute;vrier 1997.</P>
<P>La situation de la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse en Bulgarie chez les artiodactyles est bien ma&icirc;tris&eacute;e gr&acirc;ce aux mesures strictes appliqu&eacute;es pour &eacute;radiquer le foyer (voir <EM>
Informations sanitaires</EM>
, <STRONG>
9 </STRONG>
[46], 175) ; ces mesures se sont traduites notamment par l'abattage des animaux infect&eacute;s et des animaux ayant &eacute;t&eacute; en contact avec ceux-ci, puis la destruction de leurs cadavres, et par l'abattage des animaux sensibles pr&eacute;sents dans la zone d'&eacute;pizootie du village de Malko Charkovo (r&eacute;gion de Yambol).</P>
<P>Durant deux mois, tous les artiodactyles du pays ont fait l'objet d'examens cliniques hebdomadaires pour la recherche de la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse.</P>
<P>En outre, 4 039 pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements de sang, dont 3 019 avaient &eacute;t&eacute; effectu&eacute;s dans la zone A et 1 020 dans la zone B, ont &eacute;t&eacute; test&eacute;s entre le 29 octobre 1996 et le 4 f&eacute;vrier 1997. Tous les troupeaux d'animaux sensibles de ces zones ont ainsi &eacute;t&eacute; contr&ocirc;l&eacute;s et aucun animal ne s'est r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; porteur d'anticorps dirig&eacute;s contre le virus de la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse.</P>
<P>A la date du 9 f&eacute;vrier 1997, trois mois se sont &eacute;coul&eacute;s depuis la fin de la d&eacute;sinfection du foyer et de toutes les activit&eacute;s d'&eacute;radication de la maladie.</P>
<P>Compte tenu de la strat&eacute;gie de non vaccination et d'abattage sanitaire adopt&eacute;e en Bulgarie vis-&agrave;-vis de la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse, et en accord avec l'article 2.1.1.2. du <EM>
Code zoosanitaire international</EM>
, nous consid&eacute;rons que la Bulgarie est en mesure de recouvrer le statut de pays indemne de fi&egrave;vre aphteuse.</P>

<P>Un foyer de maladie de Newcastle a &eacute;t&eacute; signal&eacute; en septembre 1996 dans le parc zoologique d'Helsinki, situ&eacute; dans une &icirc;le en face de la capitale (voir <EM>
Informations sanitaires</EM>
, <STRONG>
9 </STRONG>
[37], 142). Un harle bi&egrave;vre (<EM>
Mergus merganser</EM>
), apport&eacute; le 18 ao&ucirc;t 1996 dans une unit&eacute; isol&eacute;e o&ugrave; &eacute;taient soign&eacute;s des animaux sauvages bless&eacute;s et qui poss&eacute;dait son personnel propre, mourut le 7 septembre. Le 23 septembre, un examen virologique de routine conduisit &agrave; l'isolement du paramyxovirus-1 (PMV-1) chez cet oiseau. L'indice de pathog&eacute;nicit&eacute; par voie intrac&eacute;r&eacute;brale &eacute;tait de 1,37 (d&eacute;termin&eacute; par le Laboratoire v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire central &agrave; Addlestone, Royaume-Uni, Laboratoire de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence de l'OIE pour la maladie de Newcastle).</P>
<P>Les 12 autres oiseaux pr&eacute;sents dans l'unit&eacute; ne pr&eacute;sentaient pas de signes cliniques ; 2 d'entre eux, cependant, poss&eacute;daient des anticorps dirig&eacute;s contre le PMV-1. La tentative d'isolement viral &agrave; partir de pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements post mortem s'est r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;e infructueuse.</P>
<P>Les &eacute;preuves d'isolement viral et l'examen s&eacute;rologique ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;s en conformit&eacute; avec la Directive du Conseil europ&eacute;en no 92/66/CEE, annexe III (isolement viral sur des œufs f&eacute;cond&eacute;s et &eacute;preuve d'inhibition de l'h&eacute;magglutination), &agrave; l'Institut de recherche v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire et alimentaire d'Helsinki.</P>
<P>Les oiseaux pr&eacute;sents dans les autres parties du parc zoologique ont &eacute;t&eacute; soumis &agrave; un d&eacute;pistage de l'infection par le PMV-1. Des pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements de s&eacute;rum de 117 oiseaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; test&eacute;s. De faibles titres (1:16 - 1:64) ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;tect&eacute;s chez 14 oies. Ces titres n'&eacute;taient pas dus &agrave; une infection active, puisque l'analyse de pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements appari&eacute;s n'a pas mis en &eacute;vidence d'&eacute;l&eacute;vation de ces titres. Les oies ont &eacute;t&eacute; abattues et les tentatives d'isolement post mortem du PMV-1 n'ont pas abouti.</P>
<P>L'isolement du virus a &eacute;t&eacute; tent&eacute; chez 70 oiseaux au total (&agrave; partir de 42 &eacute;chantillons organiques pr&eacute;lev&eacute;s post mortem et de 28 &eacute;couvillons cloacaux), sans r&eacute;sultat. </P>
<P>Tous les oiseaux pr&eacute;sents dans l'unit&eacute; infect&eacute;e ont &eacute;t&eacute; abattus et d&eacute;truits apr&egrave;s examen. L'unit&eacute; a &eacute;t&eacute; nettoy&eacute;e et d&eacute;sinfect&eacute;e et des mesures de restriction ont &eacute;t&eacute; impos&eacute;es au parc zoologique. Aucun cas d'infection par le PMV-1 n'ayant &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;tect&eacute; dans d'autres parties du parc zoologique, les mesures de restriction ont &eacute;t&eacute; lev&eacute;es le 17 d&eacute;cembre 1996.</P>
<P>Ce zoo n'accueillera plus d'animaux sauvages bless&eacute;s.</P>
<P>Aucun cas d'infection par le PMV-1 n'a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;tect&eacute; chez d'autres oiseaux sauvages dans d'autres parties du pays.</P>

<EM>
Texte d'une t&eacute;l&eacute;copie re&ccedil;ue le 8 janvier 1997 du Docteur A.B. Niang, directeur de l'&eacute;levage, minist&egrave;re de l'agriculture, Dakar :</P>
<P></EM>
La peste bovine est une maladie &agrave; d&eacute;claration et &agrave; vaccination obligatoires au S&eacute;n&eacute;gal depuis 1962. C'est ainsi que la vaccination de masse instaur&eacute;e dans le cadre du programme conjoint no 15 (PC 15) a permis de contr&ocirc;ler la maladie.</P>
<P>Le dernier foyer de peste bovine sur des animaux s&eacute;n&eacute;galais a &eacute;t&eacute; enregistr&eacute; en 1968 et un abattage sanitaire fut instaur&eacute; pour circonscrire le foyer. </P>
<P>En 1978, un foyer a &eacute;t&eacute; enregistr&eacute; au S&eacute;n&eacute;gal sur des animaux en transhumance dans le nord du pays et provenant d'un pays voisin.</P>
<P>En 1991, dans le cadre de la campagne panafricaine de lutte contre la peste bovine (PARC), une enqu&ecirc;te de s&eacute;rosurveillance a &eacute;t&eacute; men&eacute;e afin d'&eacute;valuer l'efficacit&eacute; des campagnes de vaccination contre la peste bovine. Il est ressorti des r&eacute;sultats de cette enqu&ecirc;te que les animaux &acirc;g&eacute;s de plus de trois ans avaient un taux de couverture immunitaire variant de 80 % &agrave; 91 %, et que les animaux &acirc;g&eacute;s de moins de trois ans avaient un faible taux de couverture immunitaire (de 37 % &agrave; 73 %). L'enqu&ecirc;te de l'ann&eacute;e 1992 a montr&eacute; la m&ecirc;me tendance.</P>
<P>Sur la base de ces r&eacute;sultats, une nouvelle strat&eacute;gie de vaccination, &eacute;tal&eacute;e sur quatre ans, a &eacute;t&eacute; mise en place en 1993. Elle est d&eacute;crite ci-dessous :</P>
<P>Ann&eacute;e 1 (1994)	Vaccination de masse sans distinction d'&acirc;ge dans les r&eacute;gions o&ugrave; les r&eacute;sultats de la s&eacute;rosurveillance sont apparus insuffisants, afin de consolider le niveau immunitaire. Dans les autres r&eacute;gions, seuls les bovins de moins de trois ans ont &eacute;t&eacute; vaccin&eacute;s.</P>
<P>Ann&eacute;e 2 (1995)	Vaccination de masse dans certaines zones du territoire national o&ugrave; les r&eacute;sultats de l'enqu&ecirc;te de s&eacute;rosurveillance men&eacute;e en 1994 ont montr&eacute; un faible niveau de couverture immunitaire, et vaccination des sujets &acirc;g&eacute;s de moins de trois ans dans le reste du territoire.</P>
<P>Ann&eacute;e 3 (1996)	Vaccination des bovins de moins de trois ans sur l'ensemble du territoire national. L'enqu&ecirc;te de s&eacute;rosurveillance a &eacute;t&eacute; men&eacute;e &agrave; la fin de chaque campagne de vaccination.</P>
<P>Ann&eacute;e 4 (1997)	Arr&ecirc;t de la vaccination contre la peste bovine sur l'ensemble du territoire national, et surveillance &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique de la maladie.</P>
<P>Depuis le mois d'octobre 1996, le S&eacute;n&eacute;gal a arr&ecirc;t&eacute; de vacciner contre la peste bovine. Tous les vaccins contre cette maladie ont &eacute;t&eacute; retir&eacute;s des services v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires de terrain et stock&eacute;s au Laboratoire national d'&eacute;levage et de recherches v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires de Dakar.</P>
<P>Un syst&egrave;me de surveillance &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique de la peste bovine a &eacute;t&eacute; mis en place, faisant intervenir une unit&eacute; &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique au niveau central et un dispositif de terrain, constitu&eacute; de l'ensemble des agents de l'&eacute;levage et articul&eacute; autour d'un r&eacute;seau de six laboratoires r&eacute;gionaux.</P>
<P>L'unit&eacute; &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique est constitu&eacute;e des v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires de la Direction de l'&eacute;levage et de ceux de la recherche ; elle est charg&eacute;e de conduire des enqu&ecirc;tes &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques p&eacute;riodiques sur le terrain.</P>
<P>Concernant le dispositif de surveillance clinique, 23 points d'enqu&ecirc;te de terrain r&eacute;partis sur l'ensemble du territoire ont &eacute;t&eacute; retenus. Les agents ont &eacute;t&eacute; form&eacute;s &agrave; la reconnaissance des signes cliniques de la peste bovine.</P>
<P>La vaccination des ovins et des caprins contre la peste des petits ruminants avec du vaccin contre la peste bovine a &eacute;t&eacute; suspendue cette ann&eacute;e.</P>
<P>Compte tenu de ce qui pr&eacute;c&egrave;de, le S&eacute;n&eacute;gal se d&eacute;clare "provisoirement indemne de peste bovine".</P>

Texte d'un communiqu&eacute; re&ccedil;u le 8 janvier 1997 du Docteur P. Ackah Angniman, D&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute; de la C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire aupr&egrave;s de l'OIE :</P>
<P></EM>
La C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire, n'ayant plus constat&eacute; de cas de peste bovine depuis 1986, se d&eacute;clare "provisoirement indemne de peste bovine", conform&eacute;ment aux m&eacute;thodes standard recommand&eacute;es par l'OIE pour l'&eacute;pid&eacute;miosurveillance de cette maladie.</P>
<P>Depuis 1986, la C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire a pratiqu&eacute; une politique de pr&eacute;vention associant :</P>
<P>la vaccination annuelle des animaux ;</P>
<P>le contr&ocirc;le s&eacute;rologique post-vaccinal annuel par sondage al&eacute;atoire ;</P>
<P>la vaccination syst&eacute;matique des animaux import&eacute;s ;</P>
<P>la surveillance du territoire et des fronti&egrave;res permettant une d&eacute;claration syst&eacute;matique de toute suspicion de maladie contagieuse.</P>
<P>La surveillance du territoire est actuellement assur&eacute;e par les agents des services ext&eacute;rieurs du minist&egrave;re de l'agriculture et des ressources animales et par des v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires install&eacute;s en client&egrave;le priv&eacute;e rurale.</P>
<P>Tout cas de maladie contagieuse est d&eacute;clar&eacute; &agrave; la Direction r&eacute;gionale de l'agriculture et des ressources animales par l'interm&eacute;diaire de la Direction d&eacute;partementale. L'information est ensuite r&eacute;percut&eacute;e &agrave; la Direction des Services v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires, qui en fait la d&eacute;claration &agrave; l'OIE.</P>
<P>Consid&eacute;rant la stabilit&eacute; de la situation au regard de la peste bovine et la pr&eacute;sence d'un syst&egrave;me de surveillance des &eacute;ventuels foyers, la C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire a d&eacute;cid&eacute; d'arr&ecirc;ter la vaccination contre la peste bovine &agrave; compter de l'ann&eacute;e 1996, en conservant la possibilit&eacute; d'intervenir imm&eacute;diatement en cas de survenue de la maladie.</P>

virus de type O, sous-type 01 Manisa.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
B.	Commentaires relatifs au diagnostic : </STRONG>
</EM>
le diagnostic a &eacute;t&eacute; confirm&eacute; par le Laboratoire de virologie du d&eacute;partement de sant&eacute; animale et par le Laboratoire mondial de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence de l'OIE pour la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse (Pirbright, Royaume-Uni). Le virus a &eacute;t&eacute; isol&eacute; sur lign&eacute;e cellulaire BHK21-C13 et identifi&eacute; au moyen d'une trousse ELISA fournie par le Laboratoire de Pirbright.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Commentaires concernant, &agrave; ce jour, l'&eacute;pid&eacute;miologie de la maladie : </STRONG>
</EM>
l'origine du virus est inconnue ; on suppose qu'il &eacute;tait pr&eacute;sent chez des animaux porteurs du virus qui ont gu&eacute;ri de la maladie lors du foyer pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent. Il s'est probablement propag&eacute; par contact direct entre les animaux, et indirectement par l'interm&eacute;diaire de vecteurs inanim&eacute;s et des d&eacute;placements humains. Les vaches avaient &eacute;t&eacute; vaccin&eacute;es contre la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse.</P>

Traduction d'extraits d'une t&eacute;l&eacute;copie re&ccedil;ue le 11 d&eacute;cembre 1996 du Docteur I. Tabakovski, directeur des services v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires, minist&egrave;re de l'agriculture, de la for&ecirc;t et de l'eau, Skopje :</P>
<P></EM>
L'Office v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire du minist&egrave;re de l'agriculture, des for&ecirc;ts et de l'eau a d&eacute;cid&eacute; d'annoncer que l'ex-R&eacute;publique yougoslave de mac&eacute;doine &eacute;tait indemne de fi&egrave;vre aphteuse.</P>
<P>Cette d&eacute;cision a &eacute;t&eacute; prise au vu de l'&eacute;volution de la situation de la maladie en 1996 (voir <EM>
Informations sanitaires</EM>
, <STRONG>
9 </STRONG>
[25], 87 et [30], 114).</P>
<P>L'&eacute;pisode de fi&egrave;vre aphteuse est rest&eacute; confin&eacute; &agrave; deux zones (r&eacute;gion de Skopje et commune de Veles) et n'a concern&eacute; que des bovins.</P>
<P>Tous les animaux sensibles pr&eacute;sents dans les zones atteintes ont &eacute;t&eacute; abattus, et leurs cadavres ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;truits.</P>
<P>Les zones atteintes ont fait l'objet d'une d&eacute;sinfection, d'une d&eacute;sinsectisation et d'une d&eacute;ratisation.</P>
<P>Le territoire du pays a &eacute;t&eacute; divis&eacute; en zones vaccin&eacute;es et zones non vaccin&eacute;es, pour assurer un meilleur contr&ocirc;le sur les animaux et leurs produits, et r&eacute;duire le risque de propagation de la maladie.</P>
<P>Des op&eacute;rations de vaccination avec rappel ont &eacute;t&eacute; conduites, sauf pour les ovins car ils ont pass&eacute; tout l'&eacute;t&eacute; et l'automne sur des p&acirc;tures en montagne.</P>
<P>Aucun nouveau foyer n'est apparu durant une p&eacute;riode fix&eacute;e par la r&eacute;glementation sur la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse.</P>
<P>Toutes les exportations d'animaux et de produits d'origine animale ont &eacute;t&eacute; interdites.</P>
<P>Il convient aussi de souligner que l'Office v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire a accept&eacute; la proposition formul&eacute;e par la Commission europ&eacute;enne de lutte contre la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse (FAO) de r&eacute;aliser une enqu&ecirc;te s&eacute;rologique dans le cheptel national d'ici la fin de 1996.</P>

<P>Transport des autres animaux sensibles du village, non atteints par la maladie, sous surveillance v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire, jusqu'&agrave; un abattoir situ&eacute; dans la ville d'Elhovo (r&eacute;gion de Yambol) ; abattage de ces animaux (74 bovins, 246 porcs, 929 ovins et 86 ch&egrave;vres) dans les conditions sanitaires requises ; traitement thermique de leurs viandes. </P>

<P></STRONG>
</EM>
Les examens cliniques r&eacute;alis&eacute;s jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent et les 2 843 pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements sanguins collect&eacute;s dans tous les troupeaux des villages situ&eacute;s dans un rayon de 10 &agrave; 15 km du foyer et soumis &agrave; l'&eacute;preuve s&eacute;rologique ELISA n'ont r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; aucun nouveau cas de fi&egrave;vre aphteuse et aucun animal poss&eacute;dant des anticorps sp&eacute;cifiques.</P>
<P>Par deux fois (du 31 octobre au 4 novembre, puis du 25 au 28 novembre 1996) une mission compos&eacute;e d'experts de la Commission europ&eacute;enne de lutte contre la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse (FAO) et de la Commission europ&eacute;enne s'est rendue sur place pour s'enqu&eacute;rir de la situation et des mesures prises. Cette mission a consid&eacute;r&eacute; que ces mesures avaient &eacute;t&eacute; appropri&eacute;es, rapides et efficaces, et propres &agrave; &eacute;viter la propagation du virus &agrave; d'autres animaux.</P>
<P>Les mesures prises jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent par le Service v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire national, excluant le recours &agrave; la vaccination contre la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse, permettent d'assurer, 30 jours apr&egrave;s l'&eacute;radication du foyer, que la situation est bien ma&icirc;tris&eacute;e et que la maladie ne se propagera pas &agrave; d'autres r&eacute;gions du pays.</P>

<EM>
Traduction d'un extrait d'une t&eacute;l&eacute;copie re&ccedil;ue le 2 juillet 1996 du Docteur G. Murray, chef des services v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires, minist&egrave;re du secteur primaire et de l'&eacute;nergie, Canberra:</P>
<P>Historique</P>
<P></EM>
Un pt&eacute;rope (chauve-souris frugivore) de l'esp&egrave;ce <EM>
Pteropus alecto</EM>
, trouv&eacute; en mauvaise sant&eacute; sur le bord d'une route &agrave; Ballina (sur la c&ocirc;te nord de l'Etat de Nouvelle-Galles du Sud), a &eacute;t&eacute; remis par un protecteur des chiropt&egrave;res au laboratoire v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire r&eacute;gional de Wollongbar (Nouvelle-Galles du Sud). L'animal &eacute;tait incapable de voler et pr&eacute;sentait un l&eacute;ger tremblement.</P>
<P>Le laboratoire a pratiqu&eacute; l'autopsie et pr&eacute;lev&eacute; du sang et des tissus pour examen. Les tissus ont &eacute;t&eacute; adress&eacute;s &agrave; l'Institut de recherche animale de Yeerongpilly (Etat du Queensland), pour la recherche du morbillivirus &eacute;quin, et au laboratoire australien de sant&eacute; animale (AAHL*), Geelong, pour &eacute;liminer les hypoth&egrave;ses de morbillivirose et de rage.</P>
<P><EM>
R&eacute;sultats de laboratoire</P>
<P></EM>
Les r&eacute;sultats de l'autopsie n'&eacute;taient pas concluants. L'examen histopathologique a r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; une enc&eacute;phalite grave, diffuse, non purulente, en accord avec les signes cliniques.</P>
<P>Les r&eacute;sultats &eacute;taient n&eacute;gatifs pour le morbillivirus &eacute;quin.</P>
<P>L'&eacute;preuve &agrave; l'immunoperoxydase a fourni un r&eacute;sultat positif pour la recherche de lyssavirus au niveau de l'enc&eacute;phale et des cellules nerveuses du tractus gastro-intestinal ; elle s'est r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;e n&eacute;gative pour les autres tissus.</P>
<P>Les &eacute;preuves par anticorps fluorescents &eacute;taient positives pour l'antig&egrave;ne lyssavirus. La microscopie &eacute;lectronique a montr&eacute; des corps d'inclusion dans les neurones. Ont &eacute;galement &eacute;t&eacute; observ&eacute;es des structures de type viral &eacute;voquant fortement une infection &agrave; rhabdovirus, bien que les particules classiques en forme de "balle de fusil" n'aient pu &ecirc;tre d&eacute;tect&eacute;es, sans doute en raison de la technique de fixation utilis&eacute;e.</P>
<P>L'&eacute;preuve de neutralisation virale r&eacute;alis&eacute;e avec le sang du chiropt&egrave;re a fourni un r&eacute;sultat n&eacute;gatif pour la recherche du lyssavirus de s&eacute;rotype 1, le virus classique de la rage. Toutefois, il est admis que la mort de l'animal a pu intervenir avant que les anticorps n'aient eu le temps d'appara&icirc;tre.</P>

<P></EM>
Un pt&eacute;rope trouv&eacute; &agrave; Townsville (dans le nord du Queensland) et pr&eacute;sentant des signes nerveux a r&eacute;cemment &eacute;t&eacute; remis &agrave; un laboratoire en vue de son autopsie. Les r&eacute;sultats obtenus avec l'enc&eacute;phale de ce chiropt&egrave;re &eacute;taient similaires &agrave; ceux observ&eacute;s avec l'isolat de Nouvelle-Galles du Sud. Le virus de Nouvelle-Galles du Sud et celui de Townsville sont plus proches des lyssavirus de g&eacute;notypes 1 et 5 que des autres lyssavirus.</P>
<P>Un isolat a &eacute;t&eacute; adress&eacute; au CDC* d'Atlanta (Etats-Unis d'Am&eacute;rique) pour identification et caract&eacute;risation du virus.</P>

Traduction d'un extrait d'une t&eacute;l&eacute;copie re&ccedil;ue le 8 novembre 1996 du Docteur G. Murray :</P>
<P></EM>
Un lyssavirus a d&eacute;sormais &eacute;t&eacute; isol&eacute; &agrave; partir de cinq pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements au total, collect&eacute;s sur des animaux malades trouv&eacute;s &agrave; Townsville, sur la c&ocirc;te sud-est du Queensland et sur la c&ocirc;te nord de Nouvelle-Galles du Sud. Ces animaux appartiennent &agrave; deux esp&egrave;ces de chiropt&egrave;res frugivores : <EM>
Pteropus alecto </EM>
et <EM>
P. scapulatus</EM>
.</P>
<P>Les Autorit&eacute;s sanitaires du Queensland signalent le premier cas de transmission du virus en Australie &agrave; une soignante d'animaux de Rockhampton (Queensland) qui s'&eacute;tait occup&eacute;e de chiropt&egrave;res bless&eacute;s. Cette femme se trouve dans un &eacute;tat grave &agrave; l'H&ocirc;pital Brisbane Royal. Le diagnostic d&eacute;finitif est attendu, aucun virus n'ayant &eacute;t&eacute; isol&eacute; &agrave; ce jour.</P>
<P><EM>
Etude du lyssavirus </P>
<P></EM>
D'apr&egrave;s l'AAHL, c'est le m&ecirc;me virus, du point de vue biologique et g&eacute;n&eacute;tique, qui a &eacute;t&eacute; isol&eacute; &agrave; partir des cinq pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements pr&eacute;cit&eacute;s. Il est &eacute;troitement apparent&eacute; &agrave; la fois au virus de la rage classique (s&eacute;rogroupe 1, g&eacute;notype 1) et &agrave; l'<EM>
European Bat Lyssavirus </EM>
(EBL) 1 et 2 (s&eacute;rogroupe 5, g&eacute;notypes 5 et 6). Toutefois, cette nouvelle &eacute;tude montre que le g&eacute;nome de ce lyssavirus se distingue pour environ 8 % du s&eacute;rogroupe 1 et du s&eacute;rogroupe 5, et qu'il doit par cons&eacute;quent &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme un nouveau g&eacute;notype.</P>
<P>Le CDC a fourni les conclusions suivantes :</P>
<P>inocul&eacute; par voie p&eacute;riph&eacute;rique &agrave; des souris, ce lyssavirus provoque une paralysie ascendante et une enc&eacute;phalomy&eacute;lite,</P>
<P>les vaccins &agrave; usage humain ou v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire, y compris les vaccins sous-unitaires, prot&egrave;gent contre ce virus,</P>
<P>le s&eacute;rum des personnes vaccin&eacute;es neutralise le virus au m&ecirc;me titre que le s&eacute;rum de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence hyperimmun.</P>
<P><EM>
Conclusion</P>
<P></EM>
Les isolements r&eacute;alis&eacute;s &agrave; ce jour montrent qu'un lyssavirus circule depuis longtemps d&eacute;j&agrave; sur un vaste territoire chez au moins deux esp&egrave;ces de chiropt&egrave;res frugivores.</P>
<P>Pour ce qui est de la rage classique (virus du s&eacute;rogroupe 1), aucun cas d'infection rabique humaine ou animale d'origine autochtone n'a &eacute;t&eacute; constat&eacute; en Australie au cours des deux derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es (en fait, depuis 1867).</P>
<P>Nous consid&eacute;rons que le lyssavirus isol&eacute; chez les pt&eacute;ropes est &eacute;quivalent aux EBL 1 et 2. Par cons&eacute;quent, au vu des dispositions du <EM>
Code zoo-sanitaire international </EM>
donnant la d&eacute;finition de ce qu'est un pays indemne de rage (article 3.1.5.2, paragraphe 4), l'Australie doit continuer &agrave; &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;e indemne de rage.</P>

Traduction d'une t&eacute;l&eacute;copie re&ccedil;ue le 14 novembre 1996 du Docteur P.P. Bosman, directeur des Services v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires et de l'am&eacute;lioration de l'&eacute;levage, Pretoria :</P>
<P></EM>
S. R. - 1</P>
<P>Le 5 novembre 1996, la direction de la sant&eacute; publique a re&ccedil;u notification d'un foyer de fi&egrave;vre h&eacute;morragique de Crim&eacute;e-Congo (FHCC) affectant 16 personnes travaillant dans l'un des deux abattoirs d'autruches appartenant &agrave; la coop&eacute;rative Klein Karoo et situ&eacute;s &agrave; Oudtshoorn. Les activit&eacute;s d'abattage de la coop&eacute;rative ont &eacute;t&eacute; imm&eacute;diatement interrompues en attendant le r&eacute;sultat de l'enqu&ecirc;te diligent&eacute;e par la direction de la sant&eacute; publique v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire, le d&eacute;partement de la sant&eacute;, l'institut national de virologie et des responsables de la coop&eacute;rative.</P>
<P>Depuis lundi, l'unit&eacute; FHCC de l'h&ocirc;pital Tygerberg (Le Cap) a proc&eacute;d&eacute; &agrave; une &eacute;tude &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique approfondie qui a r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; les faits suivants :</P>
<P>Seize sujets-contact primaires ont &eacute;t&eacute; identifi&eacute;s ; eux-m&ecirc;mes, ainsi que les membres de leurs familles et leurs amis ont fait l'objet d'un examen s&eacute;rologique et restent plac&eacute;s sous surveillance m&eacute;dicale intensive.</P>
<P>Une patiente est d&eacute;c&eacute;d&eacute;e en phase aigu&euml; de la maladie, essentiellement par d&eacute;ficience de son syst&egrave;me immunitaire. Chez les autres patients (&agrave; l'exception d'un seul) des anticorps sp&eacute;cifiques sont d'ores et d&eacute;j&agrave; apparus, ce qui permet de pronostiquer une gu&eacute;rison compl&egrave;te.</P>
<P>Un interrogatoire pouss&eacute; a r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; que, sur les 16 patients, 8 travaillaient dans l'aire de plumaison, 5 dans le secteur de la d&eacute;pouille, 2 dans l'aire d'&eacute;tourdissement et 1 dans l'aire d'&eacute;visc&eacute;ration.</P>
<P>Tous ces ouvriers pr&eacute;sentaient des &eacute;rosions cutan&eacute;es et des coupures au dos ou sur la paume des mains ainsi que sur la partie ant&eacute;rieure des membres inf&eacute;rieurs, contrairement aux personnes en poste dans d'autres parties de l'abattoir. </P>
<P>Tous ces ouvriers travaillaient sur la m&ecirc;me cha&icirc;ne d'abattage lorsque l'incident s'est produit. Ceci am&egrave;ne &agrave; consid&eacute;rer qu'il s'agit d'une anad&eacute;mie, dont une seule autruche, manipul&eacute;e par ces m&ecirc;mes ouvriers durant les phases d'&eacute;tourdissement, de plumaison et de d&eacute;pouille repr&eacute;sente, avec une quasi certitude, l'origine.</P>
<P>En raison d'une pluviom&eacute;trie &eacute;lev&eacute;e dans certaines r&eacute;gions fournissant des autruches aux abattoirs d'Oudtshoorn, il a &eacute;t&eacute; observ&eacute; que les autruches qui leur &eacute;taient livr&eacute;es pr&eacute;sentaient une infestation anormale par les tiques.</P>
<P>Il existe plus de 30 sous-esp&egrave;ces de tiques du genre <EM>
Hyalomma </EM>
connues pour &ecirc;tre des vecteurs potentiels de la maladie.</P>
<P>La forme asymptomatique de la maladie est enzootique chez les bovins et les ovins d'Afrique du Sud.</P>
<P>Le virus est relativement fragile : il ne survit ni dans le sang dess&eacute;ch&eacute;, ni &agrave; une temp&eacute;rature &eacute;lev&eacute;e (cuisson de la viande), ni &agrave; un pH faible (< 6), ni dans la viande apr&egrave;s maturation.</P>
<P>Les d&eacute;cisions suivantes ont &eacute;t&eacute; prises le 6 novembre, au cours d'une r&eacute;union tenue &agrave; Oudtshoorn avec toutes les parties int&eacute;ress&eacute;es :</P>
<P>Les abattoirs de la coop&eacute;rative de Klein Karoo &agrave; Oudtshoorn resteront ferm&eacute;s pendant encore au moins 14 jours jusqu'&agrave; ce que tous les faits se rapportant &agrave; cette affaire aient &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;claircis ; ce d&eacute;lai donnera aussi le temps aux producteurs livrant des autruches aux abattoirs d'instaurer les mesures de prophylaxie pr&eacute;conis&eacute;es.</P>
<P>Il devra &ecirc;tre certifi&eacute; que les autruches ont &eacute;t&eacute; soumises &agrave; un traitement acaricide au moins 14 jours avant abattage ; seules les autruches indemnes de tiques seront admises &agrave; l'abattoir.</P>
<P>Des mesures de s&eacute;curit&eacute; suppl&eacute;mentaires vont &ecirc;tre prises &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des ouvriers des abattoirs afin de leur &eacute;viter tout contact avec des tiques infect&eacute;es.</P>
<P>Des essais vont &ecirc;tre entrepris imm&eacute;diatement pour &eacute;tudier le pouvoir pathog&egrave;ne du virus de la FHCC chez les autruches et le pouvoir infectieux de leur viande li&eacute; &agrave; leur parasitisme par les tiques infect&eacute;es ; les r&eacute;sultats de ces essais devraient &ecirc;tre connus d'ici six &agrave; huit semaines.</P>
<P>L'exportation de la viande des autruches abattues apr&egrave;s le 22 octobre dans les deux abattoirs de la coop&eacute;rative Klein Karoo situ&eacute;s &agrave; Oudtshoorn ne sera pas autoris&eacute;e tant qu'aucune certitude ne sera acquise quant &agrave; leur pouvoir infectieux. Toutefois, les &eacute;tudes conduites sur les viandes bovine et ovine dans les zones infest&eacute;es de mani&egrave;re enzootique par les esp&egrave;ces du genre <EM>
Hyalomma </EM>
confirment que les viandes ayant &eacute;t&eacute; soumises au processus de maturation pendant au moins 24 heures ne pr&eacute;sentent aucun danger pour le consommateur. Il y a tout lieu de penser que les r&eacute;sultats de ces &eacute;tudes sont valables &eacute;galement pour la viande d'autruche. Cette viande ne pr&eacute;senterait par cons&eacute;quent aucun danger pour le consommateur apr&egrave;s maturation ; or la maturation et la r&eacute;frig&eacute;ration des viandes sont des op&eacute;rations normalis&eacute;es dans tous les abattoirs agr&eacute;&eacute;s d'Afrique du Sud. Des contr&ocirc;les compl&eacute;mentaires sont en cours.</P>
<P>Ce foyer malencontreux de FHCC chez l'homme se limite &agrave; un seul des abattoirs de la coop&eacute;rative Klein Karoo. Aucun des autres abattoirs d'autruches, y compris ceux agr&eacute;&eacute;s pour l'exportation, ne sont concern&eacute;s par ce foyer. Le statut des abattoirs agr&eacute;&eacute;s n'est donc en aucune mani&egrave;re affect&eacute; par l'incident survenu &agrave; Oudtshoorn. Les mesures de prophylaxie qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;cid&eacute;es (traitement acaricide effectu&eacute; au moins 14 jours avant l'abattage – d&eacute;lai d'attente obligatoire) seront cependant &eacute;tendues &agrave; d'autres abattoirs d'autruches.</P>

<P>Le 27 septembre 1996, l'interdiction portant sur le dernier local restant sous surveillance dans l'&Eacute;tat du Missouri a &eacute;t&eacute; lev&eacute;e.</P>
<P>Au total, au cours de l'&eacute;pisode, 16 locaux atteints ou suspects ont &eacute;t&eacute; mis en interdit (2 oiselleries et des locaux d'habitation). Au total, 541 oiseaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; soumis &agrave; des &eacute;couvillonnages cloacaux pour la recherche de la maladie de Newcastle &agrave; virus v&eacute;log&egrave;ne visc&eacute;rotrope ; parmi eux, 7 se sont r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;s atteints dans 5 locaux diff&eacute;rents.</P>
<P>L'abattage sanitaire a &eacute;t&eacute; appliqu&eacute; en achetant et en d&eacute;truisant les jeunes perroquets atteints. Tous les locaux mis en interdit ont &eacute;t&eacute; lib&eacute;r&eacute;s apr&egrave;s que les oiseaux restants eurent &eacute;t&eacute; soumis par deux fois, avec r&eacute;sultat n&eacute;gatif, &agrave; un &eacute;couvillonnage cloacal &agrave; 15 jours d'intervalle.</P>
<P>A aucun moment, les oiseaux expos&eacute;s ne sont devenus malades. Aucun &eacute;levage de volailles n'a &eacute;t&eacute; expos&eacute; &agrave; la maladie, car il n'en existait pas aux environs des locaux infect&eacute;s.</P>

un seul cas clinique a &eacute;t&eacute; constat&eacute;. Il s'agissait d'un cormoran &agrave; aigrette (<EM>

<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Commentaires relatifs au diagnostic : </STRONG>
</EM>
le diagnostic a &eacute;t&eacute; confirm&eacute; le 30 septembre 1996 par l'Institut de recherche en sant&eacute; animale de Hull (Qu&eacute;bec). L'indice de pathog&eacute;nicit&eacute; par voie intrac&eacute;r&eacute;brale &eacute;tait de 1,38. </P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Commentaires concernant, &agrave; ce jour, l'&eacute;pid&eacute;miologie de la maladie : </STRONG>

des indices de pathog&eacute;nicit&eacute; similaires ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;termin&eacute;s en 1990, 1992 et 1995 sur des isolats provenant de cormorans. Il n'y avait pas eu, alors, de propagation de la maladie aux populations aviaires domestiques. Cette fois encore, aucune contamination de volailles n'a &eacute;t&eacute; observ&eacute;e.</P>

mise en interdit du centre de soins et pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements &agrave; des fins de d&eacute;pistage chez les oiseaux ayant pu &ecirc;tre en contact avec le cormoran infect&eacute;. Des notices d'information mises &agrave; jour sont distribu&eacute;es aux aviculteurs canadiens.

<P>La suspicion d'enc&eacute;phalomy&eacute;lite &eacute;quine v&eacute;n&eacute;zu&eacute;lienne a &eacute;t&eacute; infirm&eacute;e et le diagnostic d'enc&eacute;phalomy&eacute;lite &eacute;quine de l'Est a &eacute;t&eacute; port&eacute;. Sur un total de 106 cas, 92 &eacute;quid&eacute;s sont morts &agrave; ce jour. Le dernier cas a &eacute;t&eacute; enregistr&eacute; le 4 octobre 1996.</P>
<P>La zone focale s'&eacute;tend sur un rayon de 15 km ; on y recense 840 chevaux r&eacute;partis dans 35 ranchs. Le reste de la commune d'Aldama, o&ugrave; se trouvent environ 6 000 chevaux, est consid&eacute;r&eacute; comme zone p&eacute;rifocale.</P>
<P>Le programme de lutte contre les vecteurs se poursuit dans les zones focale et p&eacute;rifocale. Les recherches &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques se poursuivent &eacute;galement, et aucun cas humain n'a &eacute;t&eacute; constat&eacute; &agrave; ce jour.</P>
<P>Les d&eacute;placements d'&eacute;quid&eacute;s dans l'Etat de Tamaulipas et vers le reste du pays demeurent interdits.</P>
<P>D&egrave;s le premier rapport, un plan de vaccination contre l'enc&eacute;phalomy&eacute;lite &eacute;quine v&eacute;n&eacute;zu&eacute;lienne avait &eacute;t&eacute; mise en œuvre &agrave; titre pr&eacute;ventif : 6 272 &eacute;quid&eacute;s pr&eacute;sents dans les zones focale et p&eacute;rifocale ont ainsi &eacute;t&eacute; vaccin&eacute;s. D&egrave;s l'obtention du diagnostic d&eacute;finitif, un nouveau plan faisant appel &agrave; un vaccin sp&eacute;cifique &agrave; l'enc&eacute;phalomy&eacute;lite &eacute;quine de l'Est a &eacute;t&eacute; instaur&eacute; en vue de vacciner 10 000 &eacute;quid&eacute;s dans la commune atteinte ainsi que dans trois communes limitrophes, destin&eacute;es &agrave; constituer une zone tampon.</P>

</EM>
On a pu ais&eacute;ment d&eacute;terminer que les foyers secondaires avaient &eacute;t&eacute; contamin&eacute;s &agrave; la faveur d'un contact direct avec d'autres foyers, notamment par l'utilisation de m&ecirc;mes lieux de p&acirc;turage et d'abreuvement ; en revanche les recherches &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques n'ont pu d&eacute;terminer l'origine des foyers primaires et le mode exact d'introduction du virus.</P>
<P>On peut &eacute;carter &agrave; coup s&ucirc;r l'hypoth&egrave;se selon laquelle les foyers primaires seraient dus &agrave; des contacts directs avec des animaux &eacute;trangers infect&eacute;s. En effet, aucun animal n'a &eacute;t&eacute; introduit au cours des derniers mois dans les foyers primaires et ces exploitations ne recourent pas &agrave; des m&eacute;thodes d'&eacute;levage qui auraient pu favoriser la cohabitation temporaire de leur cheptel avec des animaux sensibles venant d'au-del&agrave; des fronti&egrave;res.</P>
<P>La seule hypoth&egrave;se plausible est donc celle de contacts indirects, notamment par l'interm&eacute;diaire de personnes. Bien que les connaissances traditionnelles sur l'&eacute;pid&eacute;miologie de la clavel&eacute;e ne soient pas en faveur de ce mode de transmission, la fr&eacute;quence et l'intensit&eacute; de la circulation de personnes et de v&eacute;hicules qui passent la fronti&egrave;re &agrave; cet endroit pourrait fort bien accro&icirc;tre la possibilit&eacute; de transmission indirecte. On sait notamment avec certitude que le foyer de Xanthi est li&eacute; &agrave; des d&eacute;placements transfrontaliers de personnes.</P>

la maladie ne s'est pas propag&eacute;e aux autres troupeaux de la localit&eacute; ou de la r&eacute;gion. La surveillance sanitaire men&eacute;e dans la r&eacute;gion n'a pas permis de d&eacute;terminer l'origine de la maladie. La transhumance transfrontali&egrave;re complique le probl&egrave;me. Les r&eacute;sultats diagnostiques et &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques remettent en question la pr&eacute;sence de la maladie, mais la surveillance se poursuit, en qu&ecirc;te du virus responsable.</P>

un examen virologique a permis d'isoler le 23 septembre le paramyxovirus-1 chez le harle bi&egrave;vre. L'indice de pathog&eacute;nicit&eacute; par voie intrac&eacute;r&eacute;brale &eacute;tait de 1,37. Des tentatives d'isolement viral sont en cours pour les autres oiseaux.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Commentaires concernant, &agrave; ce jour, l'&eacute;pid&eacute;miologie de la maladie : </STRONG>
</EM>
aucun autre oiseau pr&eacute;sent dans le parc zoologique n'a pr&eacute;sent&eacute; de signes cliniques de la maladie. Bien qu'aucun accroissement de la morbidit&eacute; ou de la mortalit&eacute; n'ait &eacute;t&eacute; signal&eacute; dans la population d'oiseaux sauvages de Finlande, la faune sauvage est probablement &agrave; l'origine de l'infection.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Mesures de prophylaxie adopt&eacute;es &agrave; ce jour :</P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
-	Mise en interdit du parc zoologique.</P>
<P>-	Abattage de tous les oiseaux pr&eacute;sents dans l'unit&eacute; infect&eacute;e (leurs cadavres ont &eacute;t&eacute; soumis &agrave; des examens de laboratoire).</P>
<P>-	Nettoyage et d&eacute;sinfection de l'unit&eacute;.</P>
<P>-	D&eacute;pistage effectu&eacute; par examen s&eacute;rologique et &eacute;couvillonnage cloacal chez les autres oiseaux pr&eacute;sents dans le parc zoologique.</P>
<P>-	Intensification des pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements sur les oiseaux sauvages.</P>

</EM>
il est probable que la maladie se soit propag&eacute;e &agrave; partir d'une ferme adjacente ou que des animaux infect&eacute;s latents aient d&eacute;velopp&eacute; la maladie &agrave; la suite d'un stress. L'infection s'est transmise par voie a&eacute;rienne ou sexuelle. </P>
<P>Le d&eacute;pistage s&eacute;rologique effectu&eacute; dans des fermes tir&eacute;es par sondage al&eacute;atoire a montr&eacute; que beaucoup d'animaux poss&eacute;daient des titres d'anticorps contre l'herp&egrave;svirus I, ce qui donne &agrave; penser que la maladie aurait pris une allure enzootique dans les &eacute;levages de Sulaibiya.</P>

<P>Durant l'&eacute;pisode de maladie de Newcastle &agrave;  virus v&eacute;log&egrave;ne visc&eacute;rotrope (MNVV) survenu chez des psittacid&eacute;s dans l'Etat du Missouri en juillet 1996, cinq &eacute;levages au total ont eu des cas confirm&eacute;s. Sur les 444 oiseaux recens&eacute;s dans ces &eacute;levages, 7 se sont r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;s atteints et ont d'ailleurs p&eacute;ri de mort naturelle. Les 437 autres oiseaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; soumis par deux fois &agrave; un &eacute;couvillonnage cloacal &agrave; 15 jours d'intervalle. Les analyses effectu&eacute;es sur les sondes cloacales ont toutes fourni des r&eacute;sultats n&eacute;gatifs. L'interdiction dont faisaient l'objet les cinq &eacute;levages a &eacute;t&eacute; lev&eacute;e au mois d'ao&ucirc;t.</P>
<P>L'enqu&ecirc;te &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique a permis de retrouver des &eacute;levages ayant eu des contacts avec les &eacute;levages infect&eacute;s. Ils ont &eacute;t&eacute; mis en interdit et des pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements y ont &eacute;t&eacute; effectu&eacute;s. A la date d'aujourd'hui, l'interdiction a &eacute;t&eacute; lev&eacute;e pour tous ces &eacute;tablissements, sauf un. Aucun oiseau pr&eacute;sent dans ces &eacute;levages n'a pr&eacute;sent&eacute; de sympt&ocirc;mes &eacute;voquant la MNVV.</P>
<P>Enfin, au mois d'ao&ucirc;t, un rapport pr&eacute;liminaire signalait, chez un psittacid&eacute; de l'Oklahoma, la d&eacute;couverte d'une souche de virus de la maladie de Newcastle diff&eacute;rente des souches isol&eacute;es chez les 7 psittacid&eacute;s du Missouri. Apr&egrave;s de nouvelles recherches, les &eacute;chantillons provenant de cet oiseau se sont r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;s n&eacute;gatifs pour le virus de la maladie de Newcastle. </P>

<P>Aucun nouveau foyer de fi&egrave;vre aphteuse n'a &eacute;t&eacute; signal&eacute; depuis le rapport pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent, et l'&eacute;pizootie semble d&eacute;sormais ma&icirc;tris&eacute;e.</P>
<P>Du 12 au 17 ao&ucirc;t 1996, la Commission europ&eacute;enne a organis&eacute; une visite sur le terrain, dans le d&eacute;partement de l'Evros, en vue d'appr&eacute;cier la situation et l'efficacit&eacute; globale des mesures de lutte et de pr&eacute;vention mises en œuvre par les autorit&eacute;s grecques.</P>
<P>Les experts de la Commission ont conclu que ces mesures &eacute;taient en parfaite conformit&eacute; avec la r&eacute;glementation communautaire, avaient permis de ma&icirc;triser l'&eacute;pizootie, et garantissaient que la maladie ne se propagerait pas hors du d&eacute;partement infect&eacute;.</P>
<P>Au vu de ces conclusions favorables, le Comit&eacute; v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire permanent de l'Union europ&eacute;enne a adopt&eacute;, lors d'une r&eacute;union extraordinaire tenue le 22 ao&ucirc;t, une proposition de D&eacute;cision de la Commission rapportant la D&eacute;cision no 96/440/CE qui mettait en interdit la totalit&eacute; du territoire de la Gr&egrave;ce, et limitant la mise en interdit au d&eacute;partement de l'Evros (zonage).</P>
<P>Cette nouvelle D&eacute;cision est scientifiquement justifi&eacute;e et permet de r&eacute;tablir les &eacute;changes intra-communautaires d'animaux vivants et de produits d'origine animale provenant de Gr&egrave;ce ou y transitant, &agrave; l'exclusion du d&eacute;partement de l'Evros.</P>

La situation est maintenant sous contr&ocirc;le. La maladie s'est limit&eacute;e &agrave; 10 villages dans le district de Korcha. Les 623 animaux cliniquement atteints ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;truits (463 bovins, 74 petits ruminants, 86 porcs). Les mesures de restriction des mouvements d'animaux et de d&eacute;sinfection demeurent maintenues dans et autour de la zone infect&eacute;e. La surveillance clinique est &eacute;galement maintenue dans la zone de vaccination. Une zone de surveillance autour de la zone de vaccination et dans les districts frontaliers a &eacute;t&eacute; mise en place. La premi&egrave;re campagne de vaccination en anneau autour des villages infect&eacute;s s'est termin&eacute;e le 12 juillet par les villages infect&eacute;s eux-m&ecirc;mes. Un total de 266 048 animaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; vaccin&eacute;s (59 234 bovins, 137 190 ovins, 57 202 ch&egrave;vres et 7 422 porcs) et marqu&eacute;s par un trou &agrave; l'oreille. La deuxi&egrave;me campagne de rappel a commenc&eacute; dans les zones p&eacute;riph&eacute;riques et l'ensemble des animaux devraient avoir re&ccedil;u les deux injections le 15 ao&ucirc;t.</P>

La maladie est sous contr&ocirc;le. Les deux derniers foyers sont apparus le 18 juillet dans deux villages proches de villages anciennement infect&eacute;s. Deux r&eacute;gions seulement ont &eacute;t&eacute; touch&eacute;es par la maladie, celle de Titov Veles avec un seul foyer (village d'Orizari) et celle de Skopje avec 17 foyers (17 villages). Le contr&ocirc;le de la maladie a &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute; par l'abattage et la destruction de tous les bovins des villages infect&eacute;s, soit au total 4 369 bovins. Une vaccination en anneau des bovins de ces deux r&eacute;gions a &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;e (Titov Veles : 7 500 et Skopje : 20 239). Une vaccination de pr&eacute;caution a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;cid&eacute;e pour les populations animales consid&eacute;r&eacute;es comme les plus &agrave; risque (73 700 bovins situ&eacute;s dans la zone frontali&egrave;re avec l'Albanie et le Kosovo, et 17 600 bovins dans 25 fermes ayant de gros effectifs). La campagne de primo-vaccination est termin&eacute;e et la campagne de rappel devrait commencer &agrave; partir du 6 ao&ucirc;t et se terminer vers le 15 ao&ucirc;t.</P>

Au total 101 villages ont &eacute;t&eacute; infect&eacute;s, correspondant approximativement au quart sud du Kosovo. L'abattage sanitaire a &eacute;t&eacute; appliqu&eacute; et 4 079 animaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;truits (2 580 bovins, 829 moutons et ch&egrave;vres et 670 porcs).

le 25 juillet 1996, le Laboratoire de Pirbright a confirm&eacute; que le g&eacute;nome du virus de type O isol&eacute; dans le Delta est apparent&eacute; aux souches ayant caus&eacute; r&eacute;cemment des foyers en Thrace turque, mais pas &agrave; la souche isol&eacute;e en Gr&egrave;ce en 1994.</P>

</EM>
malgr&eacute; les mesures s&eacute;v&egrave;res de pr&eacute;caution et de prophylaxie prises, une seconde vague de foyers s'est produite dans la pr&eacute;fecture de l'Evros au cours des derniers jours. Les investigations &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques pr&eacute;liminaires indiquent que les foyers primaires ont &eacute;t&eacute; caus&eacute;s par des contacts indirects avec des animaux infect&eacute;s hors de Gr&egrave;ce (d&eacute;placements de personnes, ou abreuvement d'animaux dans le fleuve Evros). Des d&eacute;placements de personnes, des contacts avec des vecteurs inanim&eacute;s, et l'utilisation de p&acirc;turages communs &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur de la Gr&egrave;ce sont &agrave; l'origine des foyers secondaires.</P>

abattage sanitaire. Pas de vaccination. En outre, depuis le 4 juillet 1996, les mesures suivantes sont en vigueur :</P>
<P>–	Abattage sanitaire pr&eacute;ventif de tous les animaux potentiellement contamin&eacute;s dans les zones de protection ;</P>
<P>–	Recensement et enregistrement de toutes les exploitations d&eacute;tenant des animaux sensibles dans le d&eacute;partement de l'Evros, et examen clinique avec enqu&ecirc;te &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique au moins deux fois par semaine dans ces exploitations ;</P>
<P>–	Mise en place de zones de protection et de surveillance autour des foyers, et interdiction totale des d&eacute;placements d'animaux, de produits d'origine animale et d'aliments du b&eacute;tail &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur de ces zones ;</P>
<P>–	Interdiction de tous les transports d'animaux, de produits d'origine animale et d'aliments du b&eacute;tail dans tout le d&eacute;partement de l'Evros, et mesures de police sanitaire strictes le long de la fronti&egrave;re avec le d&eacute;partement de Rodopi, avec d&eacute;sinfection des v&eacute;hicules quittant l'Evros.</P>
<P>–	Surveillance clinique &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique et, si n&eacute;cessaire, s&eacute;rologique au moins une fois par semaine sur tout le territoire de la Gr&egrave;ce.</P>

il semble qu'un animal porteur asymptomatique ait d&eacute;velopp&eacute; l'infection &agrave; la suite d'un stress important. Des animaux de l'&eacute;levage avaient &eacute;t&eacute; import&eacute;s d'Europe du Nord en avril 1996. L'utilisation de la m&eacute;thode ELISA pour le d&eacute;pistage de la rhinotrach&eacute;ite infectieuse bovine/vulvovaginite pustuleuse infectieuse aurait mis en &eacute;vidence une maladie pr&eacute;-existante. L'infection s'est propag&eacute;e par voie a&eacute;rienne, des souffleries (ventilateurs) &eacute;tant utilis&eacute;es pour rafra&icirc;chir les animaux.</P>

deux isolats viraux ont &eacute;t&eacute; obtenus le 20 juillet 1996 ; ils ont &eacute;t&eacute; identifi&eacute;s le 29 juillet comme appartenant au sous-type I, variante E (I-E). Ce sous-type est enzootique sur la c&ocirc;te sud-est du Mexique et en Am&eacute;rique centrale. Il est associ&eacute; &agrave; des cycles sauvages impliquant des petits mammif&egrave;res et des moustiques. Il peut arriver que des &eacute;quins soient infect&eacute;s lorsqu'ils interviennent dans ces cycles, mais la morbidit&eacute; et la mortalit&eacute; restent faibles, sans apparition d'&eacute;pizooties.</P>

Traduction d'une t&eacute;l&eacute;copie re&ccedil;ue le 20 juillet 1996 du Professeur Ali A.M. Moussa, pr&eacute;sident de l'Organisation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des services v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires, minist&egrave;re de l'agriculture, Le Caire :</P>
<P></EM>
L'Egypte se d&eacute;clare « provisoirement indemne de peste bovine » conform&eacute;ment aux crit&egrave;res de l'OIE :</P>
<P>1.	Aucun cas de peste bovine n'a &eacute;t&eacute; constat&eacute;, tant sur des bases cliniques que sur des bases &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques, depuis juin 1986 (c'est-&agrave;-dire depuis dix ann&eacute;es cons&eacute;cutives). Une vaccination annuelle g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute;e et coordonn&eacute;e a &eacute;t&eacute; appliqu&eacute;e &agrave; tous les bovins de 1982 &agrave; 1995 (durant 14 ann&eacute;es cons&eacute;cutives). Elle utilisait un vaccin Plowright produit dans le pays &agrave; partir de virus de la peste bovine sur culture cellulaire (TCRV) ; ce vaccin r&eacute;pond aux normes internationales (OIE et Organisation mondiale de la sant&eacute;). Ces faits ont pu &ecirc;tre v&eacute;rifi&eacute;s de la fa&ccedil;on suivante :</P>
<P>1.1.	Surveillance sanitaire passive : les animaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s p&eacute;riodiquement aux v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires du gouvernorat.</P>
<P>1.2.	S&eacute;rosurveillance:</P>
<P>1.2.1.	V&eacute;rification, &agrave; travers tout le pays, au moyen d'&eacute;preuve ELISA de comp&eacute;tition (locale ou &eacute;trang&egrave;re), de l'existence d'une protection immunitaire contre le virus de la peste bovine parmi les animaux vaccin&eacute;s appartenant &agrave; des groupes d'&acirc;ges diff&eacute;rents. Les r&eacute;sultats sont satisfaisants.</P>
<P>1.2.2.	V&eacute;rification de l'absence de circulation d'une souche att&eacute;nu&eacute;e du virus de la peste bovine parmi les veaux non vaccin&eacute;s &acirc;g&eacute;s de plus de huit mois, et parmi les ovins et caprins. Les r&eacute;sultats de laboratoire, utilisant l'ELISA de comp&eacute;tition, se sont r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;s n&eacute;gatifs.</P>
<P>1.2.3.	Un total de 5 200 s&eacute;rums d'ovins et de caprins ont &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave; travers le pays en 1996. Les r&eacute;sultats de laboratoire, utilisant l'ELISA de comp&eacute;tition, se sont r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;s n&eacute;gatifs pour la recherche de circulation d'une souche att&eacute;nu&eacute;e du virus de la peste bovine.</P>
<P>2.	Tous les vaccins TCRV ont &eacute;t&eacute; retir&eacute;s de la circulation dans tous les gouvernorats du pays et ont &eacute;t&eacute; stock&eacute;s &agrave; l'Institut de recherche v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire sur les s&eacute;rums et les vaccins (VSVRI, Abbasiya, Le Caire).</P>
<P>3.	Tous les produits antig&eacute;niques apparent&eacute;s au virus de la peste bovine ont &eacute;t&eacute; retir&eacute;s des organismes gouvernementaux et priv&eacute;s d'Egypte.</P>
<P>4.	L'importation et le transport d'animaux et de leurs produits provenant de zones infect&eacute;es de peste bovine sont interdits.</P>
<P>5.	Le d&eacute;cret minist&eacute;riel no 806 du 13 juillet 1996 pr&eacute;voit :</P>
<P>-	la suspension pour trois ann&eacute;es cons&eacute;cutives de la vaccination contre la peste bovine ;</P>
<P>-	le maintien pour trois ann&eacute;es cons&eacute;cutives de la surveillance sanitaire et s&eacute;rologique pour les bovins, ovins et caprins ;</P>
<P>-	la production, par le VSVRI, de la quantit&eacute; strat&eacute;gique n&eacute;cessaire de TCRV approuv&eacute;e par le pr&eacute;sident de l'Organisation g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des services v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires.</P>

&agrave; des fins de prophylaxie, il convient de consid&eacute;rer tous les animaux sensibles pr&eacute;sents dans le delta comme des animaux potentiellement contamin&eacute;s, en raison de conditions g&eacute;ographiques et zootechniques particuli&egrave;res &agrave; la zone du delta. Les p&acirc;turages du delta se trouvent comme sur une &icirc;le, naturellement s&eacute;par&eacute;s du reste de la Gr&egrave;ce par le fleuve, et accessibles seulement par quelques ponts constamment gard&eacute;s par l'arm&eacute;e. Tous les passages d'animaux, de produits, de personnes et de v&eacute;hicules peuvent donc &ecirc;tre efficacement contr&ocirc;l&eacute;s. Des mesures de sauvegarde sont observ&eacute;es. La pr&eacute;vention de la propagation de la maladie, en Gr&egrave;ce ou hors de Gr&egrave;ce, peut &ecirc;tre assur&eacute;e.</P>

il ressort de l'enqu&ecirc;te &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique que les &eacute;changes quotidiens de marchandises, y compris le trafic ill&eacute;gal de cigarettes, d'un pays &agrave; l'autre ont permis la transmission m&eacute;canique du virus par le biais des chevaux ou des &acirc;nes entre les pays voisins et la population animale indig&egrave;ne. Le virus peut par ailleurs avoir &eacute;t&eacute; introduit par le biais de fourrage ou par le biais de contacts avec des troupeaux de l'ex-R&eacute;publique yougoslave de Mac&eacute;doine ou d'Albanie, qui paissent sur des p&acirc;turages communs avec des animaux de la RFY (Serbie et Mont&eacute;n&eacute;gro) ; des citoyens de l'ex-R&eacute;publique yougoslave de Mac&eacute;doine poss&egrave;dent encore des p&acirc;turages en RFY (Serbie et Mont&eacute;n&eacute;gro).

Des mesures sanitaires et v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires strictes ont &eacute;t&eacute; prises, en conformit&eacute; avec les recommandations internationales relatives &agrave; la lutte contre la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse.</P>
<P>Un "quartier g&eacute;n&eacute;ral yougoslave / f&eacute;d&eacute;ral" a &eacute;t&eacute; mis en place pour coordonner les op&eacute;rations de lutte contre la maladie dans la zone contamin&eacute;e et la zone &agrave; risque, analyser la situation et planifier l'application des mesures.</P>
<P>Environ 130 v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires, 30 techniciens des services officiels de district, des unit&eacute;s de la garde nationale et des membres de l'arm&eacute;e travaillent actuellement dans la zone contamin&eacute;e. Les &eacute;quipes v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires proc&egrave;dent &agrave; des examens cliniques ; sont &eacute;galement sur le th&eacute;&acirc;tre des op&eacute;rations des &eacute;quipes d'&eacute;pid&eacute;miologistes, des inspecteurs des Services v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires et des &eacute;quipes de d&eacute;sinfection.</P>
<P>Dans la zone &agrave; risque, 120 v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires travaillent en collaboration avec les &eacute;quipes.</P>
<P>Afin d'entraver la progression de la maladie, les marchandises sont strictement contr&ocirc;l&eacute;es aux fronti&egrave;res et les personnes et les v&eacute;hicules sont soumis &agrave; une d&eacute;sinfection.</P>
<P>Les districts de Kacanik, Prizren, Vitina, Gora, Štrpce, Obilic et Gnjilane sont d&eacute;clar&eacute;s contamin&eacute;s, tandis que les districts voisins sont consid&eacute;r&eacute;s "&agrave; risque". Dans ces zones, les mesures suivantes ont &eacute;t&eacute; mises en œuvre :</P>
<P>-	abattage sanitaires dans les fermes contamin&eacute;es et les fermes voisines, avec enfouissement des carcasses des animaux et indemnisation des propri&eacute;taires dans un d&eacute;lai de trois jours ;</P>
<P>-	interdiction du transport d'animaux sensibles et de leurs produits ;</P>
<P>-	interdiction du transport d'aliments pour animaux ;</P>
<P>-	mise en interdit des &eacute;levages atteints, avec s&eacute;questration des animaux et restriction des d&eacute;placements de personnes ;</P>
<P>-	examen clinique des bi-ongul&eacute;s afin de d&eacute;terminer l'&eacute;tendue de l'&eacute;pizootie ;</P>
<P>-	fermeture des abattoirs lorsque la situation &eacute;pizootiologique l'exige ;</P>
<P>-	d&eacute;sinfection quotidienne et mise en place de p&eacute;diluves aux emplacements appropri&eacute;s ;</P>
<P>-	la vaccination est pr&eacute;vue dans les districts &agrave; risque, tous les districts du Kosovo et les districts situ&eacute;s aux fronti&egrave;res avec l'Albanie et avec l'ex-R&eacute;publique yougoslave de Mac&eacute;doine.</P>

Le "Dispositif national d'urgence en sant&eacute; animale" (DINESA) a mis en place de fa&ccedil;on pr&eacute;ventive un plan de vaccination p&eacute;rifocale intensive contre l'EEV dans les trois communes o&ugrave; des cas de neuropathie ont &eacute;t&eacute; signal&eacute;s et dans 29 autres communes de la m&ecirc;me r&eacute;gion. Ce plan vaccinal s'est achev&eacute; le 18 juillet 1996, avec 15 453 animaux vaccin&eacute;s.</P>
<P>-	<EM>
Enqu&ecirc;te et surveillance &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques : </EM>
Dans la zone infect&eacute;e et dans les zones p&eacute;riph&eacute;riques : contr&ocirc;le des d&eacute;placements d'&eacute;quins des trois communes atteintes vers le reste de l'Etat, et de l'Etat d'Oaxaca vers les autres Etats.</P>
<P>-	<EM>
Fumigations : </EM>
Les services de sant&eacute; publique ont fait proc&eacute;der &agrave; des fumigations contre les moustiques vecteurs dans les parties urbanis&eacute;es des communes atteintes ; les recherches &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques correspondantes r&eacute;v&egrave;lent l'absence de cas humains.</P>
<P>La situation est consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme ma&icirc;tris&eacute;e, puisque 6 jours apr&egrave;s l'ach&egrave;vement du plan vaccinal aucun nouveau cas n'est &agrave; d&eacute;plorer.</P>

Extraits d'une t&eacute;l&eacute;copie re&ccedil;ue le 12 juillet 1996 du Docteur A.M. Denke, directeur de l'&eacute;levage et des p&ecirc;ches, minist&egrave;re du d&eacute;veloppement rural et de l'hydraulique villageoise, Lom&eacute; :</P>
<P></EM>
Le Togo est subdivis&eacute; en 71 "carr&eacute;s &eacute;pizootiques" couverts par 63 postes v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires regroup&eacute;s au sein de 30 inspections v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires coiff&eacute;es par 5 services r&eacute;gionaux de l'&eacute;levage et des p&ecirc;ches avec, au niveau central, une Direction de l'&eacute;levage et des p&ecirc;ches qui comporte 3 divisions, &agrave; savoir : Division sant&eacute; animale, Division des productions animales et Division des p&ecirc;ches.</P>
<P>Outre les services &eacute;tatiques, une dizaine de v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires priv&eacute;s s'impliquent dans la client&egrave;le rurale et dans la proc&eacute;dure d'information sur les maladies. Les &eacute;leveurs arrivent &agrave; identifier les &eacute;tats morbides et certaines maladies des animaux qu'ils signalent aux services comp&eacute;tents.</P>
<P>Tout cas de maladie d&eacute;clar&eacute; ou suspect&eacute; au niveau des &eacute;levages est imm&eacute;diatement rapport&eacute; au chef d'inspection de la zone concern&eacute;e. L'information remonte simultan&eacute;ment au Chef de service r&eacute;gional et &agrave; la Direction de l'&eacute;levage et des p&ecirc;ches o&ugrave; le D&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute; permanent du Togo aupr&egrave;s de l'OIE en fait la d&eacute;claration &agrave; l'OIE le cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant.</P>
<P>Depuis 1988, il n'a plus &eacute;t&eacute; enregistr&eacute; de cas de peste bovine au Togo et la vaccination a &eacute;t&eacute; arr&ecirc;t&eacute;e en 1990. N&eacute;anmoins, avec la r&eacute;apparition de la p&eacute;ripneumonie contagieuse bovine depuis 1994, le vaccin mixte peste bovine / p&eacute;ripneumonie contagieuse bovine ("Bisec") est utilis&eacute; dans le cadre de la vaccination contre cette maladie.</P>
<P>Au vu de ce qui pr&eacute;c&egrave;de, le Togo se d&eacute;clare « provisoirement indemne de peste bovine ». </P>

En application de la D&eacute;claration de Dakar issue de la 10e R&eacute;union r&eacute;gionale de la Campagne panafricaine de lutte contre la peste bovine (PARC) pour l'Afrique de l'Ouest et du Centre, j'ai l'honneur de vous informer que la R&eacute;publique de Guin&eacute;e a arr&ecirc;t&eacute; les vaccinations massives contre la peste bovine en 1971, et la vaccination &agrave; la fronti&egrave;re avec le Mali et le S&eacute;n&eacute;gal en 1994. </P>

des pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements ont &eacute;t&eacute; envoy&eacute;s le 5 juillet 1996 au Laboratoire mondial de R&eacute;f&eacute;rence de l'OIE pour la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse (Pirbright, Royaume-Uni).</P>

les habitants de Dikella ont des contacts fr&eacute;quents avec la Turquie (d&eacute;placements de personnes, de v&eacute;hicules et de marchandises). </P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Mesures de prophylaxie adopt&eacute;es &agrave; ce jour : </STRONG>
</EM>
toutes les mesures pr&eacute;vues &agrave; l'article 5 de la Directive europ&eacute;enne 85/511/CEE ont &eacute;t&eacute; instaur&eacute;es d&egrave;s le 3 juillet 1996. Le plan d'urgence a &eacute;t&eacute; int&eacute;gralement mis en œuvre. Des zones de protection (villages de Makri, Dikella et Mesimvria) et de surveillance (villages de Nea Hili, Atarni, Avra, Komaros, Perama, Plaka et Mesti) ont &eacute;t&eacute; mises en place le 4 juillet 1996. La sortie d'animaux vivants et de produits d'origine animale hors du d&eacute;partement est suspendue jusqu'&agrave; nouvel ordre.</P>
<P>Foyer no 1/96 : sans attendre la confirmation du diagnostic, les autorit&eacute;s v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires locales ont proc&eacute;d&eacute; &agrave; l'abattage des animaux sensibles pr&eacute;sents dans la ferme ainsi qu'&agrave; l'abattage des animaux de trois autres fermes de Dikella (154 ovins et 2 bovins), qui avaient p&acirc;tur&eacute; et s'&eacute;taient abreuv&eacute;s avec les animaux atteints. Si les mesures de pr&eacute;vention l'exigent, les autorit&eacute;s v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires locales envisagent de recourir &agrave; toute extr&eacute;mit&eacute; &agrave; l'abattage de la totalit&eacute; des animaux sensibles du village de Dikella (soit environ 800 ovins, 25 bovins et 30 porcs).</P>
<P>Foyer no 2/96 : l'abattage sanitaire doit &ecirc;tre pratiqu&eacute; le 5 juillet 1996.</P>

Commentaires concernant l'effectif atteint : </STRONG>
</EM>
dans le cadre du plan de d&eacute;pistage s&eacute;rologique men&eacute; dans tous les &eacute;levages bovins du pays (soit environ 27 000 troupeaux), des animaux pr&eacute;sentant une r&eacute;action s&eacute;rologique au virus de la leucose ont &eacute;t&eacute; trouv&eacute;s dans huit &eacute;levages laitiers. Toutefois, les signes cliniques de la maladie ne se sont manifest&eacute;s chez aucun animal.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Commentaires relatifs au diagnostic : </STRONG>
</EM>
le d&eacute;pistage pr&eacute;liminaire a &eacute;t&eacute; effectu&eacute; &agrave; partir de lait de m&eacute;lange pour les &eacute;levages laitiers, et de pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements individuels de sang pour les &eacute;levages d'animaux de boucherie. Tous les pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements de sang d'animaux de boucherie se sont r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute;s n&eacute;gatifs. Dans les &eacute;levages laitiers o&ugrave; se trouvaient des animaux r&eacute;agissants, tous les animaux ont &eacute;t&eacute; test&eacute;s individuellement pour rechercher la pr&eacute;sence d'anticorps dans le sang.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Commentaires concernant, &agrave; ce jour, l'&eacute;pid&eacute;miologie de la maladie : </STRONG>
</EM>
l'origine de l'infection est inconnue. Des recherches &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques sont en cours. Une nouvelle enqu&ecirc;te nationale est en pr&eacute;paration.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Mesures de prophylaxie adopt&eacute;es &agrave; ce jour : </STRONG>
</EM>
les huit &eacute;levages o&ugrave; se trouvaient des animaux r&eacute;agissants ont &eacute;t&eacute; plac&eacute;s sous surveillance officielle et soumis &agrave; des restrictions. Les d&eacute;placements d'animaux dans, ou &agrave; partir, des &eacute;levages infect&eacute;s sont interdits. Des mesures de restriction ont &eacute;galement &eacute;t&eacute; prises concernant le p&acirc;turage des troupeaux en question. Les animaux pr&eacute;sentant des anticorps sont &eacute;limin&eacute;s avec l'accord de leurs propri&eacute;taires.</P>

Extraits d'un bulletin d'information re&ccedil;u le 5 juin 1996 du Secr&eacute;taire de la Commission europ&eacute;enne de lutte contre la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse (FAO)2 :</P>
<P><STRONG>
Foyer primaire : </P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
Le premier cas de fi&egrave;vre aphteuse a &eacute;t&eacute; observ&eacute; le 3 mai 1996 &agrave; Drithas au sud-est du pays sur un bovin dans une ancienne ferme d'Etat situ&eacute;e &agrave; 10 km au nord de la ville de Kor&ccedil;a, si&egrave;ge de la pr&eacute;fecture. Etaient pr&eacute;sents sur la ferme 393 bovins, 200 moutons et 390 porcs appartenant &agrave; une centaine de familles travaillant autrefois sur la ferme et continuant d'y r&eacute;sider.</P>
<P>Le 6 mai, 16 bovins &eacute;taient touch&eacute;s et le 7 mai, 48. Des bovins de tous les &acirc;ges, des moutons et des porcs ont progressivement &eacute;t&eacute; infect&eacute;s. Le 17 mai, 81 animaux &eacute;taient touch&eacute;s ; le 27 mai on comptait 247 bovins, 15 moutons et 18 porcs atteints.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Foyers secondaires : </P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
Au 1er juin, la maladie avait atteint au total 7 villages, touchant cliniquement 298 bovins, 15 moutons et 33 porcs. Tous les villages se situent dans une zone d'environ 10 km.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Origine de la maladie :</P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
L'Albanie a r&eacute;cemment import&eacute; de grandes quantit&eacute;s de viande congel&eacute;e de bœuf et de buffle (dont certaines non d&eacute;soss&eacute;es) en provenance de pays non indemnes de fi&egrave;vre aphteuse. Cette viande serait utilis&eacute;e essentiellement pour la transformation, mais une partie est aussi vendue directement et il est tr&egrave;s possible que les d&eacute;chets de ces viandes (y compris les os) aient &eacute;t&eacute; consomm&eacute;s par des porcs qui auraient &eacute;t&eacute; ainsi infect&eacute;s avant de contaminer des bovins.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Caract&eacute;risation de la souche :</P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
La souche a &eacute;t&eacute; isol&eacute;e au Laboratoire national de Brescia (Italie) et transmise au Laboratoire mondial de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence de l'OIE pour la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse (Pirbright, Royaume-Uni) pour caract&eacute;risation. Ce travail est en cours. Les premiers r&eacute;sultats semblent indiquer que le virus est apparent&eacute; aux virus du s&eacute;rotype A22 Arabie Saoudite/Inde.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Mesures de lutte :</P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
Des mesures de lutte contre la maladie ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;cid&eacute;es &agrave; partir du 13 mai. Une r&eacute;solution gouvernementale du Conseil des ministres a &eacute;t&eacute; prise en ce sens et un arr&ecirc;t&eacute; du ministre de l'agriculture et de l'alimentation en date du 20 mai d&eacute;finit vingt mesures pratiques, dont la mise en quarantaine des villages infect&eacute;s, la fermeture des march&eacute;s, l'interdiction du transport d'animaux dans le district de Kor&ccedil;a et les districts voisins, la destruction des animaux atteints avec indemnisation des &eacute;leveurs et la constitution d'un Comit&eacute; de lutte contre la maladie.</P>
<P>La maladie a continu&eacute; de s'&eacute;tendre malgr&eacute; les mesures prises et la mission a pr&eacute;conis&eacute; le renforcement des mesures sanitaires en m&ecirc;me temps que la mise en œuvre imm&eacute;diate d'une vaccination de tous les animaux sensibles dans le district de Kor&ccedil;a et une partie des districts voisins de Pogradec et Devoll, soit environ 150 000 animaux. Le vaccin sera fourni par la Commission europ&eacute;enne de lutte contre la fi&egrave;vre aphteuse.</P>

les pigeons sauvages introduits &agrave; l'universit&eacute; d'Oulu le 25 mars 1996 constituaient la source pr&eacute;sum&eacute;e de l'infection. Afin de confirmer cette hypoth&egrave;se, des pigeons appartenant &agrave; leur population d'origine ont &eacute;t&eacute; soumis &agrave; un examen s&eacute;rologique dont les r&eacute;sultats ont &eacute;t&eacute; connus le 28 mai 1996 : sur un total de 83 pigeons captur&eacute;s, 31 &eacute;taient porteurs d'anticorps dirig&eacute;s contre le paramyxovirus-1, mais aucun ne pr&eacute;sentait de signes cliniques de la maladie de Newcastle. L'apparition de signes cliniques chez les pigeons infect&eacute;s introduits &agrave; l'universit&eacute; d'Oulu a probablement &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;clench&eacute;e par le stress de la captivit&eacute;. Aucun autre cas n'a &eacute;t&eacute; signal&eacute;.</P>

Traduction d'une t&eacute;l&eacute;copie re&ccedil;ue le 10 mai 1996 de Monsieur K. Rajan, secr&eacute;taire &agrave; l'&eacute;levage, minist&egrave;re de l'agriculture, New Delhi :</P>
<P></EM>
1.	Donnant suite &agrave; la pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente d&eacute;claration relative au statut "provisoirement indemne de peste bovine" de trois zones comprenant 20 Etats et deux territoires insulaires (voir <EM>
Informations sanitaires</EM>
, <STRONG>
8 </STRONG>
[42], 133-134), le gouvernement de l'Inde d&eacute;clare par la pr&eacute;sente les Etats de Maharashtra et Goa &eacute;galement "provisoirement indemnes de peste bovine".</P>
<P><IMG SRC="F09_180.GIF" BORDER=1></P>
<P>2.	Dans ces deux Etats, la population de bovins est d'environ 22 millions et la population de petits ruminants d'environ 11 millions. Aucun cas de peste bovine n'a &eacute;t&eacute; observ&eacute; au Maharashtra au cours des 30 derniers mois ni &agrave; Goa depuis 1990. Le dernier foyer de peste bovine chez des bovins a &eacute;t&eacute; observ&eacute; au Maharashtra en octobre 1993 (2 animaux &eacute;taient morts) ; chez les petits ruminants, le dernier foyer remonte &agrave; juillet 1993.</P>
<P>3.	Au Maharashtra, la vaccination g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute;e des bovins a &eacute;t&eacute; suspendue &agrave; partir de septembre 1994, sauf dans les districts de Nasik et de Dhule o&ugrave; le programme de vaccination s'est poursuivi jusqu'en novembre 1995. Pour la prophylaxie de la peste des petits ruminants, le vaccin antibovipestique a &eacute;t&eacute; utilis&eacute; dans cet Etat jusqu'en janvier 1996.</P>
<P>4.	Afin de conserver un cordon sanitaire le long de la Zone C, la vaccination des ruminants est maintenue dans les districts du Maharashtra (sur une profondeur de 30 km) et de Goa (sur une profondeur de 10 km) qui bordent cette zone.</P>
<P>5.	Les Etats de Goa et du Maharashtra poss&egrave;dent un r&eacute;seau bien organis&eacute; d'institutions v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires &agrave; m&ecirc;me d'assurer le d&eacute;pistage et la d&eacute;claration de la maladie et toute enqu&ecirc;te la concernant ; un programme de surveillance intensive est en place. La recherche d'anticorps chez les animaux vaccin&eacute;s est en cours (m&eacute;thode ELISA) ; les r&eacute;sultats sont consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme satisfaisants. Les mesures de contr&ocirc;le aux fronti&egrave;res pour les animaux en d&eacute;placement ont &eacute;t&eacute; renforc&eacute;es en s'appuyant sur la l&eacute;gislation existante.</P>
<P>6.	Aucun nouveau cas de peste bovine n'a &eacute;t&eacute; signal&eacute; dans les Zones A, B et D depuis qu'elles ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;clar&eacute;es provisoirement indemnes de peste bovine.</P>
<P>7.	Aucun cas de peste bovine n'a &eacute;t&eacute; signal&eacute; depuis un an dans la Zone C, sauf dans le Tamil Nadu o&ugrave; la fr&eacute;quence de la maladie est sporadique.</P>
<P>8.	Une vaccination de masse contre la peste bovine est mise en œuvre dans le Tamil Nadu.</P>
<P>Compte tenu de l'ensemble de ces consid&eacute;rations, le gouvernement de l'Inde ajoute les Etats du Maharashtra et de Goa &agrave; la Zone B et les d&eacute;clare provisoirement indemnes de peste bovine.</P>

l'ensemble du foyer (universit&eacute; d'Oulu) comprenait 747 oiseaux (pigeons, t&eacute;tras, canards, cailles et poules) utilis&eacute;s pour la recherche scientifique et gard&eacute;s pour la plupart (576) &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur. Le 25 mars 1996, 25 pigeons sauvages ont &eacute;t&eacute; plac&eacute;s dans une voli&egrave;re de plein air, portant &agrave; 95 le nombre de pigeons qu'elle contenait. Une semaine apr&egrave;s, quelques pigeons sont morts sans avoir manifest&eacute; aucun sympt&ocirc;me. En avril, 23 autres pigeons sont morts.</P>

aucun animal trouv&eacute; porteur d'anticorps dirig&eacute;s contre l'agent de la dourine n'a pr&eacute;sent&eacute; de signes cliniques, m&ecirc;me apr&egrave;s avoir re&ccedil;u un traitement immunosuppresseur, et leur s&eacute;ropositivit&eacute; a &eacute;t&eacute; attribu&eacute;e &agrave; des r&eacute;actions crois&eacute;es.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Commentaires relatifs au diagnostic : </STRONG>
</EM>
l'analyse s&eacute;rologique de 3 001 &eacute;chantillons provenant d'&eacute;quid&eacute;s (&acirc;nes, chevaux, mules) a r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; une s&eacute;ropr&eacute;valence de 0,14 ‰. Les s&eacute;rums pr&eacute;sentant une r&eacute;action &agrave; <EM>
Trypanosoma equiperdum </EM>
ont &eacute;t&eacute; adress&eacute;s pour confirmation &agrave; l'Institut national de diagnostic et de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique d&eacute;pendant du minist&egrave;re de la sant&eacute;. Or cet institut a mis en &eacute;vidence une r&eacute;action &agrave; <EM>
T. cruzi </EM>
pour 12 s&eacute;rums, ce qui indique la possibilit&eacute; de r&eacute;actions crois&eacute;es. L'agent pathog&egrave;ne de la dourine n'a &eacute;t&eacute; isol&eacute; ni chez les animaux s&eacute;ropositifs ni chez les animaux immunod&eacute;prim&eacute;s.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Mesures de prophylaxie adopt&eacute;es au cours de la p&eacute;riode objet du pr&eacute;sent rapport : </STRONG>
</EM>
la surveillance &eacute;pid&eacute;miologique par d&eacute;pistage s&eacute;rologique chez les &eacute;quid&eacute;s continue dans l'Etat de Chihuahua et d'autres r&eacute;gions du pays.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Conclusion : </STRONG>
</EM>
l'absence de tableau clinique et la possibilit&eacute; de r&eacute;actions crois&eacute;es entre <EM>
T. equiperdum </EM>
et d'autres trypanosomes antig&eacute;niquement indiff&eacute;renciables donnent &agrave; penser que la maladie continue d'&ecirc;tre exotique au Mexique. En outre, l'immunosuppression induite exp&eacute;rimentalement chez des &eacute;quid&eacute;s pr&eacute;sentant une r&eacute;action positive &agrave; <EM>
T. equiperdum </EM>
n'a pas conduit &agrave; l'expression de signes cliniques. Enfin, les tentatives d'isolement de l'agent causal ont &eacute;chou&eacute;.</P>

</CENTER>
<P></STRONG>
<EM>
   </P>
<P></EM>
Le ministre de la sant&eacute; du Royaume-Uni a annonc&eacute; le 20 mars 1996 qu’un Comit&eacute; consultatif ind&eacute;pendant avait fait part au gouvernement du diagnostic de 10 cas de maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob pr&eacute;sentant des caract&eacute;ristiques nouvelles et coh&eacute;rentes. Cette affection produit chez l’homme des effets similaires &agrave; ceux de l’enc&eacute;phalopathie spongiforme bovine (BSE) chez les bovins. Bien qu’il ne soit pas scientifiquement prouv&eacute; que la BSE puisse se transmettre &agrave; l’homme par la consommation de viande de boeuf, le Comit&eacute; a retenu comme explication la plus probable &agrave; ce jour que ces cas de maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob seraient li&eacute;s &agrave; une exposition &agrave; la BSE avant 1989, c’est-&agrave;-dire avant l’interdiction au Royaume-Uni d’utiliser certains tissus d’origine bovine pour l’alimentation humaine. Le Comit&eacute; a recommand&eacute; que soient prises des mesures de pr&eacute;vention suppl&eacute;mentaires, dont le d&eacute;sossage dans des &eacute;tablissements sp&eacute;cialement agr&eacute;&eacute;s des carcasses de bovins &acirc;g&eacute;s de plus de 30 mois. Le gouvernement du Royaume-Uni a accept&eacute; ces recommandations, qui seront mises en application d&egrave;s que possible.</P>
<P>Cette d&eacute;claration, relay&eacute;e dans le monde entier, a mis en &eacute;moi l'opinion publique internationale et a des r&eacute;percussions sur la consommation et la commercialisation de la viande de boeuf dans toute l’Europe.</P>
<P>Les notifications et les actions portant sur la BSE au plan international sont r&eacute;sum&eacute;es ci-apr&egrave;s.</P>
<P>Les Pays Membres de l’OIE, notamment le Royaume-Uni et les pays touch&eacute;s avec une faible incidence par la BSE, fournissent aux Services v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires et aux organisations internationales, par l’interm&eacute;diaire de l’OIE, des informations portant sur le nombre de cas observ&eacute;s (voir tableau p. 34), sur les m&eacute;thodes utilis&eacute;es pour combattre la maladie, sur les r&eacute;sultats des recherches et sur les relations &eacute;ventuelles avec des affections apparent&eacute;es touchant d’autres esp&egrave;ces, y compris l’esp&egrave;ce humaine.</P>
<P>L’OIE a r&eacute;uni des experts sur la BSE &agrave; deux reprises en 1990 et une fois en 1991. L’objectif de ces r&eacute;unions &eacute;tait de communiquer aux Services v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires de tous les pays les informations connues sur cette maladie &eacute;mergente, et d'&eacute;laborer des recommandations concernant les proc&eacute;dures d’importation d'animaux et de produits d’origine animale, semence et embryons compris. Ces proc&eacute;dures ont &eacute;t&eacute; adopt&eacute;es par le Comit&eacute; international de l'OIE en mai 1992 et int&eacute;gr&eacute;es au <EM>
Code zoo-sanitaire international </EM>
de l'OIE, qui est le texte normatif de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence en la mati&egrave;re et qui est r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement mis &agrave; jour.</P>

<P>En 1994, l’OIE a de nouveau convoqu&eacute; un groupe d’experts pour d&eacute;terminer si des donn&eacute;es &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques r&eacute;centes ou de nouvelles d&eacute;couvertes devaient amener &agrave; r&eacute;viser le chapitre consacr&eacute; &agrave; la BSE dans le <EM>
Code zoo-sanitaire international</EM>
. Ont particip&eacute; &agrave; la r&eacute;union 25 sp&eacute;cialistes et observateurs venus de neuf pays, de l’Organisation mondiale de la sant&eacute; (OMS) et de la Commission europ&eacute;enne, y compris des experts de la maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob.</P>
<P>Ce groupe a rappel&eacute; que le Royaume-Uni est le seul pays ayant une incidence &eacute;lev&eacute;e de BSE. Les participants ont constat&eacute; avec satisfaction que la d&eacute;cision de 1988 interdisant de donner aux ruminants des aliments issus de ruminants s’&eacute;tait apparemment traduite par un d&eacute;clin persistant du taux d'infection au Royaume-Uni. Ils estimaient &agrave; cette &eacute;poque que les mesures analogues prises par les autres pays o&ugrave; des cas avaient &eacute;t&eacute; diagnostiqu&eacute;s &eacute;taient propres &agrave; pr&eacute;venir la propagation de la maladie et/ou &eacute;ventuellement l’&eacute;radiquer.</P>
<P>A l'&eacute;poque, des essais de transmission de la BSE et de maladies similaires entre esp&egrave;ces avaient &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;s. Rien ne prouvait avec certitude que les bovins pouvaient contracter la BSE par un autre mode de transmission que l'ingestion d'aliments contamin&eacute;s. Des recherches avaient n&eacute;anmoins &eacute;t&eacute; poursuivies sur les diff&eacute;rents modes de contamination possibles mais, compte tenu de la tr&egrave;s longue dur&eacute;e d’incubation de la maladie, les r&eacute;sultats n’&eacute;taient pas encore connus.</P>
<P>D&egrave;s les premiers &eacute;pisodes de BSE en Europe, le risque th&eacute;orique de transmission de cette maladie &agrave; l’homme avait &eacute;t&eacute; pris en compte et int&eacute;gr&eacute; dans tous les programmes nationaux de lutte contre la maladie. Les recherches ont continu&eacute; dans cet esprit. La confrontation des &eacute;tudes &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques sur la BSE et sur la maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob chez l’homme n’avait alors montr&eacute; aucune relation. La politique suivie par tous les pays touch&eacute;s, visant &agrave; r&eacute;duire dans toute la mesure du possible les risques de contamination des aliments et des produits pharmaceutiques &agrave; usage humain, &eacute;tait alors la seule politique acceptable que l'on pouvait adopter &agrave; ce moment l&agrave;. &Agrave; la lumi&egrave;re d’informations nouvelles sur la BSE, le Groupe a recommand&eacute; en 1994 de modifier le texte figurant dans le <EM>
Code zoo-sanitaire international</EM>
, ce qui a &eacute;t&eacute; approuv&eacute; par le Comit&eacute; international de l'OIE en mai 1995.</P>
<P>En collaboration &eacute;troite avec l’OIE qui a particip&eacute; aux travaux, l’OMS a &eacute;galement &eacute;t&eacute; active dans ce domaine. Elle a organis&eacute; des consultations en 1991 et en 1993 pour recueillir et communiquer aux pays les informations disponibles sur l’utilisation des tissus d’origine animale dans la pr&eacute;paration d’aliments, de substances m&eacute;dicamenteuses et d’autres produits destin&eacute;s &agrave; l’homme et aux animaux.</P>
<P>En mai 1995, l’OMS a r&eacute;uni une nouvelle consultation sur les probl&egrave;mes de sant&eacute; publique li&eacute;s aux enc&eacute;phalopathies spongiformes humaines et animales transmissibles. Les participants ont estim&eacute; que les r&eacute;sultats de l'&eacute;tude r&eacute;alis&eacute;e au Royaume-Uni qui semblait avoir mis en &eacute;vidence certains liens entre l’alimentation et la maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob, &eacute;taient dus &agrave; un biais de m&eacute;moire et n'indiquaient pas de lien causal. Il est ressorti de la consultation que l’ensemble des informations disponibles semblait indiquer que tous les mammif&egrave;res, y compris l’homme, doivent &ecirc;tre consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme potentiellement sensibles &agrave; l’BSE en cas d’exposition suffisante &agrave; la maladie, que les politiques alors suivies permettaient de r&eacute;duire au minimum les risques d’exposition de l’homme et des animaux, et que les donn&eacute;es &eacute;pid&eacute;miologiques en Europe n’indiquaient pas d’&eacute;volution de l'incidence de la maladie de Creutzfeldt-Jakob chez l’homme qui puisse &ecirc;tre imput&eacute;e &agrave; la BSE.</P>
<P>Dans le but d’aider les pays non touch&eacute;s &agrave; se pr&eacute;munir contre un risque &eacute;ventuel, l’OIE a parrain&eacute;, en f&eacute;vrier 1996, un cours de formation consacr&eacute; au diagnostic de la BSE, destin&eacute; &agrave; 14 pays appartenant &agrave; la Communaut&eacute; d'&Eacute;tats ind&eacute;pendants (CEI) ou aux r&eacute;publiques Baltes. Cette session s’est d&eacute;roul&eacute;e &agrave; Vladimir, en Russie.</P>
<P>Les activit&eacute;s men&eacute;es sur le plan international par l'Union europ&eacute;enne ne sont pas incluses dans le pr&eacute;sent r&eacute;sum&eacute;.</P>
<P>Comme l’indique la mise &agrave; jour du nombre de cas de BSE dans le monde rapport&eacute;s &agrave; l’OIE (page 34), l'incidence de la maladie a continu&eacute; de d&eacute;cliner au Royaume-Uni en 1995.</P>
<P>Compte tenu des r&eacute;cents r&eacute;sultats de la recherche au Royaume-Uni, et dans le cadre de leurs responsabilit&eacute;s sanitaires, l’OMS et l’OIE proposent de r&eacute;unir &agrave; nouveau des experts.</P>

&agrave; ce jour l'Institut v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire d'Onderstepoort a re&ccedil;u des pr&eacute;l&egrave;vements provenant de 54 chevaux que l'on pense &ecirc;tre morts de peste &eacute;quine. Le virus a &eacute;t&eacute; isol&eacute; et le s&eacute;rotype de 12 isolats a pu &ecirc;tre d&eacute;termin&eacute; : le s&eacute;rotype 4 a occasionn&eacute; la mort de huit des chevaux et les autres morts sont dues aux s&eacute;rotypes 1, 2 et 6. </P>

Mesures de prophylaxie adopt&eacute;es &agrave; ce jour : </STRONG>
</EM>
afin de limiter le nombre de foyers dans les zones &agrave; haut risque, il est conseill&eacute; aux propri&eacute;taires de chevaux de vacciner ou de revacciner leurs chevaux, de les garder &agrave; l'&eacute;curie de deux heures avant le coucher du soleil jusqu'&agrave; deux heures apr&egrave;s le lever du soleil, de lutter contre les vecteurs et de restreindre l'introduction des chevaux non vaccin&eacute;s dans  les zones &agrave; haut risque et leur sortie hors de ces zones.</P>

internacional de animales y productos de origen animal son considerables. Estas enfermedades son 
por lo general objeto de un informe anual, aunque en algunos casos, de acuerdo con lo dispuesto 
en los Art&iacute;culos 1.2.0.2 y 1.2.0.3 del <EM>C&oacute;digo Zoosanitario Internacional</EM>, pueden 
ser objeto de informes m&aacute;s frecuentes.

<P>La fiebre aftosa en los biongulados de Bulgaria ha sido controlada gracias a las medidas estrictas que se aplicaron para erradicar el foco (v&eacute;ase <EM>
Informaciones Sanitarias</EM>
, <STRONG>
9 </STRONG>
[46], 175). Estas medidas comprend&iacute;an principalmente el sacrificio de los animales infectados y de los animales que estuvieron en contacto con ellos, seguido por la destrucci&oacute;n de sus cad&aacute;veres, y el sacrificio de los animales susceptibles presentes en la zona epizo&oacute;tica del pueblo de Malko Sharkovo (regi&oacute;n de Yambol).</P>
<P>Durante dos meses, todos los biungulados del pa&iacute;s fueron objeto de ex&aacute;menes cl&iacute;nicos semanales para la b&uacute;squeda de la fiebre aftosa.</P>
<P>Adem&aacute;s, 4.039 muestras de sangre, de las cuales 3.019 fueron tomadas en la Zona A y 1.020 en la Zona B, fueron sometidas a pruebas entre el 29 de octubre de 1996 y el 4 de febrero de 1997. Todos los reba&ntilde;os de animales susceptibles presentes en estas zonas han sido cubiertos por el muestreo y ning&uacute;n animal se revel&oacute; portador de anticuerpos dirigidos contra el virus aftoso.</P>
<P>El 9 de febrero de 1997, se cumplieron tres meses desde el fin de la desinfecci&oacute;n del foco y de todas las dem&aacute;s actividades de erradicaci&oacute;n.</P>
<P>Considerando la estrategia de no vacunaci&oacute;n y de sacrificio sanitario que fue adoptada en Bulgaria para luchar contra la fiebre aftosa, y conforme con el Art&iacute;culo 2.1.1.2. del <EM>
C&oacute;digo Zoosanitario Internacional</EM>
, consideramos que Bulgaria est&aacute; en condiciones para recuperar la calificaci&oacute;n de libre de fiebre aftosa.</P>

17 de enero de 1997.</P>
<P>Un foco de enfermedad de Newcastle se present&oacute; en septiembre de 1996 en el parque zool&oacute;gico de Helsinki, situado en una isla frente a la capital (v&eacute;ase <EM>
Informaciones Sanitarias</EM>
, <STRONG>

[37], 142). Una serreta grande (<EM>
Mergus merganser</EM>
), tra&iacute;da el 18 de agosto de 1996 a una unidad aislada donde se trataba a los animales salvajes heridos y que pose&iacute;a su propio personal, muri&oacute; el 7 de septiembre. El 23 de septiembre, un examen virol&oacute;gico de rutina permiti&oacute; aislar el paramixovirus-1 (PMV-1) en el ave. El &iacute;ndice de patogenicidad por v&iacute;a intracerebral era de 1,37 (determinado por el Laboratorio Veterinario Central de Addlestone, Reino Unido, Laboratorio de referencia de la OIE para la enfermedad de Newcastle).</P>
<P>Las 12 otras aves presentes en la unidad no presentaron signos cl&iacute;nicos, pero 2 de ellas pose&iacute;an anticuerpos contra el paramixovirus-1. Se intent&oacute; aislar el virus a partir de muestras necr&oacute;psicas, sin ning&uacute;n resultado.</P>
<P>Las pruebas de aislamiento viral y el examen serol&oacute;gico fueron realizados en conformidad con la Directiva del Consejo Europeo nº 92/66/CEE, anexo III (aislamiento viral de huevos embrionados y prueba de inhibici&oacute;n de la hemaglutinaci&oacute;n), en el Instituto de Investigaciones Veterinarias y Alimentarias de Helsinki.</P>
<P>Se busc&oacute; evidencias serol&oacute;gicas de una infecci&oacute;n por el PMV-1 en las aves presentes en otras partes del parque zool&oacute;gico. Se examinaron muestras de suero de 117 aves. Leves t&iacute;tulos (1:16 - 1:64) se detectaron en 14 gansos. Estos t&iacute;tulos no se deb&iacute;an a una infecci&oacute;n activa, puesto que el an&aacute;lisis de muestras apareadas no mostr&oacute; ning&uacute;n incremento de estos t&iacute;tulos. Los gansos fueron sacrificados y los intentos de aislamiento <EM>
post mortem </EM>
del PMV-1 no dieron resultados positivos.</P>
<P>Se intent&oacute; aislar el virus de 70 aves en total (a partir de 42 muestras org&aacute;nicas tomadas post mortem y de 28 torundas cloacales), sin resultados positivos.</P>
<P>Todas las aves presentes en la unidad infectada fueron sacrificadas y destruidas tras un examen. Se limpi&oacute; y desinfect&oacute; la unidad. Se impuso medidas de restricci&oacute;n al parque zool&oacute;gico. Como no se detect&oacute; ning&uacute;n otro caso de infecci&oacute;n por el PMV-1 en otras partes del parque zool&oacute;gico, las medidas de restricci&oacute;n se suspendieron el 17 de diciembre de 1996.</P>
<P>Este parque zool&oacute;gico ya no recibir&aacute; animales salvajes heridos.</P>
<P>No se detect&oacute; ning&uacute;n otro caso de infecci&oacute;n por el PMV-1 en aves silvestres de otras partes del pa&iacute;s.</P>

<EM>
Traducci&oacute;n de un fax recibido el 8 de enero de 1997 del Doctor A.B. Niang, Director de Ganader&iacute;a, Ministerio de Agricultura, Dakar:</P>
<P></EM>
La peste bovina es una enfermedad sujeta a declaraci&oacute;n y a vacunaci&oacute;n obligatoria en Senegal desde 1962. Gracias a ello, la vacunaci&oacute;n masiva instaurada en el marco del programa mixto Nº 15 (PC 15) ha permitido controlar la enfermedad.</P>
<P>El &uacute;ltimo foco de peste bovina en animales senegaleses se registr&oacute; en 1968 y se aplic&oacute; el sacrificio sanitario para impedir su extensi&oacute;n. </P>
<P>En 1978 se registr&oacute; un foco en animales que trashumaban por el norte del Senegal y que proven&iacute;an de un pa&iacute;s vecino.</P>
<P>En 1991 se llev&oacute; a cabo, en el marco de la Campa&ntilde;a Panafricana de Lucha contra la Peste Bovina (PARC), una encuesta de vigilancia serol&oacute;gica para evaluar la eficacia de las campa&ntilde;as de vacunaci&oacute;n contra la peste bovina. Los resultados de la encuesta indicaron que el grado de protecci&oacute;n inmunitaria de los animales de m&aacute;s de tres a&ntilde;os de edad variaba entre un 80% y un 91%, y que el grado de protecci&oacute;n inmunitaria de los animales de menos de tres a&ntilde;os era bajo (entre un 37% y un 73%). La encuesta realizada en 1992 indic&oacute; la misma tendencia.</P>
<P>En vista de ello, en 1993 se adopt&oacute; una estrategia de vacunaci&oacute;n distinta, repartida en un per&iacute;odo de cuatro a&ntilde;os:</P>
<P>1er a&ntilde;o (1994)	Vacunaci&oacute;n masiva de los animales, sin distinci&oacute;n de edad, en las zonas en que los resultados de la vigilancia serol&oacute;gica hab&iacute;an sido insuficientes, para reforzar el grado de inmunidad. En las dem&aacute;s regiones solamente fueron vacunados los bovinos menores de tres a&ntilde;os.</P>
<P>2º a&ntilde;o (1995)	Vacunaci&oacute;n masiva en algunas zonas del territorio nacional en que los resultados de la encuesta serol&oacute;gica de 1994 hab&iacute;an indicado un grado bajo de protecci&oacute;n inmunitaria, y vacunaci&oacute;n de los animales menores de tres a&ntilde;os en el resto del territorio.</P>
<P>3er a&ntilde;o (1996)	Vacunaci&oacute;n de los bovinos menores de tres a&ntilde;os en todo el territorio nacional. La encuesta de vigilancia serol&oacute;gica se llev&oacute; a cabo al final de cada campa&ntilde;a de vacunaci&oacute;n.</P>
<P>4º a&ntilde;o (1997)	Interrupci&oacute;n definitiva de la vacunaci&oacute;n contra la peste bovina en todo el territorio nacional y vigilancia epidemiol&oacute;gica de la enfermedad.</P>
<P>La vacunaci&oacute;n contra la peste bovina ha sido definitivamente interrumpida en Senegal desde el mes de octubre de 1996. Todas las vacunas contra la peste bovina han sido retiradas de las oficinas de terreno de los Servicios Veterinarios y almacenadas en el Laboratorio Nacional de Zootecnia e Investigaciones Veterinarias de Dakar.</P>
<P>Se ha instaurado un sistema de vigilancia epidemiol&oacute;gica de la peste bovina que comprende una unidad epidemiol&oacute;gica central y un dispositivo de terreno formado por todos los agentes del sector ganadero y articulado en torno a una red de seis laboratorios.</P>
<P>La unidad epidemiol&oacute;gica est&aacute; compuesta por  los veterinarios de la Direcci&oacute;n de Ganader&iacute;a y los que trabajan en la investigaci&oacute;n y se encarga de realizar peri&oacute;dicamente encuestas epidemiol&oacute;gicas en el terreno.</P>
<P>En lo relativo al dispositivo de vigilancia cl&iacute;nica, se han seleccionado veintitr&eacute;s puntos del territorio nacional para encuestas de terreno. Los agentes han recibido la formaci&oacute;n necesaria para el reconocimiento de los signos cl&iacute;nicos de la peste bovina.</P>
<P>La vacunaci&oacute;n de ovinos y caprinos contra la peste de peque&ntilde;os rumiantes por medio de la vacuna contra la peste bovina ha sido suspendida este a&ntilde;o.</P>
<P>En vista de los hechos arriba expuestos, Senegal se declara "provisionalmente libre de peste bovina".</P>

<P></STRONG>
<EM>
Traducci&oacute;n de un parte recibido el 8 de enero de 1997 del Doctor P. Ackah Angniman, Delegado de C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire ante la OIE:</P>
<P></EM>
Dada la ausencia de casos de peste bovina en C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire desde 1986, el pa&iacute;s se ha declarado "libre de peste bovina", de conformidad con los m&eacute;todos estandares recomendados por la OIE para la vigilancia epidemiol&oacute;gica de esta enfermedad.</P>
<P>Desde 1986 la C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire aplica una pol&iacute;tica preventiva que combina:</P>
<P>la vacunaci&oacute;n anual de los animales;</P>
<P>el control serol&oacute;gico postvacunal mediante sondeo anual de animales escogidos al azar;</P>
<P>la vacunaci&oacute;n sistem&aacute;tica de los animales importados;</P>
<P>la vigilancia del territorio y de las fronteras, que permite la declaraci&oacute;n sistem&aacute;tica de cualquier sospecha de enfermedad contagiosa.</P>
<P>La vigilancia del territorio es una misi&oacute;n de la que se encargan actualmente los agentes de los servicios exteriores del Ministerio de Agricultura y los veterinarios privados instalados en zonas rurales.</P>
<P>Todo caso de enfermedad contagiosa es declarado a la Direcci&oacute;n Regional de Agricultura y Recursos Pecuarios por la la Direcci&oacute;n Provincial. La informaci&oacute;n es transmitida seguidamente a la Direcci&oacute;n de los Servicios Veterinarios, que se encarga de comunicarla a OIE.</P>
<P>Dada la estabilidad de la situaci&oacute;n de la peste bovina y la presencia de un sistema de vigilancia de los focos ocasionales, la C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire ha decidido cesar la vacunaci&oacute;n contra la peste bovina a partir del a&ntilde;o 1996, reserv&aacute;ndose la posibilidad de intervenir inmediatamente en caso de aparici&oacute;n de la enfermedad.</P>

vacas de raza frisona en dos unidades de producci&oacute;n lechera intensiva. La mayor parte de los casos eran bovinos importados de Europa del Norte desde marzo de 1996. Dos terneros nacidos de vacas afectadas han muerto.</P>

<EM>
Diagn&oacute;stico:</P>
<P>A.	Conclusiones actuales sobre la &iacute;ndole del agente causal: </STRONG>
</EM>
virus de tipo O y subtipo O1 Manisa.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
B.	Comentarios relativos al diagn&oacute;stico: </STRONG>
</EM>
el diagn&oacute;stico fue confirmado por el Laboratorio de Virolog&iacute;a del Departamento de Sanidad Animal y por el Laboratorio Mundial de Referencia de la OIE para la fiebre aftosa (Pirbright, Reino Unido). El virus se aisl&oacute; a partir de la l&iacute;nea celular BHK21-C13 y se identific&oacute; mediante el uso de un kit ELISA suministrado por el Laboratorio de Pirbright.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios sobre la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
el origen del virus se desconoce. Se supone que quedaba presente en animales portadores que se recuperaron de la enfermedad desde el brote precedente. Se propag&oacute; probablemente por contacto directo entre los animales, e indirectamente por el intermedio de fomites y de desplazamientos humanos. Las vacas hab&iacute;an sido vacunadas contra la fiebre aftosa.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas durante el per&iacute;odo que abarca el presente informe: </STRONG>
</EM>
tratamiento de los animales enfermos para aliviar las partes inflamadas y evitar una infecci&oacute;n secundaria. Aplicaci&oacute;n de medidas sanitarias.</P>

Traducci&oacute;n de extractos de un fax recibido el 11 de diciembre de 1996 del Doctor I. Tabakovski, Director de Servicios Veterinarios, Ministerio de Agricultura, Bosques y Agua, Skopje:</P>
<P></EM>
La Oficina Veterinaria del Ministerio de Agricultura, Bosques y Agua ha decidido anunciar que la ex-Rep&uacute;blica yugoslava de Macedonia estaba libre de fiebre aftosa.</P>
<P>Esta decisi&oacute;n ha sido tomada considerando la evoluci&oacute;n de la situaci&oacute;n de la enfermedad en 1996 (v&eacute;ase <EM>
Informaciones Sanitarias</EM>
, <STRONG>
9 </STRONG>
[25], 87 y [30], 114).</P>
<P>Los focos de fiebre aftosa se localizaron en dos zonas (regi&oacute;n de Skopje y municipio de Veles) y s&oacute;lo los bovinos fueron afectados.</P>
<P>Todos los animales susceptibles presentes en las zonas afectadas fueron sacrificados, y sus cad&aacute;veres fueron destruidos.</P>
<P>Las zonas afectadas fueron objeto de desinfecci&oacute;n, desinsectaci&oacute;n y eliminaci&oacute;n de roedores.</P>
<P>El territorio del pa&iacute;s fue dividido en zonas con vacunaci&oacute;n y zonas sin vacunaci&oacute;n, para asegurar un mejor control de los animales y sus productos, y reducir el riesgo de propagaci&oacute;n de la enfermedad.</P>
<P>Operaciones de vacunaci&oacute;n y revacunaci&oacute;n fueron llevadas a cabo, excepto para los ovinos puesto que pasaron el verano y el oto&ntilde;o en monta&ntilde;a.</P>
<P>No se present&oacute; ning&uacute;n nuevo foco durante un per&iacute;odo determinado por la reglamentaci&oacute;n sobre la fiebre aftosa.</P>
<P>Se prohibi&oacute; la exportaci&oacute;n de animales y productos de origen animal.</P>
<P>Cabe se&ntilde;alar que la Oficina Veterinaria ha aceptado la propuesta de la Comisi&oacute;n Europea de Lucha contra la Fiebre Aftosa (FAO) de llevar a cabo una encuesta serol&oacute;gica en la poblaci&oacute;n animal del pa&iacute;s de aqu&iacute; al final de 1996.</P>

Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas durante el per&iacute;odo que abarca el presente informe:</P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
Aplicaci&oacute;n de medidas estrictas de cuarentena en la poblaci&oacute;n de Malko Sharkovo.</P>
<P>Prohibici&oacute;n, en todo el pa&iacute;s, de los desplazamientos de animales, del sacrificio y del comercio de animales de pezu&ntilde;a hendida y de sus productos.</P>
<P>Suspensi&oacute;n de las exportaciones de animales vivos y de productos de origen animal.</P>
<P>Inspecci&oacute;n cl&iacute;nica individual de los animales de pezu&ntilde;a hendida en todas las regiones ganaderas del pa&iacute;s.</P>
<P>Sacrificio sin efusi&oacute;n de sangre, el 29 de octubre de 1996, de todos los animales enfermos y de los animales que estuvieron en contacto con ellos (89 bovinos, 11 ovinos, 14 cabras y 47 cerdos), y destrucci&oacute;n en el sitio de sus cad&aacute;veres. </P>
<P>Transporte de los dem&aacute;s animales susceptibles de la aldea que no fueron afectados por la enfermedad, bajo vigilancia veterinaria, hasta un matadero situado en la ciudad de Elhovo (regi&oacute;n de Yambol); sacrificio de estos animales (74 bovinos, 929 ovinos, 86 cabras y 246 cerdos) en las condiciones sanitarias requeridas; tratamiento t&eacute;rmico de las carnes obtenidas.</P>
<P>Desinfecci&oacute;n del foco, concluida el 9 de noviembre de 1996, y del matadero de Elhovo.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Resultados:</P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
Los ex&aacute;menes cl&iacute;nicos realizados hasta la fecha y las 2.843 muestras sangu&iacute;neas tomadas en todas las granjas de las poblaciones situadas dentro de un radio de 10 a 15 km del foco y sometidas a la prueba serol&oacute;gica ELISA no revelaron ning&uacute;n nuevo caso de fiebre aftosa ni ning&uacute;n animal seropositivo.</P>
<P>Una misi&oacute;n compuesta de expertos de la Comisi&oacute;n Europea de Lucha contra la Fiebre Aftosa (FAO) y de la Comisi&oacute;n Europea acudi&oacute; al lugar dos veces (del 31 de octubre al 4 de noviembre, luego del 25 al 28 de noviembre de 1996) para enterarse de la situaci&oacute;n y de las medidas tomadas. La misi&oacute;n consider&oacute; que las medidas hab&iacute;an sido adecuadas, prontas y eficaces para evitar la propagaci&oacute;n del virus a nuevos animales.</P>
<P>Las medidas tomadas hasta la fecha por el Servicio Veterinario Nacional, que no contemplan el recurso a la vacunaci&oacute;n contra la fiebre aftosa, permiten asegurar, 30 d&iacute;as despu&eacute;s de la erradicaci&oacute;n del foco, que la situaci&oacute;n est&aacute; bajo control y que la enfermedad no se propagar&aacute; a otras regiones del pa&iacute;s.</P>

<EM>
Traducci&oacute;n de un extracto de un fax recibido el 2 de julio de 1996 del Doctor G. Murray, Jefe de Servicios Veterinarios, Ministerio de Industrias Primarias y Energ&iacute;a, Canberra:</P>
<P>Antecedentes</P>
<P></EM>
Un quir&oacute;ptero frug&iacute;voro de la especie <EM>
Pteropus alecto</EM>
, encontrado enfermo al borde de la carretera en las afueras de Ballina (en la costa septentrional del Estado de Nueva Gales del Sur), fue entregado por un protector de quir&oacute;pteros al laboratorio veterinario regional de Wollongbar (Nueva Gales del Sur). El animal no pod&iacute;a volar y temblaba ligeramente.</P>
<P>El laboratorio procedi&oacute; a su autopsia y tom&oacute; muestras de sangre y de tejidos para someterlas a ex&aacute;menes. Los tejidos fueron enviados al Instituto de Investigaciones Veterinarias de Yeerongpilly (Estado de Queensland) para la detecci&oacute;n del morbilivirus equino y al Laboratorio Australiano de Sanidad Animal (AAHL*) de Geelong para descartar la hip&oacute;tesis de morbilivirosis y de rabia.</P>
<P><EM>
Resultados obtenidos por los laboratorios</P>
<P></EM>
La autopsia no di&oacute; ning&uacute;n resultado concluyente. El examen histopatol&oacute;gico revel&oacute; una encefalitis grave, difusa y sin supuraci&oacute;n, lo cual concuerda con los signos cl&iacute;nicos. </P>
<P>Las pruebas de detecci&oacute;n del morbilivirus equino resultaron negativas.</P>
<P>La prueba con inmunoperoxidasa para la detecci&oacute;n de lisavirus result&oacute; positiva. La reactividad se manifest&oacute; solamente en c&eacute;lulas nerviosas del cerebro y del tracto gastrointestinal; los dem&aacute;s tejidos resultaron negativos.</P>
<P>Las pruebas de anticuerpos fluorescentes para el ant&iacute;geno lisavirus resultaron positivas. El microscopio electr&oacute;nico permiti&oacute; observar corp&uacute;sculos de inclusi&oacute;n en las neuronas. Se observaron igualmente estructuras de tipo viral sumamente evocadoras de infecci&oacute;n por rabdovirus, aunque no se observaron las cl&aacute;sicas part&iacute;culas en forma de "bala", debido seguramente a la t&eacute;cnica de fijaci&oacute;n utilizada.</P>
<P>Una prueba de seroneutralizaci&oacute;n con la sangre del quir&oacute;ptero dio resultado negativo en la prueba de detecci&oacute;n del lisavirus de serotipo 1, que es el virus cl&aacute;sico de la rabia. Pero se admiti&oacute; que el animal pod&iacute;a haber muerto antes de que los anticuerpos tuvieran tiempo de desarrollarse.</P>
<P>* <EM>
Australian Animal Health Laboratory.</P>
<P>Traducci&oacute;n del extracto de un fax recibido el 11 de septiembre de 1996 del Doctor G. Murray:</P>
<P></EM>
Un quir&oacute;ptero de Townsville (al norte del Estado de Queensland) que presentaba s&iacute;ntomas nerviosos fue sometido a autopsia por un laboratorio. La reactividad observada en el cerebro de este quir&oacute;ptero fue la misma que la que se observ&oacute; en los tejidos del quir&oacute;ptero de Nueva Gales del Sur. El virus de Nueva Gales del Sur y este nuevo virus de Queensland se acercan m&aacute;s a los lisavirus de genotipo 1 y de genotipo 5 que a los dem&aacute;s lisavirus.</P>
<P>Se ha enviado un aislado al CDC* de Atlanta (Estados Unidos de Am&eacute;rica) para que identifique y caracterice el virus.</P>
<P>* <EM>
Center for Disease Control.</P>
<P>Traducci&oacute;n del extracto de un fax recibido el 8 de noviembre de 1996 del Doctor G. Murray:</P>
<P></EM>
Un lisavirus ha sido aislado ya de cinco muestras tomadas de dos especies de quir&oacute;pteros frug&iacute;voros (<EM>
Pteropus alecto </EM>
y <EM>
P. scapulatus</EM>
). Las muestras pertenec&iacute;an a animales enfermos encontrados en Townsville, en la costa sudoriental del Estado de Queensland y en la costa septentrional del Estado de Nueva Gales del Sur.</P>
<P>Las Autoridades sanitarias del Estado de Queensland se&ntilde;alan el primer caso de transmisi&oacute;n del virus en Australia a una protectora de animales de Rockhampton que hab&iacute;a cuidado a quir&oacute;pteros heridos. La mujer se encuentra ingresada en estado grave en el Hospital Real de Brisbane. Se espera el diagn&oacute;stico definitivo, pero no se ha aislado por ahora ning&uacute;n virus.</P>
<P><EM>
Estudio del lisavirus</P>
<P></EM>
Seg&uacute;n el AAHL, el virus aislado de las cinco muestras precitadas es biol&oacute;gica y gen&eacute;ticamente el mismo y est&aacute; estrechamente emparentado con el virus cl&aacute;sico de la rabia (serogrupo 1, genotipo 1) y con el <EM>
European Bat Lyssavirus </EM>
(EBL) 1 y 2 (serogrupo 5, genotipos 5 y 6). No obstante, este nuevo estudio demuestra que el genoma de este lisavirus difiere aproximadamente un 8% del serotipo 1 y del serogrupo 5 y debe por consiguiente ser considerado como un genotipo  nuevo.</P>
<P>El CDC ha formulado las siguientes conclusiones:</P>
<P><STRONG>
.	</STRONG>
este lisavirus provoca par&aacute;lisis ascendente y encefalomielitis cuando se inocula a ratones por v&iacute;a perif&eacute;rica,</P>
<P><STRONG>
.</STRONG>
	las vacunas antirr&aacute;bicas de uso humano o veterinario, incluidas las vacunas subunitarias, protegen contra este lisavirus y</P>
<P><STRONG>
.</STRONG>
	el suero de las personas vacunadas contra la rabia neutraliza el virus del mismo modo que el suero de referencia hiperinmune.</P>
<P>Los aislamientos efectuados hasta la fecha indican que un lisavirus lleva ya tiempo circulando en una zona geogr&aacute;fica extensa y en dos especies de quir&oacute;pteros frug&iacute;voros por lo menos.</P>
<P>Por lo que se refiere a la rabia cl&aacute;sica (virus del serogrupo 1), no se ha observado en Australia ning&uacute;n caso de infecci&oacute;n r&aacute;bica humana o animal de origen aut&oacute;ctono durante los dos &uacute;ltimos a&ntilde;os (en realidad, desde 1867).</P>
<P>En lo relativo a la situaci&oacute;n de la rabia en Australia, consideramos que el lisavirus aislado en quir&oacute;pteros frug&iacute;voros es equivalente al EBL 1 y 2. Por consiguiente, de acuerdo con lo dispuesto en el <EM>
C&oacute;digo Zoosanitario Internacional</EM>
, que define las condiciones que debe reunir un pa&iacute;s para ser considerado libre de rabia (Art&iacute;culo 3.1.5.2, p&aacute;rrafo 4), Australia seguir&aacute; consider&aacute;ndose libre de rabia.</P>

Traducci&oacute;n de un fax recibido el 14 de noviembre de 1996 del Doctor P.P. Bosman, Director-Jefe de Servicios Veterinarios y Mejoras Pecuarias, Pretoria:</P>
<P></EM>
S. R. - 1</P>
<P>El 5 de noviembre de 1996 se notific&oacute; a esta Direcci&oacute;n que 16 trabajadores de uno de los dos mataderos de avestruces de la Cooperativa Klein Karoo, situados en Oudtshoorn, se hallaban aparentemente afectados por la fiebre hemorr&aacute;gica de Crimea-Congo (FHCC). Las actividades de los dos mataderos fueron inmediatamente suspendidas y no se reanudar&aacute;n hasta que no se conozcan los resultados de la encuesta emprendida por la Direcci&oacute;n de Salud P&uacute;blica Veterinaria, el Ministerio de Sanidad, el Instituto Nacional de Virolog&iacute;a y los responsables de la cooperativa.</P>
<P>1.	La unidad de FHCC del Hospital de Tygerberg (El Cabo) lleva a cabo desde el 11 de noviembre un estudio epidemiol&oacute;gico detenido, el cual revela que:</P>
<P>1.1.	Se han identificado dieciseis pacientes de contacto primario y todos ellos, as&iacute; como sus familiares y amigos, han sido sometidos a ex&aacute;menes serol&oacute;gicos y son todav&iacute;a objeto de vigilancia y cuidados m&eacute;dicos intensivos.</P>
<P>1.2.	Ha muerto una paciente en fase aguda de la enfermedad, principalmente por deficiencia de su sistema inmunitario. Todos los dem&aacute;s pacientes (salvo uno) han desarrollado ya anticuerpos espec&iacute;ficos, lo que permite pronosticar su completa curaci&oacute;n.</P>
<P>1.3.	Un interrogatorio minucioso de todos los pacientes y trabajadores del matadero ha revelado que de las 16 personas afectadas 8 trabajaban en la secci&oacute;n de desplume, 5 en la de desolladura, 1 en la de evisceraci&oacute;n y 2 en la de aturdimiento.</P>
<P>1.4.	En comparaci&oacute;n con los trabajadores de otros sectores del matadero, los trabajadores afectados presentaban todos distintos grados de abrasi&oacute;n y heridas en el dorso y la palma de las manos y en la parte anterior de las extremidades inferiores.</P>
<P>1.5.	Todos los trabajadores afectados se encontraban en la misma cadena de sacrificio cuando se produjo el incidente. Cabe pensar por lo tanto que se trata de un foco de enfermedad provocado por una misma fuente de infecci&oacute;n, la cual es - con casi toda seguridad - una sola avestruz manipulada por esos mismos trabajadores durante las operaciones de aturdimiento, desplume y desolladura.</P>
<P>1.6.	Como consecuencia de las fuertes lluvias registradas en algunas zonas que suministran avestruces a los mataderos de Oudtshoorn, se observ&oacute; una infestaci&oacute;n anormal de garrapatas en las avestruces suministradas.  </P>
<P>1.7.	M&aacute;s de 30 subespecies de garrapatas del g&eacute;nero <EM>
Hyalomma </EM>
pueden ser vectores de la enfermedad.</P>
<P>1.8.	La forma asintom&aacute;tica de la enfermedad es end&eacute;mica en el ganado bovino y ovino de Sud&aacute;frica.</P>
<P>1.9.	El virus es relativamente l&aacute;bil y no sobrevive en la sangre seca, en condiciones de alta temperatura (cocci&oacute;n de la carne) o de pH bajo (< 6), ni en la carne sometida a una proceso de maduraci&oacute;n.</P>
<P>2.	Durante una reuni&oacute;n celebrada el 6 de noviembre en Oudtshoorn por todas las partes interesadas, se tomaron las siguientes decisiones:</P>
<P>2.1.	Los mataderos de la cooperativa Klein Karo permanecer&aacute;n cerrados por lo menos 14 d&iacute;as m&aacute;s, hasta que se hayan aclarado todos los hechos relacionados con este suceso; los productores que les suministran avestruces tendr&aacute;n as&iacute; tiempo de establecer las medidas de control indicadas.</P>
<P>2.2.	Se exigir&aacute; la prueba certificada de que las avestruces han sido tratadas con acaricidas por lo menos 14 d&iacute;as antes de su sacrificio. S&oacute;lo se admitir&aacute;n en el matadero las avestruces exentas de garrapatas.</P>
<P>2.3.	Se adoptar&aacute;n medidas de seguridad complementarias para evitar que los trabajadores del matadero tengan contacto con garrapatas infectadas.</P>
<P>2.4.	Se emprender&aacute;n de inmediato investigaciones sobre la patogenia del virus de la FHCC en las avestruces y sobre la infecciosidad de sus carnes despu&eacute;s de haber sido parasitadas por garrapatas posiblemente infectadas. Los resultados de estas investigaciones se conocer&aacute;n dentro de 6 a 8 semanas.</P>
<P>2.5.	La carne de las avestruces sacrificadas despu&eacute;s del 22 de octubre en los dos mataderos de la Cooperativa Klein Karoo de Oudtshoorn no se exportar&aacute; mientras no se hayan obtenido datos seguros sobre su infecciosidad. No obstante, los estudios sobre el ganado bovino y ovino en las zonas endemicamente infestadas por garrapatas de la especie <EM>
Hyalomma </EM>
confirman que la carne sometida a un proceso de maduraci&oacute;n durante por lo menos 24 horas no presenta ning&uacute;n peligro para el consumo humano. Cabe pensar que los resultados de estos estudios son tambi&eacute;n v&aacute;lidos para la carne de avestruz y, dado que la maduraci&oacute;n y la refrigeraci&oacute;n son procedimientos normalizados en todos los mataderos autorizados de Sud&aacute;frica, la carne de avestruz sometida a un proceso de maduraci&oacute;n no deber&iacute;a presentar tampoco ning&uacute;n peligro para el consumo humano. Se realizan actualmente pruebas suplementarias.</P>
<P>2.6.	El foco de FHCC que desgraciadamente ha afectado a personas, se ha limitado a un matadero de la Cooperativa Klein Karoo. Ning&uacute;n otro matadero de avestruces, incluidos los que tienen autorizaci&oacute;n de exportar carne de avestruz, se ha visto afectado por este foco, por lo que el incidente de Oudtshoorn no pone de ning&uacute;n modo en tela de juicio la situaci&oacute;n sanitaria de estos mataderos. Las medidas de control adoptadas (tratamiento acaricida antes del sacrificio y per&iacute;odo de espera obligatorio de 14 d&iacute;as) se aplicar&aacute;n sin embargo a otros mataderos de avestruces.</P>

se cree que animales importados para ser sacrificados est&eacute;n al origen de la infecci&oacute;n. Antes de ponerlos a la venta, fueron llevados a una reserva de pastos perteneciente al gobierno pero que es manejada por un grupo de criadores que practica tambi&eacute;n el comercio de ganado.</P>

<P>El 27 de septiembre de 1996, se levant&oacute; la cuarentena para el &uacute;ltimo establecimiento que permanec&iacute;a en observaci&oacute;n en el Estado de Missouri.</P>
<P>En total 16 establecimientos hab&iacute;an sido puestos en cuarentena (2 establecimientos de cr&iacute;a de aves ornamentales y viviendas). Un total de 541 aves fueron examinadas a partir de torundas cloacales para determinar si estaban afectadas por la enfermedad de Newcastle por virus vel&oacute;g&eacute;nico viscerotr&oacute;pico; se estableci&oacute; un diagn&oacute;stico positivo en 7 aves repartidas en 5 establecimientos.</P>
<P>El sacrificio sanitario se aplic&oacute; comprando y destruyendo el lote de loros j&oacute;venes afectados. La cuarentena fue levantada en todos los establecimientos despu&eacute;s que dos ex&aacute;menes de torundas cloacales de las aves restantes, realizados con un intevalo de 15 d&iacute;as, dieron resultados negativos.</P>
<P>Las aves expuestas no mostraron s&iacute;ntomas de la enfermedad, en ning&uacute;n momento. Ning&uacute;n establecimiento afectado se hallaba en las inmediaciones de explotaciones comerciales, por lo consiguiente ninguna explotaci&oacute;n comercial estuvo expuesta a la enfermedad. </P>

<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos a los animales afectados: </STRONG>
</EM>
se comprob&oacute; un solo caso cl&iacute;nico. Se trataba de un cormor&aacute;n de doble cresta (<EM>
Phalacrocorax auritus</EM>
) llevado a un centro de rehabilitaci&oacute;n de aves. El ave muri&oacute; de la enfermedad. Ning&uacute;n otro caso sospechoso ha sido se&ntilde;alado este a&ntilde;o en la poblaci&oacute;n de cormoranes.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos al diagn&oacute;stico: </STRONG>
</EM>
el diagn&oacute;stico fue confirmado el 30 de septiembre de 1996 por el Instituto de Investigaciones Zoosanitarias de Hull (Qu&eacute;bec). El &iacute;ndice de patogenicidad por v&iacute;a intracerebral fue de 1,38.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos, hasta la fecha, a la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
&iacute;ndices semejantes de patogenicidad fueron encontrados en 1990, 1992 y 1995 en aislados procedentes de cormoranes. La enfermedad no se propag&oacute; a las poblaciones aviares dom&eacute;sticas. En esta ocasi&oacute;n tampoco se observ&oacute; contaminaci&oacute;n de las aves de corral.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas hasta la fecha: </STRONG>
</EM>
imposici&oacute;n de cuarentena en el centro de salvamento y muestreo de las aves que estuvieron en contacto con el ave infectada. Se est&aacute; distribuyendo folletos informativos actualizados a los avicultores canadienses. Se dar&aacute; la alerta a todas las regiones para que acrecenten la vigilancia y se&ntilde;alen cualquier caso sospechoso.</P>

municipio de Aldama, Estado de Tamaulipas.</P>
<P>La presencia del virus de encefalomielitis equina del este (EEE) fue establecida en los equinos que presentaron neuropat&iacute;as. De 106 animales enfermos, 92 han muerto. El &uacute;ltimo caso se registr&oacute; el 4 de octubre de 1996.</P>
<P>En la zona focal, que tiene un radio de 15 km, se encuentran 840 caballos repartidos en 35 rancher&iacute;as. Se considera como zona perifocal al resto del municipio de Aldama, Tamaulipas, con una poblaci&oacute;n aproximada de 6.000 equinos.</P>
<P>El programa de control de vectores en la zona focal y perifocal y la investigaci&oacute;n epidemiol&oacute;gica han sido mantenidos. A la fecha no se han detectado casos humanos.</P>
<P>La prohibici&oacute;n de la movilizaci&oacute;n de equinos dentro del Estado de Tamaulipas y hacia el resto del pa&iacute;s sigue en vigor.</P>
<P>A partir del primer reporte y en forma preventiva, se inici&oacute; un programa de vacunaci&oacute;n contra la encefalomielitis equina venezolana en donde se inmunizaron 6.272 equinos focal y perifocal. Una vez confirmado el diagn&oacute;stico se estableci&oacute; un nuevo programa de vacunaci&oacute;n con vacuna espec&iacute;fica contra la EEE con una cobertura de 10.000 equinos en el municipio afectado y tres municipios aleda&ntilde;os como zona de amortiguamiento.</P>

Texto de un fax recibido el 2 de octubre de 1996 del Doctor A.O. Flores Hern&aacute;ndez, Director General de Salud Animal, Secretar&iacute;a de Agricultura, Ganader&iacute;a y Desarrollo Rural, Ciudad de M&eacute;xico:</P>
<P></EM>
S. R. - 1</P>
<P>El Dispositivo Nacional de Emergencia en Salud Animal (DINESA) viene investigando casos de neuropat&iacute;as en equinos que se han presentado a partir del 21 de septiembre de 1996 en el municipio de Aldama en el Estado de Tamaulipas. Hasta la fecha se han registrado 55 casos (29 enfermos y 26 muertos). Se encuentran en un radio de 10 km en 23 rancher&iacute;as con un inventario aproximado de 505 cabezas. La enfermedad que se sospecha es encefalomielitis equina venezolana (EEV).</P>
<P>Al d&iacute;a 29 de septiembre de 1996 se han adoptado las siguientes medidas:</P>
<P>a)	Acciones sanitarias:</P>
<P>-	Investigaci&oacute;n y vigilancia epizootiol&oacute;gica en el &aacute;rea de los casos y regi&oacute;n perifocal hasta 40 km alrededor del foco.</P>
<P>-	Prohibici&oacute;n de la movilizaci&oacute;n de equinos fuera del municipio afectado.</P>
<P>-	Programa preventivo de vacunaci&oacute;n contra la EEV en los 505 equinos del &aacute;rea afectada. Iniciaci&oacute;n de vacunaci&oacute;n en el &aacute;rea perifocal en la cual se encuentran aproximadamente 5.500 cabezas.</P>
<P>b)	Rastreo epizootiol&oacute;gico con toma de muestras.– A la fecha se han colectado 44 sueros de animales enfermos y sus contactos, de los cuales se han procesado 29. Se cuenta adem&aacute;s con 4 enc&eacute;falos y otros &oacute;rganos.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Resultados preliminares:</P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
-	Diez de los sueros examinados muestran t&iacute;tulos de anticuerpos contra la EEV, en un rango de 1:10 a 1:640 (los equinos del &aacute;rea tienen antecedentes de vacunaci&oacute;n).</P>
<P>-	Se est&aacute; intentando el aislamiento viral sin resultados hasta el momento.</P>

<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios sobre la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad:</P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
Se ha podido f&aacute;cilmente determinar que la contaminaci&oacute;n de los focos secundarios se produjo por contacto directo con otros focos, principalmente mediante el compartimiento de los pastos y de las fuentes de agua. En cambio, las investigaciones epidemiol&oacute;gicas no consiguieron determinar el origen de la enfermedad en los focos primarios y el modo exacto de introducci&oacute;n del virus.</P>
<P>Se puede descartar con toda seguridad la hip&oacute;tesis de focos primarios debidos a contactos directos con animales infectados procedentes de m&aacute;s all&aacute; de las fronteras. En efecto, ning&uacute;n animal fue introducido durante los &uacute;ltimos meses en los focos primarios, y estas explotaciones no recurren a m&eacute;todos de explotaci&oacute;n que pudiesen favorecer la coexistencia temporal del ganado con animales susceptibles procedentes de m&aacute;s all&aacute; de las fronteras.</P>
<P>Ahora bien, la &uacute;nica hip&oacute;tesis veros&iacute;mil ser&iacute;a la de contactos indirectos, particularmente mediante personas. Aunque los conocimientos epidemiol&oacute;gicos cl&aacute;sicos sobre la viruela ovina no apoyan este modo de transmisi&oacute;n, la frecuencia y la intensidad del tr&aacute;fico de personas y veh&iacute;culos que cruzan la frontera en esta &aacute;rea bien tal vez acrecenten las oportunidades de transmisi&oacute;n indirecta. Se tiene la certeza que el foco de Xanthi, por ejemplo, se relaciona con movimientos de personas a trav&eacute;s de las fronteras.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas durante el per&iacute;odo que abarca el presente informe: </STRONG>
</EM>
sacrificio sanitario; ausencia de vacunaci&oacute;n; instauraci&oacute;n de zonas de protecci&oacute;n y vigilancia alrededor de los focos con control estricto de los desplazamientos en dichas zonas.</P>

se evidenci&oacute; la presencia de ant&iacute;genos virales por el m&eacute;todo de inmunodifusi&oacute;n en gel de agar en el Laboratorio de Referencia de Muguga (Kenia). Sin embargo, estos resultados no han sido corroborados por el Laboratorio de Referencia de Pirbright (Reino Unido), el cual obtuvo resultados negativos. No se consigui&oacute; aislar el virus.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios sobre la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
la enfermedad no se propag&oacute; a las dem&aacute;s manadas de la localidad o de la regi&oacute;n. La vigilancia sanitaria llevada a cabo en la regi&oacute;n no permiti&oacute; determinar el origen de la enfermedad. La trashumancia transfronteriza complica el problema. Los resultados diagn&oacute;sticos y epidemiol&oacute;gicos cuestionan la presencia de la enfermedad, pero la vigilancia sigue su curso en busca del virus responsable.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas durante el per&iacute;odo que abarca el presente informe: </STRONG>

la vacunaci&oacute;n contra la peste bovina ha concluido en la regi&oacute;n y contin&uacute;a en los distritos vecinos. Se ha suspendido la cuarentena.</P>

</EM>
el foco se present&oacute; en el parque zool&oacute;gico de Helsinki, en una unidad aislada donde se trata a los animales salvajes heridos. Una serreta grande (<EM>
Mergus merganser</EM>
) fue tra&iacute;da el 18 de agosto de 1996 y muri&oacute; el 7 de septiembre. Las 12 otras aves presentes en la unidad no presentaron signos cl&iacute;nicos, pero dos de ellas pose&iacute;an anticuerpos contra el paramixovirus-1.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos al diagn&oacute;stico: </STRONG>
</EM>
el 23 de septiembre de 1996 un examen virol&oacute;gico permiti&oacute; aislar el paramixovirus-1 en la serreta. El &iacute;ndice de patogenicidad por v&iacute;a intracerebral era de 1,37. Se est&aacute; intentando aislar el virus de las dem&aacute;s aves.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos, hasta la fecha, a la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
ninguna otra ave presente en el parque zool&oacute;gico manifest&oacute; signos cl&iacute;nicos de la enfermedad. Aunque ning&uacute;n aumento en la morbilidad o la mortalidad ha sido se&ntilde;alada en la poblaci&oacute;n de aves silvestres de Finlandia, la fauna silvestre constituye probablemente la fuente de infecci&oacute;n.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas hasta la fecha:</P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
-	Imposici&oacute;n de cuarentena en el parque zool&oacute;gico.</P>
<P>-	Sacrificio de todas las aves presentes en la unidad infectada (sus cad&aacute;veres han sido sometidos a ex&aacute;menes de laboratorio).</P>
<P>-	Limpieza y desinfecci&oacute;n de la unidad.</P>
<P>-	Chequeo por examen serol&oacute;gico o por torundas cloacales de las dem&aacute;s aves presentes en el parque zool&oacute;gico.</P>
<P>-	Intensificaci&oacute;n de la toma de muestras en aves silvestres.</P>

<EM>
Comentarios sobre la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
es probable que la enfermedad haya sido transmitida a partir de una granja adyacente o que animales con infecci&oacute;n latente hayan desarrollado la enfermedad a continuaci&oacute;n de un estr&eacute;s. Se propag&oacute; por v&iacute;a a&eacute;rea o ven&eacute;rea.</P>
<P>La detecci&oacute;n serol&oacute;gica llevada a cabo en granjas seleccionadas aleatoriamente mostr&oacute; que muchos animales pose&iacute;an t&iacute;tulos de anticuerpos contra el herpesvirus 1, lo que sugiere que la enfermedad habr&iacute;a llegado a presentar un aspecto enzo&oacute;tico en las manadas de Sulaibiya.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas durante el per&iacute;odo que abarca el presente informe: </STRONG>
</EM>
todos los bovinos importados tienen que haber recibido dos dosis de vacuna de herpesvirus bovino 1 inactivado. Se ha emprendido, con la misma vacuna, la vacunaci&oacute;n de la manada existente.</P>

<P>Durante el brote de enfermedad de Newcastle por virus velog&eacute;nico viscerotr&oacute;pico (ENVV) que afect&oacute; psit&aacute;cidos del Estado de Missouri en julio de 1996, se confirmaron casos en cinco establecimientos en total. De las 444 aves presentes en &eacute;stos, 7 fueron infectadas y murieron naturalmente. Las otras 437 aves resultaron negativas a los an&aacute;lisis realizados a partir de torundas cloacales tomadas dos veces con un intervalo de 15 d&iacute;as.  En el mes de agosto se levant&oacute; la cuarentena impuesta en los cinco establecimientos.</P>
<P>La encuesta epidemiol&oacute;gica revel&oacute; otros establecimientos que hab&iacute;an tenido contactos con los establecimientos afectados. Se los puso bajo cuarentena y se tomaron muestras. A la fecha, la cuarentena impuesta en estos establecimientos ha sido levantada para todos menos para uno. Ning&uacute;n ave presente en estos establecimientos present&oacute; s&iacute;ntomas compatibles con la ENVV.</P>
<P>Adem&aacute;s, en el mes de agosto, un informe preliminar se&ntilde;al&oacute; en un psit&aacute;cido del Estado de Oklahoma el hallazgo de una cepa de virus de la enfermedad de Newcastle diferente de las cepas aisladas de los 7 psit&aacute;cidos de Missouri. Despu&eacute;s de investigaciones adicionales, las muestras procedentes de esta ave se revelaron negativas para el virus de la enfermedad de Newcastle.</P>

<P>Ning&uacute;n nuevo foco de fiebre aftosa fue se&ntilde;alado desde el informe anterior, y la epizootia parece haber sido controlada.</P>
<P>Del 12 al 17 de agosto de 1996, la Comisi&oacute;n Europea organiz&oacute; una visita de terreno en el departamento del Evros, para juzgar la situaci&oacute;n y la eficacia de las medidas de lucha y de prevenci&oacute;n aplicadas por las Autoridades griegas.</P>
<P>Los expertos de la Comisi&oacute;n concluyeron que las medidas eran totalmente conformes con la reglamentaci&oacute;n comunitaria, que hab&iacute;an permitido controlar la epizootia y que garantizaban que la enfermedad no iba a propagarse fuera del departamento infectado.</P>
<P>Considerando estas conclusiones favorables, el Comit&eacute; Veterinario Permanente de la Uni&oacute;n Europea aprob&oacute;, durante una reuni&oacute;n extraordinaria celebrada el 22 de agosto, una propuesta de Decisi&oacute;n de la Comisi&oacute;n que abroga a la Decisi&oacute;n nº 96/440/CE de puesta en cuarentena de la totalidad del territorio de Grecia, y por la cual la cuarentena queda restringida al departamento del Evros (zonificaci&oacute;n).</P>
<P>Esta nueva Decisi&oacute;n se justifica cient&iacute;ficamente y permite restablecer los intercambios intracomunitarios de animales vivos y de productos de origen animal procedentes de Grecia o que transitan por este pa&iacute;s, excluyendo el departamento del Evros. </P>

todos los focos son secundarios, situaci&oacute;n previsible debido a la proximidad inmediata de las fincas afectadas previamente y el uso de abrevaderos y pastos comunes. Los focos Nº  21/96 y 22/96 han sido clasificados como primarios dada la ausencia de relaci&oacute;n epidemiol&oacute;gica comprobada hasta ahora. Se prosigue la investigaci&oacute;n. </P>

</EM>
las aves a partir de las cuales se aisl&oacute; el virus vel&oacute;geno viscerotropia de la enfermedad de Newcastle el 16 de julio de 1996 eran dos cotorras amazonas de cabeza amarilla, de seis semanas, que hab&iacute;an sido compradas por un distribuidor de Oklahoma. Todos los locales visitados (11) durante la investigaci&oacute;n son viviendas o establecimientos de cr&iacute;a de aves ornamentales, en los que ninguna ave se hab&iacute;a enfermado. No hay ninguna planta de cr&iacute;a industrial en los alrededores de estos locales. No hay ning&uacute;n otro local que deba visitarse.</P>

<P></EM>
La situaci&oacute;n se halla ahora bajo control. La enfermedad se limit&oacute; a 10 aldeas en el distrito de Korcha. Los 623 animales cl&iacute;nicamente afectados fueron destruidos (463 bovinos, 74 peque&ntilde;os rumiantes, 86 porcinos). Las medidas de restricci&oacute;n de los desplazamientos de animales y de desinfecci&oacute;n se mantienen dentro y alrededor de la zona infectada. Tambi&eacute;n se mantiene la vigilancia cl&iacute;nica en la zona de vacunaci&oacute;n. Se estableci&oacute; una zona de vigilancia en torno a la zona de vacunaci&oacute;n y en los distritos fronterizos. La primera campa&ntilde;a de vacunaci&oacute;n perifocal y alrededor de las aldeas infectadas finaliz&oacute; el 12 de julio en las aldeas infectadas. Un total de 266.048 animales fueron vacunados (59.234 bovinos, 137.190 ovinos, 57.202 caprinos y 7.422 porcinos) y marcados con un agujero en la oreja. La campa&ntilde;a de revacunaci&oacute;n comenz&oacute; en las zonas perif&eacute;ricas y el conjunto de los animales deber&iacute;an haber recibido las dos inyecciones el 15 de agosto.</P>

La enfermedad est&aacute; controlada. Los dos &uacute;ltimos focos aparecieron el 18 de julio en dos aldeas pr&oacute;ximas de aldeas anteriormente infectadas. La enfermedad afect&oacute; solamente dos regiones, la de Titov Veles con un solo foco (aldea de Orizari) y la de Skopje con 17 focos (17 aldeas). El control de la enfermedad se logr&oacute; mediante el sacrificio y la destrucci&oacute;n de todos los bovinos de las aldeas infectadas, a saber, un total de 4.369 bovinos. Se efectu&oacute; una vacunaci&oacute;n perifocal de los bovinos de estas dos regiones (Titov Veles: 7.500 y Skopje: 20.239). Se decidi&oacute; proceder a una vacunaci&oacute;n de precauci&oacute;n de las poblaciones animales consideradas m&aacute;s vulnerables (73.700 bovinos situados en la zona fronteriza con Albania y el Kosovo, y 17.600 bovinos en 25 explotaciones que contaban con reba&ntilde;os importantes). La campa&ntilde;a de primera vacunaci&oacute;n lleg&oacute; a su t&eacute;rmino y la campa&ntilde;a de revacunaci&oacute;n deber&iacute;a comenzar a partir del 6 de agosto y finalizar hacia el 15 de agosto.</P>

En total fueron infectadas 101 aldeas, correspondientes aproximadamente a la cuarta parte meridional de Kosovo. Se aplic&oacute; el sacrificio sanitario y se destruyeron 4.079 animales (2.580 bovinos, 829 ovinos y caprinos y 670 porcinos). Se elabor&oacute; un programa de vacunaci&oacute;n en tres etapas para todo el Kosovo (900.000 animales).</P>

</EM>
el 25 de julio de 1996 el Laboratorio de Pirbright confirm&oacute; que el genoma del virus de tipo O aislado en el Delta est&aacute; relacionado con las cepas que causaron recientemente focos en la Tracia turca, pero no con la cepa aislada en Grecia en 1994.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos, hasta la fecha, a la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
pese a las severas medidas de precauci&oacute;n y profilaxis adoptadas, se produjo una segunda serie de focos en la prefectura del Evros en los &uacute;ltimos d&iacute;as. Las investigaciones epidemiol&oacute;gicas preliminares indican que los focos primarios fueron causados por contactos indirectos con animales infectados fuera de Grecia (desplazamientos de personas, o animales que se abrevaron en el r&iacute;o Evros). Los focos secundarios se deben a desplazamientos de personas, contactos con vectores inanimados y la utilizaci&oacute;n de pastos comunes dentro de Grecia.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas durante el per&iacute;odo que abarca el presente informe: </STRONG>
</EM>
sacrificio sanitario, sin vacunaci&oacute;n. Adem&aacute;s, desde el 4 de julio de 1996 est&aacute;n en vigor las siguientes medidas:</P>
<P>–	Sacrificio sanitario preventivo de todos los animales potencialmente contaminados en las zonas de protecci&oacute;n;</P>
<P>–	Censo y registro de todas las explotaciones que poseen animales susceptibles en el departamento del Evros, y examen cl&iacute;nico con investigaci&oacute;n epidemiol&oacute;gica al menos dos veces por semana en esas explotaciones;</P>
<P>–	Establecimiento de zonas de protecci&oacute;n y de vigilancia alrededor de los focos, y prohibici&oacute;n total de los desplazamientos de animales, productos de origen animal y alimentos para ganado dentro de esas zonas;</P>
<P>–	Prohibici&oacute;n de todos los transportes de animales, productos de origen animal y alimentos para ganado en todo el departamento del Evros, y estrictas medidas de control sanitario a lo largo de la frontera con el departamento de Rodopi, con desinfecci&oacute;n de los veh&iacute;culos que abandonan el Evros.</P>
<P>–	Vigilancia cl&iacute;nica epidemiol&oacute;gica y, en caso necesario, serol&oacute;gica al menos una vez por semana en todo el territorio de Grecia.</P>

es probable que un animal portador asintom&aacute;tico haya desarrollado la infecci&oacute;n a continuaci&oacute;n de un gran estr&eacute;s. Animales de la manada fueron importados de Europa del Norte en abril de 1996. El uso del m&eacute;todo ELISA para la detecci&oacute;n de la rinotraque&iacute;tis infecciosa bovina / vulvovaginitis pustular infecciosa habr&aacute; patentizado una enfermedad que ya exist&iacute;a. La enfermedad se propag&oacute; por transmisi&oacute;n a&eacute;rea (aerosoles), puesto que los animales se mantienen en edificios donde se utilizan ventiladores para refrescarlos. </P>

Conclusiones actuales sobre la &iacute;ndole del agente causal: </STRONG>
</EM>
el 20 de julio de 1996 se realizaron dos aislamientos virales que fueron identificados como subtipo I variante E (I-E) el 29 de julio. Este subtipo es enzo&oacute;tico en la costa de la regi&oacute;n sureste de M&eacute;xico y en Centroam&eacute;rica, y est&aacute; asociado a ciclos silvestres entre peque&ntilde;os mam&iacute;feros y mosquitos. Los equinos se infectan casualmente cuando irrumpen en los ciclos silvestres o selv&aacute;ticos, por lo tanto la morbilidad y mortalidad son bajas sin provocar epizootias.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas durante el per&iacute;odo que abarca el presente informe: </P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
-	Se ha establecido un estricto control de la movilizaci&oacute;n de equinos del &aacute;rea focal hacia el interior del Estado de Oaxaca, as&iacute; como de dicho estado al resto del pa&iacute;s.</P>
<P>-	Se ha implementado un sistema de vigilancia epidemiol&oacute;gica activa a nivel nacional.</P>
<P>-	Se llev&oacute; a cabo una campa&ntilde;a de vacunaci&oacute;n de equinos en los tres municipios de la zona focal y en veintinueve de la zona perifocal, por lo cual se logr&oacute; inmunizar un total de 16.700 equinos del Estado de Oaxaca.</P>

Traducci&oacute;n de un fax recibido el 20 de julio de 1996 del Profesor Ali A.M. Moussa, Presidente de la Organizaci&oacute;n general de Servicios veterinarios, Ministerio de Agricultura, El Cairo:</P>
<P></EM>
Egipto se declara « provisionalmente libre de peste bovina », considerando los hechos siguientes:</P>
<P>1.	No se evidenci&oacute; la peste bovina, sea cl&iacute;nica o epidemiol&oacute;gicamente desde junio de 1986 (durante 10 a&ntilde;os consecutivos). Se realiz&oacute; anualmente la vacunaci&oacute;n masiva y coordinada de todos los bovinos entre 1982 y 1995 (durante 14 a&ntilde;os consecutivos), con vacuna contra la peste bovina Plowright producida localmente a partir de cultivo celular (TCRV), adaptada a los protocolos internacionales de normalizaci&oacute;n (OIE y Organizaci&oacute;n Mundial de la Salud). Esto se comprob&oacute; de la siguiente manera:</P>
<P>1.1.	Vigilancia sanitaria pasiva a trav&eacute;s de la presentaci&oacute;n peri&oacute;dica de los animales a los veterinarios de los gobernoratos.</P>
<P>1.2.	Vigilancia serol&oacute;gica:</P>
<P>1.2.1.	Se utiliza un m&eacute;todo ELISA competitivo (local o del extranjero) para comprobar la existencia de barreras inmunitarias contra el virus de la peste bovina en animales vacunados de diferentes grupos de edad a trav&eacute;s del pa&iacute;s. El resultado es favorable.</P>
<P>1.2.2.	Se utiliza el m&eacute;todo ELISA competitivo para comprobar la ausencia de circulaci&oacute;n de una cepa v&iacute;rica atenuada entre terneros no vacunados de m&aacute;s de ocho meses de edad, as&iacute; como entre ovinos y caprinos. Di&oacute; resultados negativos.</P>
<P>1.2.3.	En 1996, se colectaron en el pa&iacute;s 5.200 sueros de ovinos y caprinos. Las investigaciones laboratoriales con el m&eacute;todo ELISA competitivo han demostrado la ausencia de circulaci&oacute;n de una cepa atenuada del virus de la peste bovina.</P>
<P>2.	Retiro de todas las vacunas TCRV de todos los gobernoratos del pa&iacute;s para ser almacenados en el Instituto Veterinario de Investigaciones sobre los Sueros y las Vacunas (VSVRI), Abbasiya, El Cairo.</P>
<P>3.	Retiro de todo el material antig&eacute;nico emparentado con el virus de la peste bovina de las entidades gobernamentales o privadas que los detienen en Egipto.</P>
<P>4.	Prohibici&oacute;n de la importaci&oacute;n y del transporte de animales o productos de origen animal a partir de &aacute;reas afectadas por la peste bovina.</P>
<P>5.	El decreto ministerial nº 806 del 13 de julio de 1996 declara:</P>
<P>-	suspensi&oacute;n de la vacunaci&oacute;n contra la peste bovina durante tres a&ntilde;os seguidos,</P>
<P>-	prorrogaci&oacute;n de la vigilancia sanitaria y serol&oacute;gica (en bovinos, ovinos y caprinos) durante tres a&ntilde;os seguidos,</P>
<P>-	la producci&oacute;n por el VSVRI de la cantidad estrat&eacute;gica necesaria de TCRV aprobada por el  Presidente de la Organizaci&oacute;n general de Servicios veterinarios.</P>

las dos manadas infectadas constan de 250 y 600 bovinos, respectivamente. En total, 4.000 bovinos, 3.000 ovinos y 100 cerdos son mantenidos en explotaciones extensivas en la regi&oacute;n del delta.</P>

las condiciones geogr&aacute;ficas y zoot&eacute;cnicas peculiares que prevalecen en la zona del delta llevan a considerar todos los animales susceptibles como potencialmente contaminados. En efecto, el &aacute;rea del delta puede ser considerada como una "isla", naturalmente separada del resto de Grecia por el r&iacute;o Evros, y acequible s&oacute;lo mediante un reducido n&uacute;mero de puentes permanentemente bajo la custodia del ej&eacute;rcito. En este sentido, todos los traslados de animales, productos, personas y veh&iacute;culos hacia o a partir de la zona puede ser eficazmente controlados. Se observan medidas de salvaguardia. Se puede garantizar el impedimiento de la propagaci&oacute;n de la enfermedad, sea en Grecia o hacia fuera de ella.</P>

las investigaciones llevadas a cabo para detectar el origen de la enfermedad muestra que el transporte diario de mercanc&iacute;as, incluido el contrabando de cigarrillos, de un pa&iacute;s a otro, ha permitido la transmisi&oacute;n mec&aacute;nica del virus, mediante los caballos y los asnos, entre los pa&iacute;ses vecinos y la poblaci&oacute;n animal nacional. El virus puede tambi&eacute;n haber penetrado a trav&eacute;s de forraje (heno) destinado al ganado vacuno o mediante contactos con manadas de la ex-Rep&uacute;blica Yugoslava de Macedonia y de Albania, que comparten pastos colectivos con manadas de la RFY (Serbia y Montenegro). El virus puede tambi&eacute;n haber sido introducido mediante el contrabando de animales de pa&iacute;ses vecinos.</P>

Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas durante el per&iacute;odo que abarca el presente informe: </P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
Se aplicaron medidas veterinarias y sanitarias estrictas, seg&uacute;n los principios reconocidos a nivel internacional en la lucha contra la fiebre aftosa.</P>
<P>Se estableci&oacute; un "cuartel general yugoslavo / federal" de lucha contra la enfermedad que coordina las actividades de los centros operativos en el &aacute;rea contaminada y en el &aacute;rea "amenazada", analiza la situaci&oacute;n y programa la aplicaci&oacute;n de medidas.</P>
<P>Aproximadamente 130 m&eacute;dicos veterinarios, 30 t&eacute;cnicos de los servicios oficiales de distrito, unidades de la milicia y miembros del ej&eacute;rcito trabajan actualmente en el &aacute;rea contaminada. Equipos de veterinarios trabajan en el &aacute;rea, realizando el examen cl&iacute;nico de los animales, as&iacute; como equipos de especialistas en epizootiolog&iacute;a, veterinarios inspectores y equipos de desinfecci&oacute;n.</P>
<P>En el &aacute;rea "amenazada", 120 veterinarios en total trabajan con los equipos.</P>
<P>Para prevenir la difusi&oacute;n de la enfermedad, se controla estrictamente el comercio en las fronteras y se desinfecta a las personas y los veh&iacute;culos.</P>
<P>Los distritos de Kacanik, Prizren, Vitina, Gora, Štrpce, Obilic y Gnijilane se han declarado "contaminados", y los distritos vecinos "amenazados". En estas zonas se ha emprendido las siguientes medidas:</P>
<P>-	sacrificio sanitario en las granjas contaminadas y en las granjas vecinas, con entierro de las canales e indemnizaci&oacute;n de los propietarios (en un plazo de tres d&iacute;as),</P>
<P>-	prohibici&oacute;n del transporte de animales sensibles y de sus productos,</P>
<P>-	prohibici&oacute;n del transporte de piensos,</P>
<P>-	imposici&oacute;n de cuarentena en las granjas contaminadas, secuestro de los animales y restricci&oacute;n de los desplazamientos de personas,</P>
<P>-	examen cl&iacute;nico de los biungulados para determinar la extensi&oacute;n de la afecci&oacute;n,</P>
<P>-	cierre de los mataderos cada vez que la situaci&oacute;n lo requiera,</P>
<P>-	desinfecci&oacute;n diaria y colocaci&oacute;n de barreras de desinfecci&oacute;n en lugares adecuados,</P>
<P>-	programa de vacunaci&oacute;n en los distritos amenazados, todos los distritos de Kosovo y distritos que lindan con Albania y la ex-Rep&uacute;blica Yugoslava de Macedonia.</P>

Se lograron dos aislamientos virales que se enviaron el 24 de julio de 1996 a los Laboratorios de los Servicios Veterinarios Nacionales de los Estados Unidos de Am&eacute;rica (Ames, Iowa), para la subtipificaci&oacute;n. </P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios sobre la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
debido a las caracter&iacute;sticas de la presentaci&oacute;n cl&iacute;nica se supone que se trata de un virus de EEV del tipo enzo&oacute;tico de baja patogenicidad, del cual se tienen antecedentes en la regi&oacute;n del sureste de M&eacute;xico y Centroam&eacute;rica.</P>

</EM>
-	<EM>
Vacunaci&oacute;n: </EM>
El Dispositivo Nacional de Emergencia en Sanidad Animal (DINESA) inici&oacute; en forma preventiva un programa intensivo de vacunaci&oacute;n contra la EEV en los 3 municipios en que se se&ntilde;alaron casos de neuropat&iacute;as y en 29 municipios m&aacute;s de la misma regi&oacute;n, en forma perifocal; el programa concluy&oacute; el 18 de julio de 1996 con 15.453 animales vacunados.</P>
<P>-	<EM>
Investigaci&oacute;n y vigilancia epizootiol&oacute;gica: </EM>
En el &aacute;rea focal y regiones perif&eacute;ricas, control de la movilizaci&oacute;n de equinos de los tres municipios afectados hacia el resto del Estado y del Estado de Oaxaca hacia otros Estados.</P>
<P>-	<EM>
Fumigaci&oacute;n: </EM>
Por parte del Sector Salud, se fumig&oacute; contra mosquitos vectores las &aacute;reas urbanas de los municipios afectados, realiz&aacute;ndose la investigaci&oacute;n epidemiol&oacute;gica correspondiente sin que hasta la fecha existan casos en humanos.</P>
<P>Se considera que la situaci&oacute;n se encuentra controlada ya que a 6 d&iacute;as de concluir la cobertura vacunal no se han detectado m&aacute;s casos.</P>

Traducci&oacute;n de extractos de un fax recibido el 12 de julio de 1996 del Doctor A.M. Denke, Director de Ganader&iacute;a y Pesca, Ministerio de Fomento Rural y de Hidr&aacute;ulica Lugare&ntilde;a, Lom&eacute;:</P>
<P></EM>
Togo est&aacute; subdividido en 71 Cuadrados Epizo&oacute;ticos cubiertos por 63 puestos veterinarios agrupados en 30 Inspecciones Veterinarias abarcadas por 5 Servicios Regionales de Ganader&iacute;a y Pesca, dirigidas a nivel central por una Direcci&oacute;n de Ganader&iacute;a y Pesca que consta de tres divisiones, a saber: Divisi&oacute;n de Sanidad Animal, Divisi&oacute;n de Producci&oacute;n Animal y Divisi&oacute;n de Pesca.</P>
<P>Adem&aacute;s de los Servicios estatales, una decena de m&eacute;dicos veterinarios privados se dedican a la clientela rural y a la informaci&oacute;n zoosanitaria. Los criadores saben reconocer los estados m&oacute;rbidos y algunas enfermedades de los animales y los se&ntilde;alan a los servicios competentes.</P>
<P>Cualquier caso de enfermedad declarado o sospechado en las manadas es inmediatamente se&ntilde;alado al Jefe de Inspecci&oacute;n del &aacute;rea respectivo. La informaci&oacute;n se comunica simult&aacute;neamente al Jefe de Servicio Regional y a la Direcci&oacute;n de Ganader&iacute;a y Pesca donde el Delegado Permanente de Togo ante la OIE la notifica a la OIE en caso necesario.</P>
<P>Ning&uacute;n caso de peste bovina ha sido registrado en Togo desde 1988, y se dej&oacute; de vacunar en 1990. Sin embargo, la vacuna mixta peste bovina / perineumon&iacute;a contagiosa bovina ("Bisec") se utiliza contra la perineumon&iacute;a contagiosa bovina que volvi&oacute; a aparecer en 1994.</P>
<P>Considerando lo que antecede, Togo se declara "provisionalmente libre de peste bovina".</P>

</EM>
es probable que existiese en la manada un portador asintom&aacute;tico. La enfermedad se propag&oacute; por contacto directo (aerosoles), puesto que se utilizan nebulizadores para refrescar los animales. Hasta la fecha se limita a una explotaci&oacute;n, debido probablemente a la elevada temperatura de verano que no favorece los desplazamientos de personas y de ganado.</P>

foco nº 1/96 (poblaci&oacute;n de D&iacute;kela): a la fecha parece que s&oacute;lo una granja, que comprende 63 ovejas y 2 bovinos, haya sido afectada en la aldea; los bovinos no presentaban signos cl&iacute;nicos en el momento de la inspecci&oacute;n.</P>

<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas hasta la fecha: </STRONG>
</EM>
todas las medidas previstas en el Art&iacute;culo 5 de la Directiva 85/511/CEE han sido instauradas desde el 3 de julio de 1996. El programa de emergencia ha sido puesto en marcha en su integridad. El 4 de julio de 1996 se instauraron zonas de protecci&oacute;n (pueblos de Makri, D&iacute;kela y Mesimvr&iacute;a) y de vigilancia (pueblos de Nea Jil&iacute;, Atarni, &Aacute;vra, K&oacute;maros, P&eacute;rama, Plaka y Mesti). Se suspende hasta nuevo aviso la salida de animales vivos y productos de origen animal fuera del departamento.</P>
<P>Foco nº 1/96: sin esperar la confirmaci&oacute;n del diagn&oacute;stico, las Autoridades Veterinarias locales sacrificaron los animales susceptibles presentes en la granja as&iacute; como los animales de tres otras granjas de D&iacute;kela (154 ovejas y 2 bovinos) que hab&iacute;an pacido y bebido con los animales afectados. Cuando las medidas de prevenci&oacute;n lo requieran, las Autoridades Veterinarias locales contemplan el recurso extremo de sacrificar la totalidad de los animales susceptibles de la poblaci&oacute;n de D&iacute;kela (aproximadamente 800 ovinos, 25 bovinos y 30 cerdos).</P>
<P>Foco nº 2/96: el sacrificio sanitario ha de realizarse el 5 de julio de 1996.</P>

foco nº 1/96: tienda que vende aves de corral j&oacute;venes a los particulares; focos nº 2/96 a 5/96: peque&ntilde;os criaderos familiares de gallos y gallinas.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Conclusiones actuales sobre la &iacute;ndole del agente causal: </STRONG>
</EM>
foco nº 2/96: identificaci&oacute;n del virus de la enfermedad de Newcastle. &Iacute;ndice de patogenicidad por v&iacute;a intracerebral: 1,87. El virus ha sido enviado al Laboratorio de Referencia de la Uni&oacute;n Europea para ser comparado con el virus que caus&oacute; brotes en 1995.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios sobre la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
existe un v&iacute;nculo epidemiol&oacute;gico entre los cinco focos puesto que la tienda vendi&oacute; pollos contaminados a peque&ntilde;os criaderos.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas durante el per&iacute;odo que abarca el presente informe: </STRONG>
</EM>
sacrificio sanitario, refuerzo de la vacunaci&oacute;n obligatoria de aves de corral en toda la isla, y mantenimiento de la prohibici&oacute;n de cualquier transporte de aves desde la isla hacia la Francia metropolitana. Considerando estas medidas y la ausencia de focos en el territorio metropolitano, Francia conserva su calificaci&oacute;n de "libre de enfermedad de Newcastle".</P>

Comentarios relativos al diagn&oacute;stico: </STRONG>
</EM>
despu&eacute;s de la sospecha en tres apiarios del municipio de Limonar, provincia de Matanzas, se realiz&oacute; la confirmaci&oacute;n en el Laboratorio Nacional de Referencia de Enfermedades de las Abejas (14 de abril de 1996). Las &aacute;reas afectadas fueron inspeccionadas por t&eacute;cnicos del Centro Nacional de Referencia.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos, hasta la fecha, a la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
despu&eacute;s de la sospecha inicial se orient&oacute; un muestreo en las provincias de Matanzas y la Habana (frontera) y se detect&oacute; el mismo problema en un grupo de apiarios. Se realiz&oacute; un muestreo nacional, y como resultado se confirm&oacute; la enfermedad en 165 apiarios de las provincias de Matanzas (7 municipios, 80 apiarios afectados), Habana (11 municipios, 78 apiarios) y Ciudad de la Habana (5 municipios, 7 apiarios), siendo negativas en el resto del territorio nacional. </P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>

Diagn&oacute;stico:</P>
<P>A.	Conclusiones actuales sobre la &iacute;ndole del agente causal: </STRONG>
</EM>
paramixovirus-1 mesog&eacute;nico que no est&aacute; emparentado con las cepas suelen hallarse en aves de corral. &Iacute;ndice de patogenicidad por v&iacute;a intracerebral: 1,0.</P>

<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos, hasta la fecha, a la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
la infecci&oacute;n fue muy probablemente introducida a favor de la introducci&oacute;n de palomas ornamentales subcl&iacute;nicamente infectadas compradas en un peque&ntilde;o mercado de ganado. </P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas hasta la fecha: </STRONG>
</EM>
sacrificio sanitario de todas las aves (palomas, ocas y pollos). Limpieza y desinfecci&oacute;n dentro y alrededor del foco. Se est&aacute;n llevando a cabo investigaciones epidemiol&oacute;gicas.</P>

Comentarios relativos al diagn&oacute;stico: </STRONG>
</EM>
el animal fue llevado a un "hospital de murci&eacute;lagos", donde fue eutanasiado. En el marco del monitoreo de rutina para la b&uacute;squeda de la rabia de los quir&oacute;pteros, su cad&aacute;ver fue enviado a un laboratorio. </P>

<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos, hasta la fecha, a la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
se est&aacute;n llevando a cabo investigaciones para intentar determinar el origen del animal. No se ha podido encontrar ninguna colonia de <EM>
Myotis daubentonii </EM>
en los alrededores, y de hecho ning&uacute;n lugar de los alrededores parece adecuarse a su implantaci&oacute;n. Dado que el animal fue encontrado en un puerto de la costa sure&ntilde;a de Gran Breta&ntilde;a, es probable que haya cruzado el Canal de la Mancha volando o a bordo de un barco.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>

</EM>
se destruy&oacute; el murci&eacute;lago afectado. El "hospital de murci&eacute;lagos" ha sido sometido a medidas de restricci&oacute;n. Conforme al Art&iacute;culo 3.1.5.2 del <EM>
C&oacute;digo Zoosanitario Internacional </EM>
de la OIE, el Reino Unido guarda su estatuto de pa&iacute;s libre de rabia a pesar de este incidente.</P>

<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos a los animales afectados: </STRONG>
</EM>
en el cuadro del programa de detecci&oacute;n serol&oacute;gica llevado a cabo en todas las granjas ganaderas del pa&iacute;s (27.000 manadas aproximadamente), en 8 granjas lecheras se hallaron vacas que presentaron una reacci&oacute;n serol&oacute;gica al virus de la leucosis bovina enzo&oacute;tica, sin presentar por lo tanto signos cl&iacute;nicos.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos al diagn&oacute;stico: </STRONG>
</EM>
el monitoreo preliminar ha sido efectuado a partir de leche de tanque de colecta para las manadas lecheras, y de muestras sangu&iacute;neas individuales para las manadas de animales de engorde. Todas las muestras sangu&iacute;neas de los animales de engorde han resultado negativas. En las manadas lecheras positivas, todos los animales han sido muestreados individualmente para la b&uacute;squeda de anticuerpos en la sangre.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos, hasta la fecha, a la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
se desconoce el origen de la infecci&oacute;n. Se est&aacute;n llevando a cabo investigaciones. Se est&aacute; preparando una nueva encuesta a nivel nacional.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas hasta la fecha: </STRONG>
</EM>
las 8 manadas positivas han sido colocadas bajo vigilancia oficial y est&aacute;n sometidas a restricciones. Se prohibe desplazar los animales dentro o a partir de las granjas infectadas. Tambi&eacute;n se tomaron medidas de restricci&oacute;n en cuanto al pastoreo de estas manadas. Los animales seropositivos se eliminan previa aprobaci&oacute;n de sus propietarios.</P>

Traducci&oacute;n de extractos de un bolet&iacute;n informativo recibido el 5 de junio de 1996 del Secretario de la Comisi&oacute;n Europea de Lucha contra la Fiebre Aftosa (FAO):</P>
<P><STRONG>
Foco primario: </P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
El primer caso de fiebre aftosa fue observado el 3 de mayo de 1996 en Drithas en el sudeste del pa&iacute;s en un bovino en una antigua granja estatal situada a 10 km al norte de la ciudad de Kor&ccedil;a, cabeza del distrito. La finca constaba de 393 bovinos, 200 ovejas y 390 cerdos pertenecientes a unas cien familias que trabajaban en la granja estatal y que a&uacute;n viven en el lugar.</P>
<P>El 6 de mayo, 16 bovinos estaban afectados, y el 7 de mayo, 48. Bovinos de todas las edades, ovejas y cerdos fueron progresivamente infectados. El 17 de mayo, 81 animales estaban afectados y el 27 de mayo, el total de animales afectados mont&oacute; a 247 bovinos, 15 ovejas y 18 cerdos.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Focos secundarios: </P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
El 1º de junio, la enfermedad se hab&iacute;a propagado a siete aldeas, resultando cl&iacute;nicamente afectados 298 bovinos, 15 ovejas y 33 cerdos. Todas estas aldeas se ubican en una zona de aproximadamente 10 km de radio.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Origen del brote:</P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
Albania import&oacute; recientemente grandes cantidades de carne de bovino y b&uacute;falo congelada (parte de ella sin deshuesar) de pa&iacute;ses no libres de fiebre aftosa. Dicha carne se destinaba prioritariamente a ser procesada, pero parte fue tambi&eacute;n vendida directamente y es muy probable que cerdos hayan sido alimentados con desperdicios de esta carne (de la carne sin deshuesar inclusive) que contrajeron la enfermedad y que luego contaminaron a los bovinos.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Tipificaci&oacute;n del virus aislado:</P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
El Laboratorio Nacional de Brescia (Italia) aisl&oacute; el virus y lo remiti&oacute; al Laboratorio Mundial de Referencia de la OIE para la fiebre aftosa (Pirbright, Reino Unido) para su tipificaci&oacute;n. Esta tarea est&aacute; en curso. Los resultados preliminarios parecen indicar que el virus est&aacute; emparentado con los virus del serotipo A22 Arabia Saud&iacute;/India.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de lucha contra la enfermedad:</P>
<P></STRONG>
</EM>
El 13 de mayo de 1996 se decidieron medidas de lucha. Una Resoluci&oacute;n Gubernamental del Consejo de Ministros fue adoptada y un decreto del Ministerio de Agricultura y Alimentaci&oacute;n, de fecha 20 de mayo de 1996, defini&oacute; 20 medidas concretas, entre las cuales la imposici&oacute;n de cuarentena en las aldeas infectadas, el cierre de los mercados, la prohibici&oacute;n del transporte de animales en el distrito de Kor&ccedil;a y los distritos vecinos, la destrucci&oacute;n de los animales enfermos con indemnizaci&oacute;n de los granjeros, y la constituci&oacute;n de un Comit&eacute; de lucha contra esta enfermedad.</P>
<P>A pesar de las medidas de control tomadas, la enfermedad sigui&oacute; propag&aacute;ndose. La misi&oacute;n insisti&oacute;, entonces, en la necesidad de reforzar las medidas sanitarias y de instaurar inmediatamente una campa&ntilde;a de vacunaci&oacute;n de todos los animales susceptibles en el distrito de Kor&ccedil;a y parte de los distritos de Pogradec y Devoll, que lindan con el primero, lo que cubre un total de aproximadamente 150.000 animales. La vacuna ser&aacute; provista por la Comisi&oacute;n Europea de Lucha contra la Fiebre Aftosa.</P>

Comentarios sobre la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
se ten&iacute;an sospechas de que las palomas silvestres introducidas el 25 de marzo de 1996 en la Universidad de Oulu fuesen la fuente de infecci&oacute;n. Para confirmar esta hip&oacute;tesis, aves procedentes de la poblaci&oacute;n inicial de esas palomas fueron sometidas a un examen serol&oacute;gico cuyo resultado fue anunciado el 28 de mayo de 1996: de un total de 83 palomas capturadas, 31 pose&iacute;an anticuerpos dirigidos contra el paramixovirus-1, aunque ninguna mostr&oacute; signos cl&iacute;nicos de la enfermedad de Newcastle. La aparici&oacute;n de signos cl&iacute;nicos en las palomas infectadas llevadas a la Universidad de Oulu se debe probablemente al estr&eacute;s ocasionado por el cautiverio. No se han se&ntilde;alado m&aacute;s casos de la enfermedad.</P>
<P><STRONG>

el 8 de febrero de 1996 se enviaron muestras al Centro del Servicio de Higiene Animal de Tokio y la enfermedad de Newcastle fue diagnosticada por inhibici&oacute;n de la hemaglutinaci&oacute;n y aislamiento viral.</P>

</EM>
el 31 de enero de 1996 el propietario compr&oacute; dos aves. Una de ellas mostr&oacute; signos cl&iacute;nicos el 1º de febrero y muri&oacute; al d&iacute;a siguiente. Inicialmente, se consult&oacute; a un veterinario, pero su tratamiento no di&oacute; resultados favorables. Se trata del primer foco de enfermedad de Newcastle se&ntilde;alado en Jap&oacute;n desde 1992. Se est&aacute;n llevando a cabo investigaciones sobre el origen de este foco.</P>

<A NAME="Sec1"></A>PESTE BOVINA EN INDIA<BR>El Delegado declara dos nuevos Estados « provisionalmente libres »</P>

<EM>
Traducci&oacute;n de un fax recibido el 10 de mayo de 1996 del Se&ntilde;or K. Rajan, Secretario de Ganader&iacute;a, Ministerio de Agricultura, Nueva Delhi:</P>
<P></EM>
1.	En complemento de la anterior declaraci&oacute;n relativa a la calificaci&oacute;n de provisionalmente libres de peste bovina de las tres zonas compuestas por 20 Estados y dos territorios insulares (v&eacute;ase <EM>
Informaciones Sanitarias</EM>
, <STRONG>
8 </STRONG>
[42], 133-134), el Gobierno de la India declara ahora provisionalmente libre de peste bovina el territorio que abarca sus Estados de Maharashtra y Goa.</P>
<P><IMG SRC="E09_180.GIF" BORDER=1></P>
<P>2.	La poblaci&oacute;n bovina de estos dos Estados es de aproximadamente 22 millones de cabezas y la poblaci&oacute;n de peque&ntilde;os rumiantes de unos 11 millones. No se ha observado ning&uacute;n caso de peste bovina en Maharashtra en los &uacute;ltimos 30 meses y en Goa desde 1990. El &uacute;ltimo foco de peste bovina en Maharashtra se registr&oacute; en los bovinos en octubre de 1993, cuando murieron dos animales, y en los peque&ntilde;os rumiantes en julio de 1993.</P>
<P>3.	La vacunaci&oacute;n generalizada de los bovinos se suspendi&oacute; en Maharashtra en septiembre de 1994, con la excepci&oacute;n de los distritos de Nasik y Dhule donde las actividades de vacunaci&oacute;n cesaron en noviembre de 1995. La vacuna contra la peste bovina fue utilizada en los peque&ntilde;os rumiantes para luchar contra la peste de peque&ntilde;os rumiantes en Maharashtra hasta enero de 1996.</P>
<P>4.	A fin de mantener un cord&oacute;n sanitario a lo largo de la Zona C, la vacunaci&oacute;n de los rumiantes se mantiene en los distritos de Maharashtra (en una franja de 30 km) y de Goa (en una zona de 10 km de ancho) adyacentes a los Estados de dicha zona.</P>
<P>5.	Ambos Estados cuentan con una red bien organizada de instituciones veterinarias para la notificaci&oacute;n y monitoreo de la enfermedad, y se est&aacute; realizando una activa labor de vigilancia. Tambi&eacute;n se est&aacute; efectuando un monitoreo serol&oacute;gico mediante la t&eacute;cnica ELISA, cuyos resultados fueron considerados satisfactorios. Se han puesto en pr&aacute;ctica medidas de control en las fronteras para los animales migrantes, aplicando las medidas legislativas existentes.</P>
<P>6.	No se ha notificado incidencia de la peste bovina en las Zonas A, B y D desde que han sido declaradas provisionalmente libres de peste bovina.</P>
<P>7.	Con la excepci&oacute;n de Tamil Nadu, donde a&uacute;n se observa una incidencia espor&aacute;dica de peste bovina, la enfermedad no se ha manifestado en los dem&aacute;s Estados y Territorios de la Uni&oacute;n de la Zona C en el &uacute;ltimo a&ntilde;o.</P>
<P>8.	Se est&aacute; realizando una vacunaci&oacute;n masiva contra la peste bovina en Tamil Nadu.</P>
<P>Considerando lo que antecede, el Gobierno de la India a&ntilde;ade los Estados de Maharashtra y Goa a la Zona B y los declara provisionalmente libres de peste bovina.</P>

el foco (la universidad de Oulu) conten&iacute;a en total 747 aves (palomas, lag&oacute;podos, patos, codornices y gallinas) destinadas a investigaciones cient&iacute;ficas, la mayor parte de las cuales (576) se manten&iacute;an en el interior. El 25 de marzo de 1996, 25 palomas silvestres fueron colocadas en una pajarera al aire libre, con lo que el n&uacute;mero de palomas en dicha caja ascendi&oacute; a 95. Despu&eacute;s de una semana, algunas palomas murieron sin mostrar ning&uacute;n s&iacute;ntoma. 23 palomas m&aacute;s murieron durante el mes de abril.</P>

Comentarios relativos al diagn&oacute;stico: </STRONG>
</EM>
el Instituto de Investigaciones Veterinarias y Alimentarias de Helsinki y el Laboratorio de Referencia de la OIE para la enfermedad de Newcastle (Weybridge, Reino Unido) aislaron el paramixovirus-1. Indice de patogenicidad por v&iacute;a intracerebral: 1,32. De las 128 muestras sangu&iacute;neas que se recolectaron en las aves del centro de investigaciones, no se encontraron anticuerpos espec&iacute;ficos sino en palomas. </P>

<EM>
Comentarios relativos, hasta la fecha, a la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
se trata del primer foco de enfermedad de Newcastle en Finlandia desde hace 25 a&ntilde;os. Se desconoce el origen de la infecci&oacute;n; una encuesta epidemiol&oacute;gica est&aacute; en curso. Existe un criadero de aficionado en la zona de vigilancia, pero ninguna explotaci&oacute;n av&iacute;cola.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas hasta la fecha: </STRONG>
</EM>
aplicaci&oacute;n de las medidas previstas en la Directiva 92/66/CEE de la Comunidad Europea. Sacrificio sanitario, limpieza y desinfecci&oacute;n. Instauraci&oacute;n de una zona de protecci&oacute;n de 3 km y de una zona de vigilancia de 10 km de radio alrededor del foco.</P>

<EM>
Identificaci&oacute;n geogr&aacute;fica de los focos: </STRONG>
</EM>
Estado de Chihuahua.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos a los animales afectados: </STRONG>
</EM>
ning&uacute;n animal seropositivo present&oacute; signos cl&iacute;nicos, aun cuando fueron inmunosuprimidos, y la seropositividad fue atribuida a reacciones cruzadas.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos al diagn&oacute;stico: </STRONG>
</EM>
se efectu&oacute; un an&aacute;lisis de un total de 3.001 muestras procedentes de equinos (asnos, caballos, mulas) que indic&oacute; una seroprevalencia del 0,14‰. Los sueros aparentemente positivos a <EM>
Trypanosoma equiperdum </EM>
fueron dirigidos al Instituto Nacional de Diagn&oacute;stico y Referencia Epidemiol&oacute;gica de la Secretar&iacute;a de Salud para corroborar su diagn&oacute;stico. Sin embargo, en esta instituci&oacute;n 12 sueros resultaron positivos a <EM>
T. cruzi</EM>
, lo que indica la posibilidad de reacciones cruzadas. No se aisl&oacute; el agente causal de los animales seropositivos ni de los inmunosuprimidos.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas durante el per&iacute;odo que abarca el presente informe: </STRONG>
</EM>
actualmente se contin&uacute;a con la vigilancia epidemiol&oacute;gica mediante el monitoreo serol&oacute;gico de equinos en el Estado de Chihuahua y otras partes del pa&iacute;s.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Conclusi&oacute;n: </STRONG>
</EM>
la falta de evidencia cl&iacute;nica aunada a la posibilidad de reacciones cruzadas del <EM>
T. equiperdum </EM>
con otros tripanosomas antig&eacute;nicamente indistinguibles, indica que la enfermedad contin&uacute;a siendo ex&oacute;tica en M&eacute;xico. Esto ha sido reforzado por la inmunosupresi&oacute;n experimental en equinos que aparentemente hab&iacute;an resultado positivos a <EM>
T. equiperdum </EM>
y que no manifestaron signos cl&iacute;nicos de la enfermedad. Tampoco fue posible aislar el agente causal.</P>

El Ministro de la Salud del Reino Unido anunci&oacute; el 20 de marzo de 1996 que un comit&eacute; asesor independiente hab&iacute;a se&ntilde;alado al Gobierno que se hab&iacute;an diagnosticado 10 casos de la enfermedad de Creutzfeldt-Jakob, una enfermedad humana con efectos similares a los que produce la encefalopat&iacute;a espongiforme bovina (BSE) en los bovinos, con caracter&iacute;sticas constantes y hasta entonces desconocidas. Aunque no existen pruebas cient&iacute;ficas de que la BSE pueda transmitirse al ser humano a trav&eacute;s de la carne bovina, el comit&eacute; concluy&oacute; que la explicaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s probable hasta la fecha era que esos casos estaban relacionados con una exposici&oacute;n a la BSE antes de la introducci&oacute;n en 1989 en el Reino Unido de la prohibici&oacute;n de utilizar determinados tejidos bovinos en la alimentaci&oacute;n humana. El Comit&eacute; recomend&oacute; que ciertas medidas preventivas adicionales fuesen tomadas, entre ellas la obligaci&oacute;n de deshuesar las canales de animales de m&aacute;s de 30 meses de edad en instalaciones especialmente autorizadas. El Gobierno del Reino Unido acept&oacute; las recomendaciones, que entrar&aacute;n en vigor lo m&aacute;s pronto posible.</P>
<P>El anuncio suscit&oacute; una considerable publicidad y preocupaci&oacute;n en el mundo entero, y tuvo repercusiones en el consumo y comercio de carne bovina en Europa.</P>
<P>A continuaci&oacute;n se presenta un breve resumen de los informes y las actividades internacionales relativos a la BSE.</P>
<P>Los Pa&iacute;ses Miembros de la OIE, entre ellos el Reino Unido y los pa&iacute;ses afectados con baja incidencia de la enfermedad, proporcionan regularmente a los Servicios Veterinarios y a las organizaciones internacionales, por conducto de la OIE, informaci&oacute;n sobre la incidencia de la enfermedad (v&eacute;ase el texto adjunto), los m&eacute;todos utilizados para controlarla, las investigaciones sobre la enfermedad e informaci&oacute;n sobre su posible relaci&oacute;n con enfermedades similares que afectan a otras especies, comprendidos los seres humanos.</P>
<P>La OIE reuni&oacute; expertos en BSE dos veces en 1990, y una en 1991. Las reuniones ten&iacute;an por objeto informar a los Servicios Veterinarios mundiales sobre los conocimientos relativos a esta enfermedad de reciente aparici&oacute;n, y formular recomendaciones relativas a los procedimientos de importaci&oacute;n de animales y productos de origen animal, comprendidos el semen y los embriones. Estos procedimientos fueron adoptados por el Comit&eacute; Internacional de la OIE en mayo de 1992, e incorporados en el <EM>
C&oacute;digo Zoosanitario Internacional </EM>
de la OIE, el texto aprobado aplicable en esta materia y que se revisa peri&oacute;dicamente.</P>

<P>Italia: 2 casos (10/94)</P>
<P>Om&aacute;n: 2 casos confirmados en 1989</P>
<P>En 1994 la OIE convoc&oacute; nuevamente a un grupo de expertos a fin de determinar si hab&iacute;a nuevos datos epidemiol&oacute;gicos o derivados de la investigaci&oacute;n sobre la BSE que pudieran requerir una revisi&oacute;n del cap&iacute;tulo del <EM>
C&oacute;digo </EM>
relativo a la enfermedad. Participaron en la reuni&oacute;n 25 especialistas y observadores de nueve pa&iacute;ses, la Organizaci&oacute;n Mundial de la Salud (OMS) y la Comisi&oacute;n Europea, as&iacute; como expertos en la enfermedad de Creutzfeldt-Jakob.</P>
<P>El grupo de expertos reconoci&oacute; que el Reino Unido era el &uacute;nico pa&iacute;s en que se observaba una incidencia elevada de la BSE. Expres&oacute; su satisfacci&oacute;n por el hecho de que, aparentemente a ra&iacute;z de la prohibici&oacute;n instaurada en 1988 de utilizar piensos derivados de rumiantes para alimentar a rumiantes, el &iacute;ndice de infecci&oacute;n siguiera disminuyendo en el Reino Unido. Opin&oacute; que medidas similares adoptadas por otros pa&iacute;ses en que se hab&iacute;an diagnosticado casos eran apropiadas para impedir la propagaci&oacute;n y/o eventualmente para erradicar la enfermedad.</P>
<P>Se hab&iacute;a logrado la transmisi&oacute;n experimental de la BSE y otras enfermedades similares entre especies.  En esa &eacute;poca no hab&iacute;a ninguna indicaci&oacute;n clara de una transmisi&oacute;n natural de la BSE a los bovinos que no pasara por piensos infectados. La investigaci&oacute;n sobre otras v&iacute;as de transmisi&oacute;n prosigui&oacute; pero, dada la longitud del periodo de incubaci&oacute;n, a&uacute;n se esperaban los resultados.</P>
<P>Desde la aparici&oacute;n de focos de BSE en Europa, no se hab&iacute;a descartado la posibilidad de un riesgo te&oacute;rico de transmisi&oacute;n de la BSE a los seres humanos, que se tomaba en consideraci&oacute;n en todos los programas nacionales de control de la enfermedad. Continuaron las investigaciones teniendo en cuenta esta posibilidad. Los estudios epidemiol&oacute;gicos sobre la BSE comparados con los de la enfermedad de Creutzfeldt-Jakob en los seres humanos no evidenciaron entonces ninguna relaci&oacute;n. La pol&iacute;tica de todos los pa&iacute;ses infectados de reducir al m&iacute;nimo el riesgo de contaminaci&oacute;n de los alimentos y productos farmac&eacute;uticos de consumo humano era la &uacute;nica aceptable que pod&iacute;a adoptarse en ese momento. A la luz de la nueva informaci&oacute;n sobre la BSE, en 1994 el Grupo de expertos recomend&oacute; que se modificara el <EM>
C&oacute;digo Zoosanitario Internacional</EM>
, que fue aprobado por el Comit&eacute; Internacional en mayo de 1995.</P>
<P>La OMS tambi&eacute;n ha realizado actividades vinculadas a la enfermedad, en estrecha cooperaci&oacute;n con la OIE y con su participaci&oacute;n. La OMS celebr&oacute; consultas en 1991 y 1993 a fin de examinar los conocimientos del momento sobre la utilizaci&oacute;n de tejidos animales en los piensos para animales, en los alimentos humanos y en la preparaci&oacute;n de medicamentos y otros productos destinados al ser humano y a los animales, con miras a asesorar a los pa&iacute;ses.</P>
<P>En mayo de 1995 la OMS celebr&oacute; una nueva consulta sobre las cuestiones de salud p&uacute;blica relacionadas con las encefalopat&iacute;as espongiformes transmisibles a los seres humanos y a los animales. Se consider&oacute; que ciertos v&iacute;nculos aparentes de la alimentaci&oacute;n con la enfermedad de Creutzfeldt-Jakob observados en un an&aacute;lisis efectuado en el Reino Unido eran debidos a un sesgo de memoria y no indicaban una asociaci&oacute;n causal. Los participantes en la consulta concluyeron que los datos disponibles suger&iacute;an que todos los mam&iacute;feros, comprendidos los seres humanos, deb&iacute;an ser considerados potencialmente susceptibles a la BSE si la exposici&oacute;n a la enfermedad era suficiente, que las actuales pol&iacute;ticas de profilaxis eran apropiadas para reducir al m&iacute;nimo el riesgo de exposici&oacute;n para los animales y los seres humanos, y que los datos epidemiol&oacute;gicos registrados en Europa no indicaban un cambio de la incidencia de la enfermedad de Creutzfeldt-Jakob en los seres humanos que pudiera atribuirse a la BSE.</P>
<P>Con objeto de ayudar a los pa&iacute;ses no afectados que pod&iacute;an correr riesgos, en febrero de 1996 la OIE patrocin&oacute; un curso de formaci&oacute;n sobre el diagn&oacute;stico de la BSE para 14 pa&iacute;ses de la Comunidad de Estados Independientes (CEI) y los pa&iacute;ses b&aacute;lticos en Vladimir, Rusia.</P>
<P>Las actividades internacionales dirigidas por la Uni&oacute;n Europea no han sido incluidas en este resumen.</P>
<P>Como se puede observar en la actualizaci&oacute;n adjunta del n&uacute;mero de casos de BSE notificados por el mundo entero a la OIE, la incidencia de la enfermedad en el Reino Unido sigui&oacute; disminuyendo en 1995.</P>
<P>En vista de las observaciones efectuadas recientemente en el Reino Unido, tanto la OIE como la OMS proponen nuevas reuniones de expertos relacionadas con sus responsabilidades respecto de la enfermedad.</P>

</EM>
este foco se ubica fuera del &aacute;rea de control de la peste porcina africana. Dos propiedades han resultado afectadas. El contagio se debe tal vez a la exportaci&oacute;n il&iacute;cita de cerdos fuera del &aacute;rea de control de la peste porcina africana. Se est&aacute;n llevando a cabo investigaciones.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas hasta la fecha: </STRONG>
</EM>
se han tomado las medidas zoosanitarias habituales. Todos los cerdos de la explotaci&oacute;n murieron o fueron sacrificados y destruidos. Se ha impuesto la cuarentena en las dos propiedades afectadas as&iacute; como en las propiedades adyacentes. Se prohibe la comercializaci&oacute;n de los cerdos procedentes de esta zona, sea para el uso local o para la exportaci&oacute;n. Las exportaciones de animales y productos de origen animal desde las otras zonas no controladas no resulta afectada por estas medidas.</P>

</EM>
algunos de los casos letales fueron en caballos vacunados, lo que motiva cierta inquietud.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos al diagn&oacute;stico: </STRONG>
</EM>
hasta la fecha el Instituto Veterinario de Onderstepoort ha recibido muestras procedentes de 54 caballos supuestamente muertos de peste equina. Se realiz&oacute; el aislamiento del virus y se determin&oacute; el serotipo de doce aislados: el serotipo 4 es responsable de la muerte de ocho de los caballos y las dem&aacute;s muertes se deben a los serotipos 1, 2 y 6.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos, hasta la fecha, a la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
estos brotes de peste equina han sido favorecidos por condiciones clim&aacute;ticas propicias (fuertes lluvias y calor).</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas hasta la fecha: </STRONG>
</EM>
para limitar el n&uacute;mero de focos en las zonas de alto riesgo, se aconseja a los propietarios de caballos vacunar o revacunar sus caballos, guardarlos en el establo desde dos horas antes de la puesta del sol hasta dos horas despu&eacute;s del amanecer, luchar contra los vectores y limitar los desplazamientos de caballos no vacunados hacia dentro o hacia fuera de las zonas de alto riesgo.</P>

<P>En el foco nº 2/96 (Pack, distrito de Voitsberg, provincia de Estiria), signos cl&iacute;nicos caracter&iacute;sticos de esta enfermedad fueron observados en las 30 aves de corral presentes en esta granja, y todas sucumbieron al cabo de algunos d&iacute;as. Muestras tomadas de un gallo fueron enviadas al Instituto Federal de Lucha contra las Enfermedades Virales de los Animales (Viena). El diagn&oacute;stico de enfermedad de Newcastle fue confirmado el 8 de febrero de 1996.</P>
<P>Las aves picotearon desperdicios entre los que hab&iacute;a desechos de un pollo. El pollo hab&iacute;a sido comprado en un supermercado para el consumo privado del granjero y se desconoce su origen.</P>

Comentarios relativos a los animales afectados: </STRONG>
</EM>
tras propagarse a una poblaci&oacute;n bovina desprovista de inmunidad contra el virus de la fiebre aftosa (por no haber sido nunca afectada por esta enfermedad y/o por no haber sido vacunada desde hace mucho tiempo), la infecci&oacute;n, que hasta la fecha era espor&aacute;dica, pas&oacute; a ser epizo&oacute;tica.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos al diagn&oacute;stico: </STRONG>
</EM>
aislamiento del virus aftoso (tipos SAT 2 y O) por el Laboratorio Mundial de Referencia de la OIE para la Fiebre Aftosa (Pirbright, Reino Unido).</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Comentarios relativos, hasta la fecha, a la epidemiolog&iacute;a de la enfermedad: </STRONG>
</EM>
la frecuencia de la enfermedad aument&oacute; entre bovinos particularmente sensibles, puesto que manadas comunitarias de bovinos locales fueron llevadas a pastos situados en la frontera entre Ruanda, Tanzania y Uganda, donde la enfermedad es enzo&oacute;tica, y tambi&eacute;n a causa de la matanza il&iacute;cita de bovinos en algunos mataderos.</P>
<P><STRONG>
<EM>
Medidas de control y de vigilancia adoptadas hasta la fecha: </STRONG>
</EM>
adopci&oacute;n de medidas cuarentenarias. Proyecto gubernamental de asentamiento de los pastores. Informaci&oacute;n a los ganaderos y a las Autoridades locales sobre las v&iacute;as de contaminaci&oacute;n y los medios de control. Vacunaci&oacute;n en anillo. Instauraci&oacute;n en breve plazo de un control semestral de los desplazamientos de los animales.</P>

<BR>

The Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) is a pro-market, public policy group
committed to advancing the principles of free enterprise and limited
government.  Founded in 1984 by <A HREF="/staff/smith.html">Fred L. Smith, Jr.</A>, CEI emphasizes the
marketing and implementation of classical liberal ideals. <p>

<p>CEI utilizes a five-point management approach to affecting public policy:
analysis, education, coalition building, advocacy and litigation.  Its purpose
is to advance the free-market agenda, believing limited government and
competition best serve the public interest.<p>

<p>A non-profit, tax-exempt organization under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, CEI relies entirely on donations from corporations, foundations, and private individuals with an interest in restoring individual liberties and
economic freedom. <I>All contributions are tax deductible.</i><p>

<BR>"America has historically been the refuge of the hopeful and aspiring; it is the melting pot of the world.  Radical egalitarians and reactionary
nativists aside, most of us are pleased that this process has produced a
rich mulligan stew of citizens of different cultures, races and creeds, and
not the bland conformity of a plain-vanilla caricature.  Out of the most
heterogeneous of inputs, America has produced an industrious and diverse
citizenry."

With the expansion of their majority, Senate Republicans were poised to reinvigorate efforts to downsize the federal government. Standing in the way, however, are statist committee chairman that do not share the limited government philosophy.  In particular, conservative Republicans have opted not to challenge either James Jeffords (R-VT), on Labor and Human Resoures, or John Chafee (R-RI) on Environment and Public Works for the committee chairs. Jeffords, some many recall, was the only Republican Senator to
support the Clinton health care plan, and Chafee sought to prevent
the reexamination of burdensome environmental regulations in the
104th Congress.  By keeping Jeffords and Chafee in the leadership,
conservative Republicans have placed the limited government agenda
that much more out of reach.

<H2>Legalized Gambling in the United States</H2>
<P>Robert R. Detlefsen, December 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>Legalized gambling in the United
 States is increasingly under
 attack, not only within individual states regarding its proposed
expansion into new jurisdictions, but also on the national level.
 This August, Congress enacted legislation that establishes a
commission to investigate the social and economic consequences
of gambling.  
<P>
    Despite the many forms of gambling that are currently permitted
in most states, gambling opponents tend to focus on privately
owned casinos while virtually ignoring state lotteries, which
remain the most popular and widespread form of legal gambling.
The preoccupation with casinos is puzzling, because almost every
argument that is raised against casino gambling applies with greater
force to lotteries.  
<P>
    Those making the moral case against gambling frequently depict
casino patrons as hapless victims of unscrupulous &quot;gambling
kingpins.&quot;  Their wagers, it is claimed, are born of desperation
and ignorance.  Yet casino patrons tend to have above-average
incomes and education levels.  A demographic profile of casino
gamblers in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area offers a glimpse
of the kind of person who does -- and does not -- visit casinos.
 
<P>
    According to <I>Washingtonian</I>, casino gamblers there &quot;tend
to be suburban couples with good jobs and grown children.  Whites,
Hispanics, and Asian-Americans frequent casinos at higher rates
than blacks.  Betters tend to be over age 50 with tweedy tastes,
fond of theater, classical music, books, and European travel.&quot;
 
<P>
    The profile of the non-casino gambler is no less interesting:
 &quot;The fewest casino gamblers live near military bases... where large families with modest incomes have neither the time nor the money to roll the dice.&quot;  National studies of gamblers are consistent with these findings.
<P>
    Compared to lottery players, casino patrons are less motivated
by a desire to win money because they perceive casinos primarily
as forums for socializing and entertainment.  While casino patrons
tend to gamble in the company of spouses, friends, or associates
from clubs and fraternal organizations, playing the lottery is
a largely solitary pursuit.  Indeed, even to speak of &quot;playing
the lottery&quot; is misleading, for there is no element of play
involved in the act of buying a ticket and waiting for the winning
numbers to be announced. 
<P>
    Casino gambling, on the other hand, offers a smorgasbord of
interactive games, in which the only way to participate is to
play -- employing strategy, skill, patience, and of course, luck.
<P>
    In every state where casinos are allowed, public advertisements
for casinos are strictly regulated.  Indeed, in many jurisdictions
casinos are flatly prohibited from advertising the gambling component
of their operations.  
<P>
    Government-sponsored lottery advertisements, by contrast,
are ubiquitous in nearly all of the 38 states that run lotteries.
 These ads appear in nearly every mass medium (e.g., television,
radio, daily newspapers, and billboards), and are notorious for
encouraging working-class people to regard the lottery as a viable
way to make money-and escape from what the ads sometimes depict
as dreary, dead-end jobs.  
<P>
    Thus one lottery ad featured a vendor at a sporting event
who thinks to himself, &quot;If I win Pick-6, I won't have to
do this anymore.&quot;  A billboard located in a crime-infested,
impoverished neighborhood on Chicago's South Side displayed an
Illinois lottery ticket with a caption that read simply:  &quot;This
could be your ticket out.&quot;  The ad did not merely fail to
disclose the statistical improbability of such good fortune; it
also revealed that the state was deliberately pitching its lottery
to those least able to afford the luxury of gambling, and in a
way calculated to appeal to the very anguish and desperation brought
on, arguably, by the failure of other state policies. 
<P>
    The economic critique of gambling rests heavily on the notion
that casinos deprive other businesses of revenue.  
<P>
    The implication for the validity of the substitution effect
is clear:  The availability of more disposable income means that
new forms of entertainment, such as casino gambling, can coexist
with, and need not supplant, existing forms of entertainment.
 To the extent that existing forms of entertainment suffer a decline
in revenue, this more likely reflects a change in consumer tastes
than any iron law of &quot;substitution.&quot;  Protecting existing
businesses by erecting legislative barriers to casino development
would run counter to the interest of consumers.
<P>
    Given gambling's enduring place in American history -- as both
a popular pastime enjoyed by millions, and as a source of bitter
controversy -- it is naive to think that a national consensus on
gambling will emerge any time soon.  Thus, the appropriate locus
for the debate over gambling lies exactly where it does today
-- at the level of state government.  Yet for those who want a
national gambling policy that reflects their personal predilections,
the constitutional limits on the scope of federal authority are
an inconvenient obstacle that must be overcome.  
<P>
    That is why the formation of a federal investigatory commission
on gambling is an important victory for the national anti-gambling
movement.  For the commission, far from being a mere fact-finding
body, represents the means by which federal power can be mobilized,
not only against gambling, but against the rightful authority
(and duty) of state governments to set their own policies on gambling.

<BR>CEI recently published the fourth edition of the <I>Free
Market Environmental Bibliography</I>. This updated version includes
more subject areas and brief essays outlining the free market
approach to environmental concerns. 

<P>Many people believe that new approaches to environmental
problems are necessary for environmental progress to continue.
 An increasingly popular idea is free market environmentalism
(FME),an alternative paradigm for environmental protection that
focuses on how institutional arrangements empower or inhibit private
actors to address environmental concerns.

<P>Supporters of FME believe that the same institutions which
have generated wealth and ensured individual liberty -- property
rights, market exchange and rule of law -- are the best hope for ensuring
environmental quality, now and in the future.
<P>
    This bibliography is vital to those interested in new approaches
to environmental protection. Selections include academic articles,
treatises, policy papers and magazine stories. The entries are
subdivided by topic, as well as by their source. Each section
begins with introductory remarks which identify key readings and
the insights they provide. 
<P>
    The <I>Free Market Environmental Bibliography</I> an ongoing
project. CEI will update and expand it again in coming years.

<FONT SIZE=+1>Warren T. Brookes Fellowship Memorial Dinner</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+3>Governor John Engler</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>Tuesday, November 19,1996</FONT><BR>
</B></CENTER>

<P><BR>
As you may know, <A HREF="/olson.html">Joe Olson</A>, before he took the post of Insurance Commissioner in my administration, was Chair of the Board of Directors at the <A HREF="http://www.mackinac.org">Mackinac Center</A> -- a Michigan-based think tank that we call the CEI of the midwest.
<P>
Actually, if Warren Brookes were alive today, I am certain he
would be thrilled at the degree to which idea-generating organizations
like <A HREF="/">CEI</A>, the <A HREF="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</A> and the <A HREF="http://www.heritage.org">Heritage Foundation</A> are leading
the debate in Washington.
<P>
Certainly, he would be proud -- extremely proud -- of the scholars
who have so ably filled the Warren Brookes Fellowship in Environmental
Journalism. Beginning with Ron Bailey, and continuing with Michael
Fumento, Michelle Malkin and James Bovard, these Warren Brookes
fellows have represented the epitome of excellent scholarship,
thoughtful analysis and outstanding writing.
<P>
Indeed, every time I pick up a newspaper like the <I>Wall Street
Journal</I> and see a column by a scholar such as Jim Bovard, I think
of Warren and know that he lives on -- not just through the CEI
fellows but through all of us.
<P>
We share his belief in the power of free markets. We share his
skepticism of bureaucratic science -- BS as Warren used to call
it. And we share his lifelong commitment to the principle that
people make better decisions -- for their businesses, for their
families and for the world they live in -- better decisions than
government ever could.
<P>
Warren Brookes was an honest broker in the marketplace of ideas
and information. And while we miss his voice twice-a-week in the
paper, we certainly continue to benefit every day from the power
of his ideas and the diversity of his intellect.
<P>
I wish that Warren would have been alive to see Republicans take
control of Congress. What I wish even more would have been to
see the fun Warren would have had skewering the Clinton administration
- on issues ranging from his pre-election land grab in Utah to
the 225,000 pages of rules that have been added to the federal
register over the past four years.
<P>
Considering the withering criticism Warren had for a previous
administration, we can only imagine what he would have said about
the current president. Recall this example of what Warren said
about the 1990 debate over the Clean Air Act:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;. . . in the current environmental debate on Capitol Hill,
the collective hole in the White House and legislative heads may
be larger and more permanent than the one that shows up every
fall in the ozone layer over the Antarctic -- and more dangerous
to our economic and ecological health.&quot;
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
 Just imagine what Warren might have written about the Clinton-Gore
mantra -- &quot;protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the
environment.&quot; Or what he would have said about a vice president
who has a portrait of Rachel Carson hanging in his office.
<P>
Remember, this is the same vice president, who is his 1992 book,
<I>Earth in the Balance</I>, said that the automobile was a mortal threat
to our national security. In addition, I bet that Warren would
have been the first to point out that the president's so-called
bridge to the 21st century is a toll bridge.
<P>
In a world where too many people get their news from Oprah Winfrey
and Geraldo Rivera, we need more journalists like Warren Brooks.
And fortunately, more journalists -- like John Stossel, last year's
speaker at this dinner -- are rising to the challenge.
<P>
Just yesterday, for example, two op-eds in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>,
one by Julian Simon, the other by David Rothbard and Craig Rucker,
debunked for the the umpteenth time -- the myths about a population
explosion and fear of famine currently being propagated at the
U.N. Food Summit in Rome.
<P>
We learn from their able scholarship that people worldwide are
better fed living longer and healthier lives. More importantly,
we learned that continuously improving farming methods are more
than capable  of  feeding a growing world population.
<P>
As the father of triplet daughters, I had been concemed that I
had unwittingly contributed to an impending worldwide disaster.
I was especially concerned because my little Maggie does not like
to share her food. Let me tell -- no one is going to take apple
juice away from Maggie.
<P>
Seriously, there is no doubt that when it comes to environmental
joumalism, those who follow in Warren's footsteps are outnumbered
by those who don't. But we have an ally on our side that usually
wins in the end -- the truth. And I have developed a method of
getting back at the fearmongers, especially liberal fearmongers
<P>
I'll say to them, &quot;Did you know that one in four liberals
is at risk of developing cancer and that one in five liberals
will die from it?&quot; Of course, I don't tell them that conservatives
-- indeed all Americans -- face the same risk of cancer.
<P>
I should note, however, that Warren wrote about much more than
environmental issues. Often, he wrote about a subject dear to
my hear -- taxes, and the economic benefits of cutting them. For
example, he wrote in his column in June 1991:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
&quot;One of the genius strokes of the U.S. Constitution is that
it provides the one thing most governmenta. systems lack, namely
competition within government itself. The federalist system still
allows states to pursue varying tax, fiscal and regulatory policies
that strongly influence their economic activity. This means states
automatically become 'laboratories' for economic policy. Unfortunately,
liberal think tanks have all but ignored this fertile field for
research -- and with good reason: There is a virtually unblemished
         record of strong economic performance in low-tax states,
and vice-versa.
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
As usual, Warren was right. And Michigan's success story proves
it.
<P>
Just a few months after I became Michigan's governor, I invited
Warren, Tom Bray and several other friends over for dinner. At
the time, Michigan's economy was mired in recession. Unemployment
was approaching ten percent.
<P>
The state budget was nearly $2 billion in the red and the deficit
was growing. At the same time, taxes -- especially property taxes
-- were skyrocketing and welfare was becoming a way of life for
more and more families. A tent city of protestor had camped out
on the lawn of the State Capitol.
<P>
Twenty-one tax cuts later, Michigan is a far different place.
Twenty-one tax cuts have put more than $6.5 billion back into
the wallets and purses of Michigan taxpayers. I'm talking about
the biggest property tax cut in history, cutting income taxes,
raising exemptions, eliminating inheritance taxes and most taxes
on pensions. We're even phasing out Michigan's capital gains tax.
<P>
The result has been an economic turnaround that is the envy of
America. Our unemployment rate has been below five percent  every
month this year. In fact, we are headed for the lowest unemployment
rate since 1969.
<P>
That's not the only good news. Since 1991, Michigan employers
have created more than 500,000 new jobs. Over the same period,
personal income in Michigan has climbed more than 25 percent --
the fastest growth rate in the nation.
<P>
Since 1994, more than 100,000 families have left the welfare rolls
and achieved independence. Michigan's budget has been balanced
five years in a row and our state's Rainy Day Fund is at an historic
high of more than $1 billion.
<P>
And I should note that we have accomplished all of this, not inspired
by Washington, but in spite of Washington . . . 
<P>
. . .  in spite of the biggest tax increase in history
<P>
. . .  in spite of two vetoes of welfare reform
<P>
. . .  and in spite of an EPA that has increasingly overstepped
its bounds and usurped the lawmaking responsibilities of Congress
and stepped on the state's ability to implement environmental
reform.
<P>
Indeed, I am reminded of a story that NYU law professor David
Schoenbrod tells in his book, <I>Power Without Responsibility</I>, about
the battles between Franklin Roosevelt and the Supreme Court concerning
the limits of federal power.
<P>
Schoenbrod -- who is also a scholar at the Manhattan and Cato Institutes
-- cites a case in which the Supreme Court struck down several
provisions of FDR's National Industrial Recovery Act -- legislation
creating a federal agency to write and enforce its own laws dictating
wages, prices and production schedules.  At the time, Justice
Louis Brandies told a top Roosevelt aide:
<P><blockquote>
&quot;This is the end of this business of centralization, and
I want you to go back and tell the president that we are not going
to let this government centralize everything.  It's come to an
end.  As for your young men, you call them together and tell them
to get out of Washington -- tell them to go home to the states.
 That is where they must do their work.&quot;
<P></blockquote>
My friends, we have been doing the work in Michigan.  As governor
of a state with more than 3,000 miles of coastline on the nation's
most precious fresh water resources -- the Great Lakes -- I know
that the quality of our natural resources directly affect the
lives an livelihoods of all our citizens.
<P>
I believe strongly that a healthy environment and a healthy economy
are mutually sustainable.  You cannot have one without the other.
 On a microeconomic level, I also believe that good environmental
policy is good business.  However, the unfortunate  reality id
that government policies designed to protect or to clean up the
environment that do not recognize this basic principle of mutual
sustainability are usually counterproductive.
<P>
For example, consider the federal Superfund program.  Rather than
directing limited resources to achieve the most cost effective
reduction in health risk to the public, Superfund has spawned
endless lawsuits and legal wrangling, much-delayed and ever more
costly cleanups, and contaminated sites that remain unused, undeveloped
and a threat to public health.  Indeed, I am told that as much
as 80 percent of the funding for this program goes to pay lawyers.
 Maybe we ought to rename Superfund the &quot;Superlawyer Fund.&quot;
<P>
I am especially concerned about the program's explicit failure
to rehabilitate urban &quot;brownfield&quot; sites and to make
them available for redevelopment.  In a scientific survey of Michigan's
environmental; problems. The inability to reuse such urban sites
in favor of suburban and rural &quot;Greenfield&quot; was identified
as our state's top concern.
<P>
The current CERCLA liability scheme of strict, joint and several
and retroactive liability is part of the problem.  While the system
is labeled &quot;polluter's pay,&quot; in reality it is &quot;deep
pockets pay.&quot;  As a result, redevelopment efforts are stymied
as cleanup costs skyrocket and liability disputes escalate.
<P>
Until last year, Michigan's cleanup rules had mirrored the federal
CERCLA liability scheme and the lack of results, especially in
our inner cities, was all too evident. With tlie support of a
wide geographical range of city mayors, in June 1995, I signed
legislation that replaced strict liability for owners and operators
with a  liability standard based on causation.
<P>
This approach retains the concept that the polluters should pay
by still holding the parties that caused the problem liable for
cleaning it up. We also enacted a blanket exemption from liability
for existing contaminated culpable purchasers and occupants of
contaminated property.
<P>
In addition, we have strengthened and expanded liability protections
available to lenders who foreclose on contaminated property. I
strongly encourage identical liability protections be included
in Superfund in each of theses areas. Such reforms are vital to
state and city efforts to encourage reuse of contaminated property.
<P>
Further encouragement can be provided by cleanup standards based
on land use. Recent reforms in Michigan allow us to use containment
remedies and land use controls in lieu of performing costly remediations.
Combined with a single risk level and specific soil and groundwater
cleanup criteria, we can develop remedial action plans for sites
of environmental contamination far more quickly than Records of
Decision can be developed under Superfund.
<P>
Our new cleanup standards allow us to use our limited resources
to get the best protection for our citizens. Indeed, we estimate
that these reforms will reduce the cost of cleaning a site by
up to 50 percent while still providing fully protective remedies.
<P>
The results so far have been impressive. A study of our reforms
that was released earlier this year showed an increase in investment
by the private sector of more than $220 million and the creation
of more than 2,300 jobs in redevelopment projects.
<P>
In contract, on the federal level, under the current Superfund
law we have the worst of all possible worlds: Burdensome cleanup
rules and considerable duplication between the federal and state
government serve to waste money, delay cleanup projects and deny
accountability to the public.
<P>
Superfund is only one example of a federal environmental policy
that is counterproductive, costly, and cumbersome to the states.
I wish I had time to discuss all my concerns with management of
the EPA, but let me just briefly highlight a few.
<P>
First, the Clinton administration has proposed stricter clean
air standards that threaten to put virtually every major metropolitan
area in Michigan and America into noncompliance. The result would
be severe restrictions on economic growth in those areas, especially
the very same inner cities that desperately need growth and  new
jobs.
<P>
Second, the EPA has launched an all-out assault on states that
have enacted environmental audit laws that encourage companies
to perform such audits and promptly report and correct violations.
In fact, the EPA has punished such states by interfering in the
state delegation of federal programs like the Clean Air Act, the
Clean Water Act, and other environmental statutes.
<P>
Heavyhanded, autocratic, and unelected bureaucrats at the EPA
are telling the states that we are guilty until proven innocent.
Even worse, we most likely face similar punishments for implementing
emissions trading  programs and wetlands mitigation banks. To
the EPA, no good deed by the states goes unpunished.
<P>
Third, bowing to pressure from environmental extremists, the EPA
recently took unprecedented steps to stall a solution mining project
in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, delaying the project for at least
18 months and costing at least 100 jobs.
<P>
The reversal of EPA policy came as a shock to the mining compacy,
the workers and state officials, for the EPA had been working
closely with them for two years and had previously approved the
project.
<P>
The irony is that an idle copper mine threatens nearby Lake Superior.
An active solution mine would permanently protect the lake. The
end result of the EPA's meddling? Jobs lost and a Great Lake threatened.
<P>
Fourth, a recently leaked memo from the EPA reveals a secret Clinton
plan to raise the federal gas tax by 50 cents, increase CAFE standards
and tighten auto emission restrictions -- all without the approval
of  Congress. I would call this secret plan a disaster for Michigan
-- the nation's number one auto-producing state!
<P>
Using an obscure section of legislation enacted in the early 1960's,
the author of this memo claims the president has the authority
to administratively enact such measures based on national security
concerns. That tells me we need more CEI fellows standing careful
watch over an administration that accepts environmental extremism
as gospel and rejects common sesnse cost-benefit analysis as heresy.
<P>
That's why they punished the president for his 1.7 million acre
land grab in Utah by defeating that state's only Democratic Congressman,
Bill Orton. That's why they re-elected a Republican Congress for
the first time in 70 years. That's why states from Maine to Montana
rejected extremist ballot measures.
<P>
In Michigan, for example, by a two to one margin, voters rejected
a measure sponsored by animal rights activists that would have
virtually eliminated bear hunting.
<P>
In our democracy, that is our saving grace -- the vote of the
people. And that is the best reflection of Warren Brookes' legacy
-- a voting public that is better informed on issues from the
environment to the  economy.
<P>
The voters don't make the right choice every time, but with the
wise balance of power devised by our founding fathers, I believe
that America is back on track to developing an environmental policy
based on sound science, relative risk, and free market principles.
<P>
We won't get there overnight, but we will get there. That's our
promise to Warren Brookes and his legacy to us.
<P>
Thank you very much.

<A HREF="/staff/adler.html">Jonathan H. Adler</A>, November 1996

<P>
<BR>&quot;If there is one event that causes the diverse environmental
community to hyperventilate in unison, it is an assault on the
ESA (Endangered Species Act),&quot; said Donald Barry of the World
Wildlife Fund.  This, more than anything else, may explain why
environmental activists vehemently attack CEI's efforts to protect
private property rights from regulatory takings or to promote
a non-regulatory approach to species conservation.

<P>The most recent barrage came from Robert Bonnie, an economist
at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). In an October 15 <I>Washington
Times</I> op-ed, &quot;Giving Animals Safe Harbor,&quot;
 Bonnie assailed CEI for promoting private conservation and suggesting
that voluntary efforts could do more for species than the ESA.
 CEI's work, he charged, &quot;has no basis in reality.&quot;
 Given that the ESA has yet to recover a single listed species,
one can imagine the level of contempt  Bonnie has for voluntary
conservation efforts.  Yet as one might expect, Bonnie's op-ed
was filled with inaccurate and misleading claims about CEI's work
and America's proud legacy of private conservation.
<P>
    For starters, Bonnie claimed that the bluebird is the &quot;only&quot;
species for which &quot;recovery was primarily a result of voluntary
efforts.&quot;  This is simply false.  Private conservation efforts
have helped many species tremendously, including some of those
Bonnie mentions.
<P>
    For instance,  Bonnie wrote that &quot;the return of the wild
plains bison occurred not on private lands, but on public lands.&quot;
 Really?  It was the lack of protection on government lands, and
the government-supported slaughter of bison, that brought the
species to the brink of extinction in the first place.  By 1905,
the federal government had only 25 plains bison in Yellowstone
National Park, all of which were sold or donated by private conservationists.
 The only other plains bison the government watched over were
in Washington, D.C., where there were fewer than ten.  While federal
lands were anything but safe harbors for bison, historical documents
show that there were hundreds of bison in private hands by 1905.
 Moreover, in the federal bison preserves Bonnie cites, those
herds were also started from bison donated by or purchased from
private owners.  Were it not for private conservationists, there
would have been no bison to &quot;return&quot; to federal lands.

<P>
    Federal funding was &quot;critical&quot; for peregrine falcon
recovery efforts, according to Bonnie.  However, Tom Cade, founder
of the Peregrine Fund, told my colleagues that peregrine reintroduction
efforts would have occurred with or without federal funding. 
 Moreover, the Fish and Wildlife Service's enforcement activities
in the 1980s hindered efforts to restore peregrines through captive
breeding.
<P>
    Of course the banning of DDT in 1972 (not 1970 as Bonnie claims)
by the Environmental Protection Agency (not Congress) played an
indispensable role in the peregrine's recovery.  It was also the
DDT ban, and not the ESA as Bonnie implies, that was primarily
responsible for the rebound of the bald eagle.  EDF takes credit
for the DDT ban time and again in its promotional literature.
 Yet Bonnie apparently forgot what EDF's fundraisers know by rote.
<P>
    There are countless stories of private conservation in action,
as documented in reports by CEI and others.  America's conservation
tradition, and its reliance on non-coercive means to achieve environmental
goals, is something of which environmental activists should be
proud.  The same claim cannot be made for the ESA, which has failed
to recover a single species, notwithstanding government claims
to the contrary.
<P>
    Part of the problem, which Bonnie and his colleagues at EDF
have acknowledged, is that the ESA punishes private landowners
for owning habitat.  As currently written, the ESA is an enemy
of private conservation.  Well over 100,000 nesting boxes have
been erected for wood ducks since the turn of the century.  Over
150,000 wood ducks hatched out of such boxes in 1990.  Yet were
the wood duck ever &quot;protected&quot; by the ESA, duck boxes
would become a liability for private landowners.  Is it any wonder
such efforts are rarely undertaken for listed species?
<P>
    Bonnie and the Interior Department would like us to believe
that the &quot;safe harbors&quot; policy solves this problem.
It doesn't.  It merely forestalls federal land-use controls on
those landowners willing to negotiate deals with the federal government.
 No wonder nearly half of those participating in &quot;safe harbors&quot;
protecting the red-cockaded woodpecker are golf courses, which
are unlikely ever to need to cut a tree or otherwise modify habitat
in a manner that could harm such birds.  Small landowners who
wish to do more on their land than sink birdies stand to gain
very little.  They still have tremendous incentives &quot;to destroy
prime habitat and even species,&quot; in Bonnie's words, due to
the punitive nature of the ESA.  &quot;Safe harbors&quot; or not,
landowners will continue to &quot;shoot, shovel and shut up,&quot;
as they say out west, so long as the ESA threatens to restrict
the use of their land.

<P>In 1995 CEI founded the <A HREF="/cpc/">Center for Private Conservation</A> to
research and promote non-regulatory approaches to wildlife conservation.
 If EDF's activists care as much about saving endangered species
as they do about saving the Endangered Species Act, they will
help this effort, not denigrate it.

<A HREF="/staff/kazman.html">Sam Kazman</A>, CEI General Counsel, November 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>Air bags were one of my first issues when I began working in public
interest law twenty years ago.  I had just started as an attorney
with Pacific Legal Foundation.  The U.S. Department of Transportation,
under the newly elected Carter Administration, shelved a massive
demonstration program for passive restraints (that is, air bags
and automatic seat belts), and instead mandated the devices. 

<P>We sued.  We argued that DOT was arbitrarily mandating passive
restraints without extensive field testing; that air bags posed
significant risks of their own; and that the mandate was a violation
of privacy rights.  We lost. 

<P>Several years later the Reagan Administration
tried to rescind the passive restraint mandate.  The insurance
industry successfully sued to keep the mandate in force.  In 1983,
shortly after the Supreme Court ruled against the rescission,
I argued in a <I>Wall St. Journal</I> op-ed that the Administration's
major mistake had been to accept &quot;the conventional wisdom
that air bags have been proven in the real world.&quot;

<P>These days
the newspapers are filled with stories of air bags killing children
and small or elderly adults.  Joan Claybrook and Company claim
the auto industry knew of this threat for decades and did nothing.
But it was Joan Claybrook herself who, as  Administrator of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Agency under Carter, was a prime
mover behind the passive restraint mandate.  Among her lesser
known actions was suppressing a cadaver test study that indicated
that air bags caused greater injury than seat belts, and harassing
the researcher who wrote the study.  

<P>At the same time, a NHTSA
brochure blandly debunked the notion &quot;that not enough is
known about these systems&quot;.  The air bag, it explained, simply
inflates, protects, and begins deflating in the blink of an eye.
 &quot;Basically, that is all there is to the air cushion and
how it works.  Not all that complicated, is it?&quot;, it stated
reassuringly.

<P>Air bags do save lives on balance, but significantly
fewer lives than NHTSA predicted and with risks that are far greater
than the agency acknowledged back then.  

<P>In coming months, the
auto industry will come under increasing fire for having supposedly
failed to &quot;warn&quot; us about the hazards of air bags, with
Claybrook &amp; Co. only adding to the heat.  

<P>Not all that complicated,
is it?

<H2>The Power of Positive Drinking</H2>
<P>
<A HREF="/staff/lieber.html">Ben Lieberman</A>, November 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>CEI is back in federal court.  On October 29th, CEI filed suit against the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) to challenge the agency's
prohibition against truthful statements concerning the health
benefits of moderate drinking on alcoholic beverage labels and
advertisements.  Consumer Alert,
a non-profit consumer advocacy group with an interest in protecting
the free flow of information to its members, is also a party to
the suit. This action culminates a nearly one and one-half year
effort to get ATF to stop censoring the facts about moderate alcohol
consumption.  In 1995, CEI petitioned the agency to allow truthful
health statements on labels and advertisements.  Several months
later, CEI conducted <A HREF="http://www.cei.org/press.html">a poll</A> which showed a high level of public
ignorance about the link between moderate drinking and lower heart
disease.  CEI even printed and distributed labels of our own mock
vintage, <A HREF="http://www.cei.org/wine.gif">&quot;Vino Veritas (Freedom of Speech Wine),&quot;</A> which
include a health statement.   Thus far, ATF has simply stonewalled.
 
<P>Now, they are legally required to respond to the lawsuit within
60 days. ATF is still fighting the reality that moderate drinking
reduces the risk of contracting heart disease, the leading cause
of deaths in adults.  More than 100 studies establishing the connection
between moderate alcohol consumption and substantial reductions
in cardiovascular risk and overall mortality have appeared in
the New England Journal of Medicine, the Journal of the American
Medical Association, the British Medical Journal, and others.
 
<P>Among medical researchers, the facts are no longer in doubt.
 But the ATF bureaucrats who regulate alcoholic beverage labels
and advertisements can't handle the truth.  They don't want the
public to know that there could be anything good about drinking.
The issue has been popularized by the media, however.  In particular,
CBS' 60 Minutes has done two stories on the so-called &quot;French
Paradox&quot; --  the fact that the wine-loving French have a higher
dietary fat intake but are less likely than Americans to suffer
from cardiovascular disease.  Still, most Americans are uninformed.
 
<P>CEI's 1995 poll found that more than half the respondents were
unaware of the health benefits associated with moderate drinking.
 Of those that were aware, many mistakenly believed the benefits
could be derived only from red wine, the focus of the 60 Minutes
segments.  However, the positive association has been found with
all types of alcohol. Putting this information on alcoholic beverage
labels and advertisements would increase the level of knowledge.
 
<P>A Federal Trade Commission study demonstrated that the benefits
of fiber in cereals, though well established medically, were largely
unknown to the general public until the information started appearing
on product labels.  The increase in knowledge was greatest for
economically and educationally disadvantaged individuals, who
are less likely to read health related publications, and for whom
labels and ads are an important source of information.  The same
would likely be true in the case of moderate drinking and heart
disease. Nonetheless, the ATF, which has authority over the content
of alcoholic beverage labels and advertisements, has steadfastly
refused to allow any health statements whatsoever.  CEI petitioned
ATF to allow such statements in May of 1995, and included the
following language as an example of what should be permissible:
&quot;There is significant evidence that moderate consumption
of alcoholic beverages may reduce the risk of heart disease.&quot;
 
<P>Nearly one and one-half years later, ATF has yet to respond.
 Consumer Alert has written ATF in support of our petition, also
to no avail.  As one industry insider said, &quot;ATF will do
nothing on health claims unless somebody sues them.&quot;  So
CEI did. CEI's suit contends that ATF's suppression of the facts
about the benefits of moderate drinking violates the First Amendment.
 Supreme Court precedent on this point is very favorable.  The
Court has consistently held that the First Amendment applies to
so-called commercial speech.  In just the past two years, the
Court has heard two cases involving the First Amendment and limitations
on alcoholic beverage labeling and advertising.  In both, all
nine justices ruled that such communications are Constitutionally
protected.  In Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.,  the Court ruled that
Coors had a First Amendment right to put alcohol content information
on beer bottles and cans.  ATF had sought to ban such information.
 
<P>More recently, in 44 Liquormart Inc. v. Rhode Island, the Court
struck down a Rhode Island law banning price advertising by liquor
stores.    The main argument ATF has offered up in support of
its position is that health statements are misleading &quot;unless
they are properly qualified, present all sides of the issue, and
outline the categories of individuals for whom any positive effects
would be outweighed by numerous negative health effects.&quot;
 
<P>In effect, ATF would require health statements to be followed
by detailed caveats explaining every conceivable reason why someone
should not drink.  ATF admits that it is &quot;extremely unlikely
that such a balanced claim would fit on a normal alcoholic beverage
label&quot; -- thus their position is a de facto ban.   Similar
arguments about the incomplete nature of commercial speech have
been rejected by the Supreme Court.  In the 1977 case of Bates
v. State Bar of Arizona, the Court held that:it seems peculiar
to deny the consumer, on the ground that the information is incomplete,
at least some of the relevant information needed to reach an informed
decision.  Moreover, the argument assumes that the public is not
sophisticated enough to realize the limitations of advertising,
and that the public is better kept in ignorance than trusted with
correct but incomplete information.  We suspect the argument rests
on an underestimation of the public.  In any event, we view as
dubious any justification that is based on the benefits of public
ignorance. ATF's reasoning relies heavily on the assumption that
the public cannot be trusted with the facts.  Paternalism, though
popular with ATF and other regulatory agencies and Naderite nanny
groups, has been dismissed as an unacceptable rationale for censorship.
 
<P>In 44 Liquormart, Justice John Paul Stevens declared that &quot;the
First Amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations
that seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives
to be their own good.&quot;  In addition to having the facts and
the law against it, the ATF is clinging to a policy that has been
abandoned by other federal agencies.  The Department of Agriculture
and the Department of Health and Human Services, in their new
edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, acknowledged
the health benefits of moderate drinking, stating that &quot;current
evidence suggests that moderate drinking is associated with a
lower risk for coronary heart disease in some individuals.&quot;
 
<P>Under federal law, the Dietary Guidelines &quot;shall be promoted
by each Federal agency in carrying out any Federal food, nutrition,
or health program.&quot;  Rather than &quot;promote&quot; the
potential health benefits of moderate alcohol consumption, ATF
has chosen to suppress them.  Indeed, pasting pages of this document
on a bottle could land a winemaker in jail.  CEI's suit is now
pending in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia.  Stay tuned for further developments.

<FONT SIZE=+2>Population Control Won't Stop World Hunger</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1>UN Should Not Have Expelled Dissenters from Food Summit</FONT>
</CENTER>
<P><BR><B>WASHINGTON, DC, November 15, 1996</B><BR>
Population control is not the answer to global food shortages, according to the <A HREF="/">Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI)</A>, a free market think tank.  Market-driven innovations in fertilizer use, high-yield seed hybrids, and biotechnology have produced tremendous leaps in agricultural productivity. Yet the reasons for increased food abundance are being ignored at the UN World Food Summit being held this week in Rome, Italy.

<P>&quot;The keys to reduced hunger are growing economies and rising incomes, which allow citizens to become healthier and live longer.
Coercive actions by governments to squelch population growth is
no solution,&quot; said <A HREF="http://www.cei.org/staff/sheehan.html">James Sheehan</A>, research associate at CEI.

<P>Confounding alarmists predictions,  the U.S. returned a record
corn crop in 1996.  Prices of corn, wheat, and other commodities
have fallen dramatically, ending fears of a severe global food
shortage.  

<P>The refugee crisis in Zaire focused the world's attention on global
hunger just as ten thousand delegates convened at the Rome Summit.
&quot;The problem in this part of Africa is political instability,
government repression, socialist planning and civil strife, not
overpopulation,&quot; says Sheehan.  &quot;The strategies contained
in the World Food Summit's Plan of Action would have done nothing
to head off the current refugee crisis.&quot;

<P>The UN is also calling on the U.S. to give far more foreign aid
to developing countries.  The regime in Zaire has already received
$8 billion in foreign aid in the last twenty five years, but was
used simply to finance the lavish lifestyle of its corrupt leadership,
according to CEI.  More foreign aid lending, which has had the
effect of miring the poorest countries deeply in debt, is likely
to further impede their capacity to create wealth and grow economically.

<P>&quot;Inept government policies are responsible for economic distortions
and localized shortages,&quot; says Sheehan, &quot;this is what
prevents the poor from having access to the global abundance of
food.&quot;
<P>
Market-oriented perspectives have been absent at the Food Summit
because of the UN's arbitrary decision to limit the number of
credentialed non-governmental organizations permitted to participate
in the conference.  That decision had the effect of excluding
NGOs who do not support the summit's population control objectives.
&quot;It appears that the UN does not welcome dissenting points
of view,&quot; commented Sheehan.

<P><BR>From Rome, Julian Morris of the Institute
of Economic Affairs (UK) contributed to this release.

<H2>Greens' Bark Worse Than Bite</H2>
</CENTER>

<H3>Environmental Issues Played Minor Role in Congressional
Races</H3>

<P><B>WASHINGTON, DC November 6, 1996</B><BR>
Despite predictions that environmental issues would sweep many Republican Senators and Congressmen out of office, environmental issues appear to have had a minimal impact on the 1996 Congressional elections and many Republicans targeted by environmental activists groups escaped unscathed.

<P>&quot;The best efforts of environmentalists failed to return a
Democratic Congress, and they lost ground in the Senate,&quot;
commented <A HREF="/staff/adler.html">Jonathan Adler</A>, Director of <A HREF="/esp.html">Environmental Studies</A> at
the <A HREF="/">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A> and author of <a href="http://www.townhall.com/crc/books/green.html"><I>Environmentalism at the Crossroads: Green Activism in America</I></A>. A Sierra Club election day release proclaimed that &quot;Based on the number
of candidate ads that cite an endorsement by the Sierra Club,
the environment will be a powerful issue in this election... &quot;

<P>&quot;The Greens' bark was worse than their bite,&quot; Adler noted. &quot;The Republicans' failure to march in lockstep with the environmental establishment cost them very little.&quot;

<P>&quot;This should not be a big surprise,&quot; said Adler. &quot;Polling
data has consistently shown that Americans support <I>both</I>
environmental protection <I>and</I> limited government. Just because
people want environmental protection does not mean that they want
extensive federal regulation.&quot; Earlier this year, CEI released
a <I>National Survey of Attitudes on Environmental Policy</I>
that showed strong support for protecting private property rights
and devolving authority for many environmental programs to state
and local governments.

<P>&quot;There was a backlash against excessive federal regulations
in the 1994 elections, and few candidates wished to appear unresponsive
to the needs and concerns of small businesses and private landowners,&quot;
Adler said. In the Vice Presidential debate between Al Gore and
Jack Kemp, Gore emphasized Clinton administration efforts to reduce
red tape and regulatory burdens. &quot;The Clinton reelection
team clearly understood the importance of these issues,&quot;
Adler added. &quot;When Clinton went the other way, and locked
up 1.7 million acres in Utah, he cost the Democrats a seat.&quot;
Incumbent Rep. Bill Orton (D-UT) was defeated, in part, due to
the backlash in his district, which contains the Escalante National
Monument designated by President Clinton during the campaign.

<H2>CEI Internship Program</H2>
</CENTER>
<P><BR>
The <A HREF="/">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A> has full-time, paid internship
positions available for fall, winter, spring, and summer.  Quarter and
Semester schedules can be accommodated.  These positions are for juniors,
seniors, and graduate students only.  

<P>Applicants must submit a resume, cover letter, and writing sample (short
research paper is best) to:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
Intern Coordinator<BR>
CEI<BR>
1001 Connecticut Ave., NW<BR>
Suite 1250<BR>
Washington, DC  20036<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>When selecting interns, we look for individuals who are free-market oriented and are majoring in one of the following areas:  political science, journalism, public policy, philosophy, economics, environmental studies, and pre-law (other majors will be considered depending upon non-academic experience).  Good research and writing skills along with a working knowledge of Word Perfect 5.1 or Microsoft Word are essential.

<P>Based on policy interests and experience, interns at CEI are assigned to
work with one or two <A HREF="/staff/">policy analysts</A> for the duration of their internship.
This way, interns get an in-depth view of what a policy analyst does, and
focus on issue areas they are familiar with.  However, they are also asked
to do work (go-fer-type) for other staff members.  Interns are encouraged to take the initiative to write opinion editorials or letters to the editor on topics pertinent to the work CEI does.  Motivated graduate students who have expertise with one specific issue have, in the past, been given the
opportunity to write monographs for CEI.

<P>By interning at CEI, students learn about the role of think tanks in shaping public policy and public opinion.  They will be able to sharpen their research, editing, and writing skills.  Our interns are encouraged to attend lectures hosted by other think tanks (<A HREF="http://www.cato.org">Cato</A>, <A HREF="http://www.heritage.org">The Heritage Foundation</A>, etc.) in D.C., as well as participate in round table discussions held at CEI.

<B>President and Founder<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:flsmith@CEI.org">flsmith@CEI.org</A></B>
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>Fred L. Smith, Jr.  is the President and Founder of the <A HREF="/">Competitive
Enterprise Institute</A>, a public interest group active in a wide range of
economic and environmental public policy issues.  Located in Washington,
D.C., CEI works to educate and inform policymakers, journalists, and other
opinion leaders on market based alternatives to regulatory initiatives and
engages in public interest litigation to protect property rights and
economic liberty.

<P>Mr. Smith is a frequent guest on various radio and television programs where he has debated free market approaches to vexing public problems.  He has appeared on national news programs such as "MacNeil/Lehrer," "Crossfire," ABC's "20/20," and CNBC.  His writings can be seen in leading newspapers such as the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, the <I>Washington Times</I> and numerous public policy journals.  He authored a chapter on energy and environment in <I>Market Liberalism, a Paradigm for the 21st Century</I>, and is the co-editor of the
book, <A HREF="/books.html#politics"><i>Environmental Politics: Public Costs, Private Rewards</I></A> that argues
that much environmental regulation is driven by political considerations.
He also wrote the epilogue to CEI's critically acclaimed book, <A HREF="/trustate.html"><I>The True
State of the Planet</I></A>, a scientific guide to the environment written by some of the nation's premier environmental scholars.

<P>Before founding CEI, Mr. Smith served as the Director of Government
Relations for the Council for a Competitive Economy, as a senior economist
for Association of American Railroads, and for five years as a Senior Policy Analyst at the Environmental Protection Agency.

<P>Instead of relying on the political process to give sustained, long term
attention to environmental protection, <A HREF="/cei.html">CEI</A> has developed and promoted an
alternative strategy called <A HREF="/fme.html">free market environmentalism</A>.  CEI contends that
where individual property rights exist in environmental resources, the
environment is most likely to be protected.  After all, most of the
world's environmental problems exist in those areas where common ownership
of government management is the norm.  A free market environmental program
would allow individuals to advance environmental goals as effectively as free
markets permit individuals to advance economic goals.  The policies that flow
from this approach -- privatization, targeted liability rules, sound scientific
inquiry, reduced reliance on political regulation -- are very different from
those now being sought by environmental activists.  They are, however, far more
likely to prove effective.  <p>

<p>
CEI's Environmental Studies Program includes both an overall effort to
reframe the environmental debate and a series of targeted projects to reform
specific policies.  Only a comprehensive vision of market-oriented
environmental policies will engender the support needed to reform current
policies.  That framework must then be developed in detail for specific
environmental initiatives.<p>
<p>
As the leading proponent of free market environmentalism, the Competitive
Enterprise Institute continues to challenge the conventional wisdom of the
environmental movement and aggressively promotes free market environmentalism
as a more effective strategy for attaining our nation's environmental
goals.  CEI has fostered and coordinated the development of a network of public
policy organizations around the country and across the globe.  CEI has
positioned itself to take a stronger role in both domestic and international
debates over environmental policies in the 1990s.<p>

<p>
Specifically, CEI works on the vast array of particular environmental issues, including:

<BR>

<P>America has long been known as a nation where private homes and backyards are
beautiful but politically managed parks and streets are a mess.  For some the
answer is to raise taxes to better support the &#147;cash starved&#148; public
sector.  For others the answer will be found in stringent regulations covering
every aspect of modern society.  A better approach would be to discover what
makes homes and backyards beautiful and apply the lessons to problem areas.
Rather than bureaucratize the environment, we should privatize our efforts to
protect the environment....One might say that trees should not have legal
standing, but behind every tree should stand a private steward, a private
owner, willing and legally enabled to protect that resource....This vision of
an America engaged in creative ecological privatization may be radical, but it
offers great promise of lasting success in dealing with the ever-changing
circumstances of human interaction with the natural world.  Not only is this
vision applicable to environmental protection, it is compatible with the
traditional American respect for individual liberty.  (with Kent Jeffreys,
&#147;A Free Market Environmental Vision,&#148; David Boaz and Edward H. Crane
(Eds.), <i>Market Liberalism: A Paradigm for the 21st Century</i>, Cato
Institute, 1993, p. 389)<P>

<A HREF="/cei.html">CEI</A>'s <i>Death by Regulation</i> project is aimed at changing the policy
debate, not only through conventional policy analysis, but also by exploring
new means of bringing this message to a wider audience.  One approach is to
focus on previously unrecognized victims of regulatory failure, showing, for
example, that government regulation can in some cases be literally lethal.
<p>
This focus is based, in part, on our recognition that past deregulatory efforts
have either been outright failures or, at best, only limited successes.
Traditional cost-benefit debates are often rigged contests, with market
advocates easily cast as the "greedy" defenders of
"profits" while regulators are the "good guys" who protect
us.  CEI's <i>Death by Regulation</i> work attempts an end-run around this
dilemma -- if the public can be persuaded that government intervention carries
its own deadly consequences, then the entire nature of this debate changes.
<p>
The potential of the <i>Death by Regulation </i>project is best illustrated by
CEI's work on the <A HREF="ebb2.html">CAFE</A> issue.  The CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy)
program imposes the minimum fuel efficiency standards for each automaker's
sales of new cars in this country.  The CAFE program was established by
Congress in 1975 in response to the oil shocks of that period.    <p>
<p>
As oil prices subsequently began to fall in the mid-1980s, however, the public
started to seek larger, safer vehicles once again -- a shift in consumer demand
that ran headlong into CAFE's constraints.  America's competitive
advantage in the large-car production was undermined, destroying domestic jobs
and raising consumer prices.
<p>
CEI entered the CAFE debate in 1986, recognizing that economic arguments alone
were failing to win the policy debate.  CEI raised the CAFE-safety issue,
arguing that CAFE literally kills people by restricting the production of
larger, more crashworthy cars.  Recognizing the lack of formal academic
research on this, CEI persuaded Brookings economist Robert Crandall to
investigate the issue.  The result was a study, co-authored with Harvard Public
Health Professor John D. Graham, that appeared in the 1989 <i>Journal of Law
and Economics</i>.  Its conclusion:  CAFE causes 2,000 to 4,000 car occupant
deaths each year.  <p>
     <p>
CEI also engaged in coalition building, spurring other groups not only to look
at this issue, but to produce their own policy papers on CAFE.  And CEI also
filed a new type of court challenge to CAFE, challenging not its economic
rationality but its lethal effect.  Our first case, in 1986, pitted CEI against
environmental groups who were seeking to make CAFE <u>more</u> stringent.  We
did not win that case on the merits, but we did establish that CEI had judicial
standing to raise the issue.<p>
<p>
The breakthrough came in 1992, in our second court case.  In the first judicial
overturning of a CAFE standard in the program's history, a federal appeals
court harshly rejected the government's claim that CAFE kills no one.  It
found that the agency had reached this conclusion through a combination of
"fudged analysis," "statistical legerdemain," and
"bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo."<p>
<p>
The agency at issue was NHTSA (the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration) whose main job is to promote traffic safety.  An agency whose
middle name is safety had been found to be concealing the fact that one of its
major programs kills people.  A key piece of evidence was the Harvard-Brookings
study that CEI had previously instigated.<p>
<p>
Most importantly, perhaps, the phenomenon of <i>Death by Regulation</i> was no
longer an academic hypothesis; it had been judicially confirmed.  <p>
<p>
The next chapter in the CAFE story is still being written.  CEI is back in
court, challenging NHTSA's refusal to follow the 1992 court decision.  A
ruling on our new case is imminent.<p>

<P>CPC seeks to expand the knowledge and information base surrounding the ability to advance environmental objectives privately, absent government control or influence. 

<P>The Center researches and documents successful private efforts to conserve resources and ecologically sensitive
lands, and analyzes how various legal and social institutions assist or
hinder the ability of private individuals and associations to protect their
environment.  The Center seeks to publicize its findings through
publications, speeches, roundtables, and work with interested organizations.</FONT>

<b>Free Market Environmentalism</b><p>
<p>

<A HREF="/essays/sheehan1.html">"Trashing Free Trade: The Basel Convention's Impact on International Commerce"</A><p>
by James M. Sheehan<p>
With the establishment of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995, free trade should be on the rise. However, new non-tariff trade
barriers are gaining increased acceptance around the world in the form of
multilateral environmental treaties with trade enforcement measures.<p>
October 1996	$6.00<p>

<HR NOSHADE>
<a href="marine.html"><i>Emerging Technologies and Private Stewardship of Marine Resources</i></A><p>
by Michael De Alessi<p>
Until recently, the prevailing notion among regulators was that fisheries
should be open and available to everyone.  This assured that fisheries would be
subject to the tragedy of the commons.  If fisheries are to survive, access to
them must be limited.  Mr. De Alessi, a Center for Private Conservation
Research Associate, explores options for saving the world's fisheries.<p>
January 1996		$6.00<p>


<HR NOSHADE>
<i>Resolving the Tragedy of the Commons by Creating Private Property Rights in Wildlife</i><p>
by Robert J. Smith<p>
The problems of overexploitation and extinction of wildlife appear to derive
consistently from their being treated as a common property resource.  Center
for Private Conservation Senior Scholar R. J. Smith, through several examples,
demonstrates how creating private property rights in wildlife can preserve our natural resources.  (Originally published in Cato Journal, Vol. 1, No. 2 [Fall 1981].  Copyright Cato Institute.)<p>
January 1996		$6.00  <p>



<HR NOSHADE>
<i>Two Years After NAFTA: A Free Market Critique and Assessment</i><p>
by James M. Sheehan<p>
In this close inspection of the NAFTA proposal, CEI Research Associate James Sheehan revealed not genuine free trade, but a managed trade agreement designed to create a North American trade bloc.  The treaty erected new barriers to
outside parties and created a new bureaucracy capable of entangling trade
policy in a morass of environmental and social concerns.<p>
December 1995		$5.00<p>




<HR NOSHADE>
<i>Appropriations Riders and Environmental Reform: How Appropriate?</i><p>
by Jonathan H. Adler and Scott H. Segal<p>
This Environmental Discussion Paper provides a brief overview of the origin,
extent and limitations of the appropriations authority and the recent use of
this appropriations authority by the House of Representatives to proscribe
certain actions by the Environmental Protection Agency.<p>
September 1995		$4.00<p>



<HR NOSHADE>
<A HREF="agpaper.html"><i>Federal Agricultural Policy: A Harvest of Environmental Abuse</i></A><p>
<i></i>by Jonathan Tolman<p>
This CEI monograph documents the significant environmental impacts caused by
federal farm subsidies, including more intensive use of  farm chemicals and the
destruction of the Florida Everglades.  Arguing that consumers, taxpayers, and
the environment would all be better off with a free market agricultural policy,
Mr. Tolman calls for an end to federal subsidies.<p>
August 1995         $5.00<p>


<HR NOSHADE>

<A HREF="title5.html"><i>Title V of the Clean Air Act:  Will America's Industrial Future be
Permitted?</i></A><p>
<i></i>by Ben Lieberman<p>
Title V of the 1990 Clean Air Act requires "major" industrial sources of air
pollution to incorporate all of the provisions of the Clean Air Act into a
single document, or "permit."  This will severely impact America's
competitiveness.  Mr. Lieberman argues in this paper that Congress must not
miss the chance to do away with Title V.  <p>
July 1995      $5.00<p>




<HR NOSHADE>

<A HREF="bank.html"><i>Who Needs an Eximbank?</i></A><p>
<i></i>by William H. Lash III<p>
Despite being the World's leading exporter, the U.S. spends over 3 billion tax
dollars annually on export promotion activities.  The most egregious member of
the federal government's confederacy of dunces is the Export-Import Bank of the
United States, the Eximbank.  Mr. Lash outlines all of the reasons why the
Eximbank should go out of  business.<p>
June 1995      $5.00<p>



<HR NOSHADE>


<a href="blm.html"><i>How and Why to Transfer BLM Lands to the States</i></A><p>
by Robert H. Nelson<p>
No area has greater potential for devolving federal responsibilities to the
states than Western public lands.  Transferring BLM lands to the states would
signify the end of the progressive in public land management.  In this booklet,
CEI Senior Fellow in Environmental Policy Dr. Nelson outlines why and how this
task should be accomplished.<p>
January 1996		$7.00<p>

<HR NOSHADE>


<A HREF="interior.html"><i>How to Dismantle the Interior Department</i></A><p>
by Robert H. Nelson<p>
In this proposal, Mr. Nelson looks at the Interior Department agency by agency
and suggests how the responsibilities of  each could be handed over to the
states, completely done away with, or put into private hands.  <p>
June 1995        $6.00<p>


<HR NOSHADE>

<A HREF="dsm.html"><i>The Economic Fallacies of Demand-Side Management</i></A><p>
by Matthew C. Hoffman<p>
Recent years have seen the emergence of Demand-Side Management (DSM), a new
approach to the electricity utility planning process.  Through DSM programs,
utilities endeavor to diminish ratepayer demand to avoid supply costs and
capacity expansion. In this monograph, former CEI Policy Analyst Matthew
Hoffman asserts that DSM is flawed both in theory and practice.<p>
June 1995        $5.00<p>



<HR NOSHADE>

<i>Managing the Marine Commons:  A Roundtable Discussion</i><p>
<i></i>This, the final monograph in the Progress and Planet Project series, is
a roundtable discussion that attempts to point policy makers toward the causes
of the current problems with our marine resources, and more importantly, where
the solutions can be found.  The participants were Kent Jeffreys of the
National Center for Policy Analysis, Dr. Lee Anderson of the University of
Delaware, Dr. Francis Christy of IMARIBA, and John Waugh of IUCN.<p>
May 1995       $6.00<p>



<HR NOSHADE>

<i>The Basel Convention</i><p>
<i></i>by Ray Evans<p>
The Basel Convention on Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their
Disposal is a treaty designed to regulate, but, as Mr. Evans argues, more
fundamentally to ultimately bring to an end, international trade in a very
large number of materials.  It is "a high point...in green
imperialism."  In this paper, Ray Evans outlines the reasons why the
United States Senate should decline to ratify the Basel Convention.<p>
May 1995       $4.00<p>



<HR NOSHADE>

<i>The World Bank's Trail of Sorrows</i><p>
<i></i>by Paul Georgia<p>
The World Bank's stated objectives were the reconstruction of war-torn Europe
and the economic development of the less developed countries.  Instead, the
World Bank has been the source of human rights abuses, environmental disaster,
and economic stagnation.  In this paper, Mr. Georgia argues that for these
reasons, the United States should no longer fund the World Bank.<p>
April 1995          $4.00<p>




<HR NOSHADE>

<A HREF="tru7.html"><i>Conserving Biodiversity:  Resources for our Future</i></A><p>
by Stephen R. Edwards<p>
In this paper, part of CEI's Progress and the Planet project, Dr. Edwards
argues that governments and conservation groups need to begin promoting the
harvesting and sustainable use of wildlife by rural peoples living in
developing countries, rather than treating those people as if they are
criminals.  Sustainable use is sustainable development -- they are one and the same.<p>
February 1995       $6.00<p>




<HR NOSHADE>

<A HREF="tru4.html"><i>The Coming Age of Abundance:  The Declining Scarcity of Natural
Resources</i></A><p>
by Stephen Moore<p>
Part of the CEI's Progress and the Planet Project, this paper discusses the
possibility that the twenty-first century may be the first era in the history
of humanity that natural resource scarcity ceases to act as a significant
constraint on economic growth. Moore asserts that, based on measurable trends
of the past century, humanity will soon be entering an age of increasing and
unprecedented natural resource abundance.<p>
February 1995       $6.00<p>



<HR NOSHADE>

<A HREF="tru6.html"><i>The World's Forests: Conflicting Signals</i></A><p>
by Roger A. Sedjo<p>
In this paper, part of CEI&#146;s Progress and the Planet project, Roger Sedjo
discusses the major causes for deforestation.  He debunks the myth that
commercial logging is a major cause of deforestation, arguing instead that
agriculture has been, and continues to be, the main cause.<p>
January 1995        $6.00<p>




<HR NOSHADE>

<i>CEI's Property Rights Reader</i><p>
edited by Jonathan Adler<p>
In the past year, property rights issues have become a major concern for many
citizens in the U.S. This reader is a compilation of CEI's writings on
property rights.  It discusses the role of the ESA and wetlands regulations in
depriving citizens of the right to own and/or use their property.  Several of
the articles included also discuss the debate over private vs. public land
management.  <p>
January 1995        $6.00<p>



<HR NOSHADE>
<i>Elephants and Ivory: Lessons from the Trade Ban</i><p>
by Ike C. Sugg and Urs P. Kreuter<p>
In this book, published by the IEA Environment Unit, the African Elephant is used to illustrate the limitations of preservation, the necessity  of
conservation, and the fundamental schism between the two.  This particular
pachyderm represents a paradigm for the future of wildlife conservation.<p>
1994			$10.00<p>



<HR NOSHADE>

<A HREF="trade.html"><i>The Greening of Trade Policy:  &#147;Sustainable Development&#148; and
Global Trade</i></A><p>
by James M. Sheehan<p>
Though non-tariff barriers to trade are proliferating, world trade continues
its expansion.  Yet a new rationale for protectionism is emerging which argues
for the restriction of trade as a means of preserving and protecting the
environment. CEI policy analyst Jim Sheehan delves into this form of
"green" protectionism which demands that high environmental standards
be linked to trade.  This monograph discusses the history and implications of
GATT, NAFTA, CITES, and the Basel Convention.<p>
November 1994         $5.00<p>




<HR NOSHADE>
<A HREF="tru3.html"><i>Global Warming: Messy Models, Decent Data, Pointless Policy</i></A><p>
by Dr. Robert C. Balling, Jr.<p>
As part of CEI's Progress and the Planet project, Balling tackles the
apocalyptic vision of the greenhouse effect.  Sound scientific evidence argues
against the existence of a greenhouse crisis, against the notion that realistic
policies could achieve any meaningful climatic impact, and against the claim
that we must act now in order to avert disaster.<p>
November  1994    $6.00<p>



<HR NOSHADE>
<i>Gaining More Ground:  An Analysis of Wetland Trends in the United
States</i><p>

Far more wetlands are being created each year than are being converted for
other uses.  Nevertheless, the federal government's persecution of hapless
landowners continues.  This discussion paper demonstrates that such draconian
measures are unnecessary to protect America's wetlands.<p>

<i>Evaluating the Employee Commute Option (ECO):   Can ECO Make Economic
Sense?</i><p>
by Jonathan Adler<p>
One of the more burdensome and least cost-effective provisions of the 1990
Clean Air Act requires employers in the nation's smoggiest cities to shoehorn
their employees into carpools and onto mass transit.  This policy makes little
sense, even from an environmental stand point.  This program is symbolic of the
failings of America's "one-size fits nobody" approach to environmental

"Deregulation <I>can</I> happen.  If the proper constellation of economic, political, and moral forces are assembled, statist institutions can be rolled back in favor of free markets.... America's flirtation with
deregulation, while on hold, did not end in the 1970s.  Deregulation can,
and will, happen again."

"The central planning belief that bureaucrats -- operating outside the
information flows of the market and immune from its painful lessons -- would better allocate society's scarce capital than entrepreneurs is no longer in favor.  The wreckage of past regulatory mishaps is leading many to recognize that over-regulation entails risks that will often exceed those of under-regulation.  History-induced modesty may yet prevail over the 'fatal conceit' of the political controllers."

"For too long, the standard of government has been, 'Well, is it a nice
thing to do?' Or, 'Will it make the world a better place?'  This is the
wrong way to evaluate government programs. The question one should really
ask is whether we absolutely need government to perform a particular
function -- and secondarily, whether the <B>federal</B> government is the only level of government capable of completing the task.  By asking ourselves these questions, we will realize that America could do with far less government."

"Free market ideas have swept across the world in the past decade, improving both the equity and efficiency of the world economy.  The virtues of the free enterprise system and the individual liberties upon which it rests are widely recognized as never before in human history.  Tragically, current environmental policies threaten a return to the errors of centrally-planned societies."

"The environmental vision that CEI advocates is one that empowers individuals and communities, not government bureaucrats.

"At the dawn of the information age, it is time to replace a generation of
environmental laws written in the midst of the industrial era -- a time
before personal computers, fiber optics, and the Internet, a time when wage
and price controls were considered sound economic policy, and a time when
relatively little was known about the human impact on the world around us.
In short, there needs to be a revolution in environmental policy -- a
revolution at least as dramatic and sweeping as that which has transformed
the rest of society."

"Environmental concerns both unite and divide the American people. Every
American supports the goals of clean air, clean water, and the conservation
of natural resources. This does not mean, however, that everyone supports
today's environmental policies. Indeed, the past few years have seen a
rapid growth in opposition to the form and cost of existing federal
environmental laws -- opposition that fueled efforts to reform environmental laws in the 104th Congress, and still demands significant change today."

"It is time to launch the second wave of environmentalism. Environmental
values will survive only with the same protections now afforded to economic
resources. We cannot deny the existence of the house of humanity. Our goal instead must be to integrate the house of humanity with the house of
nature."

"In seeking to ensure the well-being of our planet, we should consider the
statement by Winston Churchill about the English cathedral: 'First we shape
our institutions; and then they shape us!'  That comment is even more
applicable in considering the rich array of legal and political institutions that determine the treatment of natural and environmental resources.  Our challenge is to design institutions suitable for humanity as it is -- not as we would have it be."

"Consider that no one is responsible for preserving pet
biodiversity... There is no endangered pet act.  Were it not so silly, this
might seem surprising, since, after all, far more people care about these
species than those 'protected' by the Endangered Species Act.  The reason,
of course, is that fears of this sort seem fanciful. No one worries about
the extinction of pets because it is widely recognized that as a specific
species declines, it becomes scarce and thus more eagerly sought after.
Humans seek, in part, to differentiate themselves by their pets, and this
creates a mechanism whereby scarcity becomes its own redress."

"Private ownership avoids the tragedy of the commons rather easily.  In a communally owned forest, for instance, the incentive is to cut down as many trees as possible as quickly as possible.  But a person who owns property can exclude others from using it.  He can make rational decisions not just for his own but for others' benefit.  He can consider the future.  If trees are becoming scarce, he is motivated to protect his own trees because they will become more valuable."

"Cost-benefit analysis is really nothing more than the common sense
requirement that an agency think like people think. Imposing a regulation
is like making a major purchase. Consider a family buying a new car. They
know they'd be somewhat safer in a Mercedes than in a Chevette.  Does this
mean they're putting price tags on their lives and those of their children?
No, it means they have better things to do with their money than buy a
Mercedes -- like save for their children's education, purchase a house in a
safer neighborhood, or invest for their future."

"It requires a tremendous leap of faith to assume that government generated
science will be worthwhile and objective. Government dollars have been
poured into acid rain, dioxin and global warming research, producing
numerous flawed computer models and scary 'what if...' scenarios that
have little relevance to policy, but generate publicity to advance a
political -- not scientific -- agenda."

"The 'public interest' rationale for government must be refuted if reform is to succeed.  If most or even many Americans believe that an agency's
policies promote the public good, they will tend to support them.  Yet,
demonstrations that such 'public interest' rationales are fig leaves
shielding special interest privileges may well attract liberal support for
reform.  Recall that transportation deregulation was championed by Senator
Ted Kennedy, among others."

"When Reagan was elected in 1982, I and others urged that the incoming
Administration take environmental policies seriously. They did not.
Republicans elected not to block the Superfund bill advanced in the lame
duck session preceding Reagan's innaugural.  The insufferable law was
passed, and this vastly complicated the task of reforming other
environmental programs.  James Watt and Anne Gorsuch were appointed to head
Interior and EPA respectively.  The Green response was to launch a massive
fund-raising effort that facilitated the rapid growth of the environmental
establishment throughout the 1980's.  Secretary Watt could well have been
the Finance Chairman of the Sierra Club.  In this climate, little was done
to reform environmental policy -- and from there, thing only got worse."

"After harvest, the first act of a wise farmer is to set aside enough seed
corn to ensure next year's crops.  Successful American entrepreneurs might
consider setting aside sufficient reserves to ensure the competitive
conditions that have fostered their success.  As Schumpeter warned years
ago, a capitalist society must be accepted as legitimate; a continuous
educational effort dedicated to that end is therefore required....
	
<P>"Corporations cannot win this battle alone.  In today's world, anyone having an obvious economic stake in a policy area is seen as suspect.  Drug
companies have little standing in any dispute with the Food and Drug
Administration; oil and chemical company research is rejected when questions of human health arise; automobile companies are seen as profiting from killing off their customers.  If capitalism is to be effectively marketed, I believe, market-oriented businessmen must develop creative new arrangements with their ideological friends in the free market community.  Just as a firm seeks third-party endorsement to market its products, it will need such independent supporters to advance its policy interests.  As in other situations, allies will be vital in the war for economic freedom."

"Individuals have the right to use their property as they wish.  Liberty is a neglected aspect of antitrust discussion.  Why should a businessman not be free to restrain his own trade if he wishes, alone or in combination with others?  The activities prohibited under antitrust laws are invariable
peaceable activities -- whatever their merit under an efficiency standard -- and thus should be allowed in a free society.... [I]n general, the Chicago School's case for antitrust policy -- and its opposition to price fixing in particular rests solely on economic efficiency, as if rights had nothing to do with the matter -- as if business had no right in principle to dispose of its property as it sees fit, but only a conditional freedom so long as it helps maximize some social utility function.  That is to say, no business is entitled to its property if that property can be redeployed so as to expand output.  With 'conservative,' 'pro-business' economists taking this view, who needs social democrats?"

<p><br><hr><p><br>

"In America, religious as well as a wide range of other non-economic values
are honored and respected but not politically supported.  We each individually determine our own religious values and decide for ourselves what level of support we wish to provide.  In America, the cathedrals of God are built on private property and are financed privately under America's traditional concept of separation of Church and State.
	
<P>"There is no reason why those who believe in the intrinsic or even sacred value of nature cannot advance their beliefs in this manner as well.  After all, environmental groups now spend hundreds of millions annually advancing their values politically.  Were such funds invested in the private sphere, much private conservation would be possible."


<p><br><hr><p><br>


"Too often conservatives have focused only on one threat at a time --
national defense, economic deregulation, constitutional restraints on
spending -- while statist forces have found other routes to their goals.  As one statist rationale has been destroyed, they've quickly advanced another. American statists were very creative, inventing the modern regulatory state which retains the appearance of 'private' enterprise while destroying the reality.  Outright government ownership would be most honest, after all. Government agencies -- say the Postal Service -- are held somewhat responsible for their performance, while regulatory agencies exercise vast power but evade such accountability.  America has moved steadily down the road toward even greater regulatory controls.  The gains of economic deregulation were real but they have been more than offset by the losses associated with social, health and environmental regulations.  Such regulatory programs entail vague goals, universal scope, and massive
deregulations of authority to bureaucrats."

"Think about it!  There is not a medicine in your bathroom cabinet that does not carry some risk that is not deadly at some dosage.  But medicines cure disease.  Many of the cleaning supplies beneath your sink are 'toxic' if ingested; yet they make possible a cleaner home.  The world is made safer by dangerous products and processes that are less dangerous than the products and processes they replace."

"Here we are, the safest, healthiest, longest-living people in history, and we have become a society of paranoids, obsessed with risk, fearful of the water we drink, the food we eat, the air we breathe, ozone holes exposing us to mysterious rays from space, radon seeping up from the earth into our showers.

siding and insulation, chlorinated compounds in our drinking water, alar on our apples, sick buildings, and unsafe foods -- sometimes, it seems as if the greens believe that the only safe people are the homeless and the starving."

"Disillusionment with environmentalism reflects in part the success of such
groups at gaining power.  Power tends to corrupt, and the environmental
movement demonstrates that fact wonderfully.  Many environmental leaders have become more concerned with defending the clean air act than clean air, with retaining power than reducing pollution.  The result is that our greens no longer enjoy the saintly status of planet guardians."

"Too often business finds itself highlighting current 
waste generation levels, then discussing how much better it is doing, and how
much better it intends to do tomorrow.  Let me suggest that there are dangers
in this approach.  Such approaches implicitly accept the view that firms are
engaged in the business of producing wastes, of harming the Earth.  Business
sometimes seems to have adopted a wife beating defense; yes, we beat our wives
but we've cut back considerably over the last decade and our plans call
for almost totally eliminating this activity by the year 2000.  Then they step
back expecting applause."

"I would describe CEI as a kind of 'battered business bureau,' a

"Smoking is a serious risk factor, causing over 500,000 lung cancer deaths per
year in the USA.  Driving in the US is also risky; about 50,000 people die in
highway-related incidents per year.  Few people are acquainted with the risk of
shark attacks in the US -- perhaps one or two per year. Yet, not too many years
ago, if one were to stand on a dune on a beach in America and cry 'Shark!
Shark!', almost everyone would rush from the water, some would light up a
cigarette, and most would soon drive home!  This illustrates well the all too
human tendency to rate sensational risks more highly than the more prosaic
risks that actually do us in."

"You (attendees at the ICME June 15, 1995 conference) care about the environment but you also think.  A rare combination in the emotional and ideological climate that has defined environmental policy over the last several decades. Your challenge is to reconcile the passions which motivate many within the environmental movement with the intelligence that alone offers the only hope of resolving environmental problems."

<p><br><hr><p><br>

"Modern man is rapidly moving away from materialism itself as a basis for civilization.  We use less and less material to do more and more -- a handful of plentiful sand to transmit more messages via fiber optics than were once carried by tons of scarce copper.  As we have dug deeper, we have replenished the void with the one truly non-depletable, ultimately renewable resource -- the fruits of our intellect, science and technology.  Knowledge is the one resource that is not consumed by use."

<b>Ecological Central Planning</b>
<p>
"Environmental policy today is pursued exactly as planned economies seek to
produce wheat.  A political agency is assigned the task.  It develops detailed
plans,  issues, directives, and the citizens comply.  That process will produce
some wheat just as environmental regulations produce some gains.  However,
neither system enlists the enthusiasm and the creative genius of the citizenry,
and neither leads to prosperity."  ("The Market and Nature," p. 352)
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Endangered Industries</b>
<p>
"Consider the experience of the petroleum industry.  That industry willingly
paid very dearly to obtain leasing rights to explore and develop oil in
off-shore regions.  Yet, the oil industry was soon evicted.  The off-shore bans
were soon followed by bans on exploration in Alaska and throughout the nation.
The domestic oil exploration industry has been devastated -- the oil industry has
lost some 500,000 jobs over the last decade, perhaps half due to such policies.
Using the economic rhetoric of grazing fees and royalties, Babbitt and company
aim at eliminating economic activities from the Western lands." (Despairing
Optimist, 1 September 1993, p. 4)
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Ecological Adoption</b>
<p>
"Current American law...prohibits ownership of endangered species.  This is the
environmental equivalent of prohibiting the adoption of orphaned and abandoned
children." ("Conclusion:  Environmental Policy at the Crossroads," p.
192)
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Diversity, Human and Biological</b>
<p>
"Even if it could be shown that a flood of biblical proportions was likely, we
should avoid building a huge state 'ark' to shelter politically
preferred environmental amenities.  Instead, America should become a land of
millions of small arks, each tended by individuals or voluntary organizations
and thus better able to preserve and protect the natural world.
<p>
For public agencies to deal with the full range of ecological niches and
changing circumstances found in nature, constant fine-tuning of the
bureaucratic mechanism is needed, yet bureaucracies are notoriously difficult
to fine tune.  In contrast, free markets are naturally self-correcting and
every transaction is an act of fine tuning." ("A Free Market Environmental
Vision" p. 396)
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Conservatives</b>
<p>
"Conservatives in general remain ambivalent about politics.  Too often, they
view political activities in the same way that the Victorians regarded sex-a
messy necessity that should not be openly discussed and certainly should not be
enjoyed.  This genteel view of politics handicaps its practitioners in the tug
of war over government policy.  If you don't like politics, you probably
aren't going to be very good at it." ("Learning the Washington
Game," p. 41)
<p><br><hr><p><br>

<b>Richer Is Safer</b>
<p>
"The United States has storms.  Bangladesh has storms.  In the United States,
no one dies.  In Bangladesh, many thousands of people die.  It is not because
nature is different in those two environments, it is because the U.S. has a
freer society and therefore has developed more ability to absorb whatever cards
nature deals to us.  We should free the world, not regulate it into oblivion."
("Balance Problem," <i>Rocky Mountain News</i>, 16 August 1992)
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Socialism, American Style</b>
<p>
"Perhaps I should have stayed in France -- at least there socialism is honestly
labeled.  Tom Miller recently completed the <i>1992 Competitive Enterprise
Index</i> (enclosed in the last Despairing Optimist letter) and found that
Representative Bernie Sanders, the only formal socialist in the U.S. House and
Senate, scored higher on free market votes than some 160 of his fellow members
of Congress.  All this should remind us that America has no need for a formal
socialist party -- our Democrats and Republicans do quite well." (Despairing
Optimist, 1 November 1993, p. 1)
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Baptists and Bootleggers</b>
<p>
"Businesses have found the environmental laws useful devices to restrict
competition.  The laws make it far harder to build a new plant, introduce a new
product, or even use an old product in a new way.  Such competitive innovations
are inhibited by environmental laws:  the new, the novel must demonstrate its
virtue; the old, the familiar is accepted, warts and all." ("What
Environmental Policy?," David Boaz (Ed.), <i>Asssessing the Reagan
Years</i>, Cato Institute, 1988, p. 334)<p>
<p><br><hr><p><br>


<b>Environmental Protection Agency</b>
<p>
"In fact, the EPA has suppressed information suggesting that environmental
problems pose less of a threat than previously thought.  Examples of this are
numerous:  Delaying release of urban air pollution statistics (illustrating
dramatic improvements) until after passage of the Clean Air Act; blocking the
release of the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Project which suggested
minimal harm from acid rain; refusing to clarify the risks from dioxin (the
"carcinogen" justifying many of EPA's control programs).
Promoting irrational fears through disinformation, after all, is in the
EPA's interest -- it is the surest way to increase its budget.  An EPA
that reassured the American people, that sought to alleviate irrational fears
might well face major cutbacks." ("Europe, Energy and the Environment and
the Case against Carbon Taxes," speech, 27 January 1992, p. 4)
<p><br><hr><p><br>

"The greens endorse a kind of romantic communalism eco-socialism in which
'this land is your land, this land is my land.' But, of course,
these people are hopelessly confused.  Haven't they heard of a title search?
To turn the world into a political commons is to ensure the destruction of all
values economic as well as ecological."
<p><br><hr><p><br>


"The greatest danger of all is <i>stagnation</i>   the slowing down, the
stopping, of new products and new technologies.  We should -- and we do -- 
consider the risks of innovation, of economic growth and technological change.
But we also should consider the risks of economic and technological stagnation.
Our challenge as a society is to balance the risks of change against the risks
of stasis."
<p><br><hr><p><br>

<b>Diversity, Human and Biological</b>
<p>
"It's hard for government to keep its mind on even one or two things, yet
by politicizing environmental policy governments are charged with preserving
bio-diversity, and there are hundreds of thousands of plants and animals out
there worthy of preservation.  That task is going to be very difficult if we
limit it to 150 governments worldwide.  In contrast, 5 billion people acting as
individual owners might well find it possible to protect a much broader array
of species.  We need a diversity of ideas if we are going to preserve a
diversity of species, and governments give us very little of the former."
("Protecting the Environment -- Market Alternatives to the Bureaucratic
State," p. 399)
<p><br><hr><p><br>

<b>Chemophobia</b>
<p>
"When I was a kid, people were convinced that evil forces were adding poisonous
substances to the water supply --  and people still believe that.  But, in
those days, the villains were the Communists, the substance was fluorine, and
the charges were brought by the John Birch Society.  Today, those same fears
exist, but the villains are American business, the substances are a vast array
of 'toxic' chemicals and the charges are brought by the Greenies.
The major difference, however, is that when I was a kid, few believed the
Birchers, but today, the greenie charges are treated as gospel by even our Vice
President." (Despairing Optimist, 24 March 1994, p. 4)

In its closing days, the 105th Congress demonstrated that the "park barrel" is alive and well, with the passage of a pork-laden parks bill.  The legislative monstrosity contained over 100 separate provisions and authorized several land purchases and swaps.  To the dismay of property rights activists, the bill also included authorization for several new heritage areas, which will cost over $100 million and have the potential to metastasize into yet another threat to private property.  These provisions were advocated by several members that otherwise have property-friendly voting records, including Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) and Ben Nighthorse Campbell (R-CO), and Rep. James Hansen (R-UT). 

<p><br><hr><p><br>

"The most important aspect of the Kassenbaum-Kennedy health insurance bill that Congress has finally passed and the president signed last month was that the legislation took the federal government deeper into the regulation of private health insurance than ever before. The question only occasionally asked at the time was whether it would prove the exception or be the beginning of much more. The answer hasn't been long in coming.
<P>"An agreement was announced yesterday between the two parties and two houses to take two further regulatory steps. One would require insurance policies to pay for hospital stays of at least 48 hours for mothers giving normal birth. The other would require a rough parity in the treatment of mental health and other health services, in a policy that covered both."
<P ALIGN=RIGHT>--<I>Washington Post</I> editorial, 9/20/96

<p><br><hr><p><br>

<H2>Sellout Number 1</H2>

<P>Ignoring the current consensus on the health risks (or lack thereof) from pesticides, Congress passed a new pesticide regulation bill just before the
August recess.  Rushed through both the House and Senate in just one week by Reps. Thomas J. Bliley (R-VA) and Henry Waxman (D-CA), the new law will make it more difficult for pesticides to be registered and used.  The regulatory
noose will tighten even though the National Academy of Sciences say
consumers having nothing to fear from pesticide residues.  Although the law
eliminates the Delaney clause, it imposes a new "no harm" standard on all
residues.  Chances are the new law will create more problems for pesticide
manufacturers, food processors and farmers than it solved.

<H2>Sellout Number 2</H2>

<P>On the eve of the August recess Congress re-authorized the 1974 Safe
Drinking Water Act.  While the improved version gives more authority to the
States, it exempts the most egregious drinking water regulation that the EPA has ever contemplated from cost-benefit tests, the Disinfection By-Products
(DBP) rule.  By the Environmental Protection Agency's own estimate, the DBP
rule would double the current cost of compliance.  As drafted by the EPA,
the rule will enable the EPA to clamp down on local authorities as never
before.  In other words, the DBP rule might take away everything good the
new reform package provided.

<p><br><hr><p><br>

In a continuing effort to preserve the protected market of insurance agents
and companies, House Rules Committee Chairman Gerald Solomon (R-NY) sought
to prevent the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates
federally chartered banks, from granting banks authorization to offer new
financial products, including insurance.  <I>Congressional Quarterly</I> (7/20/96) reported that the comptroller "has been liberally interpreting existing law to give banks the ability to sell insurance through small-town branches... instead of through separately capitalized and managed affiliates." Solomon tried to surprise bank lobbyists and their House supporters with an unannounced amendment that would cut off funding for the regulator's office if it issued such rules, but was rebuffed by opponents and by members who thought his strategy "procedurally questionable"  --  and that is the kindest thing one could say about Solomon's proposal.

When the International Whaling Commission (IWC) convened in Aberdeen,
Scotland last month, the United States delegation strongly supported a
request by the Makah Indians to take five Gray whales. The Makah, a small
tribe from Washington state, were following a precedent well established by
the IWC, but midway through the meeting, the House Resources Committee
passed a unanimous resolution opposing the Makah request. That contributed
to an about face by the US delegation, which pulled its support during the
meeting. Denying the Makah request is shameful. Unlike Congress, the Makah
long ago recognized the important link between ownership and stewardship and have sensibly conserved their resources for centuries.

In recent interviews, House Speaker Newt Gingrich has challenged Majority
Leader Bob Dole's support for much needed property rights legislation and
belittled the experiences of those upon whom the weight of environmental
regulations sits.  In an interview with Greenwire, Gingrich said that Rep.
Richard Pombo (R-CA) is "open to growth" because he "has really tried to
bridge the world of the rural Westerner to the world of the scientist who
deals with this."  Were he not loyal to the Speaker, Pombo, who has led the
push for Endangered Species Act reform, might have suggested that it is the
"rural Westerner" whose land is regulated and livelihood is destroyed who
really "deals with" America's environmental laws.

Trying to beat the Democrats at their own game, a group of twenty-one House
Republicans, led by Christopher Shays (R-CT), propose raising the minimum wage by one dollar an hour after Democrats resurrect a proposal to increase the minimum by 90 cents.  If passed, the proposal would deny job oppportunities to hundreds of thousands seeking to enter the labor force, in the name of helping working Americans.  There is already one political party in the nation's Capitol subservient to big labor; America does not need another.

<p><br><hr><p><br>


One of the first bills passed by the 104th Congress was the
Congressional Accountability Act which applied federal labor laws to Congress. For the first time, Congressmen had to be concerned
about overtime pay and workplace safety (as defined by OSHA).  Although the law has yet to be fully implemented, some in Congress already are seeking to soften the law's impact by creating special exemptions, placing gag orders on complaints lodged against Members, and giving Congressional offices compliance advice not available to the private sector.

<p><br><hr><p><br>

Concerned about the rise of publishing baron Malcolm  "Steve"  Forbes, GOP presidential candidates have adopted the class-warfare rhetoric and economic populism of liberal Democrats.  Phil Gramm calls Forbes  "Richie Rich" and Pat Buchanan disparages flat tax proposals drafted by the "boys at the yacht basin." One is tempted to ask when Richard Gephardt and David Bonior joined the Republican party. Economic success used to be the American dream. Now Republican candidates want to make it a political liability.

<p><br><hr><p><br>

While Republicans scramble to pass a telecommunications reform bill, compromise after compromise has been made.  As the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> reported (12/27/95), Congressional leaders opted  to delay deregulation of 'expanded basic' cable... for another three years. They dropped a provision that would have allowed some foreign ownership of American broadcast outlets. They approved onerous language limiting 'media concentration' that will make it much harder for companies to collaborate in the data stream that will emerge at the convergence of the computer, telephone and cable businesses. And... they gave the Justice Department a bigger say in determining when the Bells can enter long distance markets    a move certain to delay full-scale competition between the Bells and AT&T, MCI, et al.  In fact, so many compromises have been made that Vice President Al Gore proclaimed "There's not a single provision of the bill we’re not happy about. This is a terrific bill, a centrist bill for the 21st century." It’s enough to give one the shivers.

<CENTER>
<H1>Rethinking Insurance Regulation</H1>
by D. Joseph Olson, Michigan state insurance commissioner
<P>
<I>On March 8, 1996, CEI held a conference on "Rethinking
Insurance Regulation." This article is adapted from the keynote speech.</i>
</CENTER>



<P>
<BR>
There is a common notion that insurance is somehow an exception to the
ordinary laws of economics.  Even among persons who would vehemently
assert that they support free markets, there is a tendency to make an exception with respect to insurance and to support government "solutions" to "problems" in the insurance market. <p>
	Since becoming Michigan's commissioner, I have done a lot of thinking
about insurance regulation.  Fortunately, I have not "grown" during
that process.  That is, I have not moved away from my long-standing commitment
to markets and toward a belief that "experts" can manage a better
outcome for both consumers and suppliers.<p>
	Instead, my thinking has been about the obstacles which confront a new
commissioner who has a free market orientation and who wants to challenge the
status quo approach to insurance regulation.  I have also done some thinking
about those who profess support for less regulation of insurance, thinking
which together with experience has increased my skepticism about the sincerity
of some of those supporters.  And perhaps most important, I have thought a lot
about what could be done to overcome those obstacles and about how to derive
some benefits even from fair-weather friends of the market.<p>
	What situation confronts a new insurance regulator in this country?  First is
the entrenched position of what might be called the regulatory community.  Many
of the employees of the insurance departments in the fifty states, as well as
most of the employees of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC), have held office for years, and they talk to each other.<p>
	It should surprise no one that the unstated consensus  among this group is
that extensive regulation of insurance is just, proper, and necessary.  I say
this not from the point of view of the cynic -- "After all, their jobs
depend upon regulation, so why wouldn't they be in favor?"  My
experience convinces me that their motivations are more complex and their
commitment to regulation is sincere.<p>

	Even though there may be some people who are supportive of less regulation and
who will assist in analysis and lobbying, you can be reasonably certain that a
large proportion of any insurance department staff will resist the elimination
or reduction of what they regard as necessary protection for consumers.  And
these people are the very ones upon whom the commissioner must rely to
discharge his statutory duties to enforce insurance laws as currently written.
This dependent relationship is likely to lead to a gradualist approach to
deregulation, with a commissioner's proposals often being a compromise
even before being sent to the legislature.  The final obstacle within this
regulatory environment is the press of day-to-day business.  Collectively,
commissioners face similar problems in their relationship with the NAIC staff.
<p>
The composition of the model laws and regulations which flow from the NAIC
should therefore not be surprising.  There are few, if any, proposals to reduce
the involvement of regulators in scrutinizing the rates and policy forms used
by insurers.  I cannot recall many proposals to reduce barriers to entry to
firms wishing to enter new markets.  <p>
	Typical justifications for regulation seem to be: control of monopoly power,
control of economic rents or "excessive profits," compensating for
externalities, inadequate information and excessive competition.  Among these
rationales, the only one which comes close to justifying insurance regulation,
at least with respect to most modern markets, is that of inadequate
information.<p>
	For a competitive market to function well, buyers must have sufficient
information to compare competing products.  In a well-functioning market, there
should be as much information available as consumers are willing to pay for in
order to lower the cost or improve the quality of their choices.  In some
markets the incentives to produce and disseminate information might  not be
sufficient, perhaps because those in the best position to produce it may not do
so or fear that disseminating it may not benefit them.  Or one of the parties
to the transaction may seek deliberately to mislead the other by conveying
false or incomplete information.<p>
	However, most insurance regulation seems to focus not on increased disclosure
and information, but rather on deciding in advance what choices consumers will
be allowed to make "in their own best interest," regardless of how
much information they have.  This approach suggests that the underlying reason
for much insurance regulation, in spite of the information rationale, is pure
paternalism.  Many adherents of the current regulatory approach seem to assume
that, even if consumers are provided with full information about their various
choices, they are incapable of dealing with that information and making the
"right" decision.<p>
	The natural result of such a regulatory community is an environment in which
the bias is toward regulation of markets, which are seen as so rife with
"failure" that government must intervene in most areas.  With these
obstacles, it is a wonder that any commissioner is ever successful in changing
anything -- except perhaps adopting more regulation.  Under these circumstances,
how can we possibly restore private markets?<p>
	Fortunately, that is not the primary responsibility of regulators, although
one might hope they would assist.  Those that do become involved need allies.
When one considers the amount of complaining by regulated entities about
excessive regulation, one might assume them to be logical allies.  To an
extent, they are.  I used to work for one, and we frequently took free market
positions which might not have been in our apparent short-term interest but
which we saw as valuable towards reaching our goal of a less regulated market.
My company consistently supported measures which would deregulate markets.
However, I must say that in my brief career as commissioner, I have observed a
resistance to deregulation on the part of many regulated entities.<p>
	Other possible allies include legislators dedicated to limited government and
free markets.  Unfortunately, I have found that many legislators who would
never support price controls in other areas, such as housing rents, do not
hesitate to vote in favor of price controls in the insurance field. There are,
of course, some legislators who are solidly in favor of free markets, but they
may not even be a majority of the Republicans in the state legislature.  <p>
	The free market regulator needs allies, as do similarly inclined legislators
and state government executives.  The need for such allies is the reason why I
have been so supportive of <A HREF="/errp.html">CEI's insurance reform project</A>.  The
intellectual support provided for market-oriented state regulators and
legislators from CEI is invaluable.  But most of the action remains at the
state level, and individual states have unique problems.  There exists in this
country an extensive network of state-based think tanks, all focusing upon
state-specific public policy issues and approaching them from a free market
point of view.  We need to develop cooperative relationships between such
state-based think tanks and CEI.  It seems a good fit.  CEI can use its
resources to look at broad economic themes in the area of insurance regulation,
and the state-based organizations can rely upon this body of work and fit it to
the specific local situations.<p>

	This research and analysis in the world of ideas is important because
politicians who impose regulations are followers, not leaders.  They respond to
the climate of opinion which dominates any particular era.  The single idea of
socialism which is most prevalent in those who think about insurance regulation
is the notion that, in light of scientific accomplishments in other fields,
surely society can be centrally planned and managed by a body of intelligent,
knowledgeable people.  Current ideas of regulation typically spring from the
belief that, in the words of Nobel laureate economist Friedrich Hayek,
"deliberate control of conscious organization is also in social affairs
always superior to the results of spontaneous processes which are not directed
by a human mind, or that any order based on a plan laid down beforehand must be
better than one formed by the balancing of opposing forces."  That
particular legacy of socialism must be discredited before we can achieve the
explicit goal of restoring private markets.<p>
	Ultimately, we can restore private markets in insurance and dispel the
prevailing myths about the institution only if we can win this war of ideas.
And there are massive resources arrayed against us, not only the government and
rent-seeking private forces I mentioned, but also academics and leftist think
tanks who view regulation more favorably than we.<P>

<P>
<BR>Sam Kazman is General Counsel of the <A HREF="/">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A>, a
free market advocacy organization headquartered in Washington, D.C.  CEI is
dedicated to advancing private solutions to regulatory issues, and to
promoting public awareness of the often hidden costs of government regulation.

<P>Mr. Kazman has been extensively involved in public interest litigation and policy analysis, especially in areas of safety regulation.  In 1992 he won a
federal appeals court ruling that the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration had illegally concealed the lethal effects of CAFE (the
federal auto fuel economy program) on highway safety.  This marked the first
judicial overturning of a CAFE standard in the program's history.  
His writings include "Deadly Overcaution:  FDA's Drug Approval Process"
(<I>Jrnl. of Regulation and Social Costs</I>, Sept. 1990), "Death By Regulation" (<I>Regulation Magazine</I>, Fall 1991), "Saying Yes To Drugs" (<I>Jrnl. of Regulation
and Social Costs</I>, June 1992), and "Purer Politics, Greasier Pigs and Other
Wonders of Campaign Reform" (<I>Regulation Magazine</I>, Summer 1992).  He has been a guest on such shows as The Larry King Show, Crossfire, McNeil-Lehrer and
Good Morning, America, and was a script consultant on CEI's recently
produced documentary, "Science Under Siege," an examination of politicized
science and toxic scare stories.

<P>Mr. Kazman directs CEI's <A HREF="/fmlp.html">"Death By Regulation" Program</A> and is currently
involved in such issues as FDA reform, risk regulation, and First
Amendment/commercial speech questions.

in political science from New York University.  He is a member of the State
Bar of Georgia.

</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>
Ike C. Sugg is the Fellow in Wildlife and Land-Use Policy at the <A HREF="/">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A>, a free market research and advocacy organization
headquartered in Washington, D.C.  CEI emphasizes the marketing and
implementation of classical liberal ideals and believes limited government
and competition best serve the public interest.

<P>At CEI, Mr. Sugg works on <A HREF="/topic.html#biodiversity">wildlife</A> and <A HREF="/topic.html#lands">land use issues</A>, focusing both on the failures of governmental programs and the successes of private conservation
efforts.  Through intensive research, writing and speaking, Mr. Sugg seeks
to heighten public awareness of how government abuses private property
owners and mismanages natural resources.  By showing how private property
rights and economic incentives can work for natural resource conservation,
rather than against it, his work is aimed at reforming failing public
policies (both here and abroad) and fostering greater appreciation for the
ethical and conservation values of human liberty.  

<P>Mr. Sugg has presented his views before Congress, the President's Council on Environmental Quality, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, National Public Radio, CNBC, C-SPAN and other fora.

<i>Public Lands and Private Rights:  The Failure of Scientific Management</i><p>

by Robert H. Nelson<p>

"Anyone who has struggled to make sense of the history of public lands
management in the American West will want to read this book.  It assembles a
marvelous argument for the decentralization of natural resource and land
management in the West.  Along the way, Nelson also untangles the brushpile of
law, policy, executive fiat, and political pandering that have punctuated the
public lands history of the West."

<i>Environmental Politics:  Public Costs, Private Rewards</i><p>

co-edited by <a href="fred.html">Fred Smith</A> and Michael Greve<p>

What really happens when environmentalist legislation is passed?  Who is hurt and who is helped?  How does our modern democratic process lead to the
systematic overthrow of good intentions in the service of narrow political
gain?  CEI's first book effort is a collection of essays whose topics range
from Superfund and ozone depletion to clean air and property rights.<p>

<i>Environmentalism at the Crossroads:  Green Activism in
America</i><p>

by <a href="adler.html">Jonathan H. Adler</A>

<p>An analysis and overview of environmental lobbying organizations, the policies they promote, and trends in American environmentalism, past, present and future.  Includes appendices providing background on environmental groups from Audubon to Zero Population Growth.


<P>"Environmentalism at the Crossroads" clearly documents how Washington environmental groups have become yet another special interest calling for more government in our everyday lives.  This book is a wake-up call to all those who beleive--as I once did--that environmentalists are in their corner." --<b>Ann G. Corcoran</b>,
		former lobbyist, National Audubon Society
		founding editor, Land Rights Letter

<P>	"Jonathan Adler's book makes a strong argument that the environmental movement has strayed from its roots--its early ideals and its natural allies.  The further it strays, the more it risks.  This is a message that some will not like, but it is important for all to hear and weigh." --from the preface by <b>John Stossel</b>,
		ABC "20/20" Correspondent

<P>"Jonathan Adler well articulates the choices America and the world face in protecting the environment. His book tracks the advocates for increasingly radical and coercive environmental laws that rely on bad science to produce expensive policy failures. Adler explains why successful conservation requires a market for choices by free people." --<b>Hon. Malcolm Wallop</b>, former Senator (R-WY)

<H1>Do Good, Be Profitable</H1>
by <A HREF="/staff/smith.html">Fred L. Smith</A>, June 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>The failure of socialism has forced its former adherents to seek new means
to achieve old goals.  One of the now popular variants is "corporate social
responsibility."  Capitalism, former socialists concede, has an important
role to play, but that role is limited because it omits important values,
such as, the "fairness" of the work place, the ecological ramifications of
business activities, the impact on children and minorities, the virtues of a stable workplace.  The claim is made that, if we wed capitalist efficiency with social justice, the world will be a better place.  Is this so?
   
<P>  Certainly capitalism has its negatives  --   what Schumpeter called its "creative destructive elements."  A large company goes bankrupt and plunges
the lives of thousands into chaos.  A product is badly designed or used in
ways not anticipated and disaster results.  A firm manages its residuals
carelessly, harming downstream or downwind neighbors.  Often, the cold
impersonality of the market threatens the warm communal values of
traditional society.  To the Robert Reichs of the world, capitalism makes us all bit players in a remake of Arthur Miller's tragedy, Death of a Salesman.

<P>"Wouldn't it be Loverly," if citizen-workers motivated by altruistic values
in socially responsible corporations joined together to eliminate poverty,
racism, genderism, pollution and bias from the world?  
   
<P>  Well, such an effort could leave us all a lot worse off.  The corporate
responsibility movement does not understand the essential demands of modern
society: the need for specialization and anonymous interactions.  Altruism
is too rare an attribute to form the basis of modern society  --  there are not enough Mother Theresas around to run society.  As Adam Smith noted, while
even a generous and long life may yield only a handful of close friends,
every day we peacefully engage a world of strangers via the market place.
Communalism cannot suffice to organize modern society  --  the reliance on
self-interest to organize these relationships is not the result of
mean-spiritedness, but of necessity.   
    
<P> A firm is well advised to concern itself with its shareholders and its
immediate corporate "family"  --  its employees and neighbors, its suppliers
and customers.  Those groups have a stake in ensuring that the firm prospers
over time.  However, to extend such relationships to the world  --  to make
every one a "stakeholder"  --  is to give a meddling power to people who have
no reason to learn anything about the value of the firm or to care anything
about its survival.  Modern society is possible only because we exclude most
people from most activities.  The institutions of the market  --  private
property, contracts, the corporation  --  are all exclusionary devices.  They
all create limited spheres of responsibility and power in which each of us
plays specialized roles to our mutual benefit.
   
<P>  A corporation is not intended to solve the world's problems. The corporate
form distinguishes one group, the "shareholders"  --  those who provide the
capital to the firm  --  from all others, in modern parlance, the
"stakeholders."  The firm hires individuals to manage the capital to benefit
the shareholders with, as noted above, due consideration to the longer term
responses of those economic interests relevant to the corporation.  Even the
shareholder interest is likely to be limited to the narrow question of
whether the firm is profitable.  Other diverse interests are expected to be
addressed by the shareholders from their earnings or the management from
their salaries.  To blur this shareholder/stakeholder distinction  --  to
endorse a form of "This firm is your firm, This firm is my firm"
collectivism  --  is to undermine the basis of modern society, to threaten our
future by returning to our tribal past.

<H3>Message From the President</H3>
<H1>Hoarding the Nation's Wealth</H1>
by <A HREF="/staff/smith.html">Fred L. Smith</A>, October 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>President Clinton's presidential order to drive man and his works from much of southern Utah makes political sense, but makes for very bad policy.
Unfortunately this blatant abuse of presidential power for political gain is in keeping with the history of federal land management. 
	
<P>The new Escalante National Monument straddles Kane and Garfield counties in Southern Utah.  These counties cover nearly 6 million acres with a total
population of less than ten thousand people.  The new monument encompasses
1.7 million acres, the center of which is known as the Kaiparowits Plateau,
a nearly treeless and waterless landscape of 500,000 acres.  Underneath this
barren desert are low sulfur coal deposits worth as much as $1 trillion.  
	
<P>Outside of coal mining there is no reason for anyone to go into the
Kaiparowits.  There are no roads.  Anyone attempting to hike into the area
would not get far due to the lack of water.  In addition, the scenery is far less dramatic than the nearby Capitol Reef, Bryce Canyon, and Zion National
Parks, which are far more accessible.
	
<P>In declaring the Kaiparowits Plateau part of a national monument Clinton
virtually ensured that the coal reserves will remain untouched.  Given its
geography and lack of water, its new designation will guarantee that the
Kaiparowits Plateau will benefit no one.
	
<P>Political management has always meant management on behalf of special
interests.  Under one presidency, economic interests may dominate while
under another ecological interests prevail.  Each side grabs what it can,
knowing that its power may dissipate with the next election.  The stability
essential for sustainable use becomes impossible.
	
<P>The evidence of this is plentiful.  America's public lands are in dismal
shape.  Yellowstone Park is so overrun with elk that other animals, such as
the beaver, have disappeared.  Grazing lands have lost productivity and are
threatened by erosion.  Other public lands also suffer from severe
mismanagement.  Bureaucrats are lousy land managers.
		
<P>Strangely, environmentalists maintain their faith in the political sector.
They frequently complain about uneconomical timber sales in our national
forests.  But subsidized output is the very core of any politicized system.
Only government, with access to the public's wealth, can sustain the
unprofitable harvest of trees over long periods of time.
		
<P>In contrast, consider resource development on private lands -- even those
controlled by environmental groups.  The Rainey Refuge in Louisiana owned by
the Audubon Society was located in the middle of an oil field.  They were
able to permit drilling, while also protecting their ecological priorities.
Private property encourages owners to consider all desires.   
	
<P>Political management creates another problem.  Property owners fear that
their holdings will be nationalized or otherwise restricted.  Domestic oil
exploration has nearly disappeared in the U.S.  And the decision to block
the New World mine in Montana as well as coal mining in Utah, makes it clear
that all mining activities are endangered.  
	
<P>The fear of sudden and unexpected loss ensures that owners will seek to
quickly liquidate their investments.  As a result business will approximate
the "rape, ruin and run" caricature perpetuated by market critics.  In the
Pacific Northwest, for example, efforts to ban logging of old growth forests
through the endangered species act has encouraged accelerated harvest in
privately owned forest lands.  Owners face a "use it or lose it" dilemma and
respond accordingly.
	
<P>Under Clinton, the joke of a few years ago -- had God not driven man from
the Garden of Eden, the Sierra Club would have -- has become a reality.  The
ecological apartheid view that we must segregate man from nature is foolish.
For a powerful political elite to enforce this eco-theocratic vision on
America is morally reprehensible.

<H1>Hurricanes and Other Horrors</H2>
<a href="/staff/smith.html">Fred L. Smith, Jr.</A>
</CENTER>
<BR>
<P>

When the answer is "Blizzards, heat waves, torrential rains, droughts,
hail, and hurricanes," the question must, of course, be "What
provides unequivocal evidence of imminent <a href="/topic.html#global">global warming</A>?"  Is there
<i>any</i> climatic condition that might lead modern day apocalyptics to
reconsider their Chicken Little views?  I'm afraid not.  Consider the
comments of Jessica Matthews in a recent <i>Washington Post </i>column,
"Is Global Warming the Problem?": "think of the blizzard of
'96 as a glimpse of a part of the likely greenhouse future."
Jessica's concerns were echoed in the <i>New York Times</i> ("Blame
Global Warming for the Blizzard"), <i>Newsweek</i> ("Blizzards,
Floods and Hurricanes: Blame Global Warming"), and throughout much of the
media.  To Jessica and her environmental cohort:  <i>"It don't matter
whether it burns or freezes, it all proves Al Gore's thesis!" </i> <p>
	The argument for blizzards being the consequence of global warming leaps from
the observation that a warmer world is a more energetic world (true) to the
presumption that it will therefore experience worse weather (not necessarily at
all).  Although this apocalyptic linkage has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> by
the doomsday crowd, it is simplistic and almost certainly wrong.  Increasing
the energy of a system does not necessarily imply more chaotic behavior --
as anyone who has ridden a bicycle knows well.  <p>
	More significantly, weather is, in part, a by-product of the temperature
differences between the polar and equatorial regions.  If the impact of global
warming were to make the poles colder and the equatorial regions hotter, then
we might indeed expect stormier weather.  However, the models upon which
Jessica's hyperventilations are based suggest exactly the opposite; it is
the polar regions that are expected to warm most significantly, the equatorial
regions little if at all.  As extreme cold is produced by arctic air from the
polar regions, global warming should produce less of a deep freeze, even though
precipitation and hurricanes may rise.<p>
		Indeed, the balance of evidence suggests a warmer world will be a cloudier
world, with most of the warming occurring at night, moderating nighttime lows.
Also, the increased cloudiness will be greatest in the summer, least in the
winter, further reducing temperature variations across the seasons.  In effect,
the most likely impact of warming -- should it occur -- would be a more
benign climate, not a more hostile one.  <p>
		Not that anyone should throw away their snow shovels yet, however.   The
evidence that mankind is having any significant impact on present climate
patterns remains speculative.  The latest round of fear mongering stemmed from
a British study that claimed 1995 was the warmest year on record before the
December data was in.  As it turns out, December was mighty frigid, and 1995
was an ordinary year.  According to the satellite data released a few weeks
after the hysteria, 1995 was the 8th warmest of the last 15 years -- yet
Jessica and the papers largely ignored it. <p>
	Why is this?  To the Jessicas of the world, global warming is like any
religious belief, unmovable by facts or logic.  They find Paradise in nature,
the Fall in Man's increased reliance on technology and economic growth.
Only global planners can protect life outside the Garden!  Evidence that the
earth is robust, that disaster is not close, weakens the appeal of these
coercive utopians' policy prescriptions.<p>
	So, while the skies of Planet Earth are likely to remain clear for some time,
we should all expect far more stormy political weather.  Environmentalism has
become the last refuge of scoundrels; the last area where statism retains any
popular appeal.  We'll see much stormier weather before the policy skies
finally clear.

<H3>Message From the President</H3>
<H1>Free Trade for All</H1>
by <A HREF="/fred.html">Fred L. Smith</A>, August 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>Massachusetts Governor William Weld, running in a tight Senate race against Senator John Kerry, recently came out in favor of a protectionist trade ban against Burma (aka Myanmar).  Weld argued that Myanmar was guilty of human rights and environmental crimes and clearly felt this position demonstrated his commitment to ethics over economics, as a way of opposing "Burma's tyrannical regime."  But was he right?  This question is important since the economic arguments for protectionism have been roundly discredited.  Trade sanctions, after all, hurt people  --  not nation states.  Without the moral legitimacy conveyed by the Governor Welds of the world, protectionism would wither away.  Thus the legitimacy of moral protectionism deserves careful scrutiny. 

<P>Certainly, trade restrictions justified on moral grounds are multiplying. On the right, the Helms-Burton law seeks to prevent foreign companies from dealing with Cuba.  On the left, efforts to "Green" GATT, to extend NAFTA-style environmental restraints to world trade, continue.  Indeed, in December in Singapore, the WTO will consider whether trade should be subordinated to a wide variety of environmental and labor policy objectives, whether trade agreements should be subject to vetoes by the Sierra Club, the AFL-CIO or other special interests.  Protectionist policies already benefit powerful domestic economic interests; this new moral element only strengthens the political power of anti-trade forces.

<P>Tragically, trade remains one of the least respected of all economic
activities.  Production involves work  --  "the sweat of the brow"  --  but trade is seen as just moving goods and services around.  The virtues of trade are unappreciated.  Yet only trade can harness the self-interest of strangers to create wealth around the world.  To restrict economic exchanges to those sharing one's values, is to endanger trade and thus  to threaten civilization. Still, trade remains vulnerable to political demagoguery, especially when
the trading partners are foreign.  Indeed, the very baseline norm of trade
policy, the "most favored nation" (MFN) status, is inherently protectionist.

<P>Under the MFN concept, trade is viewed as a privilege granted by one state to another, rather than as a basic freedom allowing the individuals of one
nation to engage in mutually beneficial exchanges with the citizens of another.

<P>Do trade bans really advance moral causes such as environmental protection or human rights?  Wouldn't opening economic doors better advance moral concerns?  On environmental grounds, the data shows that wealthier is
healthier and richer is cleaner  --  and trade advances both these results.
The human rights issue is perhaps less clear cut, but would the Soviet Union have collapsed as quickly had America restricted the flow of computers, copiers, and fax machines? 

<P>Trade allows the people of the world to experience the benefits of economic and individual liberty, and thus creates pressures for further
liberalization.  Trade does not ensure a free society, but it does encourage it.  To block trade is to block the first steps toward a better world. Moral protectionism may please domestic interest groups;  it will do little to help the oppressed of the world.

<H2>The Tragedy of the 
Commons Revisited:<BR>
Politics vs. Private Property</H2>
by Randy T. Simmons, <A HREF="/staff/smith.html">Fred L. Smith, Jr.</A>, and <A HREF="/staff/georgia.html">Paul Georgia</A>

<BR>
<H3>Executive Summary</H3>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>
One of the most powerful metaphors of the environmental problem is Garrett
Hardin’s 1968 article,  "The Tragedy of the Commons."  The tragedy metaphor
claims to show that many environmental problems are caused by a system of
open access to commonly owned resources.  Hardin summarized conventional
wisdom about common property as follows:  "Ruin is the destination toward
which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society which
believes in the freedom of the commons.  Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all."  Hardin’s article became one of the most cited environmental articles
ever published and his call for "mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon" is
the intellectual justification for nearly three decades of environmental
legislation in the United States.

<p> As that legislation developed, ideology and politics combined to select a
narrow set of tools for managing the environment, primarily prohibition and
command-and-control regulations.  But these policy tools do not address
underlying causes of environmental problems, ignore some fundamental lessons
of the "Tragedy of the Commons" and place impossible demands on the
political process.  

<P>To illustrate the management challenges faced by those who wish to avoid the
tragedy of the commons, we extend Hardin’s village metaphor by considering
the two different forms of social arrangements he suggested as possible
solutions to the problem; political management vs. private property.  In our
extension, political management requires that the village establish a
management body -- the Pasture Protection Agency (PPA) and it’s head the PPA
Administrator.  The PPA, of course, is directly analogous to our own
environmental protection and resource management agencies.  It is intended
to show the difficulties and shortcomings of political management.  

<P>The private property method divides the commons into plots, deeding a plot
to each family, and enforces these rights through fencing the plots and
branding the cows.  We also look at the common law as a powerful tool for
protecting privately owned resources from the tragedy of the commons.

<P>The pros and cons of each arrangement are evaluated for a series of
management issues, including enforcement, risk management, information
costs, cost-benefit calculus, site-specific management, flexibility,
incentives, innovation, time frames, priorities, and transaction costs.  Our
conclusion is that private management through clearly defined property
rights is superior to political management on every point.  We can improve
resource management greatly by relying more on property rights and market
forces and less on political management.

<H3>Message From the President</H3>
<H1>Unsustainable Policies</H1>
by <A HREF="/staff/smith.html">Fred L. Smith</A>, April 1996
</CENTER>

<P><BR>
In March the President’s Council on Sustainable Development (PCSD), made up of governmental, environmental and business leaders, presented to President Clinton its final report, Sustainable America.  Impressed by this document, the <I>New York Times</I> reported a truce between environmentalists and businessmen over environmental issues.  Apparently, both agree that the GOP freshman are too  radical  and that Congress should not roll back environmental regulation.  

<P>	Ever the font of pro-government conventional wisdom, the <I>Times</I> fails to realize that industry often finds government regulation desirable.  In fact, most lobbying efforts are designed to secure regulation which improves a firm’s or an industry’s competitive advantage over its rivals.  For example, the Archer Daniels Midland Company pressed hard for a rule in the <A HREF="topic.html#air">Clean Air Act</A> that would guarantee a market share for ethanol, despite the lack of clear environmental gains from such a rule.  The book <A HREF="/books.html#politics"><I>Environmental Politics: Public Costs, Private Rewards</I></A> exhibits several examples of such rent-seeking behavior.
<P>
	That said, the PCSD report serves two primary purposes.  First, it gives credence to a whole array of discredited and failed welfare state programs.  For example, the council calls for an  adequate  minimum wage, more federal job training, greater federal involvement in education, more foreign aid, an expansion of Medicaid, more funding of family planning services, greater federal involvement in agriculture, increased daycare programs, etc., all to ensure better environmental protection.
<P>
	Second, the report recommends new environmental programs which would further exacerbate the anti-competitive and anti-growth features of environmental laws.  Particularly objectionable is the recommendation for  extended product responsibility.   Under this system  manufacturers, suppliers, users, and disposers of products share responsibility for the environmental effects of products and waste streams.  
<P> 
	This proposal would lessen rather than expand responsibility.  In the market, the books are cleared at each stage of a product’s  life-cycle,  allowing each agent to consider the costs of his or her own actions.  Extending liability throughout the life-cycle would force each agent, when determining costs, to consider a whole range of possible costs imposed by others, as well as the associated probabilities.  The result would be a dramatic increase in uncertainty, blurring the lines of responsibility, rampant litigation, and a decrease in risk-taking by entrepreneurs.  Even though the PCSD claims to work toward  economic growth, environmental health, and social justice  many of its recommendations would destroy economic growth without advancing the other two goals.
<P>
	The PCSD has called for extensive use of the  Precautionary Principle.   It states that  Even in the face of scientific uncertainty, society should take reasonable actions to avert risks where the potential harm to human health or the environment is thought to be serious or irreparable.   Many of the most notorious environmental scares --  dioxin, alar, asbestos, etc. --  prompted such precautionary measures.  Government’s pursuit of perfect safety in the absence of reasonable scientific certainty  has led to policies that are irresponsible, extremely costly and in some cases, even deadly.
<P>
	Finally the report is completely devoid of any discussion of the institutions   property rights, contracts, and the rule of law   which have made sustainability possible.  This oversight is indicative of the anti-market, pro-government bias throughout the report.
<P>
	There are some redeeming qualities.  The PCSD does call for the elimination of environmentally damaging subsidies.  The report also constitutes a rhetorical move toward the market.  However, in reality it is a thinly veiled excuse for extensive government intervention into the market.  As such it should be rejected.

<TITLE>CEI EBB: Automobile Fuel Economy Standards</TITLE>

<H2>Automobile Fuel Economy Standards</H2>
</CENTER>

<P><BR>
The federal new car fuel economy program imposes a deadly trade-off of blood
for oil.  Popularly known as CAFE (for Corporate Average Fuel Economy), this
program requires that the new cars sold in the U.S. by any carmaker meet, on
average, a specified yearly fuel economy standard.  The current CAFE standard
for passenger cars is 27.5 miles per gallon (mpg). Some environmental activists
are proposing to raise CAFE to 40 mpg or higher.  If anything, CAFE standards
should be repealed.<p>
	
CAFE has a lethal effect on auto safety.  Decades of research have made it
clear that large cars are more crashworthy than similarly equipped small cars in all collision modes.  CAFE, however, restricts large-car availability.
According to a peer-reviewed Harvard-Brookings study, CAFE is responsible for a
500 pound downsizing of new cars, which translates into 2,200 to 3,900
additional traffic deaths per model year.<p>
	
CAFE&#146;s proponents argue that the law is necessary to reduce gasoline
consumption.  They assume that &#147;fuel efficiency&#148; is an end in itself. That is silly.  Oil is a resource whose use benefits people.  When
fuel-efficiency improvements pay for themselves, they are obviously worthwhile; government-<i>mandated</i> fuel efficiency, on the other hand, is an entirely
different matter, as it restricts consumer choice and produces unwelcome
side-effects.<p>
	
As for national security and foreign oil, America&#146;s use of foreign oil
depends not on fuel efficiency, but on international oil prices.  When oil
prices drop, our relative use of foreign oil increases, since domestic oil
fields are relatively high-cost producers.  We may well be better off relying on foreign oil to supply our current needs while leaving our domestic reserves
unused until they are needed.  <p>
	
Finally, the correlation between fuel economy and vehicle emissions is far
less direct than it appears to be.  NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions, for
example, may actually <i>increase</i> when fuel efficiency rises.<p>
	
Even if one accepts the need to reduce gasoline use, CAFE is an incredibly
costly means of accomplishing this.  By focusing on car design rather than car
use, it imposes its costs without regard to actual gasoline use.  Because CAFE
standards impose a sales mandate, auto manufacturers are forced to manipulate
their prices to sell vehicles that meet the prescribed standards.  As a result,
large-car buyers pay heavy CAFE premiums when buying their cars even if they
drive very little, while small-car buyers pay artificially-lowered car prices
regardless of how much they drive.  Moreover, CAFE&#146;s impact on gas
consumption is mitigated as it reduces the cost of driving.  Because of its
structure, CAFE penalizes full-line domestic carmakers such as Ford and GM, to
the advantage of foreign car makers.<p>
 	
In 1992, a federal appeals court ruled that the federal government relied
upon &#147;fudged analysis,&#148; &#147;statistical legerdemain,&#148; and
&#147;bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo&#148; in enacting current CAFE standards and
ignoring their impact on highway fatalities.  In the past year, the Republican
Congress enacted a temporary freeze on CAFE levels; at the same time, more
stringent CAFE standards have become a prime focus of global warming alarmists.
Even if the CAFE freeze is retained in the future,  CAFE will continue to have
a deadly effect through its restriction of large car production.  If CAFE is
made more stringent, that deadly impact of this law will only increase.	<p>
<i>Q:  Isn&#146;t CAFE necessary to increase fuel efficiency?</i><p>
<p>
A:  No.  When fuel efficiency increases were needed, the market has responded
far more quickly than the law.  In the late 1970s to early 1980s, for example,
the fear of rising gasoline prices produced increases in new-car fuel economy
that <i>exceeded</i> CAFE&#146;s requirements.  Should gasoline prices rise
again, there is no reason not to expect the market to respond in the same
fashion.<p>
<p>
<i>Q:  How can CAFE be claimed to kill people, when the vehicle death rate has
improved since CAFE&#146;s enactment?</i><p>
<i></i><p>
A:  The vehicle death rate has been declining for at least the last fifty
years, far longer than CAFE standards have been in place.  This has been the
result of improvements in vehicle safety, road design and, more recently, the
enforcement of drunk driving laws.  The death rate would have improved even
more in the absence of CAFE.  America&#146;s highways have been getting safer,
but without CAFE they would be safer still.  The long-term trend in this rate
cannot be used to exonerate CAFE.  <p>
<p>
<i>Q:  Won&#146;t new technologies and materials, such as light, high-strength
alloys, make it possible to achieve higher fuel economy without sacrificing
safety?</i><p>
<p>
A:  Alluring as they may be, new technologies will not alleviate CAFE&#146;s
size/safety tradeoff.  Such technologies may certainly make cars safer and more
fuel efficient, but CAFE&#146;s requirements will still forcibly shift the use
of these technologies away from safety and towards fuel efficiency, even when
consumers desire just the opposite.  For example, a new lightweight alloy may
allow a given car model to become more fuel efficient with no loss of interior
space.  On the other hand, in the absence of CAFE, that model might have become
even larger in size, and thus safer in a collision.  <p>
<p>
<i>Q:  If CAFE really is so deadly, why do safety groups such as the Center for
Auto Safety favor </i>increasing<i> the standard?</i><p>
<p>
A:  In the case of CAFE, some so-called public interest groups have apparently
chosen to favor more government over more safety.  It is noteworthy that the
auto insurance industry, which has a financial stake in vehicle crashworthiness
and which in the past has generally sided with &#147;public interest&#148;
groups on expanding vehicle safety regulation, has opposed them on the issue of
raising CAFE.
