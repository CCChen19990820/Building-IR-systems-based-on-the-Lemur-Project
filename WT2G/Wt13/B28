<BR>
<H3>Manufacturing index sends early shivers through Wall Street</H3>
On the first trading day of 1997, a surprisingly strong manufacturing report sent the already jittery financial markets into a tizzy.  <BR>
<BR>
On the heels of a 101-point slide Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 93 points at the opening bell Thursday before gingerly righting itself in afternoon trading.  Bond traders also sent prices tumbling in the morning session, fearful that the hearty economic news might be a precursor to stronger economic growth, higher inflation and increased interest rates.<BR>
<BR>
The news?  The National Association of Purchasing Management said its <A HREF = "http://206.54.248.207/rob/index.html">monthly index of manufacturing activity</A> rose 2.5% in December rather than falling, as analysts had anticipated.  The index registered 54.0 during the month, up from 52.7 in November.  Any reading above 50 indicates growth at the nation's manufacturing firms, NAPM says, while one below that level signals contraction in the industry.  <BR>
<BR>
The results don't leave much room for ambiguity, says survey author Norbert Ore.  "The manufacturing sector simply grew more rapidly in December than November," Ore says.  "That's indicated by increases in the growth rate of new orders, the growing backlog of orders and a slowing in the inventory-reduction trend."<BR>
<BR>
The report, generally the first major economic news released each month, had been widely anticipated on Wall Street as the opening economic snapshot of the new year.  NAPM members are executives in charge of buying both finished and raw materials for large corporations.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The first Baby Bell asked for permission Thursday to provide long-distance service to its local customers,</B> invoking the telecommunications law passed by Congress last February.  Seeking to protect their turf, the major long-distance companies immediately said Chicago-based Ameritech has not satisfied the law's free-trade conditions.  Ameritech provides local phone service in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.  The government has 90 days to act on the firm's request.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of Americans filing unemployment claims last week hit its highest level in more than five months,</B> the Labor Department announced Thursday.  New applications for jobless benefits shot up by 22,000 during the week to 366,000, the highest number since applications totaled 367,000 the week of July 13.  Labor also said the overall unemployment rate edged up from 5.1% in October to 5.4% in November.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Help-wanted advertising increased at the nation's newspapers in November,</B> the Conference Board said Thursday.  The business group's monthly Help-Wanted Advertising Index, which tracks job ads at 51 metropolitan newspapers across the country, gained 4% in November.  Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein says help-wanted ads increased in eight of the country's nine regions in the fourth quarter; only the Mid-Atlantic states saw a slowdown.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Some Belgian investors had trouble ringing in the new year,</B> as the Brussels Stock Exchange's computer trading system refused to cooperate during the first three hours of trading Thursday.  Market director Olivier Lefebvre said the problem arose when orders placed on December 30, the last trading day of 1996, were recognized by the system as December 1997 orders.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Nasdaq set seven market records in 1996</B>, spokesman Reid Walker announced this week.  The market closed out the year by posting high-water marks in share volume, market value of listed companies, number and dollar value of initial public offerings, dollar value of trades, market value of secondary public offerings and average daily trading volume.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Kiwi International Air Lines announced its return to service at a press conference Thursday,</B> saying it will resume flights between Atlanta, Chicago, Newark and West Palm Beach starting January 20.  The discount carrier filed for bankruptcy protection in September and suspended flights on October 15.  <BR>

<H3>New tax laws for the new year</H3>
In case you haven't yet made a new year's resolution for 1997, here's an idea: "I will save money on my taxes this year."  To help you out, <I>Kiplinger Online</I> will publish a different tax tip daily between February 1 and the April 15 federal filing deadline.  In the meantime, here are a few new ways to save money this year, courtesy of Congressional tinkering with the tax code:<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"> Non-working spouses can contribute the same amount toward Individual Retirement Accounts as working spouses for the first time.  Each will be able to contribute $2,000 annually, which is up from $250 a year for homemakers.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"> Taxpayers can withdraw money from IRAs without penalty if the money is used to pay medical expenses that total more than 7.5% of their adjusted gross income.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"> A tax credit of up to $5,000 for expenses involved in adopting children is available ($6,000 for children with disabilities).  Couples with adjusted gross incomes less than $115,000 are eligible.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"> Taxpayers with long-term care insurance will receive a tax deduction equal to their premium payments and those with less than 24 months to live can receive tax-free advances on their life insurance policies.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"> Self-employed taxpayers can deduct 40% of the cost of their health insurance premiums, up from 30% in 1996.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Women are slowly but surely gaining on men in the workplace,</B> concludes a study released this week by researchers at University of Maryland and University of Virginia.  Between 1970 and 1995, according to the study, the proportion of adult women who work outside the home increased from one-half to three-quarters and their pay jumped from 59% of what men make to 72%.  The study links the gains to women's improving education; women have made up the majority of college-degree recipients in the 1990s, for example.  "The picture of women in the workplace is one of clear, albeit slow, progress toward equality with men," says Maryland's Suzanne Bianchi.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>President Clinton delayed implementation of a new law Friday that would allow U.S. citizens to sue foreign companies doing business in Cuba,</B> bowing to international pressure.  Clinton ordered a six-month moratorium on the so-called Helms-Burton law "in order to consolidate and build on the momentum we have generated for democratic change in Cuba."  He said the U.S. might continue suspending the law in six-month increments as long as other nations continue to push for democracy and human rights in Cuba.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Heating oil and gasoline prices aren't heading lower any time soon,</B> the Energy Department said Friday.  DOE Spokesman Jay Hakes said heating oil is expected to remain 10 to 15 cents a gallon higher this winter than last because of strong demand in both the U.S. and Europe—fueled by high levels of consumer confidence.  He also said the government is forecasting average summer gasoline prices of $1.36 to $1.38 a gallon, up from $1.22 a gallon now.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The federal official overseeing the Teamsters Union election denied allegations Friday that she lost thousands of ballots,</B> saying such claims by loser James Hoffa "are without any foundation."  Union president Ron Carey was declared the winner on December 14, but Hoffa immediately challenged the results.  Federal overseer Barbara Zack Quindel investigated Hoffa's charges for nearly a month before making her announcement Friday.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>This date in sports history serves to highlight the sea-change in professional athlete's financial situations in recent decades.</B>  On January 3, 1920, the New York Yankees baseball team purchased the rights to Babe Ruth for $125,000 in cash.  In 1997 dollars, that's slightly more than $2.5 million—for the most heralded player in baseball history at the peak of his career.  The average salary for current Yankees players, in contrast, is more than $2 million per season.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Spending on construction projects in November climbed at its sharpest rate in eight months,</B> the Commerce Department announced Friday.  Construction spending gained 1.9% to total $592 billion during the month, the biggest one-month jump since it gained 2.3% between February and March.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The two major package-delivery services announced price hikes this week,</B> with both Federal Express and United Parcel Service citing increased labor and fuel costs.  Starting February 3, FedEx said it will raise prices 2% to cover the higher overhead costs.  Similarly, UPS said it will raise fees as much as 4.3% on some packages starting February 1. <BR>

<H3>Investing:  Market will ride out current turbulence</H3><P>
The stock market sell-off that began yesterday and continued, to a lesser extent, today should only represent a temporary setback for your equity investments.  We expect stocks to remain near current levels into early summer before resuming their upward march in the second half of the year.  Patience and steely nerves will ultimately be rewarded, even though the markets won't skyrocket like they did last year.<P>
<P>
The relatively robust March unemployment figures released Friday all but guaranteed that the Federal Reserve Board will not reduce short-term interest rates again until at least summer.  This is good news for workers but potentially bad news for stock investors because higher interest rates raise the cost of borrowing and could hinder corporate growth.<P>

<H3>Economy: Line-item veto will have little effect, says analyst</H3><P>
Ignore the hoopla surrounding President Clinton's signing of the line-item veto bill today, says chief economist Scott Brown at brokerage house Raymond James & Associates.  According to Brown, Congress will find too many loopholes in the bill for it to have any real effect on the economy.  Besides, it will have to withstand "a significant legal challenge," he notes, when critics argue in court that the law is an unconstitutional transfer of Congress' power over the budget.<P>
<P>
Currently, the president has the option to veto an entire bill sent from Congress, but not individual aspects of it.  The bill, scheduled to go into effect on January 1, will allow the President to eliminate single spending items from larger budget bills.<P>

<H3>Spending:  Gasoline prices trend up as summer travel season approaches</H3><P>
<P>
As you plan those long summer trips, keep in mind that higher gasoline prices might be on the way.  Prices at the pump tend to go up every spring and summer as more people hit the road, but this year could be worse than normal, predicts PaineWebber analyst Steven Pfeifer.  “Low crude oil and gasoline inventories coupled with the start of the heavy driving season means prices will get worse before they get better,” Pfeifer says.  Current gas prices hover around $1.29 per gallon in most areas. We expect that average to go up by a nickel or so before Memorial Day, but it should drop back below $1.25 by mid-August.<P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute reported this week that the supply of gasoline on hand at U.S. refineries is near an all-time low for this time of year.  The implications are straightforward:  Low supply plus increasing demand equals rising prices, at least in the short run.  The supply situation could improve if Iraq starts selling its oil on the international market again, Pfeifer notes, but he says that won’t happen “until at least May or June.”  The United Nations has limited Iraq’s sale of crude oil since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, but recently began considering whether to lift some restrictions.<P>

<H3>Insurance:  The big get bigger, but . . .</H3><P>
<P>
A new study released today says consolidation among companies in the life-, health-, home- and car-insurance industries will continue at a record pace over the next year or two.  What impact will that have on consumers?  Theoretically, such consolidation means less competition, fewer choices and potentially higher prices.  But study co-author Steven Piaker at Conning & Company Investment Securities has another possible scenario:  Feeble insurance companies will merge with larger, stronger ones that can bundle various types of insurance at one relatively low price.<P>
<P>
Despite the mixed signals, we think it’s likely you won’t see much of a price change either way in the near future.  Faced with a glut of companies, the insurance industries have been -- and are likely to stay -- quite competitive.  Some weaklings and smaller companies will be absorbed, but the bigs most people are familiar with should remain in good shape and relatively unchanged.

<H3>Investing:  Is this downturn the real thing?</H3>
The Dow Jones industrial average spent most of the day in negative territory for the fifth consecutive session today and has shaved off nearly 4% of its value in a week’s time.  Is this the beginning of a long downward spiral?  Not likely.  As we said Monday after the Dow’s 89-point drop, we expect stocks to bounce around a bit but remain near current levels into early summer before resuming their upward march in the second half of the year.  
<P>
<P>
And as we forecast in the May issue of <I>Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine</I>, "After all the peaks and valleys, stock returns this year will wind up around the historical norm of 10%."  The Dow has returned 7.2% and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index 2.5% thus far in 1996 -- leaving both with room to grow.

<H3>Spending: Cable TV rates on the way up</H3>
Don’t be surprised if your cable television bill goes up in the months ahead, following a Federal Communications Commission decision this week to stop regulating prices in the industry. 
<P>
<P>
Expect a monthly fee increase on the order of $1 or $2 from companies that are deregulated immediately.  They aren’t likely to boost prices any more than that because of the threat posed by emerging competitors such as direct broadcast satellite providers.  On the positive side of deregulation, cable operators will respond to new competition with more programming; you can expect many systems to provide 50 or more channels as part of their basic service in the near future.
<P>
<P>
The FCC agreed to drop pricing restrictions now for small cable systems and those that must compete for viewers (with, say, the local telephone company or a so-called wireless cable firm).  Larger systems will be free of pricing limits in three years.  Under current guidelines, the FCC caps price increases for basic service at the annual rate of inflation.

<H3>Taxes: Last-minute tax tips</H3>
As we headed into deadline week, roughly 43% of the taxpayers still hadn’t filed their federal tax forms -- Monday’s the big day.  If you’re among the millions rushing to finish your taxes this weekend, here’s a last-minute primer:  
<P><UL><LI>If you’re missing any forms, don’t bother to call the IRS; with all the other procrastinators jamming the phone lines this weekend, you probably won’t get through.  Go to your local library or post office to pick up a copy, or download forms from the <A HREF = "http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/forms_pubs/forms.html">IRS home page</A>.  If the IRS site is slow or doesn’t respond, you can also download tax forms free of charge from the <A HREF = "http://members.aol.com/nactp/govtwebs.htm ">National Association of Computerized Tax Processors</A> or <A HREF = "http://www.vni.net/~nettax/">NetTax ‘96</A>.
<P><LI>If you need an extension to August 15, send in Form 4868.  If you owe, pay as much as you can afford now.  The IRS charges 8% interest on late payments, with additional penalties possible.
<P><LI>If you still don’t have necessary information from your mutual fund, or don’t understand what you did receive, call the fund’s toll-free phone number.  Most fund companies provide good service and many have hired extra helpers for this weekend
<P><LI>If you need more information, try the <A HREF = "http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/where_file/index.html">IRS site</A> and/or read <A HREF = "http://www.conductor.com/cgi-bin/imagemap/taxonly?202,173">"50 Ways to Cut Your Taxes"</A> on the home page for <A HREF = "http://www.conductor.com/cgi-bin/imagemap/home?272,100">Kiplinger Tax Cut</A>, our tax-preparation software.  You might also want to read <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/apr96/taxq&a.html">"Your Tax Questions Answered"</A> in the April issue of<I> Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine</I>.</UL>

<H3>Your Home: Time to cement that mortgage rate?</H3>
If you have your eye on a house or want to refinance but haven’t locked in a mortgage rate yet, it may be time to talk to your lender.  Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages jumped more than a quarter of a percentage point this week, putting the average fixed-rate loan around 8%.  Just two months ago, 30-year loans averaged less than 7%.<P>
<P>
Though it’s not dramatic, this week’s uptick in mortgage rates does make a difference to potential home-buyers.  On a $125,000 mortgage, for example, an 8% loan instead of 7% means you need $4,000 more in income to qualify.  The higher rate also tags on an extra $96 to your monthly payments.  If you can afford to wait, you may get a better deal later in the year when inflation fears subside.<P>

<H3>Economy: Inflation fears seem unwarranted</H3>
Despite worries about rising prices that have taken the stock and bond markets on roller-coaster rides of late, inflation should turn out to be relatively tame this year.  We expect the Federal government's consumer price index to register slightly higher than 3% growth in 1996, a small increase over last year's 2.5% rate.  As the financial markets come to the same conclusion, long-term interest rates are likely to drift lower.  Rates on 30-year treasuries and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages should come down 0.5% each, to around 6.5% and 7.5%, respectively.<P>
<P>
While they may not be going up quickly, prices are increasing on a wide variety of things consumers buy.  Even excluding the statistics for energy and food, which went up faster than other sectors, the March CPI statistics showed 0.3% inflation for the month -- which translates into about 3.5% over the course of a year. <P>

<H3>Washington Watch: Minimum wage increase unlikely</H3>
Depending on who you believe, an increase in the minimum wage would be either an economic blessing or a disaster for American workers.  Democrats say increasing the minimum wage to a "living wage" level would pump about $18 billion in additional consumer spending into the economy each year as workers have more to spend.  Republicans counter that employers will simply hire fewer entry-level employees in such a scenario, leading to a higher unemployment rate and a worsening economic environment for all. <P>
<P>
So who's right?  Both, says economist George Tzannetakis of Seton Hall University.  "In reality, the evidence is mixed," he says.  "Past increases have adversely affected employment, but for the most part only among teenagers."  <P>
<P>
The issue resurfaced over the weekend when Labor Secretary Robert Reich urged Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole to pass legislation boosting the minimum wage.  A recent Clinton Administration proposal would increase the minimum wage by 90 cents over the next two years, ultimately bumping it up to $5.15 per hour.  We give it little or no chance of passing this year. <P>
<P>
<A HREF = "mailto:snelson@kiplinger.com">Let us know what you think</A>.  Should the minimum wage stay at $4.25 or increase to $5.15?<P>

<H3> Taxes: Do you really want that big refund?</H3>
The day following the April 15 tax deadline is a good time to sit back and evaluate your tax situation for <I>next</I> year.  Many taxpayers ended up with a fat refund this year — the average IRS repayment is $1,245 at last count.  If you're among them, you provided an interest-free loan to the government; every dollar you get back in a refund is a dollar you could have spent, saved or invested during the year.  So unless you use overwithholding as a type of forced savings account, you should probably change your W-4 form at work.<P>
<P>
The W-4 doesn't determine your annual tax bill, only the amount you shell out to the government each payday.  Simply put, the more withholding allowances you claim, the less tax you will have withheld.  Ask your employer how many allowances you claim now, then figure out whether you can legitimately claim more.  To adjust the number of allowances, submit a new Form W-4.  Your employer's payroll department will often help with the details, and the form itself comes with instructions.  You can pick up a blank W-4 form from your payroll department or download one from the <A HREF = "http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/forms_pubs/forms.html">IRS Web site</A>.<P>

<H3> Travel: Benefits of tax-less plane tickets on the wane </H3>
Good news for investors in the airline industry is sometimes bad news for airline travelers.  The 10% tax on domestic airline tickets that lapsed December 31 amid failed budget negotiations is one such example.  Right after the tax was dropped, most airlines cut fares 10% to reflect the difference. As the year wore on, though, airlines slowly raised base fares, to the point where most benefits of the tax-less tickets are long gone.  Result: More gain per ticket for the U.S. airline industry, which is expected to report a first-quarter profit for the first time in 17 years.<P>
<P>
There is still one potential advantage for fliers, though.  Passengers who bought tickets in 1995 (when the tax was still being levied) but used them in 1996 can still apply for a refund.  If you qualify, download Form 8849 from the <A HREF = "http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/forms_pubs/forms.html">IRS</A> or contact the airline directly.<P>

<H3>More long distance choices on the way</H3>
It looks as if AT&T, MCI and Sprint will face major competition for your long-distance dollars in the near future. Bell Atlantic and Nynex are reportedly back at the negotiating table this week in on-again, off-again, on-again discussions about combining their operations.  That comes on the heels of the SBC Communications/Pacific Telesis merger announcement less than two weeks ago—the first marriage between Baby Bells.  <P>
<P>
Such mergers are only the first wave, predicts analyst Donna Coward of Wheat First Butcher Singer.  She forecasts that within five years the seven Baby Bells and three large long-distance providers will be winnowed down to three to five major players.  "That," she says, "will lead to better service for consumers at competitive, though not dramatically lower, prices."<P>
<P>
Bell Atlantic and Nynex currently control the local phone business in Mid-Atlantic and Northeast states from Virginia to Maine.  A combination of the two would create the second-largest telecommunications company in the American market, behind AT&T.  SBC Communications, formerly known as Southwestern Bell, provides telephone service in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma.  Pacific Telesis serves California and part of Nevada.<P>

<H3> In brief </H3>
<LI><B>Taxpayers will get new weapons </B>to use against the IRS if a bill passed unanimously by the House gets Senate and presidential approval.  Taxpayers who have been the victims of "reckless IRS collection actions" will be able to sue the IRS for $1 million, up from a current cap of $100,000.  Other changes include: banning interest charges that result from delays caused by IRS mistakes; extending to 21 days from 10 days the grace period a taxpayer has to make late payments before getting hit with an interest penalty; and easing the process of charging the IRS for taxpayers' legal fees.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Coca-Cola shareholders </B>approved a two-for-one stock split at the company's annual meeting today, following announcement of a 12% increase in first-quarter profits.  A Coke spokesperson said the company made gains worldwide despite continuing economic difficulty in key markets.  "Our strong performance is the result of continued effective marketing and long-range investments, and it is paying off around the world—including some dramatic growth in our oldest market, the United States," chairman and chief executive Roberto Goizueta told Reuters news service.<P>
<P>
<A NAME="ford"><LI><B>Fords that caught fire </B></A>due to allegedly faulty ignition switches will get some attention from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Drivers have reported more than 900 fires in the more than 23 million cars, vans and light trucks on the road with such switches.  Ford used the switches in all 1984 to 1993 Ford, Mercury and Lincoln models, except for the Ford Taurus and Probe and Mercury Sable.  Ford is advising customers to replace the switch at their own expense (between $50 and $100) if they are concerned.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>In Japan today, </B>President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Hashimoto emphasized that the trade relationship between the two nations is improving.  During previous meetings between Clinton and Japanese prime ministers, trade disputes have taken center stage.  In a joint statement today, though, the leaders stressed that the reduction in the American trade deficit is a sign of progress.<P>

<H3>CompuServe, Planet Hollywood IPOs set</H3>
The nation’s second-largest online service and one of the nation’s glitziest restaurant chains go public today.  <P>
<P>
The former, CompuServe, has 4.5 million subscribers to its online service, second to Virginia-based America Online.  Its venture into the publicly owned world follows last Friday’s successful initial public offering of search-engine company Yahoo! — the stock price rocketed from $13 to $33 during the first day of trading.  CompuServe shares are initially priced at $30.  <P>
<P>
The glitzy restaurant folks, in this case actors Bruce Willis, Demi Moore, Whoopi Goldberg, Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, also took their company public today.  Planet Hollywood International plans to sell 10.8 million shares on the Nasdaq market, initially priced at $18.<P>

We will update you on the day’s market reaction this afternoon.<P>

<P>
Once the SSA mails back a response to your request, you can see the status of your personal account, with a year-by-year breakdown of the earnings on which you paid social security tax and how much you paid.  Make sure you get credit for all those tax payments over the years.  You'll get shorted if some of your earnings haven't been posted to the account.  The report includes a toll-free number for you to call if something's amiss.<P>

<H3>Two votes for more trade, not less</H3>
Commerce Secretary-designate Mickey Kantor talked tough on trade Thursday, reminding Japan and other nations that the U.S. "want[s] the same access to other markets that others have to U.S. markets."  If we get it, what would it mean for the average worker?  Quite a bit, says Howard Lewis, a vice president at the National Association of Manufacturers.  <P>
<P>
Open foreign markets mean more exports for American companies, says Lewis.  And exporting firms pay both skilled and less-skilled workers more than non-exporting companies, according to a NAM study released in February.  <P>
<P>
Companies that send some or all of their products abroad also produce more jobs than non-exporters and are less likely to go out of business, according to Lewis.  "Despite what Ross Perot or Pat Buchanan is running around saying," he concludes, "the bottom line is that international trade is good for American companies and good for American workers."<P>

Now consumers may face higher prices this summer for plane tickets, produce, milk and moving vans, as a result.  <I>USA Today </I>reported yesterday morning that the American Trucking Association has asked the federal government to declare a "fuel emergency" so moving companies can raise rates.  The article also quoted an American Airlines source who said airlines and trucking companies are likely to pass increased fuel costs along to customers.  Food that has to be refrigerated in transit, such as dairy products, fruits and vegetables, will be doubly affected, since diesel fuel is also used to run refrigerator units on trucks.<P>
<P>
<LI><B> First-time applications for state jobless benefits </B>edged up slightly last week, the Labor Department announced yesterday.  The statistics, representing the first advance in three weeks, were seen by most economists as a sign of a healthy job market despite the increase.  Initial jobless claims increased to 360,000 from 350,000 in the week ending April 13.  The number of people already receiving unemployment benefits fell 53,000 to 2.6 million in the week ending April 6.<P>

<LI><B> Mortgage rates dropped this week, </B>the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. announced Thursday. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.95% for the week, after hitting a high of 8.05% a week ago.

<H3> The days of clipping coupons may be numbered (downloading them, on the other hand . . .)</H3>
The weekly ritual of cutting coupons out of the Sunday paper may soon come to an end, says Stephen Newell, a marketing professor at Bowling Green State University.  He says companies are closely monitoring a current Procter & Gamble test of coupon-less marketing, and he expects others to try similar methods in the near future.<P>
<P>
In February, Procter & Gamble, whose products include Tide, Crest, Folgers, Cover Girl and Pringles, eliminated all promotional coupons in Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse.  Unless consumers there jump ship en masse to competing brands, P&G executives hope to do away with coupons nationwide before long.  <P>
<P>
That could have immediate consequences for the way Americans shop, according to Newell.  "Procter & Gamble is the 500-pound gorilla of the industry, and its competitors will likely fall into line and begin to phase out coupons," he says.  "Coupons may soon be a memory."  The company's marketing clout is so strong that daytime dramas were dubbed "soap operas" because of sponsorship by P&G's cleaning products.<P>
<P>
Not all is lost for coupon junkies, though — there will still be ways to get 75 cents off your Raisin Bran, Newell says.  Companies just won't pay to put them in the newspaper.  Instead, he foresees more in-store discounting and more coupon services on the Internet.  Even now, if you run a "coupons" query through any of the major search engines on the World Wide Web, you will find dozens of sites that exist solely to provide free coupons.<P>

<LI><B>CompuServe and Planet Hollywood,</B> the nation's second-largest online service and one of the nation's glitziest restaurant chains, respectively, went public Friday.  CompuServe, boasting 4.5 million subscribers to its online service, followed close on the heels of search-engine company Yahoo!, which a week earlier watched its shares rocket from $13 to $33 at its own initial public offering.  CompuServe shares finished Friday at $33, up from $30.  The glitzy restaurant folks, in this case actors/entrepreneurs Whoopi Goldberg, Demi Moore, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone and Bruce Willis, fared better.  In the most active IPO in Nasdaq history, Planet Hollywood shares jumped from $18 to $26.88 on day one of public trading.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Fidelity Investments is allegedly under investigation</B> by the Securities and Exchange Commission for improper personal trading by several of its fund managers, according to an article in Friday's<I> Washington Post</I>.  The article cited unnamed "government and legal sources," and indicated that the SEC was looking into whether or not managers bought and sold stocks for themselves ahead of fund trading to take advantage of resulting price changes.  The SEC declined to comment on the case.  Fidelity, on the other hand, angrily denied the accuracy of the <I>Post </I>article in a <A HREF = "http://www.fid-inv.com/news/press_statement.html">statement released this afternoon</A>.  <P>

<H3> The latest 'Super Bell' may be just one of many communications conglomerates on the way </H3>
The Bell Atlantic and Nynex merger announced yesterday will create the second-largest telecommunications company in the nation.  The largest — AT&T — was noticeably shaken by the announcement, issuing a statement condemning the merger as anticompetitive.  If a study released yesterday by consulting company A.T. Kearney is correct, though, AT&T will have to get used to the idea of not necessarily being the biggest, baddest guy on the telecommunications block.<P>
<P>
The Kearney study predicts that communications, information and entertainment firms will band together over the next five years.  The new "mega-companies" will offer one-stop shopping for long-distance telephone, local telephone, television and entertainment services.<P>
<P>
The impact of all this on consumers?  We'll see.  The Consumer Federation of America says Monday's merger could lead to less competition and higher prices.  But others, such as the Wheat First Butcher Singer analyst quoted in this space on <A HREF = "dn0417.html">Wednesday</A>, see such moves as a harbinger of "better service for consumers at competitive, though not dramatically lower, prices."  The one point everybody agrees on: This merger will not lead to immediate changes.<P>
<P>
The merger still has to be approved by regulators before anything is finalized. Bell Atlantic and Nynex currently control the local phone business in Mid-Atlantic and Northeast states from Virginia to Maine.  <P>

<LI> <B>Free e-mail accounts</B> are now available for customers of New York City's Juno Online Services.  Anyone interested in signing up can request the free software from <A HREF = "http://www.juno.com/getit.html">Juno's Web site</A> or call the company's toll-free phone number (800-654-5866).  Most people receive e-mail accounts through online services — for which they pay at least $10 per month.  Juno's customers, on the other hand, just fill out a questionnaire, select a password and email address and consent to viewing advertisements while they read or write e-mail messages.  If you're not sure whether the advertising will bother you, Juno's home page shows <A HREF = "http://www.juno.com/seeit.html">a mock-up of the standard screen</A> you will see while reading or writing your mail.  At least one competitor, <A HREF = "http://www.freemark.com">FreeMark Communications</A> of Cambridge, Mass., has a similar service in the works.<P>

<LI> <B>The Securities and Exchange Commission</B> said there were "inaccuracies" in a Friday <I>Washington Post</I> article about Fidelity Investments, but it declined to say if it has an investigation going on.  Friday, the <I>Post</I> reported that the SEC was investigating Fidelity for improper personal trading by several of its fund managers.  Over the weekend, the newspaper backed off somewhat after receiving a letter from the SEC that said, in part, "the article contains inaccuracies which have led to erroneous impressions."  No other details were released, but the <I>Post</I> said it stands by the central facts of its story.  <A HREF = "http://www.fid-inv.com/news/press_statement.html">Fidelity continues to deny</A> that any investigation is in progress.  <P>

<H3> Why Americans feel angst over job security </H3>
The White House Council of Economic Advisers reported today what many Americans have felt in their bones — jobs have been eliminated over the past few years faster than they used to be.  The numbers explain why so many Americans have been worried about job insecurity of late.  <P>
<P>
But today's report also highlighted the economy's silver lining:  Namely, good jobs have been created as quickly as they have been lost.  Unemployment is so low nationwide that some economists believe we are near "full employment" right now.  And the newly created jobs have been relatively high-paying ones; more than two-thirds of the jobs created in 1994 and 1995 paid better than average wages, according to today's report.  In addition, workers who have lost their jobs recently have spent less time unemployed than those in earlier years.<P>
<P>
Scant comfort to the recently downsized, but some comfort nonetheless.<P>

<LI><B>Nynex and Sprint </B>announced an agreement today that will allow Nynex to enter the long-distance telephone market as early as this summer.  Just one day after agreeing to <A HREF = "dn0422.html">merge with Bell Atlantic</A>, Nynex says it hopes to offer long-distance service in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois and Texas within three months — if the government gives its approval.  The company will likely announce more wide-ranging plans for the long distance market by the end of the year.  Nynex currently provides local phone service in the Northeastern states from New York to Maine.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Unload your tobacco investments, </B>urged the American Medical Association today.  Citing tobacco-related health risks, the doctors' group released <A HREF = "http://www.ama-assn.org/ad-com/releases/1996/tobstock.htm">a list</A> of 13 companies that manufacture and distribute tobacco products and 1,474 mutual funds that invest in them.  The AMA found that roughly one in five mutual funds had investments in the 13 tobacco companies between May 31, 1993 and January 31 of this year.  The Tobacco Institute declined to comment this afternoon, as did spokespersons for RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris, two of the targeted companies.<P>

<H3> Take stock of your belongings </H3>
The whole world took note the past two days as Sotheby's auctioned off items from the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis estate.  While you might not own a humidor like the one that fetched $574,000 Tuesday night, the Onassis estate sale provides a reminder to step back and take inventory of what you do own from time to time.  <P>
<P>
The most important reason for this, of course, is to make sure your homeowner's insurance covers what you can't afford to replace in the case of fire, theft, flood or some other disaster.  It isn't a difficult process and it could save you from a big headache later on, says Paul Pinchak of Prudential Insurance.  He tells policy holders to first go room-to-room in their houses, writing down everything of value.  Then, Pinchak says, they should take pictures of (or videotape) their most valuable items.  Even better, keep the receipts from all big-ticket items and save them in a safety deposit box with your pictures or video tapes.<P>
<P>
As a rule of thumb, you should probably take stock of your belongings every three to five years to make sure your homeowner's coverage is adequate, recommends John Blue of Geico Insurance.  <P>
<P>
For more information on whether you have enough insurance or too much, see our August 1994 article <A HREF = "/magazine/archives/1994/August/homeinsr.html">Home Insurance That Won't Let You Down</A>. <P>

<H3> In brief </H3>
<LI><B>Hope for a gasoline price reduction faded </B>this afternoon as oil-for-food negotiations between Iraq and the United Nations ground to a halt.  The UN has limited Iraq's sale of crude oil since the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, effectively reducing the supply of oil worldwide — and increasing the cost of gasoline.  Iraq has asked to be allowed to sell $2 billion worth of oil over the next six months so it can buy food, medicine and other essentials.  Today's breakdown means talks on allowing that sale aren't likely to resume before some time next month.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>State and local taxes</B> "play a major role in decisions about where to locate" new businesses, according to a new Coopers & Lybrand survey of the chief executives at the 434 fastest-growing companies in America.  The "Trendsetter Barometer" study says such CEOs worry about the state and local tax burden even more than the federal one, since it is the most rapidly increasing portion of their overall tax liability.  Respondents cited California more than any other state to be avoided, followed by New York, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.  Other high-tax states mentioned were Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oregon and Washington.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Internet capability continued on an upward trend </B>this year among those with personal computers at home, according to the Software Publishers Association's most-recent annual survey.  Seventy percent of households with PCs reported owning a modem this year, up from 65% a year ago and 49% in 1994.    Of modem owners in the 1996 poll, 46% subscribe to an online service and an additional 26% use the Internet through accounts from work or school.  Survey results show that the overall number of home personal computers rose slightly this year to 33.9 million, up from 32.6 million a year ago.<P>

<H3> Don't expect to see the effect of skyrocketing wheat, corn prices at the supermarket </H3>
Farmers in the nation's Midwest had a hard time planting spring crops this week thanks to some bad weather.  While that's big news at the Chicago Board of Trade, where prices for wheat, corn, oats and soybeans moved sharply higher, it's no news for consumers:  Analysts don't think food prices at the supermarket will budge.<P>
<P>
Analyst Ellen Baras of Duff & Phelps Equity Research says only 5% to 10% of the cost of most packaged foods (i.e. breakfast cereal) comes from raw materials such as wheat or corn.  The rest of the price goes to cover manufacturing, packaging and marketing — with plenty left over for profit.  "The types of things you buy in the supermarket usually have enough of a margin built in that they can sustain fluctuating commodity prices without changing the prices consumers see," Baras says.<P>

<H3> In brief </H3>
<LI><B>The spring home-buying season</B> is off to a solid start, according to the National Association of Realtors.  March statistics released by NAR today show sales of previously owned homes up nearly 7% from February's numbers.  Mortgage loan rates have been rising recently and analysts say consumers may be buying now in fear of even higher interest rates.  "What we are seeing is the result of buyers, including trade-up buyers, who moved quickly before interest rates rose," economist John Tuccillo told the Associated Press today.  <P>
<P>
<LI><B>Per capita income outpaced inflation </B>in 48 states last year, the Commerce Department reported today.  Nationwide, per capita personal income went up 5% to $22,788 in 1995, while prices rose only 2.4%.  Connecticut retained its spot as the state with the highest per capita income ($30,303, a 4.3% increase), but Louisiana registered the fastest-growing incomes, improving 6.9% to $18,827.  Buffeted by lower farm earnings, North Dakota and South Dakota were the only states where inflation exceeded income gains.  South Dakota received the dubious honor of being the only state where the average person's income went <I>down</I> — by 0.3% to $19,506.<P>
<P>
<A NAME="ford"><LI><B>Ford Motor Company is recalling </B>8.7 million vehicles built between 1988 and early 1993 because of allegedly faulty ignition switches.  As <A HREF = "dn0417.html#ford">we reported</A> eight days ago, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been investigating a series of fires in Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles equipped with the switches.  Ford said today that in a "very small number of vehicles, the ignition switch could experience an internal short circuit, creating the potential for overheating, smoke and possibly fire in the steering column."  Vehicles involved include: Ford Aerostar, Bronco, Crown Victoria, F-Series pickup, Mustang, Tempo and Thunderbird; Lincoln Town Car; Mercury Cougar, Grand Marquis and Topaz.  Ford will send letters to vehicle owners about how to get the switches replaced at no charge.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Internet access for schools and libraries</B> is a high priority for the Federal Communications Commission, chairman Reed Hundt said this afternoon in Washington.  Hundt's announcement came as the FCC agreed to set aside a portion of the radio spectrum so that schools and libraries can use the airwaves  free of charge to link their computers to the Internet.  They only work over short distances, but the wireless connections could link people within a building over a private 'Intranet' or allow users to connect to the Internet by networking through a single telephone modem.  The FCC ruling lets schools and libraries avoid the prohibitive cost of laying cable to get connected.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Investors were unusually active in the first quarter, </B>the New York Stock Exchange announced today.  Average daily trading volume for the first three months of the year was a record 427.5 million shares.  That compares to 333.3 million shares traded per day during the first quarter in 1995.<P>

<H3>How to find a contractor for your home </H3>
In the latest horror story to keep homeowners awake at night, the Justice Department confirmed this week that it is investigating anticompetitive practices in the roofing industry.  But if the warm weather has you itching to install a new skylight or retile the patio, there <I>are</I> steps you can take to protect yourself from dishonest and inept contractors — and save you money.<P>
<P>
First, you should have a good idea about what you want before you start looking for a contractor.  Collect magazine articles or check out your neighbors' homes for ideas, and think about how you would like your project to look when it's done.  The less ambiguity you start with, the less room you leave for dispute later.<P>
<P>
That done, don't just look in the Yellow Pages.  Ask friends and relatives for referrals and call the local trade association for a list of qualified businesses in your area.  From there, narrow your list down to four or five contractors and ask each for a list of recent jobs they've done — or are in the process of doing — that are similar to your project.  Call the references and, if possible, visit several sites.  <P>
<P>
Verify each remodeler's license (if required in your state) and insurance.  If you hire a contractor who doesn't provide worker's compensation insurance and one of his/her employees falls off your roof, you could be stuck paying medical bills and lost wages.  Also, check with your local Better Business Bureau to make sure there are no outstanding complaints against any of the contractors you are considering.  <P>
<P>
When you feel comfortable with two or three contractors, provide each with a description of your project and request a price estimate.  Prices are rarely set in stone at this stage, so you can still negotiate.  When you come to terms with a specific contractor, make sure everything is spelled out in the contract and you're on your way.<P>
<P>
For more information, read <A HREF = "http://www.nahb.com/choose.html">How to Choose a Remodeler Who's on the Level</A> at the National Association of Home Builders' Web site.  <P>

<LI><B>Consumer electricity bills are likely to go down</B> as a result of new rules announced this week by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, says analyst Daniele Seitz of UBS Securities.  Technically, the rule change only applies to large industrial buyers of energy, breaking up some of the monopolistic practices practiced by regional utilities.  But the change will filter down and lead to lower rates for small consumers, also, Seitz says.  It should also lead to a leveling of electricity rates nationwide.  "When there's competition between utilities, you won't be able to charge 10 cents [per kilowatt-hour] in New York and five cents in Alabama," she says.   <P>
<P>
<LI><B>Chat while you surf the World Wide Web </B>with free software making its debut this week from two subsidiaries of America Online.  Still in its beta version, the software allows users to view a Web site, such as this one, on the top half of their screens and 'talk' about it with other users on the bottom.  <A HREF = "http://gnn.com/gnn/vplaces/index.html">Virtual Places</A> also provides a list of Web sites where people are currently talking and allows users to see if another user is currently online.  Initially, the software is available only for Windows-equipped computers using a Netscape browser.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Repetitious work is the most serious safety and health problem in the workplace,</B> according to a new study by the AFL-CIO.  Released Friday to mark the 25th anniversary of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the report says the nature of workplace hazards have changed dramatically.  It cites falls, accidents with machinery, noise and exposure to carcinogens as the primary workplace hazards in the early 1970s.  Today, on the other hand, redundant work leading to injuries such as carpal-tunnel syndrome is the primary concern.  The study also identified workplace violence as an increasing problem for workers.<P>

<H3> Why you're feeling the pinch at the pump </H3>
The average price of a gallon of gasoline rose to $1.36 last Friday — up a nickel per gallon from two weeks ago and 14 cents higher than it was last April.  In response, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary and Congressman Edward Markey called for an investigation into whether the increases were the result of "collusion, price-fixing or deliberate efforts to limit supply" by the industry.  <P>
<P>
But Cheryl J. Trench of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation denies there is anything sneaky going on.  She says the most important factor in the price runup is that supplies of oil and gas are at near-historic lows.  Like those in other industries, oil companies have deliberately cut back on excess supply over the past decade; it's cheaper to manufacture and quickly sell a product than it is to store it for long periods of time.  Add to that a surprisingly cold (and late) winter in the U.S. and the absence of Iraqi oil on the international market, and you end up with a very low supply.<P>
<P>
That comes as we head into the heaviest driving season of the year.  Further exacerbating the situation, Trench says, is the fact that Americans are driving less-fuel-efficient vehicles and driving them faster than they have in years.  "None of these things is the be-all and end-all," she says, "but put them together and you have increasing demand and decreasing supply — basic economics working against the consumer."<P>

<H3> In brief </H3>
<LI><B>Ignore the first-quarter earnings reports</B> advises economist Robert Stonebreaker of Indiana University of Pennsylvania today.  Much is made of each company's quarterly financial results on Wall Street, and stock prices often react accordingly.  A more measured, long-term view would better benefit investors, Stonebreaker suggests.  "Investments should be based on the long-term probability of earnings, not short-term results," he says.  In other words, do your investing homework and ignore the noise surrounding short-term fluctuations.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Fresh vegetables will get more expensive this year, </B>although the price increase won't match last year's 12% jump.  So says the Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service, which released its 1996 forecast Monday.  The report highlights potatoes, tomatoes, squash, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts and okra as likely candidates for upward price trends.  Lettuce, corn, peas, broccoli and carrots, on the other hand, should remain at or below current prices for the foreseeable future.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>The AARP will license its name to health maintenance organizations</B> by the end of the year, a spokeswoman confirmed Monday following published reports to that effect.  The 33-million member organization plans to allow one or more HMOs to use its name in each region of the country, possibly as early as June.  Minimum standards of price, financial stability and member satisfaction will be required of participating health plans.  A consulting firm is currently screening hundreds of HMOs to determine which ones measure up.  The insurance business is not new for the AARP: It already receives $150 million in royalties each year for endorsing selected auto, homeowners and supplemental Medicare policies.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Netscape today unveiled Navigator 3.0,</B> the latest version of its Internet browser.  Replacing the three-month-old Navigator 2.0, the new browser will allow people to collaborate over the Internet on a single document or spreadsheet and 'talk' to each other in real time while they do it.  In addition, the new release allows Web sites to offer three-dimensional graphics, provides better sound quality and includes a more sophisticated digital identification technology.  Netscape says Navigator 3.0 will be available in about a month and should carry a price tag of $49, although several online services are likely to provide it to subscribers at no extra charge.  If you can't wait that long, a <A HREF = "http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_3.0/index. html">beta version</A> is available from the Netscape Web site. <P>

<H3> Don't expect relief at the gas station in the weeks ahead </H3>
Inflation at the gas pump has politicians up in arms, but it will take more than podium pounding in Washington to bring prices down.  Oil and gas companies made poor planning decisions last year and it will likely be at least midsummer before you see signs of price reductions.  In the meantime, though, take heart:  The worst of the increases should be behind you.<BR>
<BR>
As we highlighted <A HREF = "dn0429.html">yesterday</A>, oil companies have kept ever-shrinking stocks of crude oil on hand in recent years.  A botched attempt to time the reintroduction of Iraqi oil on the international market this spring accents just how vulnerable that strategy leaves them.  Predicting that the United Nations would approve the sale of $2 billion worth of Iraqi oil, which would reduce the price of oil $3 to $4 per barrel, the oil companies chose not to restock their supplies late last year.  "Why buy when the price is high today, if you think it will go down tomorrow," asks Cheryl J. Trench of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.  <BR>
<BR>
But when negotiations between Iraq and the UN went sour in late April, the oil companies found themselves in the unenviable position of restocking their dwindling supplies at a time when oil prices were higher than they'd been in years.  Trench predicts that prices will probably remain flat until the supply situation is stabilized this summer, then should trend downward into fall.  <BR>
<BR>
Ed Rothschild of the consumer lobbying group Citizen Action thinks that assessment may be overly optimistic.  He predicts that prices will continue increasing in the near future before they go down, and he's not happy about it.  "The oil companies wanted to lower costs, but they ended up cutting out the cushion for consumers," Rothschild says.  "That has led directly to increased prices — basic economics the companies want you to swallow, working against the little guy and for the big company."<BR>

<H3> Beware: That used car could be a lemon </H3>
Some used-car buyers may end up driving home "lemons" without any warning, the Federal Trade Commission said Monday.  The FTC says some cars the automakers are forced to repurchase under state lemon laws are fixed and resold as used cars — but not all of them are identified as one-time lemons.  Allegedly, some dealers even move them to different states to take advantage of more lenient laws, a practice known as "lemon laundering."<BR>
<BR>
State lemon laws give consumers the right to a replacement vehicle or a refund if their new car cannot be repaired after a certain number of attempts within a given timeframe (the specifics depend on the state).  Such laws are on the books in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.<BR>
<BR>
The FTC is asking consumers to <A HREF = "http://www.ftc.gov/opa/9604/lemon-bu.htm">forward their comments</A> on this issue to the agency between now and June 28.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>A minimum wage increase appears likely</B> this year, according to this week's <I>Kiplinger Washington Letter</I>.  The situation has changed dramatically since <A HREF = "dn0415.html#min">April 15</A>, when we gave such a change "little or no chance of passing" in <I>News of the Day</I>.  At the time, Republicans were firmly against any proposal to raise the minimum wage from $4.25 per hour.  Over the past two weeks, though, President Clinton has taken advantage of the GOP's position to batter Congress on the issue in a fit of election-year posturing.  To mute such criticism before the November elections, Republicans began jumping ship to support some form of increase.  True to partisan form, expect both sides to claim victory regardless of what the increase ultimately looks like.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Consumer confidence soared to its highest level since May of 1990 </B>during the past four weeks, the Conference Board announced Tuesday.  The New York-based business research group said its Consumer Confidence Index rose to 105.3 in April, well above March's reading of 98.4.  Conference Board vice president Edgar Fiedler attributed the increase to workers feeling less fearful about losing their jobs.  Well-publicized corporate layoffs last winter, including AT&T's plan to eliminate 40,000 positions, contributed to a nationwide sense of job insecurity that now seems to be receding.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Microsoft appears to have drawn a bead on category leader Macintosh in the education market,</B> based on its latest pricing promotion for schools.  Starting Wednesday, Microsoft is offering its <I>Windows 95</I> operating system to K-12 schools, colleges and universities for $19.95 per copy, plus shipping and handling — about $60 less than its retail price.  Qualified schools have to buy a minimum of five copies to qualify for the discount.  You can order the software or get more information about the offer on the company's <A HREF = "http://www.microsoft.com/services/education/win95/promo.htm">Web site</A>.  Microsoft says the offer will be honored "while supplies last or until October 31."  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Small-cap stocks continued to lead the market Tuesday, </B>guiding the Nasdaq Composite Index slightly higher to its ninth-consecutive record.  Analysts say investors are searching for companies that can outperform the economy.  Such investments are generally found among small- and medium-sized firms in a moderately growing economy such as this one.<BR>

<H3> If professional sports aren't an option, college remains a worthwhile investment </H3>
Kobe Bryant decided this week to "bypass college" for a chance at stardom (and big money) in the National Basketball Association.  More power to Bryant and the few others who will make a successful transition to professional athletics — the 17-year-old from Ardmore, Penn. will be a millionaire before he can legally vote.  Most of us, though, aren't six-and-a-half feet tall, can't score 30 points per game and are certainly not ready to square off against Michael Jordan any time soon.  For us, college still makes a lot of dollars and sense.  <BR>
<BR>
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average college graduate earned $38,844 in 1995 — $16,380 more than the average worker with only a high school diploma.  At that pace, it takes a college grad five and a half years to make up the money she gave up during her four years of school.  But the averages don't tell the whole story.  Because salaries compound over time, Census Bureau surveys indicate that the college alumna is likely to earn at least $600,000 more over the course of her lifetime than will someone who stopped after high school.<BR>
<BR>
A professional graduate degree boosts that average salary to $52,676 per year, $30,212 more than the high school average, or $2.2 million more over the course of a lifetime.  That may not be enough to make Kobe Bryant hit the books, but it's a significant lump of change for most of us.<BR>

<LI><B>Series EE U.S. savings bonds issued over the next six months will earn a 4.36% interest rate </B>for the first five years, the Treasury Department announced Wednesday.  That's down from the 5.25% introductory rate on bonds purchased in the last six months.  The short-term rate is 85% of the average of six-month Treasury security yields for February through April of this year.  The Treasury Department will change the rates again on November 1 to reflect market conditions.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of new construction projects and a survey of manufacturers point to continued economic strength </B>in the year ahead.  Both were released Wednesday, from the Commerce Department and the National Association of Purchasing Management, respectively.  The government statistics show that March spending on new construction projects increased at the fastest rate over month-earlier numbers in four years.  The rebound was much stronger than economists had anticipated and included a 2.7% increase in privately-funded projects and a 4.1% jump in government-funded construction.  Purchasing executives surveyed for NAPM's index expressed "guarded optimism" about the economy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>An online charity auction to benefit the National Education Technology Initiative starts today,</B> with the proceeds (expected to be between $3 million and $4 million) earmarked for school computers and software nationwide.  Among the items up for bid:  A glove worn by Miss Piggy; autographed copies of the Berenstain Bears children's books; and a year's supply of Ben and Jerry's ice cream.  Cyberspace bidders can submit their offers on the <A HREF = "http://www.kindernet.com">KidBid '96 Web site</A> between now and May 16.  The highest bidder for each item will be e-mailed after May 19; payment arrangements will be made at that time.

<BR>
<H3> Workers need help in changing economy, academics and executives say </H3>
Responding to anxiety over American jobs, a group of university presidents and company executives today outlined long-term strategies to help workers and businesses adjust to the worldwide shift from an industrial economy to an information-based one.  The Committee for Economic Development said many have prospered because of the shift, but the new environment also "has meant changes in job opportunities, uncertainty and difficult adjustments for many workers and their families."<BR>
<BR>
The CDE report came to many of the same conclusions as an <A HREF = "dn0423.html">April 23 release</A> by the White House Council of Economic Advisers.  "In general, the new economy bodes well for those American workers who have education beyond high school and who are prepared for careers in managerial, professional and technical occupations," today's report said.  "But the American economy is offering fewer and fewer high-paying jobs and grim long-term prospects for the less skilled."<BR>
<BR>
In response, the report called for both government and industry to initiate new policies to ease the impact of change on workers:<UL>

<LI>Employers should offer "lifetime employability" to their employees rather than "lifetime employment," through more investment in skill training.  This would make it easier to change jobs mid-career.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Government should encourage increased national savings and investment rates and expand open markets both domestically and abroad.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Business and government should work together to institute educational reform to make sure those from less-affluent schools aren't left behind.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The public and private sectors should make policy changes in unemployment, retirement and health benefits to better serve a more flexible, mobile work force.</UL><BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<BR>
<LI><B>The gross domestic product went up at a surprisingly steep rate during the first three months of the year, </B>the Commerce Department announced Thursday.  Led by stronger than expected consumer spending and business investment, the GDP expanded at a 2.8% annualized rate, up from a meager 0.5% clip during the final three months of 1995.  Economists had projected only a 1.8% annualized increase in the first-quarter GDP, which measures the value of all goods and services produced in the U.S. during that period.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>First-time applications for state unemployment benefits fell last week </B>to the lowest level in three months, the Labor Department reported Thursday.  The department said there were 348,000 new applicants in the week ending April 26, down from 372,000 the previous week.  The four-week average, generally considered to be more accurate because it smoothes out weekly volatility, fell to 357,250, its lowest reading since the week ending October 14.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Money flowed into initial public offerings at a record clip in April,</B> eclipsing the previous monthly high set in June 1993.  According to Securities Data Co., 63 companies first sold shares to the public last month for $6.6 billion — $1.3 billion more than the previous high.  That figure brings the 1996 total to approximately $14.5 billion.  Ninety-six IPOs, worth roughly $4.5 billion, are registered to begin trading in May.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Housing was more affordable than it's been in two years during the first quarter,</B> according to the National Association of Realtors.  The NAR's housing affordability index rose to 131.6 in the first three months of 1996 as lower mortgage rates boosted the purchasing power of most home buyers.  NAR Chief Economist John Tucillo said housing affordability is expected to be stable for the rest of the year with mortgage rates dropping again after their recent surge.  "Although mortgage rates rose during the latter end of the first quarter, they likely will edge downward in the months ahead," he said.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of newspaper help-wanted ads fell in every region of the country except the South Atlantic in March, </B>although not by much.  The Conference Board's Help-Wanted Advertising Index is a barometer of labor demand, and the region from Florida to North Carolina seems to be doing especially well.  Other locales aren't doing too badly either.  In fact, the South Atlantic's improvement was enough to overcome small declines elsewhere and boost the nationwide index by three points over February's count, to 85, the same level it was at a year ago.  New-job creation is relatively stable across the board because employers are optimistic yet still cautious about hiring too many people, says Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein.  They don't want to be forced into layoffs down the road.<BR>

<H3>Why good news on Main Street can be bad news for Wall Street </H3>
Thursday, the stock market tanked on news that the economy was surprisingly strong in the first quarter.  Friday morning, it rebounded immediately after a government report of puny job growth over the past four weeks.  What's going on here?  Shouldn't stocks do well when the economy gets a shot in the arm?  Over the long term, yes, economists say — but it often doesn't play out that way over shorter periods of time.<BR>
<BR>
The apparent contradiction stems from the fact that stocks compete with bonds and certificates of deposit for your investment dollars, says Syracuse University finance professor Ravi Shukla.  Any time interest rates go up, fixed-income investments like bonds and CDs become more attractive, which can reduce the demand for stocks and lead to lower market prices.  Better than expected economic news, such as Thursday's, tells investors that the Federal Reserve Board may have to raise interest rates to keep the economy from growing too quickly — threatening the future value of stocks and sending their prices down.  Friday's weak jobs picture evidently placated fears of a rate hike and the markets returned to normal.<BR>
<BR>
"Simply put, the marketplace fears the intervention of government," says Tony Sanders, who manages Ohio State University's $10 million equity portfolio.  "Any sign that the economy is growing too fast leads to fear that the Fed will apply the brakes, which can hurt stockholders."<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>The employment picture was mixed in April,</B> the Labor Department said Friday.  Overall, the unemployment rate dipped to its lowest level in 14 months at 5.4%, down from 5.6% in March.  But new-job creation came to a virtual standstill as non-farm payrolls rose by only 2,000 positions, down from 178,000 in March and 631,000 in February.  During the month, unemployment decreased among every demographic group the Labor Department tracks except for black teenagers.  Among black teens, the unemployment rate increased from 28.4% to 31.3%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Raiding a rival for employees will cost PaineWebber $2.5 million, </B>New York Stock Exchange arbritators ruled Friday.  The decision requires PaineWebber to pay Prudential Securities $1 million in compensatory damages and $1.5 million in punitive damages for allegedly luring four brokers and three sales assistants from Prudential's Gainesville, Florida office in 1993.  Left with a single broker, Prudential said it was forced to sell its Gainesville office.  So-called "raids" occur when a firm convinces employees of a rival to leave en masse along with their clients, crippling the abandoned firm.  A PaineWebber spokeswoman said that the firm may appeal the ruling.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Americans saved less and spent more in March, </B>the Commerce Department reported Friday.  Overcoming an 18-day strike at General Motors that trimmed more than $9 billion from workers' paychecks, consumer spending rose 0.6% in March — half the February increase.  Consumer spending is closely watched as a gauge of economic health since it accounts for two-thirds of the nation's buying and selling.  At the same time, the Commerce Department said consumer savings rates fell to 4.5% of disposable income, down from 4.7% in February and 5.2% in January.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>London stocks closed lower Friday after Conservatives were beaten in local elections </B>a day before.  The ruling Conservative and Unionist Party received just 27% of the vote in the final town hall elections before Prime Minister John Major is forced to announce nationwide elections, some time between now and April 1997.  The more liberal Labor Party filled the void Thursday, picking up 43% of the vote for its second consecutive strong showing in local races.  The London Stock Exchange reacted negatively to the news, if not strongly.  The Financial Times-Stock index closed down 24.8 points at 3,751.6 and the Financial Times 30-share index finished 6.2 points lower at 2,803.5.<BR>

<H3> Computer companies can't hold all the cards anymore
</H3>
Apple Computer and IBM went their separate ways long ago in the fight for the hearts and minds of personal computer users.  While Big Blue began allowing companies to make IBM "clones" more than a decade ago, Apple jealously guarded its Macintosh operating system.  Faced with mounting losses, however, Apple threw in the towel Monday and agreed to allow other companies to build Mac clones.  <BR>
<BR>
That Apple's proprietary tactics failed should come as no surprise, says University of Maryland information systems specialist Brad Wheeler.  Today's computer users expect to handle different computers without the hassle of learning new systems, Wheeler says, and count on companies to work together to bring the latest innovations to market.  As sales went south in recent years, Apple had difficulty getting software developers to write inventive programs for the Mac — and hardware changes were left up to Apple alone.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, rival manufacturers flooded the market with computers based on Microsoft's Windows operating system, attracting innovative hardware and software manufacturers with their sheer numbers.  Apple's share of the worldwide PC market slipped to 5.8% during the first three months of 1996, down from 7.7% in the first quarter a year ago.  As a result, Apple lost more than $700 million in the quarter.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>Job seekers are looking for less stress in the workplace</B> in addition to a healthy salary these days.  More than one-third of the nation's executives say that during job interviews, applicants want to know more about the environment they'll work in than about how much they'll be paid.  "Employees are taking a harder look at how they spend their time, and whether there is a comfortable fit with a prospective employer," says Max Messmer, chief executive of Robert Half International.  Messmer says many companies are addressing employees' concerns with casual dress codes, increased skill training and more family-friendly benefit programs.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Beef prices will be lower for your Memorial Day barbecue</B> thanks to <A HREF = "dn0425.html">soaring grain prices</A>.  Rather than pay increased prices for grain to feed their cattle, farmers nationwide are slaughtering their herds in higher-than-usual numbers.  That will lead to lower beef prices over the next several months as the glut of meat hits the market.  But consumers will pay the price in the fall as farmers charge more so they can replenish their herds.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The <A HREF = "dn0430.html">supply and demand inequity</A> that has led to expensive gasoline should moderate over the next several months, </B>Exxon chairman Lee Raymond told the Economic Club of Detroit on Monday.  Raymond said the prices should improve for American drivers this summer, barring any unforeseen events that affect the supply of crude oil.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Small companies paid a record $10.2 billion for the rights to sell wireless phone service </B>at a Federal Communications Commission auction that ended Monday.  The new digital <A HREF = "/magazine/may96/temay96.html">personal communications service</A> (PCS) licensees will compete directly with current cellular providers, which is likely to force down prices.  By the end of the year, PCS systems are expected to be up and running in many parts of the country, with the various systems interconnected just as cellular systems are today.  Further down the road, the technology should also allow consumers to access several different communications services — including phone, paging, fax and the Internet — through a single hand-held device.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A pair of companies will recall more than 22,000 child safety seats,</B> the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced Monday.  The statement cited Century SmartMove Model 4750 convertible seats and Evenflow Trooper Adjustable Shield seats, models 219140, 219164, 219180, 219186 and 2119188.  A mismatch of locking components in the SmartMove seats could cause the buckle to release during a crash, according to NHTSA.  Evenflow said it would provide a revised instruction pamphlet to owners of its seats, since it accidentally switched the instructions for toddler and infant use.  Owners of affected models can contact Century at 800-583-4093 or Evenflow at 800-837-4002.<BR>

<H3> Consumer groups ready to battle phone companies over rate increase</H3>
Your local phone bill could soon increase by as much as $10.80 per month if the phone companies get their way.  The seven regional Baby Bells, along with the four major long-distance companies and United States Telephone Association, recently asked the Federal Communications Commission for permission to raise the fees for basic local service under provisions of the 1996 Telecommunications Act.  <BR>
<BR>
The price increase is certainly not a done deal, though.  Three consumer groups wasted no time registering their displeasure with the plan, filing a response with the FCC on Tuesday that calls the increase "unnecessary as a matter of economics and unjustified as a matter of public policy."  Submitted by the American Association of Retired Persons, Consumer Federation of America and Consumers Union, the filing asks FCC Chairman Reed Hundt to reject the proposal.   <BR>
<BR>
The phone companies contend that fees for non-basic services, such as caller identification or call waiting, will go down to offset the increase in basic service.  Long-distance rates are also projected (by the companies) to go down, balancing out the overall cost to consumers.<BR>
<BR>
But the consumer coalition isn't buying it.  "If you're part of the 50% to 60% of the public that doesn't subscribe to extra services or use much long distance, then you just get stuck with the extra $10 a month," says CFA's Bradley Stillman.  "And that's only if you can guarantee that costs for the other things will come down, which nobody can.  We fear that competition is just not vigorous enough at this point to bring down prices for much of anything."<BR>
<BR>
The FCC is expected to respond to the request this summer.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>Federal Trade Commission officials have reached "a general consensus" to try to block or modify the proposed Time Warner/Turner Broadcasting merger, </B>The Washington Post reported Tuesday.  Citing anonymous sources, the newspaper said FTC representatives have been meeting with the companies' lawyers for two weeks in an attempt to settle their differences.  Consumer groups and competitors claim the merger would limit competition and give the merged company too much control over cable-television content.  Time Warner owns HBO, while Turner owns CNN, TBS, TNT and Headline News.  The merger also faces regulatory approval by the Federal Communications Commission.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>One-third of job applicants tested last year lacked basic skills </B>necessary to perform the jobs they sought.  In the American Management Association's most recent annual survey, 33.1% of applicants tested below what companies consider acceptable levels of "functional workplace literacy, i.e. the ability to read instructions, write reports and/or do arithmetic at a level adequate to perform common workplace tasks."  That was down from 38.5% in 1994 and the lowest since 1990, when 26.3% lacked such basic skills.  The AMA said one-fourth of firms that test applicants reported deficiency rates of 50% or more, with the percentage highest among manufacturers and lowest among wholesalers and retailers.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Consumers took on 7.3% more debt on an annualized basis in March,</B> the smallest gain in six months.  The Federal Reserve Board said Tuesday that consumer debt increased by $6.4 billion in the month, down from $12.2 billion in February.  The uptick raised the level of total consumer debt to $1.054 trillion, 13% higher than it was in March a year ago.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Cybercrime is on the increase, </B>according to a new survey released by the FBI.  Nearly half of the corporations, financial institutions, government agencies and universities questioned cited some form of unauthorized intrusion into their computer systems in the past year.  While most trespassing was traced to current employees or students, slightly more than one-third was attributed to outside hackers.  Cybercrime doesn't pose much of a threat to individuals using home computers, the FBI says, but it could suffocate online commerce by making individuals feel less secure about doing business on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Most homeowners don't have to worry about fire insurance, </B>says spokesman Jerry Parsons at State Farm Insurance.  The issue took on added significance this week for residents of Taos, New Mexico, as a forest fire burned 25 homes and threatened hundreds more.  Almost all homeowners insurance policies cover accidental fire damage, Parsons says; the only exceptions are in "a very few areas of the country, especially in California," where brushfires are routine.  Parsons says residents of such fire-prone areas can generally get an extra rider for fire coverage through their insurance company or a local association.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Ford announced its second recall in as many weeks  </B>on Monday, citing rear seat belt problems in the 1995 Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis models.  The company said some rear belt fasteners may not meet federal strength requirements, and should be changed.  The recall involves more than 47,000 vehicles in the U.S. and Canada.  Ford said dealers will replace the fasteners free of charge.  On April 25, Ford announced a <A HREF = "dn0425.html#ford">recall of 8.7 million vehicles</A> built between 1988 and early 1993 because of faulty ignition switches.<BR>

<H3>Moderate economic growth quiets inflation hawks </H3>
Stockholders can breathe easier thanks to a government report released today that points to continued low inflation.  A new survey of the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks reveals modest economic growth nationwide, with the possible exception of New York.  The New York bank pointed to weakening retail sales over the past two months, but the region's other economic indicators were solid.  The other banks cited manufacturing strength, moderate job growth, low inflationary pressures and flat-to-rising retail sales as positive signs.
<BR>
<BR>While the price of gasoline and some food products has been rising in recent weeks, Wednesday's report should quiet longer-term inflationary fears and make it more likely that the Federal Open Market Committee won't raise interest rates this summer.  That should come as welcome news to stockholders, who feared the Fed might raise rates at its May 21 meeting — increasing the yield for fixed-income investments and reducing the demand for stocks.  
<BR>
<BR>Anticipating the tame inflation outlook, <I>The Kiplinger Washington Letter</I> predicted on April 26 that the Fed will remain on the sidelines for the near future, "probably through the November elections."
<BR>
<HR>
<H3> Big Three online services in the news </H3>
For various reasons, each of the three largest online-service providers found itself in the headlines Wednesday:
<BR>
<LI><BR>America Online made official its foray into Japan, confirming media reports that appeared over the weekend.  AOL, the largest online provider, announced a partnership with brokerage house Mitsui & Co. and newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun.  The combined venture, known as AOL Japan K.K., will offer multilingual e-mail, Internet access, financial news, marketing and other services to Japanese users.
<BR>
<LI><BR>The FBI denied that it is investigating CompuServe for violating new federal decency laws.  Patrick Trueman, director of government affairs for the Christian group American Family Association, filed a complaint alleging that CompuServe's MacGlamour Forum violates the Communications Decency Act by making adult-oriented material accessible to children; some newspaper reports said the FBI had picked up the investigation from the Justice Department.
<BR>
<LI><BR>A group of employees are in negotiations to buy Prodigy, the third-largest online service, from IBM and Sears Roebuck.  The current co-owners have invested between $1 billion and $2 billion in the venture since 1982, but some analysts put its current worth at only about $100 million.  Sources say a deal is imminent
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>The Dow Jones Industrial Average spent time below 5,400 for the first time three months </B>Wednesday, rallying late to gain 1% in the session.  The blue-chip index began falling last Thursday, when the government released a report that said the economy grew more quickly than expected in the first quarter.  It recovered this afternoon following a more positive study that was released by the Federal Reserve system.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Nearly 319,000 people declared personal bankruptcy in the first four months of the year, </B>MasterCard International says in a newly released study.  Between January 1 and April 26, 318,893 people filed for bankruptcy — a 27% increase over the same period a year ago.  That's the highest four-month percentage gain in a decade and the largest four-month total ever.  In addition, for the four-week period ending April 26, bankruptcy filings were 30% higher than in April 1995.  Economists attribute the increase to high levels of consumer debt and a new, more lenient, U.S. Bankruptcy Code.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Discounted airfares are available on the Web </B>beginning Wednesday, as <A HREF = "http://www2.amrcorp.com/cgi-bin/aans">American Airlines</A> offers special "Net SAAver" rates to visitors of its site.  American says it will sell tickets for 20 routes at prices that are as much as 70% below the lowest fares you would be quoted by a travel agent.  The routes and fares will change each Wednesday; you can sign up for weekly e-mail notification of the details on American's Web site.  In a related note, <A HREF = "http://www.cathay-usa.com/auction.html">Cathay Pacific Airways</A> is accepting e-mail registration on its site for an auction of round-trip tickets between Hong Kong and either Los Angeles or New York.  The airline says bids will be accepted between May 15 and July 31, and that tickets must be used in 1997.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Two recalls announced Wednesday affect 114,000 cars in the U.S.  </B>Nissan Motor Co. said it is recalling Infiniti G20 and J30 models produced between July 1992 and March 1994.  Some of the sedans evidently have a defective engine part designed to prevent radio noise or a faulty seat-belt-tightening device.  General Motors Corp. announced it is recalling 1996 Buick Regal and Chevrolet Lumina sedans with a potential brake defect.   Dealers will inspect the cars to look for the problem and perform any needed repairs free of charge, GM said.

<H3> Government's oil sale may have unintended consequences </H3>
An Energy Department official this week claimed President Clinton's April 29 announcement that the government would sell $227 million in oil from its reserves was a bipartisan effort to reduce the deficit.  A week ago, the administration was playing it up as an election-year effort by Clinton to curb the recent runup in gasoline prices.  Either way, say many economists, the sale may have inadvertently and permanently thrown the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserves (SPR) into the political arena.<BR>
<BR>
Congress created the SPR in 1975 so that foreign oil-producing nations wouldn't be able to use their oil shipments to the U.S. as leverage in international disputes.  At the outset of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, for example, some oil was released from the SPR to offset the loss of Iraqi oil from the international market.  In two decades, though, it was never used to balance the budget or to manipulate gasoline prices.  Therein lies the danger of the government's recent sale, say economists.<BR>
<BR>
"What this has done is open the door for politicians to decide when the gasoline price is inappropriate, which they're not elected or appointed for and which they're generally not trained for," says Bernard Munk, management professor at the Wharton School at University of Pennsylvania and former chairman of Penndel Energy Corp.  "Now that the precedent has been set, it will be easy for future politicians to do the same thing — especially if they're jockeying for position in an election year."<BR>
<BR>
The only way out, says Munk, is for government to determine whether or not the SPR is still needed in the post-Cold War era and, if so, in what format.  Anything, he says, is preferable to allowing the reserves to become a political pawn that artificially manipulates the market.  But such a debate is not likely to happen this year, he concedes.  "Unfortunately, political campaigns are not good times to raise complicated, long-term issues."<BR>

<H3> Payday lenders find booming business </H3>
A growing number of Americans are turning to so-called payday lenders for small, short-term loans to get them from paycheck to paycheck.  For a flat fee, borrowers can write a post-dated check, get cash immediately and deposit the money in their account in time for the check to be covered by the later date.  There's just one catch:  interest rates as high as 600% on an annual basis.<BR>
<BR>
The number of check-cashing outlets, where such operations are based, has risen from slightly more than 2,000 a decade ago to more than 5,000 today.  Economists say it's a result, in part, of a drop in the "financial literacy" of many Americans.  They say users of payday lenders either don't realize, or don't care, how much they're paying for the short-term loans.<BR>
<BR>
One outlet owner estimates that most of his customers earn between $18,000 and $30,000 per year and come to him only after they've exhausted all other credit options.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>Retail sales were up slightly in April, </B>investment firm Salomon Brothers announced Thursday.  The company's retail index rose 1.3% in the month, following a 5.4% uptick in March.  Salomon Brothers said the discrepancy between the months is somewhat misleading because of a quirk of the calendar; many shoppers made their Easter purchases in late March this year because the holiday was so early in April.  In 1995, when Easter was later in the month, the index rose 7%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages went up one-quarter of a percentage point this week </B>according to a survey released by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Thursday.  The average 30-year mortgage last week was 8.24%, its highest level since May 4, 1995.  Fifteen-year mortgages averaged 7.75%, also up 0.25% from the previous week.  One-year adjustable-rate mortgages were also higher, averaging 5.80% after a 5.76% rate the week before.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Money continued pouring into stock funds in April while fixed-income funds remained flat,</B> the Investment Company Institute announced late Wednesday.  The mutual fund industry's trade group said that new money invested in long-term funds rose to an estimated $23 billion, up from $22.3 billion in March.  Almost all of the gains were accounted for by stock funds, ICI says, as new investment dollars evenly matched redemptions in bond and income funds.  Global and international funds registered the largest gains, with domestic equity funds up only slightly.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The four-week average number of applications for first-time jobless benefits is at an eight-month low</B> according to Labor Department statistics released Thursday.  An average of 353,750 people filed for benefits each of the four weeks through last Friday, the lowest number since the period ending September 2.  Also Thursday, the Labor Department announced that last week's initial jobless claims figure was the lowest since mid January, when blizzard conditions along the Eastern Seaboard kept many out-of-work people from visiting unemployment offices.  The largest declines were reported by North Carolina, New York, California, South Carolina and Massachusetts.  Oregon was the only state reporting a significant increase, with 1,394 applications more than the previous week.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Apple Computer notified its dealers of technical problems with some laptop and desktop models,</B> the <A HREF = "http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/chronicle/article.cgi?BU23856.DTL:/chronicle/archive/1996/05/09"><I>San Francisco Chronicle</I></A> reported Thursday.  The article said Apple plans to recall several thousand computers nationwide, including PowerBook 190 and 5300 models and some Power Mac and Performa models.  Cracks in the plastic casing of some computers allegedly cause system crashes, sudden changes in screen color and other problems.  Customers can call 800-767-2775 to find out whether their machine is part of the recall.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Nasdaq named Alfred Berkeley, III, as its new president Thursday. </B> Berkeley's appointment to the newly created position is an important step in separating the 25-year-old stock market from its parent company, the National Association of Securities Dealers.  A commission headed by former Senator Warren Rudman issued a report last fall calling for such a move to stabilize the turbulent stock market following allegations that some Nasdaq dealers had engaged in price fixing.  Both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department are still investigating the charges.  Berkeley, managing director at Baltimore investment banking firm Alex. Brown & Sons, will join Nasdaq in June.<BR>

<H3>Working women avoid "mommy track" in the '90s </H3>
Conventional wisdom, if there is such a thing, holds that the 28 million American women who work and raise children often find themselves on the so-called "mommy track" — with fewer opportunities for career advancement than their childless counterparts.  New findings by Interep Research, however, cast doubt on that theory.  Surveys the New York City researchers conducted find little relationship between children and a woman's income.<BR>
<BR>
Far more telling, the analysis showed, was whether a woman is married.  Married working women, with or without children, fared better in Interep's personal income surveys than did their single counterparts.  Among married working mothers, for example, 20% had individual incomes higher than $30,000 per year.  That compares to 23% for married non-mothers and 13% for single mothers.  <BR>
<BR>
The study cited improvements in child-care as a probable reason for the decline of the mommy track.  Some companies now offer in-house daycare facilities, for example.  Flexible hours, telecommuting and job-sharing programs also make it easier for a mother — or a father — in the '90s to both work and raise children.  The 1992 Family Leave Act also mandates that if a person needs a temporary leave of absence because of a family situation, that individual can't be penalized at work.<BR>
<BR>
All this is not to say that working mothers don't still have burdens in the home:  80% of working mothers Interep surveyed said they were "primarily responsible" for the family's shopping.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Childless couples turn to the Internet </H3>
Couples who despair they might never have a baby might find new hope on the Web.  Starting Mother's Day, a new site created by <A HREF = "http://www.surrogacy.com">The American Surrogacy Center</A> is available to offer current information from doctors, lawyers and other specialists in the field of surrogacy — when a woman other than the wife carries an embryo to term —  as a means of building families for infertile couples.<BR>
<BR>
"The rate of fertility problems among couples is rising dramatically due to increasingly advanced maternal age, as well as to physiological factors," says TASC President Joan Barnes.  Barnes says 20% of couples trying to conceive now encounter some fertility problems, and surrogacy holds promise for many of them. <BR>
<BR>
For more information about infertility procedures and the associated costs, see our recent article, <A HREF = "../magazine/may96/inferti.html">The Agonizing Price of Infertility</A>.<BR>

<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>Economists and business executives differed on their assessment of the economy this week </B>in a pair of unrelated surveys.  At the start of the Business Council's three-day annual retreat in Williamsburg, Va., the chief executives of the nation's 100 largest corporations released a poll forecasting slow economic and inflation growth through 1997.  The release pegged the economy to grow at a rate of 1% to 2% over the next 12 months.  A monthly survey of 50 leading economists, on the other hand, predicted 2.1% growth in 1996, coupled with slightly higher inflation than the business executives projected.  The economists are questioned monthly for the "Blue Chip" survey in <I>Eggert's Economic Indicators</I> newsletter. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Prices at the wholesale level rose an average of 0.4% in April,</B> the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced Friday in its monthly <A HREF = "ftp://stats.bls.gov/pub/news.release/ppi.txt">Producer Price Index</A> report.  Energy prices registered their biggest jump since December, increasing 2.8% in the month.  Gasoline led the pack with a 6.1% uptick.  Food prices helped balance out the energy sector, falling 0.3% in April; vegetable prices were down 15.5% and fruit prices 2.2% during the month.  The PPI measures prices before they reach the consumer.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>It will be easier to track publicly traded companies online</B> thanks to a new Securities and Exchange Commission edict announced this week.  Under the new rule, the 16,000 public companies must now file their financial statements on the SEC's computerized filing system, <A HREF = "http://www.sec.gov/edgarhp.htm">EDGAR</A>.  Larger companies have been required to submit their quarterly and annual reports via <A HREF = "http://www.sec.gov/edgarhp.htm">EDGAR</A> for three years; the new regulation makes the practice universal.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Farmers this year will harvest the smallest winter wheat crop since 1978, </B>the Agriculture Department projected Friday.  Based on field surveys, the department said 1.36 billion bushels will be cultivated this year, down 12% from a year ago.  A dry winter in the key growing states of Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska and Texas, as well as unseasonable temperature swings in Illinois, Indiana and Missouri, was blamed for the expected poor harvest.  Tight wheat supplies and record high prices will likely bump up cereal and bakery prices at supermarkets.  But overall food inflation won't climb significantly, since wheat represents only a small portion of total retail food costs.  Look for food prices to start climbing, though, if the fall corn harvest also tanks.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Procter & Gamble's attempt to eliminate coupons in an upstate New York <A HREF = "dn0419.html">market test</A> is under antitrust investigation</B> by the state's attorney general.  Dennis Vacco confirmed this week that his office is investigating Procter & Gamble and at least two regional supermarket chains for colluding to pressure P&G's competitors to also eliminate coupons from their promotional mix.  Procter & Gamble products include Cover Girl, Crest, Folgers, Pringles and Tide.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Demand for computer chips hit an all-time low in April, </B>the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association said Thursday.  The industry's book-to-bill ratio has been below the break-even level, or 1.0, since January — the longest dry spell since 1989.  During April, chip manufacturers reported a 0.78 book-to-bill ratio, the lowest level since the USSIA started keeping track of the data nine years ago.  That means they received $78 worth of orders for every $100 of chips they sold during the month, which is bad news for future sales.<BR>

<H3>World's dependence on oil likely to continue, energy expert says </H3>
Despite the best efforts of environmental and government groups, crude oil will remain the world's primary source of energy for decades, an international energy expert said on Sunday.  Hisham Khatib, a vice chairman of the World Energy Council, told executives at an oil and gas conference in the United Arab Emirates that fields in the Middle East, Russia and South America are likely to produce plenty of oil well into the next century.<BR>
<BR>
Analysts have been predicting since the 1970s that the world's oil supply would dwindle before long.  Without such a supply crisis to spur people into action, Khatib predicts, drivers and industrial users won't worry about finding a way to replace oil.  "For the next few decades, probably up to 2050, there will be no shortage of global resources of crude oil and natural gas," he said.  "[There is] no viable alternative to oil as the preferred fuel for transport."<BR>
<BR>
Khatib's predictions follow a few months of spiraling gas prices that reminded Americans all-too-well about their dependence.  The price increase does appear to be slowing somewhat, though.  The average price of gas across all grades was slightly lower than $1.38 over the past two weeks, up 1.62 cents over the two weeks prior.  That rate of increase is less than half the rate reported in March and April.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>Bank employees often ignore federal guidelines when selling mutual funds, </B>according to a survey released by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on Monday.  FDIC Chairman Ricki Helfer said that 28% of the time, undercover surveyors were not told that bank-sold mutual funds do not carry federal deposit insurance.  (Such insurance protects savings accounts and bank certificates of deposit.)  Prospective fund buyers were not led to a separate area of the bank to discuss non-insured investments, a federal requirement, 29% of the time.  Helfer said the FDIC may consider requiring bank employees who sell funds to take the securities industry's standardized tests in the future.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The stock of ValuJet Inc. finished sharply lower on Monday, </B>two days after a crash in the Florida Everglades that killed 104 passengers and five crew members.  The stock closed at $13.69, down more than 23% during the day's heavy trading.  At one point during the day, it traded as low as $11.75.  Saturday's accident marked the first fatal mishap since ValuJet was founded in 1993 as a low-priced, short-haul carrier.  White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said Monday that the President has asked the Transportation Department to widen the crash investigation "to scrub our system and make sure it remains the safest air transportation system in the world."<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Prodigy, the fourth-largest online service, changed hands over the weekend</B> when a group of its executives joined with privately held International Wireless Inc. to buy it from co-owners IBM and Sears Roebuck.  The takeover agreement calls for Prodigy managers to remain in place while International Wireless (IW) acquires ownership.  Prodigy chief executive Ed Bennett will also become a board member of IW.  Bennett hinted Sunday that Prodigy will set its sights on the Internet, rather than competing exclusively in the traditional online-service category.  America Online is currently the largest online service, with nearly 6 million subscribers.  CompuServe is second, with 4 million, and the Microsoft Network third, with just over 1 million.  At last count, Prodigy had slipped to fewer than 1 million subscribers.  The sale still faces regulatory approval.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>Many investors remain easy targets for fraud and abuse, survey finds </H3>
In a survey released today, two-thirds of participating investors characterized their financial knowledge as "fair" or "poor" — and they were right, says Barbara Roper of the Consumer Federation of America.  "The appalling lack of basic financial knowledge revealed by this survey calls into serious question the ability of most Americans to make sound, informed financial decisions," she said.<BR>
<BR>
The survey's results were indeed startling, though perhaps not as disastrous as Roper implies.  Fewer than one in five investors questioned was able to correctly answer seven out of eight questions on basic financial knowledge.  Half correctly answered four to six questions and one-third were right zero to three times.  (To see how well you stack up, take the <A HREF = "#survey">survey</A> yourself.)<BR>
<BR>
Mark Griffin of the non-profit group Investor Protection Trust, which sponsored the survey, says women and retirees fared worse on the questions than other groups.  "This data suggest that millions of investors, particularly women and older investors, are sitting ducks for investment fraud and abuse," Griffin says.<BR>
<BR>
Among the survey's findings:<ul>
<LI> Almost two-thirds of investors mistakenly believe that no-load mutual funds don't impose management and other fees.<BR>
<LI> 49% of investors don't understand that the purpose of diversification is to reduce risk, a fundamental concept of mutual fund investing.<BR>
<LI> Only 39% know that bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates.<BR></ul>
<BR>
On the bright side, investor awareness can be improved over time, Griffin says.  For example, the survey found that 70% of investors know that Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance does not extend to mutual funds sold by banks.  That's up from just 18% in a survey conducted two years ago.  "When investor education efforts are concentrated on a specific problem area, we can move the 'needle' in the right direction," he says.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>Prices were up and spending was down in April,</B> according to a pair of government reports released Tuesday.  The Consumer Price Index, released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, rose 0.4% during the month.  Energy costs jumped 3.2%, the biggest monthly increase in more than five years, and the price of gasoline was up 5.3%.  With the food and energy sectors removed from the mix, the so-called core rate of inflation was up 0.1%.  Meanwhile, total retail sales fell 0.3% in April, fueled by the largest drop in new-car sales in four-and-a-half years.  The news wasn't all bad, however:  Excluding the automotive segment, retail sales were actually up 0.4%.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>For the second year in a row, California's Bay Area is the least affordable place to live in America, </B>according to a new survey by Ernst & Young's Real Estate Group.  San Francisco and Oakland top this year's survey of housing costs, followed by Los Angeles, Honolulu and Miami.  While San Franciscans pay 50% of their income for housing, residents of cities at the other end of the spectrum — the most affordable urban areas — pay only about 20%.  Oklahoma City is the most affordable city, followed by Kansas City, Houston, Tulsa and St. Louis.  The annual survey compares the cost of buying a 2,000-square-foot, four-bedroom home or renting a two-bedroom luxury apartment to the average local income in the nation's major metropolitan areas.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>In a challenge to Microsoft, 10 banks have banded together to form their own online network, </B><I>The Washington Post</I> reported Tuesday.  Microsoft Chairman William Gates called banks "dinosaurs" in a speech last year, and promised to "bury them" with the company's online banking software.  NationsBank chief executive Hugh McColl announced his bank's consortium with BankAmerica, First Bank System, Royal Bank of Canada, KeyCorp., Banc One and three others he didn't name.  McColl said the group would announce within the next few weeks a joint venture with a "major technology partner" to build an electronic banking system that would be open to banks nationwide.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A popular Web site for kids may face an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission</B> for alleged deceptive marketing practices.  The watchdog group Center for Media Education this week asked the FTC to investigate <A HREF = "http://www.kidscom.com/adults.html">KidsCom</A>, which CME claims uses a fun-and-games format to collect marketing information on kids, which it then sells to companies.  SpectraCom Inc., the company that operates the site, denies the allegation.  It says the site consists almost entirely of educational and interactive activities that children enjoy.  There is one area where the site gathers information from children about their likes and dislikes, but SpectraCom says it is optional and encourages kids to get their parents' permission.  An FTC spokesperson says the agency will review the complaint before deciding whether to investigate.<BR>

<H3>Paper annual reports not on their way out just yet </H3>
The Internet may yet prove to be the death of old-fashioned corporate annual reports and the expensive, glossy paper they're printed on — but not right away.  A new study conducted by Yankelovich Partners and funded by paper manufacturer Potlatch Corp. finds that just 3% of investors have seen an annual report online, despite the large amount of financial information available on the Web.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, paper-based annual reports continue to be an investing staple, according to the study.  Among individual investors with more than $5,000 invested, 70% say they look at a company's annual report before investing.  Professionals are even more interested: 80% of mutual fund portfolio managers and 75% of analysts say they use annual reports when making investment decisions.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>Prospects are looking up for college grads on the search for jobs</B> according to a recent survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.  Corporate recruiting has strengthened due to a stable national economy and an increase in entry-level positions due to the downsizing of more experienced workers.<BR>
<BR>
The service sector remains the top provider of jobs for college graduates.  The association says computer software developers and consultants, as well as computer and business equipment manufacturer representatives, are hot right now.  Public Accountants, engineers and management consultants are also in high demand.<BR>
<BR>
Counselors say, this year more than ever, they're steering students toward smaller companies, since some of the best job growth in recent years has been with firms employing five or fewer workers.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>U.S. workforce satisfied with their jobs</B> despite dissatisfaction and uncertainty about the economy.  According to an Inc./Gallup workplace study, 90% of those surveyed are not worried about losing their job, 71% are satisfied with their job and 63% said they feel more secure about their jobs this year than last year.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>U.S. industrial production for April showed surprising strength</B> posting a 0.9% increase.  Industrial output for March, hampered by the GM strike, had fallen 0.5%.  In making this announcement the Federal Reserve said that if motor vehicles had been excluded from the figures production would have been unchanged.  Many analysts had expected an increase of only 0.5% for the month.<BR>
<BR><B>
<LI>The U.S. and China inched closer to a trade war today</B> as talks to resolve a commercial dispute protecting U.S. copyrights, patents and trademarks failed to reach an accord.  The U.S. has prepared a list of about $3 billion worth of imported goods from China, mostly clothing and electronics, from China which may face sanctions.  The dispute is over the illegal copying of movies, music, books and computer software by Chinese factories.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A House committee approved a bill to lighten the burden on mutual funds</B> by eliminating duplication between state and federal regulations.  Under the bill, mutual funds would be regulated by federal law rather than by individual states.<BR>

<H3>"Substantial spending power" to shift into South and West</H3>
Older Americans are moving and taking their money with them.  Armed with the country's highest incomes and largest accumulations of personal wealth, retirees will spark a migration of spending power out of the Northeast and North Central regions and into fast-growing states in the South and West over the next 15 years, according to a Conference Board study released Thursday.  States such as Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Oregon, Virginia and Washington stand to gain the most from increased spending and tax revenue, according to the report.<BR>
<BR>
The implications of the shift will be especially strong, says study author Bhashkar Mazumder, because of two demographic trends:  the percentage of retirees in the country is growing quickly (with Baby Boomers slated to start retiring around 2010); and older Americans hold an increasing percentage of the country's wealth.  For example, the average household income for those in the 45-64 age group is now 140% higher than for those under 25; it was 80% higher in 1970.  The median net worth of Americans between 55-64, which was twice as large as for those aged 35-44 in 1984, is now three times greater.<BR>
<BR>
Mazumder attributes the transfer of wealth to a shift in real income over the past 30 years.  He says the oldest Baby Boomers, who entered the workforce in large numbers beginning in 1965, have seen their real average annual incomes grow by 3.1%.  The post-Baby Boomers, on the other hand, joined the workforce in the 1980s and have seen their income grow by only 2.2% per year over the past decade.  He also said the recent emphasis on restructuring has hurt the youngest workers the most, contributing to the discrepancy between generations.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>Housing starts for April jumped 5.9%</B>--the largest percent gain since last November--despite increases in mortgage rates.  The increase comes on the heels of a 5.2% drop in March.  In releasing its report, the Commerce Department said construction of new homes and apartments totaled a seasonably adjusted 1.52 million.  Analysts had predicted an April drop in housing starts of between 0.8% and 1.4%<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>New claims for jobless benefits rose</B> 12,000 to 352,000 for the past week, yet the four-week moving average for unemployment insurance dropped to 353,000 according to a report from the Labor Department.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Salary increases for this year and next will average 4%</B> according to a recent study by The Conference Board.  This is the third straight year of 4% increases and matches the lowest level of pay increases since The Conference Board began tracking salary trends in 1975.  <A HREF = "../newsletter/wash.html">The Kiplinger Washington Letter</A> forecasted a 4% average salary increase for this year on September 1, 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Plans to offer bonds with inflation-linked yields were announced by the <A HREF = "http://www.ustreas.gov">Treasury Department</A> today. </B> The bonds are designed to protect investors from inflation and provide a way to save for retirement or other long-term purposes.  These "inflation-protection securities" will be offered in denominations as low as $1,000 with maturities of 10 or 30 years.<BR>

<H3> Gas prices shouldn't put a damper on summer travel plans</H3>
Summer vacationers shouldn't let higher gasoline prices get in the way of their travel plans, says the American Automobile Association.  "Although the recent run-up in gas prices may seem high as we enter the peak vacation season, vacationers are paying less than a dollar more for gas than they did last Memorial Day for a 200-mile trip," AAA's Graeme Clark said at a news conference this week announcing the group's summer travel forecast.<BR>
<BR>
Based on a car getting 25 miles to the gallon, Clark said it costs a driver 45 cents more to drive the 101 miles (a typical holiday weekend drive, AAA says) from Philadelphia to New York than it did a year ago.  If a driver were to drive all the way from Los Angeles to Washington, DC, 2,681 miles, Clark said the fuel cost difference from a year ago would amount to less than $12.  "Whether you're traveling 100 miles or 1,000 miles this summer, the bottom line difference adds just a few cents more to the overall travel experience," he said.<BR>
<BR>
Accordingly, AAA and the Travel Industry Association of America predict that consumers will cast off doubts about gas prices and make this summer the busiest travel season ever.  That's not to say that vacationers aren't worried about money, though:  The 1996 Summer Travel and Memorial Day Weekend Forecast released Thursday predicts that the average trip will be less upscale than a year ago and more family-oriented.<BR>
<BR>
In case you're still planning your vacation, AAA and TIAA say the five most popular summer travel destinations by car this year will be Orlando, Grand Canyon National Park, Los Angeles/Anaheim, Williamsburg, Va. and San Diego.  <BR>

<H3> Read the fine print of that latest and greatest credit card deal </H3>
If you're like most people, you get credit card solicitation deals in the mail all the time.  Some might actually merit close inspection.  If you notice a "two-cycle balance calculation method" listed in the fine print on any of them, though, be wary.  A few credit cards use the method, including Discover, and it could cost you a lot of money.<BR>
<BR>
It works like this:  Say you paid your credit card balance in full in April but only paid $500 of a $1,000 bill this month.  Average-daily-balance cards would begin charging you interest on the remaining balance on the June bill.  Two-cycle cards, on the other hand, would reach back to the beginning of May and charge you two months worth of interest on the June statement.  On a $500 balance for a card that charges an 18.9% annual interest rate, that means you owe an additional $8 in June.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>America still leads the world in manufacturing clout,</B> according to the annual "Industry Week 1,000" survey released this week.  The U.S. is home to nearly one-third of the world's largest manufacturers as ranked by <I>Industry Week</I> magazine, putting it ahead of all other countries.  Japan is second, followed by Britain, France and Germany.  In all, 35 countries are represented on the list.  General Motors weighed in as the world's largest manufacturer, followed in order by Ford (U.S.), Toyota (Japan), Hitachi (Japan), Matsushita (Japan), IBM (U.S.), Daimler-Benz (Germany), General Electric (U.S.), Nissan (Japan) and Philip Morris (U.S.).<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A private index of consumer confidence released Friday fell</B> from 92.7 in Mid-April to 89.9 this week.  The University of Michigan's mid-month report on consumer sentiment contradicted The Conference Board's index of consumer confidence released two weeks ago, which increased from 98.4 in March to 105.3 in April.  News of the report's downward trend, in addition to the government announcement that the March trade deficit soared, pushed stocks higher on the day.  Signs of economic strength have been viewed as bad news by stock investors recently amid concern that the Federal Reserve Board will raise short-term interest rates if inflation appears to be heating up.  Higher rates reduce consumer spending, which the Fed wants on occasion, but it also tends to hurt corporate profits.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A strong American economy and a weak European one in March led to a 27% increase in the trade deficit during the month,</B> the Commerce Department announced on Friday.  Americans bought near-record levels of imports from Japan, China and Canada in March, while sales of American products decreased in Western Europe because of tough economic times.  Thanks to the resulting shift in the balance of trade, the U.S. imported nearly $9 billion worth of goods more than it exported during the month.<BR>

<H3>More than 20 million Americans leave MCI refund unclaimed </H3>
Long-distance giant MCI wants to give away $42 million between now and the end of the month, but it can't find many takers.  <BR>
<BR>
In 1995, MCI agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by customers who called `900 numbers' between January 1, 1988 and November 1, 1994.  As part of the agreement, the company set aside $43 million to reimburse consumers who called numbers that offered sweepstakes, games of chance, awards, prizes, gifts, credit card deals and information on unclaimed refunds.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the numbers provided little to callers but generated millions in long-distance revenue for MCI.<BR>
<BR>
There's just one problem:  Less than $1 million has been claimed so far and time is running out.  As many as 21 million people who can rightfully claim up to $50 in long-distance certificates haven't done so, says an attorney overseeing the payout process.  All claim forms must be postmarked on or before May 31.<BR>
<BR>
The long-distance certificates can be used only for calls made on MCI's long-distance network, but a claimant doesn't have to be an MCI customer to use them.  MCI will provide non-customers with a toll-free number to access its network.  To receive a claim form and instructions, call 800-871-5409.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B> Chicken and turkey prices should drop this summer, </B>according to the Agriculture Department.  The department's "Poultry Outlook" released Monday forecasts that late-summer prices will run well below the levels of a year ago, when extremely hot July temperatures led to lower production and drove prices up (where they stayed through the end of the year).  Prices are expected to stay low this Fall, which should make the turkey you buy for Thanksgiving cheaper than the bird you bought last year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B> A powerful new search engine debuts today</B> in direct competition to major players <A HREF = "http://www.altavista.digital.com">Alta Vista</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!</A>. <A HREF = "http://www.hotbot.com"> HotBot</A>, a partnership of <I>HotWired </I> magazine and Inktomi Corp., claims to be the first search engine capable of cataloguing all 50 million current Web sites (Alta Vista says it catalogues 30 million).  Most current search engines track Web sites using a single computer, but HotBot networks a bunch of smaller computers into a unified system.  Such a system protects against crashes, claims Inktomi co-founder Eric Brewer, "because if one node fails the rest can cover for [it]."<BR> <BR>
<LI><B> Gasoline prices should settle down after the Memorial Day weekend, </B>thanks in part to an agreement reached Monday between Iraq and the United Nations.  The so-called "oil-for-food" agreement allows Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil on the international market over the next six months.  As a result, wholesale crude oil prices are expected to come down several dollars per barrel by mid-summer.  The plan would allow for the sale of approximately 700,000 barrels per day, well below the country's previous level of three million barrels per day.  Iraq has faced international sanctions since it invaded neighboring Kuwait in August 1990.<BR>

<H3> Even wealthiest Americans don't have enough saved for retirement, survey finds</H3>
It's no great revelation that the average American isn't saving enough to maintain his lifestyle through the retirement years.  More surprising is that the people who can afford to spend money like there's no tomorrow might find themselves short of cash when tomorrow comes.  A survey released Tuesday by the U.S. Trust Company of New York reports that only one-third of the top 1% of wealthiest Americans are saving enough to produce the level of income they want in retirement.  <BR>
<BR>
The culprit for wealthy and middle-class Americans alike, says U.S. Trust president Jeffrey Maurer, is that Baby Boomers and their parents are investing too cautiously.  "More than 40% of their portfolios are invested in fixed-income or cash-equivalent securities, which is probably too high a percentage," Maurer says of those polled for the latest survey.  "Increasing the equity portion of their retirement portfolios could help them reach their goals.  Otherwise, they will need to save more or lower their expectations."<BR>
<BR>
It all depends on your time horizon, of course — you should take more chances to achieve long-term objectives and fewer to reach near-term goals.  For suggestions on specific mutual fund portfolios, read our recent article <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1996/March/bestfund.html">"Best Funds For Your Goals."</A><BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>As expected, the Federal Reserve decided to keep short-term interest rates unchanged</B> at its Federal Open Market Committee meeting on Tuesday.  The federal funds rate remained at 5.25%, where it has been since January 31.  Although inflation has increased this year behind surging gasoline and grain prices, the Fed is evidently betting that the rise will be temporary and that no increase in short-term rates is needed right now.  The federal funds rate acts as a baseline for other short-term rates on everything from personal savings accounts to corporate loans.<BR>

<LI><B>CompuServe announced Tuesday that it is migrating to the World Wide Web,</B> following similar declarations by fellow online service providers Prodigy, Microsoft Network and AT&T Interchange.  CompuServe is the largest service to move away from its proprietary software, though, second in size only to America Online (which has yet to announce such a move).  Denny Matteucci, president of CompuServe's online division, said during a conference call today that the oldest major online service — founded in 1979 — will be accessible via Web browsers by the end of the year.  For existing CompuServe customers, the change means they can either stay with their existing service or move to the new Internet-based version once it becomes available.  <BR>

<LI><B>The economy is better off in the U.S. this year than it is in most of the world's leading industrial countries, </B>the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's chief economist said Tuesday.  "Relatively speaking, the United States is in a happy situation," Kumiharu Shigahara told delegates at the start of two days worth of talks in Paris.  Organized to promote economic cooperation and development between member states, OECD consists of the European countries, as well as Australia, Canada, Iceland, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Turkey and the U.S.<BR>

<H3>Charitable giving on the upswing </H3>
<BR>
Buoyed by a stock-market rally, higher wages and talk of ending some tax breaks this year, charitable giving increased more than 10% in 1995.  A report released Wednesday by the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel said environmental and wildlife groups benefited the most, up 12.5%, but all charitable segments registered gains during the year.  <BR>
<BR>
If you're in the mood to join the crowd and give money to a favorite cause, there are a variety of ways to determine whether your dollars will be well spent.  The easiest, of course, is to help your church or synagogue, or a local group you know well.  Recent well-publicized scandals notwithstanding, the majority of national and international charities also do a fairly good job of making sure your money reaches its intended target.  For our most recent evaluation of the 100 largest charitable organizations (excluding colleges, universities and local United Ways), read <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1995/November/charity.txt.html">"Charities You Can Believe In"</A> in the November, 1995, <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<BR>
<LI><B>The nation's largest toy store was accused of price fixing by government regulators on Wednesday.</B>  The Federal Trade Commission charged Toys R Us with antitrust violations, alleging that the company used its leverage in the market to force manufacturers to stop selling certain toys to warehouse clubs such as Price/Costco.  "Toys R Us has succeeded in keeping consumer prices higher than they otherwise would have been," FTC enforcement head William Baer said at a press conference.  Toys' chief executive Michael Goldstein said the company's practices "are well within the law" and said the company would defend itself "vigorously."<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Democratic Senator Tom Harkin said he would speak out against the reconfirmation of Fed chairman Alan Greenspan</B> when the issue comes up next week.  Harkin has asked that the Senate debate Greenspan's record for three days before his reconfirmation is put to a vote.  "I assume he'll win confirmation, but not until we have laid out a strong case [against his policies]," Harkin told Reuters news service on Wednesday.  Harkin and a small group of other Democratic senators argue that the Federal Reserve Board is not allowing the economy to grow quickly enough.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The federal government took in a record $72.4 billion more than it spent in April</B> thanks to last-minute tax filers, the Treasury Department announced this week.  The surplus was nearly 50% higher than the previous one-month high of $49.7 billion, set in April, 1995.  The added revenue reduced the expected budget deficit for the first seven months of the fiscal year to $55.8 billion, down from $96.9 billion over the same period a year ago.  The Clinton administration has forecast that the deficit for the entire year will be down 11% from fiscal 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Tony retailer Saks Fifth Avenue is now publicly owned,</B> after Saks Holdings Inc. held its initial public offering on Wednesday.   Trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol SKS, Saks stock price jumped 38.5% during the day's trading.  Parent company Investcorp retained 75% of Saks shares, but the sale marked the first public sale of company shares since its founding in 1867.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>AT&T announced Wednesday that it has become the second-largest Internet access provider,</B> signing up 150,000 subscribers since it began offering its service February 27.  AT&T WorldNet has received 600,000 requests for software in the past nine weeks, but has yet to fill half of those orders.  A key selling point:  The company's long-distance customers receive five free hours of monthly access.  AT&T didn't count the large online service providers such as America Online and CompuServe into its calculations, since those companies offer more than simple Internet access.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A tiny Rhode Island Internet provider sued CompuServe</B> on Wednesday over copyright infringement issues.  The disagreement stems from a May 1 letter CompuServe sent Providence-based Log On America asking the company to stop using its logo, which is similar to CompuServe's, or face a legal challenge.  Log On America's suit, filed in U.S. District Court, alleges that CompuServe's threat violates federal antitrust laws and that CompuServe waited too long to assert trademark rights.  A CompuServe spokesperson declined to comment on the case.<BR>

<H3> World's biggest mutual fund claims another victim </H3>
Peter Lynch quit running Fidelity Magellan fund in 1990 rather than deal with the stress of managing $13 billion of other people's money.  As assets ballooned to $20 billion, Morris Smith lasted less than two years before burning out.  Today Jeff Vinik announced that he too has had enough.  Vinik resigned as manager of the $56 billion behemoth to start his own money-management firm.  "Now seems like the right time to launch Vinik Asset Management," he said in a <A HREF = "http://www.fid-inv.com/news/press_magellan.html">Fidelity press release</A>.<BR>
<BR>
In the nearly four years that Vinik managed Magellan, the fund returned an annualized 17.4%, better than the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index (16.7%) and just slightly below the Dow Jones Industrial Average (18.2%).  This year, though, the fund was trounced on all fronts as Vinik loaded up on bonds in anticipation of a stock-market downturn.  Since January 1, the Dow has returned 13.8%; the S&P 500, 10.9%; and Magellan, a paltry 4.7%.<BR>
<BR>
Fidelity named Robert Stansky as Vinik's replacement.  Stansky, who will take over Magellan on June 3, is currently managing Fidelity's Advisor Equity Growth and Growth Company funds.  Both have shown higher than average volatility during recent years, and some on Wall Street fear that Stansky will move quickly to sell the 19% of assets Vinik reportedly has in fixed-income investments — unloading $11 billion worth of bonds on the market and depressing prices.  Others discount that possibility, though.  "Fidelity has an extremely savvy trading system that tends not to push around the markets," says Jack Bowers, editor of the independent newsletter <I>Fidelity Monitor</I>.  "I suspect Stansky will take his time and sell those bonds when the markets are least expecting it."<BR>
<BR>
For a snapshot of Vinik in happier times and for more information about Magellan, read our recent article, <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1995/September/vinik.html">"The $50 Billion Man."</A> <BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>First-time applications for jobless benefits fell last week,</B> the Labor Department announced on Thursday.  Initial jobless claims fell to 344,000 in the week ending May 18, a decline of 7,000 from the previous week.  The four-week average of first-time applicants also fell by 7,000, to 345,750 — its lowest level since the week ending August 26.  Alabama, citing fewer layoffs in construction, service and textile industries, posted the largest decline during the week.  California, Michigan and Pennsylvania bucked the trend to report significant increases.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Financing a home cost a little less last week,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said Thursday.  Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.01% nationwide during the week, down from 8.08% the week before.  The lower rate marks the continuation of a downward trend, after rates reached a high of 8.24% on May 9.  One-year adjustable-rate mortgages averaged an initial 5.75% last week, down from 5.78% the previous seven days.  Fifteen-year mortgages averaged 7.51% during the week, after weighing in at 7.59% a week earlier.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Some people will be able to call in and turn on or off household appliances over the phone</B> as part of a test program announced this week by Ameritech Corp. and Commonwealth Edison.  At least 2,200 homes in the Chicago area and southeastern Wisconsin will be wired by the end of the year to allow customers to control air conditioners, heaters, washing machines and other appliances when they're not home.  The service will initially be free, although it hasn't been determined when fees might be instituted or when other regions might see similar features become available.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Warner Brothers Records this week becomes the first major label to play an album online before it's released to music stores. </B> Thursday, Saturday and again Monday, the company will broadcast a new album by the rock group Porno for Pyros in its entirety.  The album, "Good God's Urge," won't be provided to music stores until Tuesday.  Fans can hear the album on <A HREF = "http://www.wbr.com/pornoforpyros/">Warner Brothers Records' site</A> between 8 p.m. and 1 a.m. Eastern Time on the appropriate days.<BR>

<H3> Summer at what cost?</H3>
Regardless of what the calendar says, we all know that summer starts on Memorial Day weekend — schools are out, pools open, people head to the beach, etc.  With that in mind, here's a preview of anticipated summer costs pulled from the pages of the June issue of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Electricity for air conditioning in the southeastern U.S., July through September: $398, up 0.6% from 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Pressure-treated lumber to build an 8x10-foot deck:  $360, down 4% from a year ago.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Customized 400-square-foot in-ground swimming pool:  $18,600, up 3.3%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>One-week rental of a three-bedroom lakefront home, Traverse City, Michigan:  $1,200, up 9%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>One-week rental of a deluxe three-bedroom house in suburban Atlanta during the Olympic Games:  $3,600, up 620% from 1995.<BR>

<H3> Dow Jones Industrial Average turns 100</H3>
The most widely followed and well-known proxy for the stock market turns 100 this week, but age hasn't slowed it down a bit — the Dow Jones Industrial Average has set 21 all-time highs thus far in 1996.  Chief executive Jack Welch of General Electric, the only company remaining from the original Dow, will mark the anniversary by ringing the New York Stock Exchange's opening bell on Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
The makeup of the blue-chip stock index is established by editors of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, published by Dow Jones & Co.  The stocks selected are not those of the 30 largest companies, but those of large, well-established firms with a variety of products and services.<BR>
<BR>
The current list hasn't changed since 1991, when Caterpillar replaced International Harvester.  It now includes:  AT&T, AlliedSignal, Alcoa, American Express, Bethlehem Steel, Boeing, Caterpillar, Chevron, Coca-Cola, Walt Disney, DuPont, Eastman Kodak, Exxon, General Electric, General Motors, Goodyear Tire & Rubber, IBM, International Paper, McDonald's, Merck, 3M, J.P. Morgan, Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble, Sears, Texaco, Union Carbide, United Technologies, Westinghouse Electric and Woolworth.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>The first Internet-only bank in the U.S. went public this week,</B> and was well-received by investors.  <A HREF = "http://www.sfnb.com"><U>Security First Network Bank</U></A> held an initial public offering Thursday and the stock price more than doubled in the day's trading (it remained flat in light trading on Friday).  The bank claims to offer high rates on certificates of deposit and low fees because it has very little in overhead costs, unlike traditional banks.  Since Security First doesn't have any branch offices, customers have to either direct deposit their paychecks into a checking account or mail them to the bank.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The snack-food industry is under investigation for anticompetitive practices,</B> the Justice Department confirmed Friday on the eve of one of the industry's best-selling weekends of the year.  A department spokesperson declined to identify specific companies under investigation or detail the allegations against them.  However, published reports Friday identified Frito-Lay Inc. as the probable target as a result of its alleged practice of purchasing excess shelf space in grocery stores to shut out competitors' products.  A subsidiary of PepsiCo, Frito-Lay is the largest snack-food company in the nation.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Travel prices were almost flat in April,</B> according to the Travel Industry Association of America's Travel Price Index (TPI), released Thursday.  The overall TPI increased 0.1% over March figures, but airline fares and lodging costs actually declined during the month.  Year-to-date, travel costs have outpaced general inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index) 3.4% to 2.8%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>If you're in the job market, the Great Lakes region from Illinois to Ohio looks like the place to be,</B> according to Labor Department statistics released this week.  The department said workers are scarce in both blue- and white-collar fields in the region, and the situation is expected to worsen before it gets better for employers.  Pay increases in the area, which have averaged about 3% a year during the 1990s, are forecast to rise to nearly 4% this year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Factory orders for durable goods such as equipment and computers fell in April,</B> the fifth decline in seven months.  The Commerce Department announced Friday that durable goods orders during the month totaled $166 billion, down from $169.3 billion in March.  Such orders are considered a measure of manufacturing strength in the country; weakness generally indicates slow job growth in the near term.  Durable goods are items expected to last more than three years.<BR>

<H3> Look to Midwest, smaller companies for summer job growth </H3>
Hiring is expected to rise this summer according to the latest quarterly survey from temporary help firm Manpower Inc., released Tuesday.  The study said such growth will be fueled by seasonal hiring at construction companies and continued economic strength in the Midwest.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, the survey of business managers found 27% were expecting to increase employment between July and August, 7% anticipating a reduction in the number of staff members and 63% predicting no change (3% were undecided).  During the previous quarter's survey, 26% expected to increase staff size and 8% forecast layoffs.  "An improvement in job formation may be underway," Manpower chief executive Mitchell Fromstein concluded.  "[But] it is too early to tell if the growth in the job market can be sustained."<BR>
<BR>
In the Midwest, 30% of managers planned to boost employment during the third quarter, compared to 28% in the West, 26% in the South and 25% in the Northeast.  Regardless of region, though, job seekers are increasingly finding the best opportunities at small companies with fewer than 100 workers.  For more information on the employment picture, read our recent article <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1996/January/jobs.html">"Job Mart: Great for Grads."</A><BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>Americans are beginning to register concern about the economy's immediate future,</B> according to a survey released Tuesday by the Conference Board.  The New York-based research group's monthly Consumer Confidence Index fell to 101.2 in May from 104.8 a month earlier.  The portion of the survey dedicated to consumer sentiment about the current economic situation remained relatively flat at 118.3 (it was 118.2 in April).  The consumer expectations aspect, on the other hand, dropped from 95.9 in April to 89.7 this month.  The board's interpretation: Consumers are "not as optimistic" about the next six months as they were in April.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Machine-tool orders were down in April but still higher than 1995's figures,</B> the Association of Manufacturing Technology announced on Memorial Day.  April orders totaled $438 million, down from $484 million in March yet significantly higher than the $368 million registered last April.  Machine tools are used to shape metal in the manufacture of everything from golf clubs to automobiles.  Orders for these tools provides an indication of future strength in the manufacturing sector.  The AMT report noted that orders generally drop at this time of year in anticipation of the International Manufacturing Technology Show in September, when new machinery is unveiled.<BR>
<a name="home"><BR>
<LI><B>Sales of previously owned homes rose in April for the third consecutive month,</B> the National Association of Realtors announced on Tuesday.  Nationally, used-home sales totaled an annualized 4.22 million during the month, up from 4.20 million in March.  The growth wasn't evenly distributed, however.  Sales were up 10% in the Northeast, but remained unchanged in the West and went down slightly across the rest of the country.  The average price of an existing home was $116,600 in April, up 8% from a year ago.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The cost of living in New York last year was low compared to other major international cities,</B> according to a survey released Monday by the Japanese government.  The Economic Planning Agency's study compared the cost of rent and utilities in five notoriously high-priced cities.  Tokyo came out on top of the list as the most expensive city to live in, followed in order by Paris, Berlin, London and New York.  Tokyo's prices were 159% of those in New York, the largest difference in more than a decade.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Gasoline prices appear to be leveling off after more than six months of increases, </B>an oil industry analyst said over the holiday weekend.  Nationwide, the price at the pump rose only slightly during the past two weeks.  Analyst Trilby Lundberg said the leveling off is attributable to the fact that temporary supply shortages have finally worked their way through the system.  The average price of gas at self-service pumps during the past two weeks was $1.32 for regular, $1.41 for mid-grade and $1.50 for premium.  At full-service pumps, where only 5% of gas is sold, the average prices were $1.62, $1.70 and $1.77, respectively.<BR>

<H3> Mutual fund investors get more aggressive </H3>
So far in May, mutual fund investors have socked away nearly half of their new investments in emerging growth or aggressive growth funds — two of the most volatile sectors available.  That's up from only 15% who sought that much risk a year ago, says AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif.  And that's a bigger piece of a bigger pie, also.  The Investment Company Institute reported yesterday that stock funds grew by $26 billion in April, the second-largest increase on record.<BR>
<BR>
Finance professor <A HREF = "http://www.shu.edu/~loviscto/">Anthony Loviscek</A> of Seton Hall University says investors are getting increasingly aggressive because they feel uncertain about the future.  "There's a psychology driving this," he says.  "People are starting to realize that the American Dream ain't what it used to be — job security is lower and even the availability of Social Security may be in doubt."  Consequently, Loviscek says, investors feel as if they need a larger nest egg than in the past; so they take more chances to get one.<BR>
<BR>
Loviscek is quick to point out that investor education in recent years may play a part in the change, as well.  "The optimist in me says that people understand more about the tradeoff between risk and reward than they used to," he says.  "As long as they don't need the money right away and they make intelligent decisions, there's nothing wrong with being aggressive with their money."<BR>
<BR>
<H3> Most short on time and knowledge about finances </H3>
The results of a survey released this week by Louis Harris and Associates indicate that most Americans are on shaky ground managing their day-to-day finances.  That conclusion squares with a <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/dailynews/dn0514.html">report </A>released by the non-profit group Investor Protection Trust earlier this month — and spells trouble for most people.<BR>
<BR>
According to the new survey, only one in five Americans feels confident about selecting investments; more than 75% acknowledge they don't know much about mutual funds and one-third say they don't even know what one is; 61% of respondents don't understand how compound interest increases outstanding debt; and nearly three out of four people with life insurance policies can't name what type of policy they own.<BR>
<BR>
The survey also found that traditional savings accounts remain, by far, the most common means of saving or investing (92%).  Maybe the most telling revelation from the results, though:  While almost all people surveyed admitted they need to know more about managing their money, 57% said they don't have the time or the energy to learn.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>Travelers without a laptop will be able to check their email or log on to the Web soon</B> in many areas, thanks to "cyberbooths" distributed by Atcom/Info, a San Diego company.  Similar to phone booths, the cyberbooths will allow users to insert a credit card then log into email or the browser of their choice for seven-, 15- or 60-minute intervals.  Atcom/Info says it already has orders from the Marina Marriott in San Diego and the Renaissance Hotel in Washington, DC, as well as airports in Dallas, Denver and Philadelphia.  The San Diego Convention Center already boasts several free-standing kiosks with the service.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Federal authorities warned people Wednesday to beware of worthless financial notes sold at workshops</B> by <A HREF = "http://www.latimes.com/HOME/COMMUN/NEWS/ZONE08A/t000040669.html">M. Elizabeth Broderick</A> of San Diego, who was arrested in April for fraud, obstruction of justice and conspiracy to commit fraud.  The U.S. Comptroller of the Currency said people at the workshops allegedly paid $100 for the notes, which they were told could be used to pay off much larger debts at banks and other creditors.  The supposed financial instruments, alternatively called "certified bankers checks," "certified money orders" or "comptroller warrants," have no value.  A spokesperson for the Comptroller's office said people attempting to pass them along may face criminal charges.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Trading in the stock of computer-chip maker Texas Instruments was temporarily suspended today</B> following word that chief executive Jerry Junkins died of a heart attack while on a business trip in Germany.  Junkins, 58, took over as chief executive in 1985 and was named chairman of the board three years later.  A company <A HREF = "http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/pressrel/1996/96022.htm">statement </A>said vice chairmen William Mitchell and William Weber will oversee operations until a new chief executive is named.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Combined business and personal bankruptcy filings rose nearly 17% in the 12 months to March 31,</B> the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts announced on Tuesday.  At the current pace, calendar-year 1996 bankruptcies are likely to be higher than 1 million — a first in any 12-month period.<BR>

<H3> Election returns rattle Israeli markets </H3>
Israeli stocks tumbled Thursday in a volatile session as investors responded to the news that Benjamin Netanyahu is likely to be the country's next prime minister.  The Israeli stock market fell 5% on the day, despite the fact that Netanyahu's ascension from opposition-party leader to prime minister is not assured.  With 175,000 ballots remaining to be counted late Thursday out of 3.9 million cast, Netanyahu had collected 50.3% of the vote to Prime Minister Shimon Peres' 49.6%.  Peres would have to win more than 56% of the outstanding vote to catch up, though, something most analysts think is unlikely.<BR>
<BR>
Netanyahu has promised a tougher stance in the peace negotiations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, which unnerves some foreign investors.  Investment from abroad has boomed in Israel — rising more than 600% since 1991 — as the country sealed a first-ever accord with the Palestinian Liberation Organization, signed a peace treaty with Jordan and opened diplomatic relations with a host of Arab countries in the Middle East.<BR>
<BR>
Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Lior Bregman says such concerns may depress the Israeli market in the short-term, but he doesn't foresee any fundamental change in the nation's investment picture.  Netanyahu, Bregman says, "is likely to moderate once he gains actual decision-making responsibility."  Nonetheless, Bregman suggests that investors might find the best deals among small, technology-driven Israeli companies whose revenues are least likely to be affected by a disruption in the peace process.<BR>
<BR>
For "up to the minute" updates of the vote count, check in with the election coverage at the <A HREF = "http://www.virtual.co.il/city_services/elections/">Virtual Jerusalem</A> Web site.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>New-home sales rebounded from a March slump to post a 6.7% increase last month,</B> the Commerce Department announced Thursday.  At a national median selling price of $138,700, 65,000 families bought new homes in April.  It marked the first time sales have topped an annualized rate of 700,000 for four months in a row since late 1993.  Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to an average of 7.93% during the month, up from 7.62% in March.  Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors <A HREF = "dn0528.html#home">announced </A>that sales of existing homes were also up during April.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The government obtained a restraining order against an alleged Internet-based pyramid scheme</B> on Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission <A HREF = "http://www.ftc.gov/ro/fortuna.htm">reported</A>.  The FTC says Fortuna Alliance L.L.C. "is just an elaborate, electronic version of a chain letter" in which 95% of the participants are likely to lose money.  Fortuna told visitors to its Web site that it was possible for them to earn $5,000 per month on the basis of $250 monthly investments in a company "co-op".  A government economist, however, calculated that late-comers to Fortuna's chain will have to recruit 200,000 new subscribers just to get back their initial investments.  The FTC's statement indicated that Fortuna has received more than $6 million to date, and has transferred $3.6 million of that to a bank in Antigua.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The economy grew less quickly than previously thought during the first three months of the year,</B> the Commerce Department acknowledged on Thursday.  The department lowered its initial estimate of the nation's first-quarter gross domestic product growth from 2.8% to 2.3%.  Officials attributed the revision to an unexpected reduction in business inventories, which indicates that consumers are buying goods more quickly than firms are stocking them — good news for future economic growth.  The GDP, a measure of the total goods and services produced in the U.S., increased 0.5% during the fourth quarter of 1995.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of help-wanted ads in the nation's newspapers decreased everywhere except the Southeast and Mountain states</B> over the past three months, the Conference Board said today.  The Mountain states' 0.3% gain during February, March and April wasn't remarkable, Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said, but  the 6-7% jump in the Southeast was surprising.  "An interesting question is how strong the region will continue to be after the summer Olympics," he said.  The Northeast and Pacific states showed the largest declines during the period, while the Midwest remained relatively flat.  The board's monthly Help-Wanted Advertising Index fell to 82 overall in April, down from 84 a month earlier.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of Americans seeking first-time jobless benefits seems to have leveled off,</B> the Labor Department announced Thursday.  Last week, initial claims for state benefits increased by 1,000 over the previous week, to 346,000, but the four-week moving average of such benefits fell to its lowest point since August of last year.  California, Florida, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania reported the largest decreases in claims during the week, which ended May 18.<BR>

<H3> Save money during the nuptial season and look good doing it </H3>
Everyone, it seems, wants to get married on a Saturday evening in June.  With the marriage month upon us, then, you'll likely host or attend at least one wedding in the weeks ahead.  If you're among the former group, you may want to consider the following money-saving ideas:<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Establish a budget and stick to it.  Splurge on those things that are most important to you, but keep other costs in check.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Select a reception site that allows you to hire an independent caterer, as opposed to taking what the site offers.  That way, you can solicit bids for food and drink — which together account for more than half of the average $16,000 price of a wedding.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Place a limit on the number of guests or offer a buffet-style meal, which is typically less expensive than a sit-down meal.  Failing all else, serving lunch can cost up to 20% less than serving dinner.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> A disc jockey will typically cost half as much as a live band, but be sure to get a wedding specialist.  A wedding DJ should wear appropriate clothing for the occasion and offer a wide variety of music.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Select fruit for the reception meal and flowers for the bride and bridesmaids that are in abundant supply at local wholesalers.<BR>
<BR>
If you'll be attending a wedding and not hosting it, on the other hand, note the top 10 etiquette tips for wedding guests, courtesy of <I>Bride's </I>magazine:<BR>
<BR>
1. Reply to the invitation in a timely manner.<BR>
<BR>
2. Dress appropriately.  The rule of thumb is to dress as you would for any other social event at the same hour and season.  Also take into account the formality and location of the ceremony and reception.<BR>
<BR>
3. Don't bring children, other family members or an escort to the wedding unless their name or "and guest" appears on the inside envelope of the invitation.<BR>
<BR>
4. Do not bring a wedding gift to the reception, as it will be inconvenient for the couple's families to transport them home.  If purchasing a gift before the wedding, send it to the bride's parents' home or to her home.  A guest has up to one year to send a wedding gift.<BR>
<BR>
5. Arrive 30 minutes before the ceremony begins.<BR>
<BR>
6. Pass through the receiving line if there is one.<BR>
<BR>
7. If the reception is a seated meal, be sure to introduce yourself to each person at your table.<BR>
<BR>
8. Rise and drink to each toast made to the couple at the reception.<BR>
<BR>
9. Join the other guests on the dance floor when invited by the band leader or friends.<BR>
<BR>
10. Thank the hosts before leaving the reception.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>The Dow Jones industrial average finished sharply lower Friday after a former Federal Reserve Governor predicted a July interest-rate hike.</B>  The index reacted almost immediately when former governor Lyle Gramley said he expects a 50-basis-point increase in short-term interest rates when the Federal Reserve Board meets on July 3.  When interest rates go up, fixed-income investments such as bonds and certificates of deposit become more attractive relative to stocks, which traders fear will hurt the equity markets.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>California authorities on Friday proposed a two-month ban on Chrysler sales in the state</B> in response to 116 alleged violations of state lemon laws.  The ban would keep Chrysler from delivering vehicles to dealers, although dealers would be able to sell cars already on their lots.  The California Department of Motor Vehicles says the nation's third-largest automaker repeatedly failed to notify used-car buyers of the status of vehicles sold, to provide warranties and to notify the state about vehicles required to be listed as "warranty returns".<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The largest provider of 401(k) and 403(b) retirement plans will soon allow individuals to access their accounts online,</B> Fidelity Investments said Thursday.  Under the plan, workers whose companies use Fidelity retirement plans will be able to move money between various investments via the Internet.  There will be no charge for the service, and Fidelity said it expects all of its four million clients to sign up for the service within two years.  The program will be available for corporate clients (who then pass it on to their employees) toward the end of June.  Many of Fidelity's competitors, including Vanguard, expect to offer Internet transactions within a year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Travelers take note: Some Olympic tickets are still available</B> for the summer games, scheduled to kick off July 19 in Atlanta.  The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games provides online a <A HREF = "http://www.atlantagames.com/oly/tix/avail518.htm">list of events</A> with unsold tickets, <A HREF = "http://www.atlantagames.com/oly/tix/tix.htm">general information</A> about ticket sales, an inventory of <A HREF = "http://www.atlantagames.com/lodging.htm">lodging options</A> and information about <A HREF = "http://www.atlantagames.com/oly/news/m05otix.htm">buying tickets online</A>.  For details about particular events and venues, check out the U.S. Olympic Committee's <A HREF = "http://www.olympic.nbc.com/sports/sports.html">sport-specific Web areas</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Last-minute tax payments kept Americans' discretionary spending down in April,</B> the Commerce Department announced Friday.  Despite the fact that private wages and salaries increased by $16.2 billion nationwide during the month, disposable income — income after taxes — fell 0.5%.  As a result, people reduced their spending on big-ticket durable items such as cars and appliances.  Buoyed by small-item purchases, though, overall consumer spending edged up 0.1% in April, following a 0.5% increase in March and a 1.3% jump in February.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>ValuJet shareholders filed a class-action lawsuit against the company this week,</B> alleging that the troubled airline publicly touted its safety record when, in fact, its history was less than satisfactory.  In legal documents filed Thursday in Atlanta, shareholders assert that ValuJet executives made misleading statements to inflate the price of the stock in recent months.  The plaintiffs say they hope to recover losses suffered as a result of their reliance on such statements.  A ValuJet spokesperson denies wrongdoing on the part of the company.<BR>

<H3>Stick to what you know when it comes to micro-cap stocks, expert says</H3>
The news went from bad to worse for investors in Comparator Systems this week, as the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit against the tiny fingerprint-technology firm.  Trading in the company's stock has been halted since May 9, when investigators began to suspect Comparator had fraudulently exaggerated the value of its assets.  Just before that, the stock price had rocketed from pennies per share to $2 in a matter of days, setting Nasdaq trading-volume records three sessions in a row.<BR>
<BR>
Obviously, quite a few people believed that Comparator was going to be the next Iomega or Netscape.  This all begs the question, then: If you're interested in a hot, young company, how can you tell if it's legit or if it's a penny-stock sham?  Not very easily, says Marc Robins, editor of <I>The Red Chip Review</I> newsletter, which tracks 300 micro-cap companies.  "It can be hard to tell if the next great company somebody told you about is really a boarded-up building somewhere," he says.  "To be sure of what you're getting, you need to look into it a bit more than you would General Electric, for instance."  <BR>
<BR>
Of course, the return can be much greater for small-caps than it would be for GE, Robins quickly points out.  To pinpoint firms offering that high-return potential without getting duped, Robins suggests sticking to your own back yard most of the time when it comes to micro-caps.  You aren't likely to buy stock in a boarded-up building if you drive by and see the company's office yourself and, if possible, talk to employees.  Another rule of thumb, Robins says, is to avoid highly-touted micro-caps.  Once they've received widespread attention, it's probably too late to cash in on their potential.  Besides, Robins says, "the sizzle is usually far greater than the steak" in such cases.<BR>
<BR>
For $6 per company, <A HREF = "http://www.redchip.com/reprev.html"><I>The Red Chip Review</I></A> will also provide online analysis of micro-caps it covers.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><b>Americans are less secure about their financial situation, but more willing to make sacrifices to own a home,</b> according to a survey released Monday by the Federal National Mortgage Association.  The Fannie Mae study found that two-thirds of Americans say they are willing to put off retirement for 10 years in order to buy a home and 85% said they would forgo an extra two weeks of vacation per year to do so.  Those figures are up sharply from a similar survey in 1995, when 59% and 71%, respectively, said they would agree to such sacrifices.  Eighty-one percent also said they would rather commute a long distance and own their own home than rent close to their jobs, up from 63% a year ago.  At the same time, the survey found that nearly half of respondents said they were concerned about job security, up from 26% in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><b>Key indicators point to continued economic strength six to nine months down the road, </b>the Conference Board reported on Monday.  The business group's Index of Leading Indicators rose 0.3% in April, following an identical gain in March and a 1.3% jump in February — the first time there have been three consecutive monthly gains since late 1993.  Bolstering the Conference Board's conclusion, the Commerce Department announced Monday that spending on construction projects totaled a record $552 billion in April, up 1.4% from March figures.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The manufacturing sector slowed down a bit in May as raw materials prices went up sharply,</B> the National Association of Purchasing Management said today.  NAPM's monthly index slipped to 49.3 in May, down from 50.1 a month earlier.  A reading above 50 generally indicates growing manufacturing strength while a reading below that is consistent with a contracting sector.  The prices manufacturers have to pay for materials, meanwhile, went from an index reading of 40.1 in April to 50.8 in May.  A spokesperson for NAPM said that slightly higher raw materials costs wouldn't necessarily translate into higher consumer prices, though.  Ralph Kauffman said that manufacturers' ability to pass on such costs to consumers "is not very great" in the current economy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Nynex requested permission Monday to sell long-distance in four new states </B>according to the provisions of the 1996 Telecommunications Act.  The law, which was signed into law in February, allows the regional Bell companies to begin selling long-distance service when their local areas are sufficiently competitive.  Nynex submitted the proposal to the public utilities commissions in Arizona, California, Florida and Illinois.  Nynex is the regional phone company in the New York area, although it is currently attempting to merge with former rival Bell Atlantic.<BR>

<H3>Supreme Court upholds legality of credit card fees </H3>
Barbara Smiley doesn't mind the fact that her Visa and MasterCard charge interest on unpaid balances each month; that's simply the cost of borrowing.  What the Los Angeles resident takes exception to is Citibank's monthly late-payment fees of $15 per card — something California law forbids.  Citibank is based in South Dakota, though, and the U.S. Supreme Court this week decided that nationally chartered banks only have to consider the laws of the state where they are headquartered before instituting such fees.<BR>
<BR>
As a result of the<I> Smiley vs. Citibank</I> decision, borrowers are going to have to be even more diligent when vetting credit card offers, says Michelle Meier of the Consumers Union.  "Now that the Court has given lenders the green light, it will get harder and harder to find cards without those kinds of fees," Meier says.  For information on other credit card tricks to look out for when scanning the fine print, read <A HREF = "../magazine/archives/1995/February/ff.html">Credit Cards Deals — With String Attached</A>, from the February, 1995 issue of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>.<BR>
<BR>
If you're getting soaked by the fees because your credit card bill comes due before you get your paycheck each month, call the lender and request that your due date be changed until after payday.  If the lender says no, you have another good reason to look for a different card.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>The National Highway Traffic Administration ordered the recall of more than 91,000 Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus cars on Tuesday</B> because of allegedly unsafe seatbelts.  A July 8 deadline was established for the recall, but Chrysler already informed NHTSA that it would not be able to work within that time frame.  As a result of that refusal, the Justice Department filed a federal lawsuit against the automaker on Tuesday to force the company to notify owners and fix the cars for free.  This is the first lawsuit involving the failure of cars in a government safety test — in the past, manufacturers voluntarily recalled vehicles upon NHTSA request.  The government says Cirrus and Stratus cars manufactured before May 15, 1995 don't meet the requirement to be strong enough to hold a 3,000-pound load for 10 seconds.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>President Clinton <A HREF = "http://www1.whitehouse.gov/WH/dispatch/060496.html">proposed </A>a tax credit today worth up to $3,000 to help students pay for college. </B> Speaking at Princeton University's graduation ceremony, Clinton called for a credit of up to $1,500 to be applied to a student's tuition for the first year at any college or university.  If the student maintained a B average and was not convicted of any drug-related felonies, he or she would be eligible for the credit a second year.  The plan would cost the treasury $7.9 billion over the next six years.  Clinton proposed covering the difference by eliminating a $3.5 billion tax break for multinational companies, raising $2.3 billion more by boosting an airport fee on international travelers and collecting the final $2.1 billion by selling off part of the radio airwaves.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The chief executive of Prudential Mutual Funds resigned this week,</B> leading some in published reports to question whether the company is planning to sell funds directly to the public.  Currently, Prudential funds are only available through a broker or an insurance agent.  Richard Redeker's resignation comes one week after Prudential hired an ex-Fidelity executive to oversee the company's marketing and planning efforts. (Fidelity is well known for its massive volume of direct sales.)  In a memo dated May 29, Redeker said he will step down "effectively this fall."  No replacement has been named.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Time Warner moved into the local telephone business on Tuesday, </B>announcing an alliance with regional phone company BellSouth Corp.  The agreement will allow Time Warner to compete for local phone service customers in the Southeastern region; in exchange, BellSouth will likely seek permission to sell long-distance service.  The 1996 Telecommunications Act requires areas to be sufficiently competitive before local phone companies can sell long-distance service.  The affected region includes Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>As professional hockey's Stanley Cup finals get underway, Florida Panthers owner Wayne Huizenga said he may consider selling shares in his team, </B><A HREF = "http://www.herald.com/sports/panthers/docs/000741.htm">the <I>Miami Herald</I> reported</A> on Tuesday.  Huizenga, founder of Blockbuster Entertainment, says he wants to sell up to 50% of the team in an initial public offering.  First, however, he has to win approval of the plan from the National Hockey League's board of governors and gain the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Such a sale is not the first:  Shares in professional basketball's Boston Celtics were sold to the public in 1986.  The Panthers, in only their third year in the league, are currently playing a seven-game series against the Colorado Avalanche for rights to the Stanley Cup.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Factory orders fell 0.1% in April, the third drop in four months,</B> the Commerce Department announced on Tuesday.  The fall was mostly attributable to shrinking aircraft orders. On the other hand, orders for nondurable goods actually increased 2% during the month.  Nondurables are items that are used and disposed of in less than three years.<BR>

<H3>Trustees say Medicare and Social Security funds going broke </H3>
The Medicare trust fund that pays hospital bills for the elderly will run out of money within five years and Social Security will go broke in 2029 if the programs continue unchanged, a group of Medicare trustees reported Wednesday afternoon.  To help you wade through all the election-year finger pointing that immediately ensued from both the Democratic and Republican camps about how best to respond, a primer on the situation:  <BR>
<BR>
Medicare Part A pays for care for senior citizens in hospitals, nursing homes and hospices, as well as for home care.  It receives money primarily through a 1.45% payroll tax paid by both employers and employees.  Until 1995, Medicare brought in more through payroll taxes than it spent, amassing a $134 billion trust fund — which it is now digging into.  By 2002, according to the trustees, Medicare will owe $53 billion more than it has if the system isn't changed; the shortfall would increase to more than $400 billion by 2006.  Social Security is still taking in more than it spends, but it won't be able to withstand the retirement of 76 million Baby Boomers early in the next century.<BR>
<BR>
The six-member Medicare board of trustees is composed of three Cabinet members — the secretaries of health and human services, labor and treasury — the Social Security commissioner and two members of the public.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>Reengineering is on the back burner as company growth strategies heat up,</B> according to a quarterly survey released Wednesday by the consulting arm of Deloitte & Touche, one of the largest accounting firms in the country.  The survey of 150 executives at <I>Fortune 1,000</I> companies found managers emphasizing more growth strategies and worrying less about restructuring.  In a shift, 62% said corporate expansion is one of their most important goals, up from an average of 54% who agreed with that statement over the past three years.  The days of downsizing are not necessarily over, though:  93% of managers questioned said workforce reduction and company growth are not mutually exclusive objectives.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The second-largest online service provider reversed field to join forces with Microsoft this week.</B>  CompuServe, with its five million customers, a year ago protested that Microsoft gained unfair competitive advantage by packaging the Microsoft Network with its dominant Windows software.  As part of an agreement announced on Tuesday, though, CompuServe will now be available through a single mouse-click from the opening screen of Windows 95 software, as well.  In exchange, Microsoft's Internet Explorer will become the main Web browser for CompuServe's customers.  Chasing after a market controlled by Netscape's Navigator browser, Microsoft made a similar deal with America Online in March.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Led by the California wine industry, horticultural exports rose 3% in March</B> from the same period a year ago, the Agriculture Department said on Wednesday.  Leading the way, overseas shipment of wine rose 38% from 1995 figures and fresh citrus products gained 12%.  The statistics mirror a longer-term trend for American vintners:  Over the past decade, the value of wine shipped abroad has increased 591% and the sheer volume exported has gone up 432%.  The United Kingdom is the top customer for American wines, followed by Canada, Japan, Switzerland and The Netherlands.  California growers account for nearly 90% of American wine exports each year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Tax deductions for charitable giving increased in 1994, albeit slowly,</B> the Internal Revenue Service reports in the new issue of its<I> Statistics and Income Bulletin</I>.  Such deductions totaled nearly $70 billion in the 1994 tax year, up 2.6% from 1993.  Charitable giving may be on the upswing since the IRS last counted, however.  The non-profit American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/dailynews/dn0522.html">released a study</A> last month indicating that philanthropic donations went up more than 10% in 1995.<BR>

<H3>Finding an investment newsletter that's right for you
</H3>
Carlton Luts, publisher of <I>The Cabot Market Letter</I> announced this week that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating him for possible stock manipulation (he denies any wrongdoing and is cooperating with investigators).  Much of Luts's recommended portfolio went down after the announcement Wednesday, something that hasn't happened very often to his 25,000 subscribers of late — and therein lies the more compelling story for most investors.  <BR>
<BR>
Subscribers who followed <I>The Cabot Market Letter</I>'s suggested portfolios in recent years are wealthier for it.  But there are hundreds of newsletters on the market which claim to provide just as good of advice.  How to find the handful that justify their high price tags?  With that question in mind, we recently sifted through them and identified a half dozen with superior records.  Even better, three of the six are available online.  All but one beat the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index over at least the past five years; the lone exception is almost never fully invested in stocks.  We relied on Mark Hulbert, publisher of <I><A HREF = "http://www.w2.com/docs2/b9/hulbert.html">Hulbert Financial Digest</A></I>, for performance numbers.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>American businesses expect to create half as many jobs in 1996 as they did a year ago</B>, according to a survey released Wednesday by Dun & Bradstreet.  Nonetheless, D&B's annual study found that 1.4 million new jobs will be produced this year, most at small firms with fewer than 20 employees.  Such small companies are expected to account for 39% of the job growth.  At the other end of the spectrum, large corporations with more than 10,000 workers are forecast to add 113,000 workers this year, "a significant reversal of the downsizing trend of the past decade," according to D&B economist Joseph Duncan.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Yahoo Inc. beefed up its popular search engine by joining forces with rival Alta Vista</B>, the two companies announced on Thursday.  Both <A HREF = "http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.altavista.digital.com">Alta Vista</A> will continue to operate independent services, but under today's agreement Yahoo will incorporate Alta Vista's search technology into its product — for an undisclosed price.  Yahoo is one of the better organized search engines on the Web, but far from the most comprehensive.  Alta Vista, a subsidiary of Digital Equipment Corp., isn't as well catalogued but covers more sites.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages this week moved into their highest territory in more than a year</B>, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said Thursday.  Standard mortgages averaged 8.30% this week, up from 8.03% a week ago and the highest they've been since April 13, 1995.  Other types of home loans were up, as well.  The initial rate on one-year adjustable mortgages averaged 5.86%, up from 5.76% last week; fifteen-year mortgages averaged 7.80%, up from 7.54%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of first-time applicants for state unemployment benefits increased by 9,000 last week</B> from the prior week, the Labor Department said Thursday.  New filings totaled 354,000 in the week ending June 1, up from a revised 345,000 seven days earlier (the number was initially reported as 346,000).  The four-week moving average of such benefits increased to 349,000 with the announcement.  Before passing judgment on the jobs picture, though, most economists are awaiting Friday's release of a more wide-ranging employment report by the Labor Department.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The largest municipality to ever declare bankruptcy moved a step closer to repaying bond holders this week</B>, as California's Orange County successfully sold new insured bonds to the public.  Officials plan to use some of the nearly $900 million raised Wednesday to pay creditors who were left holding the bag when the county filed for bankruptcy in December of 1994.<BR>

<H3>Despite the latest hoopla, investors should walk carefully in gambling minefield </H3>
Hilton Hotels spent $2 billion to buy Bally Entertainment this week so it could claim the mantle as the world's largest gambling company, with casinos in such far-flung locales as Australia, Egypt, Turkey and Uruguay.  The deal gives Hilton four casinos on the famed Las Vegas strip, as well as its first two properties in Atlantic City, among others.  Wall Street analysts and investors greeted the news excitedly on Thursday, bidding up stock prices and releasing glowing predictions about the combined venture's future.  The current backlash against organized gambling may soon take the bloom of the rose, though, dampening future growth for many in the industry.<BR>
<BR>
A decade ago, many states were in worse financial positions than they are today; gambling was viewed as a silver bullet that might solve any number of local problems.  Since then, though, gambling opponents have become far better organized and financed.  Groups such as the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling now oppose the expansion of gambling companies almost everywhere, generally questioning the economic benefits to communities.  Such groups argue that gambling increases welfare costs, bankruptcies, divorce and crimes such as embezzlement.  "Our goal is for this industry to be viewed as a pariah, much like the tobacco folks," says the NCALG's Tom Grey.  "Only we want it to happen faster than it did for tobacco:  It takes a teenage smoker 30-40 years to die of lung cancer, but a teenage compulsive gambler's life can go down the tubes almost immediately."<BR>
<BR>
Such sentiment is widespread enough to be a serious thorn in the side of gambling companies such as Hilton: As voters and legislators came to believe that gambling may not be a quick fix for local problems, 24 states in 34 separate referendums rejected expansion of casino sites, slot machines, parimutuel betting and other gambling in recent years.   The industry has matured quickly in the process, leaving the days of easy profits behind — companies will have to fight harder for customers, as a result.  In that respect, at least, gambling companies are very much like thousands of other publicly owned businesses investors might consider.<BR>

<H3>One argument for letting the kids out to enjoy that weekend sunshine</H3>

Don't be surprised if your kids want to go outside to play basketball, roller hockey or tennis over the weekend — they're just emulating their favorite athletes.  This weekend, the National Basketball Association and the National Hockey League will be blitzing television stations, radio stations and newspapers with promotional efforts to keep fans in a frenzy of interest as both leagues play out their title series.  Tennis fans will also have their day in the sun as the French Open finals are played in Paris.<BR>
<BR>
And you might not want to discourage your son or daughter:  Suffice it to say that the parents of athletes competing in such events don't have to worry about their retirement plans.  The NHL estimated Friday that each player on the winning team in the Stanley Cup finals will receive a <I>bonus </I>of $62,000.  The winning team in the NBA championship series gets to split up a $1.2 million reward, which comes out to more than $100,000 per player.  And that's all small potatoes compared to the French Open, where both the men's and the women's champion will receive a check between $600,000 and $700,000 for their weeks' work.<BR>
<BR>
Even if your child isn't destined to be the next Steffi Graf or Shawn Kemp, a little exercise is rarely a bad idea, right?<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>The stock and bond markets plunged sharply lower Friday morning in response to an unexpectedly strong jobs report </B>released by the Labor Department.  The markets calmed down in afternoon trading to make back most of the losses.  A huge jump in payroll jobs during May led those on Wall Street to worry that the Federal Reserve Board would be forced to raise interest rates at its next meeting, on July 2-3.  The Labor Department said the economy created 348,000 new jobs in May, more than twice as many as forecast.  In addition, the government revised the payroll growth in April to an increase of 163,000, up from the original report of a 2,000 gain.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Federal Reserve Board chairman said this week that the nation's job insecurity complex doesn't square with economic reality. </B> Speaking to a group of business leaders Thursday night, Alan Greenspan said the country has enjoyed a strong economy for more than five years now, featuring remarkably low inflation by historical standards.  Even layoffs have leveled off in recent years, he said.  Despite that, Greenspan said there is a sense among both white- and blue-collar workers that "something is fundamentally wrong."  To deal with such widespread fear, the Fed chairman suggested increased schooling and job training for all types of workers.  "People who believe that their skills are up to date and readily marketable do not inordinately fear job layoffs," he said.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A program to promote home ownership in rural areas was created Friday</B> by the Agriculture Department's Rural Housing Service, the Federal Housing Finance Board and the Local Initiatives Support Corp.  The new group, known as the Rural Home Loan Partnership, will initially operate in nine states and target rural borrowers with incomes of 80% or less of the area median income.  Private community development corporation in California, Louisiana, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York and Ohio will identify and counsel eligible buyers in those states.  The Agriculture Department has committed nearly $5 million for the program and the federal home loan bank system has promised $3.2 million.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The world's major oil-producing countries agreed to raise their daily quota to allow for Iraq's return,</B> after the United Nations recently agreed to allow Iraq back into the international market on a limited basis.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries raised its oil production ceiling to 25.033 million barrels a day on Friday, up from 24.52 million barrels.  As OPEC members hoped, crude oil traders showed little reaction to the announcement as prices fluctuated by only a few cents on the day.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The New York Stock Exchange named a new president on Thursday.</B>  William Johnston, 56, will replace Richard Grasso on July 1.  Grasso has held the post for 13 months.<BR>

<H3> Think twice before you sign on that (cellular phone) dotted line </H3>
Jeffrey Kagan of Kagan Telecommunications thinks consumers should be wary of cellular firms offering free phones or free air time in exchange for long-term service contracts.  He says cellular firms, worried about a new rival technology called Personal Communications Services, are trying to lure customers into two- or even three-year deals before prices fall sharply in the months ahead.  "People are getting scammed into signing a two-year contract just to get a free phone," Kagan says.<BR>
<BR>
Many analysts agree with Kagan that prices should be lower before long.  Most areas have only two cellular-phone carriers, but by year-end they could be joined by three or four PCS competitors as the Federal Communications Commission auctions off more licenses.  That means existing carriers will try to increase their customer base before the new competitors — along with the latest in digital technology — arrive on the scene.  "The existing carriers aren't going to sit back and let their customers go without a fight," says Michael Houghton of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.<BR>
<BR>
For the time being, you might be better off paying a slightly higher monthly fee for a short-term contract so that you don't lock yourself into one company's plan (and that company's higher rates).  Mark Lowenstein, a wireless consultant at the Yankee Group, says average cellular costs have remained relatively steady for about three years now, but they should fall as PCS competitors enter each market.<BR>
<BR>
PCS, which uses digital signals and operates on a different bandwidth than cellular phones, boasts tiny phones with longer battery life and cleaner connections than the current generation of wireless.  For more information about PCS and the changes it will likely bring to the wireless market, read <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1996/May/temay96.html">"Talk is Cheaper"</A> from the May issue of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>A gallon of gasoline is a penny cheaper than it was two weeks ago,</B> following nearly seven months of increases.  The average price for all grades of gas was $1.37 per gallon on Friday, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 service stations.  During the last survey, on May 24, the average price was 1.21 cents per gallon higher.  At self-service pumps nationwide, the average price on Friday was $1.31 for regular unleaded, $1.40 for mid-grade and $1.48 for premium.  When attendants pumped the gas, on the other hand, average prices were $1.61, $1.70 and $1.77, respectively.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Kellogg slashed prices on its popular breakfast cereals Monday,</B> responding to an earlier price cut by competitors Post and Nabisco (both owned by Philip Morris).  Kellogg Chairman Arnold Langbo said the price rollbacks will average 19% across 16 of the company's cereals — about two-thirds of its domestic cereal business.  Expected to show up on U.S. store shelves within a couple of weeks, the cuts will reduce the cost of Froot Loops by 27%, Frosted Mini-Wheats by 22% and Frosted Flakes by 18%, among other changes.  The Philip Morris cereal brands cut prices by an average of 20% in April.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Westinghouse Electric, one of the Dow 30 companies, might separate its industrial and media components into separate firms,</B> according to a <A HREF = "http://www.westinghouse.com/ci/pr_rel/1996/960610.htm">company statement</A> released Monday.  The statement said chief executive Michael H. Jordan has recommended that the Westinghouse board of directors allow the different company components to go their own ways.  No action is expected until October, at the earliest.<BR>

<H3> Job churning fast becoming the norm </H3>
American workers face, on average, a one in five chance that their jobs will be eliminated this year.  Not to worry, plenty more opportunities will be created in their place, says Gail Fosler, chief economist at The Conference Board in New York City.  She says that neither statistics touting the 2.5 million jobs that will be created this year nor similar numbers citing the number of jobs lost tell the whole tale.  "Beneath the surface, there is tremendous job churning going on as jobs are destroyed and new jobs created in their place," she says.<BR>
<BR>
Fosler will get little argument from economists on either front.  Job cuts for the first five months of 1996 are running 6.5% ahead of those in 1993, the largest downsizing year of the decade.  Nonetheless, we are near "full employment" according to many economists — with nearly everyone working who is willing and able to do so.  Nationwide, the unemployment rate is hovering slightly above 5%, the lowest point it's been at in a generation.<BR>
<BR>
The type of person who thrives in such an environment has to be adaptable to a variety of situations and comfortable with the notion of things changing around him or her, Fosler says.  "Workers are more affected by changes in the job market today because they are less able to find new jobs that are configured like their old jobs," she says.  "This may help explain why the issue of corporate restructuring strikes such a deep public chord."  A point not lost on politicians during this election year, which is why you are likely to hear much more about this subject between now and November.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>Wholesale prices fell in May, the government said Tuesday,</B> easing investor worries about runaway inflation following Friday's surprisingly robust jobs report.  The financial markets rebounded as soon as the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its May Producer Price Index this morning.  The PPI fell 0.1% last month after registering a 0.4% increase in April.  Led by a leveling off of gasoline prices, the energy sector's PPI slid 0.6%.  Food prices were unchanged during the month.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Employers can now give 401(k) advice to their workers, </B>the Labor Department said on Tuesday.  Many employers providing 401(k)s have refused to tell workers about retirement planning until now, fearing lawsuits if employees lost money.  The new rules announced Tuesday say companies can safely provide: basic financial and investment information; suggestions for allocating money among stocks and bonds; and worksheets or computer software to let employees calculate potential returns of different allocations.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The nation's second-largest full-service brokerage announced plans to start selling no-load mutual funds</B> on Tuesday.  Brokerage firms have traditionally scorned no-load funds, since such companies make their money charging commissions to investors (otherwise known as "loads").  But brokers have steadily been losing ground to no-load funds in recent years.  Smith Barney is planning to offer 400 no-load funds from 28 families, in addition to the 2,300 load-based funds it already sells.  The service won't be free, though.  While investors won't pay commissions to purchase the no-loads, they will be charged an annual fee of up to 1.5% to take part in the program.<BR>

<H3> Keeping your kids out of adult-oriented Internet areas </H3>
A U.S. court ruled today that aspects of the Communications Decency Act signed into law by President Clinton in February are unconstitutional.  The three-judge special panel issued a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the act's prohibitions against the distribution of indecent or "patently offensive" material to minors over the Internet.  "The Internet may fairly be regarded as a never-ending worldwide conversation," U.S. District Judge Stewart Dalzell said in the opinion.  "The government may not, through the CDA, interrupt that conversation."  The American Civil Liberties Union immediately posted <A HREF = "http://www.aclu.org/issues/cyber/trial.htm">the court's opinion</A> online — all 177 pages of it.<BR>
<BR>
That's fine for First Amendment scholars, you might say, but what if your kid is one of the four million children expected to go online this year?  It isn't difficult, after all, to stumble across raunchy graphics and sexually explicit discussions on the Web.  Keeping kids away from such cyberporn requires parental guidance and supervision.  But software programs can also help.  So-called "blocking software" allows parents to either restrict access to specific sites or filter out sites that feature words you decide are inappropriate.  If a child attempts to visit a blocked site, the programs either log off automatically or display a message that access is restricted.<BR>
<BR>
Different blocking programs work slightly differently, so you might want to test several before you settle on one.  Among the best choices, all available online, are:<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <A HREF = "http://www.solidoak.com/cysitter.htm">Cybersitter</A>, Solid Oak Software, $39.95.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <A HREF = "http://www.sprynet.com/about/products/kidbox~1.html">Internet in a Box for Kids</A>, SpryNet, $49.95.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> <A HREF = "http://www.netnanny.com/netnanny/product.html">Net Nanny</A>, Trove Investment Corp., $49.95.<BR>
<BR>
Prefer a low-tech approach?  A free brochure, <I>Child Safety on the Information Highway</I>, suggests you spend time with kids while they're online and provides tips for discussing online safety with them.  For a copy of the brochure, published by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, call 1-800-THE LOST (1-800-843-5678).<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>Consumer prices were slightly higher in May,</B> the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced on Wednesday.  The department said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.3% during the month, led higher by a 2.5% increase in the price of gasoline.  Overall, energy prices were up 1.1% in May, offsetting a leveling off of food prices.  Food was up 0.3% during the month, following an identical increase in April and a 0.5% jump in February.  The smaller increase was attributed to a decline of 2.6% in vegetable prices and a 1.6% drop in the going rate for fruit.  The CPI rose 0.4% in April.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Conservative investments made up the top three holdings of the nation's biggest mutual fund in April,</B> Fidelity Investments said Wednesday.  Fidelity Magellan's three largest holdings as of April 30 included Treasury notes due in 2005 and Treasury bonds due in 2023 and in 2026.  Four of the top ten holdings were Treasuries — a bond due in 2025 placed sixth among the ten.  Overall, Magellan's asset allocation as of April 30 was 70.8% equities, 19.2% bonds and 10% cash.  All told, Magellan has more than $55 billion in assets.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>More than 68,000 people filed individual tax returns showing adjusted gross income of $1 million or more in 1994,</B> <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> reported on Wednesday.  That represents 0.05% of all tax filers that year, an increase of 2,418 individual returns from 1993.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Agriculture Department revised its forecast for the winter wheat harvest by six million bushels</B> on Wednesday, up from last month's estimate.  Even with the revision, though, 1.37 billion bushels would mark the smallest harvest since 1978.<BR>

<H3> Mortgage and credit card defaults on the rise </H3>
The general drumbeat of economists these days is that Americans are in pretty good shape money-wise.  But late payments on credit cards are at their highest levels in more than 14 years and the percentage of Americans who fell behind on their mortgage payments increased "dramatically" during the first three months of the year.  Late payments on other types of consumer loans are up, also.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, consumer debt levels are higher than those seen in the late 1980s — just before the last recession hit.  If the economy slows down during the second half of the year, which some economists expect, it could put added pressure on the ability of consumers to make their loan payments.  Debt payments, excluding mortgages, already average $625 per month, or about 17% of the average household income in the U.S.  Such consumer-debt related problems might scream trouble to pessimists.<BR>
<BR>
Economist Lynn Franco with the Conference Board in New York City isn't ready to knuckle under to the naysayers, though.  "These figures are not daunting because most households do not appear to be incurring <I>excessive </I>debt," Franco says.  "Debt totals keep rising because more consumers are using their credit cards for a wider range of purchases.  Recent activity shows that consumers are still willing and, more importantly, able to spend."<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<LI><B>The economy's growth slowed further in May</B>, according to statistics released by the federal government today.  The Commerce Department said overall retail sales rose 0.8% during May after a 0.1% decline in April, with a turnaround in new-car sales responsible for the entire change.  If cars had been excluded from both monthly reports, retail sales would have posted a 1.1% gain in April and a 0.3% uptick in May.  The Labor Department also announced that first-time applications for state unemployment benefits rose to 360,000 last week from 354,000 during the week ending June 1, another sign of a slowing economy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Investors kept pouring money into the most aggressive of mutual funds in May,</B> the Investment Company Institute said this week.  For the second month in a row, funds categorized as "aggressive growth" raked in the lion's share of new investments.  Overall, investors bought an estimated $23 billion worth of stock funds during the month, down from April's $26 billion — yet enough to make May the third-best month for fund purchases in history.  For the first five months of the year, ICI estimated the net flow of money into stock funds to be $121 billion, just $9 billion shy of the one-year record set in 1993.  When measured as a percentage of total fund assets, though, the industry's monthly cash infusions aren't as high as they often were during the 1980s and early 1990s.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The New York state attorney general's office is looking into whether America Online overbills its customers,</B> AOL confirmed yesterday.  A company statement to that effect was released after an article in Wednesday's New York <I>Newsday</I> newspaper said a "formal investigation" had been launched into whether the service overcharges customers for the time they spend online.  <I>Newsday</I> also reported that there are lawsuits pending against AOL over billing issues in at least two other states.  With 6 million users registered worldwide, AOL is currently the largest online service.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>More banks may offer American Express and Discover cards in the near future,</B> if a Justice Department probe announced yesterday finds Visa USA's practices anticompetitive.  Investigators in the department's antitrust division are looking into Visa's policy of preventing banks that issue its cards from also offering those of competitors.  The government inquiry comes one month after the European Union said it wouldn't allow such rules in Europe.  The five-year-old Visa rule does not prevent banks from issuing MasterCards.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The largest retail store in Israel asked regulators for permission to sell shares in the U.S. today. </B> Blue Square-Israel Ltd. filed a request Thursday with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell up to six million American Depository Shares, each of which represents one ordinary share.  The company said it plans to sell two-thirds of the shares in the U.S. and one-third in other countries.  Blue Square runs 142 supermarkets, department stores and specialty retail shops under various names in Israel.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Securities and Exchange Commission is reviewing the proposed prospectus for an Internet-only sector fund,</B> a spokesperson for Munder Capital confirmed this week.  Munder, a subsidiary of Comerica Inc., filed the prospectus with the SEC last week and now must wait for the regulatory body's approval before proceeding.  Munder's "Net Net Fund" would hold only Internet-related stocks and would be sold exclusively through Comerica's Web site.  The SEC refused to comment on the proposal.<BR>

<H3> Summer travel roundup </H3>
Gasoline prices could drop by as much as ten cents per gallon in the coming months, Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary predicted this week — welcome news for the 81% of American families who plan to take a vacation this summer.  Cheaper gas would be especially well received this year, when cost-conscious travelers say they are planning frugal trips such as driving to campgrounds, vacation resorts or even relative's homes, according to a travel industry survey.  Only 26% say they will fly this summer.  A couple of trekking tips:<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Be sure to pack your health insurance card if you'll be going outside your region.  If you're covered by an HMO or PPO, know the rules for seeking care outside the insurer's network.  Industry experts say many travelers get stuck with bills for emergency medical treatment while on vacation because they forget to make a call to their insurer.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Mind your Ps and Qs if you plan to fly: Airline attendants say that dealing with unruly passengers is a priority this year.  Incidents such as one two weeks ago — British soccer fans allegedly did $7,500 worth of damage to a jetliner while returning to London after a game — galvanize both airline employees and passengers around tougher measures.  A number of airlines say they plan to equip crews with handcuffs starting this winter.  Others have quietly been doing the same thing for years.<BR>
<BR>
<LI> Avoid popular tourist destinations during the Fourth of July weekend.  Lon Anderson of the American Automobile Association says crowds are likely to be "at an all-time high" that weekend, thanks to the combination of holiday travelers and out-of-school kids.  The five most popular travel destinations this year are Orlando, Grand Canyon National Park, Los Angeles/Anaheim, Williamsburg, Va. and San Diego.<BR>
<BR>
<H3> This Father's Day, ties are out and Yoda's in </H3>
If you're running a little late in picking out a Father's Day gift, Brian Peck knows just what you're looking for — a limited-edition Yoda action figure, only $395.  A spokesman for Sharper Image electronics stores, Peck says Yoda (of the <I>Star Wars</I> movie trilogy) dolls are selling at a surprisingly rapid clip this year.  If three-foot-tall aliens aren't your dad's cup of tea, consider Nordstrom's best-selling (and more practical) Father's Day gift: Evergreen twill shorts, $25.  New York's up-market Hammacher Schlemmer store says $200 Jeep Boom Boxes are its best seller this year.<BR>
<BR>
Looking for something a little more down to Earth?  Traditional favorites such as breakfast in bed, a framed family photo or, yes, even ties are always welcome.  For more last-minute gift ideas, check out the <A HREF = "http://holiday.ritech.com/fathers_day/for.html">Simply Father's Day</A> or the <A HREF = "http://perfect.presentpicker.com/fathersday/father.html">Deardad.com</A> Web sites.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3> 
<LI><B>An executive said Fidelity will "look at" whether to close its flagship Magellan mutual fund to new investors.</B>  Speaking at a conference sponsored by Morningstar Mutual Funds this week, J. Gary Burkhead, president of Fidelity's research division, said the Boston-based fund company has no definite plans to close Magellan but would consider it in the future.  Magellan is the world's largest mutual fund, with more than $55 billion in total assets.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Car buyers are getting harder to please, according to the latest J.D. Power and Associates survey,</B> released Friday.  The average score for customer satisfaction fell to 119 this year from 122 in 1995, the first decline in the ten years that J.D. Power has done the closely-watched survey.  John Osborn, project director for the Agoura Hills, Calif., automotive consulting firm, said customer expectations are higher now in large part because of the wealth of car-buying information available on the Internet.  For a guide to online car information, read <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1995/September/on-line.html">"The Virtual Car Buyer"</A> from the September, 1995 issue of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Total production in the nation's factories, mines and utility companies rose 0.7% in May</B> after an identical increase a month earlier, the Federal Reserve reported Friday.  The Fed said that businesses operated at 83.2% of their total capacity during the month, up 0.3% from April figures.  The resulting higher output led to a 0.4% increase in business inventories, the Commerce Department announced separately on Friday.  And the increases come at a good time, with consumer confidence remaining high — consumers buy more products when they have confidence in the economy.  A survey released Friday by the University of Michigan shows its June index of consumer sentiment rising to 93.8 from 89.4 in May.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of stock brokers, traders, investment bankers and analysts on Wall Street is approaching the record level set just before the 1987 stock market crash,</B> according to the Securities Industry Association.  Wall Street hiring and firing has traditionally been cyclical in response to the market, and some fear that the latest hiring binge could be a sign the current bull market is getting long in the tooth.  At the end of March, the number of brokers, traders, investment bankers and analysts in the securities industry stood at 257,000, up 22% from 1990 statistics.  The record high was set in September 1987, when slightly more than 262,000 people held such positions.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are higher than they've been in more than a year,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said this week.  The most common type of home loan averaged 8.39% nationwide during the week, up from 8.30% a week earlier.  It hasn't been higher since the first week of April, 1995, when it was 8.41%.  The initial interest rate on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 5.91% this week, up from 5.86%.  Less-common 15-year mortgages averaged 7.90%, up from 7.80%.<BR>

<H3> Russian election returns bode well for investors — so far </H3>
With 98% of the ballots from the Russian presidential election counted late Monday, incumbent Boris Yeltsin led the field of 11 candidates with 35% of the vote.  Communist challenger Gennady Zyuganov garnered 32%, meaning he and Yeltsin will face each other in a run-off in early July.  Even though analysts predicted a Yeltsin win, the Russian stock and bond markets rallied on the news.  Investors fear that Zyuganov will renew price controls and renationalize newly private industries.<BR>
<BR>
Analyst Nataliya Kornitskaya of C.A. Atlantic Securities, a Boston-based research firm specializing in Russian equities, says the good times will keep rolling for investors in Russia if Yeltsin holds on to win the run-off election.  Despite Yeltsin's mixed economic record, Kornitskaya says, at least investors can predict his behavior and don't have to fear that he will pull the nation back into Soviet-style economic collapse.  "It's a devil-you-know versus devil-you-don't type of situation," she says.  "Nobody has any idea what Zyuganov is capable of, so they rightly fear the worst."<BR>
<BR>
U.S. investors can currently buy only seven Russian companies that offer American Depository Shares, all through the Bank of New York, but Kornitskaya expects that number to skyrocket during the second half of the year.  She warns potential investors to make sure they know what they're getting into, though:  "Russian equities will probably provide very high returns, but they are long-term plays right now.  To realize those profits, you may have to hold on for four or five years — and have a high tolerance for risk and volatility in the meantime."<BR>
<BR>
Other analysts see brighter days ahead for aggressive investors in many of the ex-Communist countries of Eastern Europe.  James Libera, editor of the <I>Closed-End Country Fund Report</I>, can be counted among them.  "The more advanced countries, such as Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, should do pretty well over a five-to-ten-year period," he says.  "The stocks are cheap, labor is cheap and there will be a flow of money from Western Europe to take advantage of that."<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3> 
<LI><B>New York is the most expensive U.S. city for business travelers and Biloxi, Miss., is the cheapest,</B> according to a new survey by <I>Business Travel News</I>.  The New York-based publication compared the daily cost of food, lodging, car rental and other miscellaneous expenses for business travelers in the 100 largest American cities.  With an average cost of $358 per diem, New York tops the list, followed by Washington, DC, Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia.  At the other end of the spectrum, Biloxi travelers spend an average of $144 per day.  Chattanooga, Tenn., Peoria, Ill., Springfield, Mo. and Mobile, Ala. round out the roster of least expensive cities.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Chinese and American negotiators reached a last-minute agreement Monday to avert a multi-billion-dollar trade war</B> over copyright infringement.  The U.S. had vowed to impose high import taxes on $2 billion worth of Chinese products starting Monday if the two sides failed to reach a compromise; China promised to retaliate in kind.  The U.S. withdrew its threat Monday after winning commitments from the Chinese to clamp down on 30 factories that produce counterfeit video tapes, compact discs and computer software.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>American manufacturing companies earned higher profits during the first three months of 1996 than they did during the final quarter of 1995,</B> the Commerce Department announced Monday.  The department's most recent quarterly survey of nearly 8,000 manufacturers showed profits averaging 5.8 cents per dollar of sales, up from 5 cents at the end of last year.  The companies' profits after taxes were also higher during the quarter, up to a combined $52.81 billion from $44.61 billion.  Despite the increases, though, profits remained below the levels of the first quarter a year ago.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Part-time workers don't necessarily fit the stereotypical "temp" mold, according to a new study</B> released last week.  The Conference Board's survey of 102 companies in the U.S., Australia, Canada and Europe found that lawyers, accountants, engineers and other "professionals" who choose to work less than full time account for more than half of all part-time workers.  "The dependent-care issue — be it child care or aging parents — has been the driving force for many individuals seeking part-time work schedules," Maria Laquer of the Association of Part-Time Professionals says of the study results.  Nearly one in five American employees now works fewer than 32 hours each week, according to the latest government statistics.<BR>

<H3> ValuJet shareholders left holding the bag after carrier halts flights</H3>

ValuJet stock plunged from $10 to $6.25 in relatively heavy trading Tuesday (trading as low as $4.50 during the day) after the beleaguered airline said it would voluntarily suspend all flights until the FAA agrees that its planes are safe to fly.  Once a Wall Street darling, ValuJet has been hammered relentlessly since the May 11 crash in the Florida Everglades that killed 110 people.  The day before the crash, the company's stock closed at $17.88.<BR>
<BR>
In a hastily called press conference at the Atlanta Airport on Tuesday afternoon, though, company president Lewis Jordan urged investors not to abandon the tiny low-cost carrier.  Jordan told reporters that ValuJet "has made a lot of money for shareholders" over the three-year company history, and that value investors should consider buying shares now because "we will come back as a successful, strong, safe, reliable and profitable" competitor in the airline industry.  <BR>
<BR>
But bottom feeders beware: Analysts aren't nearly as bearish on the company's chances as Mr. Jordan.  The latest survey of analysts who follow the stock by Zack's Investment Research found three calling the stock a "buy" and 10 calling it a "hold" or "sell" — and that was <I>before</I> today's decision to suspend operations.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3><UL> 
<LI><B>The Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed a public flogging for the enforcement division of Nasdaq,</B> the Associated Press reported Tuesday.  AP reported that the SEC sent a draft report to the National Association of Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's parent company, describing two years of investigations into how strictly Nasdaq enforces its own rules.  Allegedly, the SEC has proposed that the NASD agree to be censured — what amounts to a public scolding — but not fined for failing to enforce various trading rules.  Spokespersons for both the SEC and NASD refused to comment this afternoon.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Russian stocks and bonds rose again Tuesday after President Boris Yeltsin appointed a one-time rival to a high-ranking government post,</B> a move that investors evidently saw as boosting Yeltsin's re-election chances.  Stock prices surged more than 15% on Monday after it became clear that Yeltsin led the first round of presidential balloting over Communist rival Gennady Zyuganov.  Yeltsin and Zyuganov will meet in a run-off election July 3; General Alexander Lebed, who finished third in the voting, is likely to ask his voters to throw in their lot with Yeltsin after Lebed was appointed to a senior security position on Tuesday.

<LI><B>Fewer people fell behind in their mortgage payments during the first three months of the year</B>, than during the third and fourth quarters of 1995, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Monday.  The delinquency figures were still higher than during the same period a year ago, though.  The MBA's National Delinquency Survey for the first quarter found 4.46% of homeowners behind on their payments, down from 4.48% during the final three months of 1995.  The percentage was 3.94% during the first quarter a year ago.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Pacific Rim stock markets closed sharply higher Tuesday, buoyed by news of the U.S.-China trade resolution</B>.  Japan's Nikkei 225-stock stock average, for example, finished up 87.02 points, at a 1996 high of 22,332.40.  Hong Kong's blue-chip indicator, the Hang Seng Index, also gained on the day, up 87.79 points to 10,952.78.  Chinese and American negotiators reached a last-minute agreement Monday to avert a multi-billion dollar trade war, which might have hurt the economies of many nations in the Pacific Rim.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Higher mortgage rates finally took their toll in May, as construction startups on new homes and apartments fell nearly 5%</B>.  The Commerce Department said on Tuesday that housing starts totaled 1.43 million in May, down from 1.51 million in April and the lowest the monthly gauge has been since December.  Interest rates have been steadily rising for four months and are now higher than they've been in more than a year, which makes housing more expensive for borrowers and decreases demand.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>American workers were more productive in the first quarter,</B> the Labor Department announced Tuesday.  Non-farm business productivity, or output per worker hour, increased 2.1% during the January through March quarter, the largest jump in more than two years.<BR>

<H3> Emerging markets warrant second look, says Templeton's Mobius </H3>
A wise investor might well consider shifting some of her portfolio to the world's developing markets during the second half of the year, Mark Mobius said Wednesday at an international mutual fund conference in Cannes, France.  Mobius is in a good position to know, as president of Hong Kong-based Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, Inc. and manager of $8 billion in assets.<BR>
<BR>
With many worrying that the U.S. market's five-year run-up may be near its peak, Mobius said emerging markets deserve renewed consideration.  "Many investors are taking profits now in the U.S. and are searching for new high-yielding investments," he told fund managers and institutional investors at the conference.  "Continued strong economic growth indicates that companies in emerging markets still have upwards earnings potential, especially when competing markets are only likely to experience 3% growth this year at best."  As examples of better alternatives, Mobius said he expects China's gross domestic product to grow by 9% in 1996 and Hong Kong's to expand by 5%.<BR>
<BR>
The easiest way to invest in emerging markets is through a diversified mutual fund.  For a few suggestions courtesy of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>, read <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1996/January/iu.html">"What in the world is going on with emerging markets?"</A> from the January 1996 issue.  Individuals looking for more day-to-day information about emerging markets might also turn to a new Web site making its debut this week, <A HREF = "http://www.emgmkts.com/">Emerging Markets Companion</A>, or an old standby, <A HREF = "http://www.bloomberg.com/cgi-bin/tdisp.sh?bbn/snapshot.html">Bloomberg Business News</A>.<BR>

<LI><B>Olympic organizers remain more than $150 million in the hole with the opening ceremonies one month away.</B>  Construction work on housing, press facilities, welcome centers and two dozen arenas is nearly finished now, and "will be completely, 100% taken care of" before the July 19 kickoff, promises spokesman Nick Vista of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games.  Organizers expect to collect the final $153 million needed for infrastructure improvements through food, merchandise and ticket sales over the next four weeks.  "This city has never entertained the thought that expenses will not be covered," Vista says.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Federal Reserve Board found few signs of rising consumer prices in the most recent review of its 12 regional districts,</B> the department's latest "beige book" shows.  Released Wednesday, the analysis will be used by Fed policy makers when they meet July 2-3 to decide whether they should raise interest rates.  While some districts found rising prices for raw materials and producer goods, those increases had yet to translate into retail inflation.  The beige book is based on statistical reports from each of the federal districts and is published eight times a year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Detailed information about the strengths and weaknesses of various health plans is now available online</B> from the group that provides accreditation to 330 health maintenance organizations nationwide.  Starting Wednesday, the National Committee for Quality Assurance will provide <A HREF = "http://www.ncqa.org/accred/asr/asrlist.htm ">free in-depth reports</A> on 48 of the HMOs it reviews, comparing each plan to the national average in areas such as doctor qualifications and member rights.  The NCQA said that it expects to add 8-10 new plans to the list each month until all 330 are included.  If you want information about an HMO not included in the original 48, you can also <A HREF = "http://www.ncqa.org/ftpdocs.htm ">download a list</A> of all 330 plans and their accreditation status from the NCQA site.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Pint-size companies that export some or all of their products are growing faster than their small-cap brethren,</B> according to a study released by Coopers & Lybrand this week.  In a sampling of 434 small, fast-growing companies, Coopers found exporters projecting revenue growth of 31% this year, compared to 25% for non-exporters.  And the gap appears to be widening: A similar survey four years ago found exporters predicting 26% growth to non-exporters' 23%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The next target of Ralph Nader's consumer advocacy group is bank fees,</B> the Center for the Study of Responsive Law said this week.  The Nader-led movement intends to set up volunteer-run Financial Consumer Associations across the country to help people find the best banking deals, as well as to pressure banks, legislators and regulators to cap fees.  Project coordinator Janice Shield said the alliances are needed because, for example, checking account fees have increased at twice the rate of inflation in recent years.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Continental and Northwest topped the 1996 J.D. Power customer satisfaction survey for airlines,</B> the Agoura Hills, Calif. consulting firm said Wednesday.  In the poll of passengers who take more than 25 domestic round-trip flights each year, Continental was named the top airline for flights of more than 500 miles and Northwest for shorter hauls.<BR>

<H3>Homeowners wasting millions on mortgage insurance, group contends </H3>
If you've owned your home for a few years, it may be time to revisit your private mortgage insurance to make sure you're not paying for something you no longer need.  That's the word from the American Homeowners Association, which this week said that more than a million homeowners currently pay for PMI needlessly.<BR>
<BR>
PMI will pay off your mortgage if you default (though you would still lose the house); it's typically required by your lender if you can't provide a 20% or higher down payment.  As the years pass and your home equity increases to more than 20% of the house's value, though, the insurance coverage can usually be dropped — a message you may not hear from your lender.  And we're not talking about chump change: For a $200,000 home with 10% down, you'd pay nearly $900 per year for PMI.<BR>
<BR>
Lenders often neglect to tell homeowners about their ability to drop PMI because the insurance brings in so much money, according to Birmingham, Ala. lawyer Richard Freese, who has filed class-action suits on behalf of uninformed borrowers.  "I think it's intentionally done because it's a big, big moneymaker for these mortgage servicers," he says.<BR>
<BR>
Your annual mortgage statement should tell you when you can drop PMI.  If you can't figure that out, mail or fax a letter to your mortgage servicer requesting the information.  If you're already eligible, ask that the PMI be dropped as soon as possible.  You may have to meet some additional requirements for dropping the coverage and, in some cases, jump through a few hoops to see that it gets done.<BR>

<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3><UL> 
<BR>
<LI> <B> The Senate confirmed Alan Greenspan to a third term as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board on Thursday,</B> overcoming resistance from Democrats who think the Fed should loosen the economic reigns.  The 91-7 vote ends a four-month delay on President Clinton's renomination of the 70-year-old Republican to his post as the government's top fiscal policymaker.  By a closer 57-41 vote, the Senate also confirmed the nomination of White House budget director Alice Rivlin to serve as Greenspan's vice chair.  St. Louis economist Laurence Meyer was unanimously confirmed as Rivlin's replacement.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The rich are, in fact, getting richer, the Census Bureau confirmed Thursday.</B>  Pulling together reams of data released over the past three decades, the bureau found that changes in the nation's economy since the 1960s have rewarded higher-educated and more-skilled workers, increasing the income gap nationwide.  The statistics point to an increasing disparity between the haves and have-nots in every area the bureau looked at, study author Daniel Weinberg says.  The report, <A HREF = "http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/incpov.html">"A brief look at postwar U.S. income inequality,"</A> is available online.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Piper Jaffray's board of directors voted to reopen the ill-famed Institutional Government Income Portfolio fund to new investors,</B> the company announced Wednesday.  Piper agreed six months ago to pay $67.5 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought by shareholders after the fund lost more than 28% in 1994.  Supposedly a relatively safe fund focusing on government securities, it tanked after interest rates started going up.  The reason:  the fund had boosted total returns by holding derivatives that move in the opposite direction of interest rates.  The reborn fund will expand its investment focus and be renamed the Piper Jaffray Intermediate Bond Fund, according to a company statement.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>General Mills took another bite out of cereal costs this week,</B> announcing that it will either cut prices or offer bigger boxes at the same price on 27 types of cereal.  The company said that by early July, average price cuts of 11% will take effect for brands such as Cocoa Puffs, Lucky Charms, Total Raisin Bran and Trix.  General Mills is the nation's second-largest cereal producer; the largest and third-largest companies — Kellogg and Post, respectively — have announced similar cuts in recent months.  Smaller rival Quaker Oats also reduced prices this week.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages reversed course and came down this week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</B> said today.  The most common type of home loan averaged 8.30% during the week, down from 8.39% a week ago.  The downturn reversed 15 weeks of flat or rising rates.  Fifteen-year mortgages, popular with refinancers, were also down during the week, dropping from 7.90% to 7.81%.  On the other hand, the average initial rate on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages rose 0.02% to 5.93%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The U.S. trade deficit hit a record $8.63 billion in April, the Commerce Department said Thursday.</B>  Led by higher American purchases of overseas oil and cars, the deficit jumped 7.7% during the month.  Meanwhile, the Labor Department said Thursday that first-time applicants for state unemployment benefits fell by 4,000 last week.  New filings totaled 357,000, down from the previous week's revised sum of 361,000.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>High-tech stocks tumbled for the sixth consecutive session on Thursday, led down by concern over falling personal computer sales.</B>  On a day when most stock indexes remained relatively flat, the tech-heavy Nasdaq traded more than 20 points down in the afternoon before rallying to close 12 points lower.<BR>

<H3> How to select the right summer camp </H3>
Remember when summer camp was just about having fun and sitting around the campfire?  Not anymore.  With close to 18,000 camps nationwide offering opportunities that range from learning a new language to climbing a mountain, the selection of camps for your kids isn't as easy as it used to be.  The right camp might give your children the inside track to an Ivy league education, allow them to master a new skill or simply lead to an enjoyable summer vacation.  But how to choose?<BR>
<BR>
First, make sure the type of camp you pick matches the child's interest and is within your budget, says Jenny Beeh, editor of <I>Camp Management</I> magazine.  The cost of sending your kids to summer camp has gone up by as much as 150% this year in some areas as states, communities and school districts cut back because of budget difficulties.  But there are often less-costly alternatives available if you look around a little.  And, Beeh says, most camps offer some type of need and/or merit-based scholarships — especially in the case of the more expensive specialized camps.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I> recently polled teachers, parents and the American Camping Association to come up with a list of eight specialty camps across the country that stand out from the crowd.  For more information, read <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1996/March/shopsmrt.html">"Serious Summer Camp"</A> from the March 1996 issue.  There are also plenty of information sources available online, including <A HREF = "http://www.intercamp.com/directory">Intercamp</A>, which allows you to search for camps by geographic location, cost, special interest or even name.  Other helpful Web sites include <A HREF = "http://www.kidscamps.com">Kidscamps</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.nerdworld.com/nw1156.html">Nerd World Media</A> and <A HREF = "http://home.navisoft.com/camppage/index.htm">Camp Page</A>.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3><UL> 
<BR>
<LI><B>Internet users should be skeptical of stock hype online,</B> National Association of Securities Dealers chief executive Joseph Hardiman said this week.  "We are increasingly seeing the Internet, the Web chat rooms, being used for the wrong purposes," Hardiman said at a CEO forum in Toronto on Thursday.  Hardiman said individuals can quickly and easily promote a stock online without disclosing what their motive may be; he warned Internet users to be especially wary of penny-stock hype.  To illustrate, Hardiman pointed to the stock of tiny Comparator Systems, which moved from three cents to $1.17 in a single day (May 6) when it became a hot topic on several Web bulletin boards.  Within weeks, it was delisted by Nasdaq after crashing back to penny-stock territory.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The pace of new money flowing into stock mutual funds slowed this week,</B> according to AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif.  AMG said investors added $1.6 billion to their stock fund holdings in the week ended Wednesday, the lowest net inflow of cash in six weeks and lower than during the same week a year ago.  International funds led the pack during the week, collecting $530 million in new money, followed by aggressive growth funds, with a net gain of $410 million.  Overall bond fund assets remained relatively flat during the week.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The major online services are being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission for the way they tally peoples' bills,</B> <I>Business Week</I> magazine reported today.  Citing an unidentified source in the federal government, <I>Business Week</I> said the FTC is looking into whether online services lure customers in with free trial offers and then make it difficult to cancel the service when bills come due.  America Online, the largest service, already faces 12 customer lawsuits and an investigation by the New York State attorney general for alleged overbilling.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Fidelity Investments said Friday that it will impose greater curbs on employee stock trading by the end of the year.</B>  The action follows a two-year internal review of the mutual fund giant's ethics rules and media criticism of the personal trading activities of some of its fund managers.  "We want to guard against any appearance of a potential conflict of interest," says a company spokesperson.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>"Let them use plastic" a majority of parents say </B>when asked if their children should have a credit card by age 18.  In a survey of 1,000 households released this week by St. Louis-based Aragon Consulting Group, almost two-thirds of the nation's parents felt that older teenagers should have credit cards because it was more convenient for the parents.  At the same time, though, most parents in the poll felt that kids should have a job before getting a credit card and should pay off their balance in full each month.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Japanese stock market reached its highest level in four-and-a-half years on Friday,</B> with the blue-chip Nikkei 225 index moving 93.35 points higher during the day to 22,530.65.  The last time the average closed higher was January 9, 1992.  Analysts attributed the rise to comments made Thursday night by Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara, who said the government isn't planning to raise interest rates in the near future.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Wall Street stocks rose Friday in heavy trading as investors awaited the "triple witching hour" late in the day,</B> when futures contracts and stock options expired at the same time.  Triple witching strikes on the third Friday in March, June, September and December, and usually results in a volatile market as hedgers and arbitrageurs try to make a quick buck.  Some market watchers had predicted a swing in the Dow of 100 points or more on Friday, but traders shook off the effects of the triple witching hour for the most part.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>If you think you have trouble making ends meet, consider the plight of two Russian cosmonauts:</B> Yuri Onufriyenko and Yuri Usachev will be forced to spend an extra 40 days in space this summer because the Russian government can't afford to bring them home, the Interfax news agency reported Friday.  The pair is currently living and working in the Mir space station with American Shannon Lucid (who will leave aboard a U.S. space shuttle on schedule), but the Russian Space Agency can't afford to build the booster rockets needed to bring them back to Earth.  This is the second time this year that cosmonauts have been unable to return on schedule because of financial problems in the Russian space program.<BR>

<H3> The big get bigger in money-management industry </H3>
Ho hum, another day in the money-management industry . . .  Massive New York investment firm Morgan Stanley announced a $1.2 billion purchase Monday morning, muscling its way into the booming arena of mutual fund management with the acquisition of Van Kampen American Capital and its 102 funds.  Only a few hours later, CNBC reported that the Franklin and Templeton funds were close to buying Michael Price's Mutual Series funds for between $500 million and $700 million.  And published reports Monday said that investment behemoths Merrill Lynch and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are both actively searching for possible merger targets.<BR>
<BR>
Would you believe that merger and acquisition activity in the industry is slightly lower this year, if anything?  That according to San Francisco investment bank Putnam, Lovell & Thornton, which expects somewhere in the neighborhood of 40 mergers this year after a record 55 pairings in 1995.  The reason we're hearing more about them, says Putnam, Lovell & Thornton analyst Bruce Brewington, is that the big guys are finally getting into the act.  "The matchups in the past were often between small companies," he says.  "The deals we're seeing now are larger, which attracts more interest."<BR>
<BR>
Expect more consolidation involving big-name financial companies this year, Brewington says.  Tighter profit margins industry-wide are forcing the big companies to look farther afield in an effort to bring in new revenues, he says: "In the late '80s and early '90s, money was pouring into this industry and everybody was happy.  Now the flow is slowing down and companies are looking around for quick ways to grow — buying smaller fry is one easy answer."<BR>

<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3> 
<LI><B>Nearly 25,000 e-mail domain names will be suspended Tuesday</B> for failing to pay the $100 fee required for two years' rights to each name.  The National Science Foundation hired Herndon, Virginia company Network Solutions to track down deadbeat Internet sites and shut down those who refuse to pay the fee.  Deadbeats will have their names removed from master lists used by e-mail and Web browser programs, so other users won't be able to find them.  Those closed down Tuesday will have two months to pay up before they lose the domain name permanently, NSF says.  A domain name can host multiple e-mail addresses and Web pages — <I>kiplinger.com</I> is one example.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Orders for American-built machine tools fell 11% in May from April figures,</B> the Association for Manufacturing Technology reported Monday.  The drop-off follows strong sales during the first four months of the year, AMT President Albert Moore said in a statement, and year-to-date orders remain nearly 5% higher than at the same time in 1995.  On the brighter side, export orders more than doubled during the month, up 127.8% from April.  Year-to-date, export orders are up 41.1% over the first five months of 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Gasoline prices remain stubbornly high despite a drop over the past two weeks,</B> according to a new survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide.  The Lundberg Survey found an average price of $1.35.28 per gallon on Friday — 1.58 cents lower than it was June 7.  The price at the pump is still more than 17 cents per gallon higher on the year, though.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Moving to stem high inflation, the Bank of Israel boosted interest rates Monday by 1.5 percentage points,</B> jolting the financial markets.  The increase was the largest in almost two years and came in response to a 15% annual inflation rate in the country.  Stocks closed sharply lower across the board Monday and the shekel rose against the dollar in afternoon trading.<BR>

<H3> Group poised to submit online stock market proposal to SEC </H3>

The number of online stock swaps may now only be a drop in the bucket of the more than 600,000 trades that take place every day, but Andrew Klein thinks the dominant national and regional exchanges are dinosaurs anyway.  Klein, who received permission from the Securities and Exchange Commission in April to sell shares of his Spring Street Brewing Company directly to shareholders online, thinks it will only be a matter of time before buyers and sellers meet on the Internet to bypass the existing exchanges — in the process, leaving out many brokers who make money as the middlemen in the current order of things.<BR>

"If you look at how stocks trade today, it's really quite old-fashioned already," the former securities lawyer says.  "You call a broker, who calls another broker who calls another broker who looks at a computer screen at information put in by yet another brokerage house.  That's kind of silly, given the technology we have."  Jumping into the void, a group led by Klein's New York investment firm, <A HREF = "http://www.witcap.com">Wit Capital</A>, will file a proposal for an online exchange with the SEC some time this week or early next.  <BR>

<LI><B>Invesco Funds is allegedly having a difficult time keeping its mutual fund managers and analysts in-house</B>, <I>Barron's</I> reported over the weekend.  A number of high profile fund managers and analysts have left Invesco in recent months for companies offering higher pay, the weekly newspaper said.  Spokeswoman Laura Parsons said Denver-based Invesco has taken steps to retain top performers, even though it thinks <I>Barron's</I> exaggerated the situation.  "This is not an Invesco issue, this is an industry issue," Parsons said Monday.  "People are looking for talent right now, and we think it's a compliment to Invesco's record that our managers are in demand."<BR>

<LI><B>The Securities Industry Association today released a free educational brochure on savings and investing</B>, responding to eight problem areas cited by investors in a nationwide survey last November.  The 44-page brochure,<I> Investor Topics</I>, includes sections on investing basics, choosing a broker, understanding account statements and holding securities in a street name, among others.  SIA communications director James Spellman says the brochure won't be available online for several months, so to get a copy, send a stamped, self-addressed business-sized envelope to: Investor Topics, Securities Industry Association, 120 Broadway, 35th Floor, New York, NY 10271-0080.<BR>

According to the recent study, American consumers are more worried about business conditions and jobs. <br>
<br>
<LI><B>Sales of existing homes increased 1.4 percent</B> in May to a seasonably adjusted rate of 4.26 million, according to the National Association of Realtors' report released today.

<H3> Funds do a poor job of educating investors, regulator says </H3>

The mutual fund industry needs to do a better job of educating investors about how risky different types of holdings are, the SEC's top fund cop told Congress on Wednesday.  Reading from a prepared statement, Barry Barbash told a House subcommittee that an SEC survey completed this spring "raises significant questions about the financial knowledge of some mutual fund investors" — and he placed the blame squarely on fund companies.  <BR>
<BR>
By way of example, Barbash cited mutual fund prospectuses, often the first and sometimes the only fund information investors see.  More than four out of ten investors think mutual fund prospectuses are useless, he said, and survey respondents overall considered the prospectus only the fifth-best source of information about funds (behind employer materials, the financial press, friends or family and brokers).  "More can and should be done to make this information more useful to investors," he told the House securities subcommittee.<BR>
<BR>
As a result, Barbash said the SEC will announce a series of new rules this fall intended to boost the general level of investor knowledge about balancing risk and return.  Specifically, the commission is considering four initiatives: single-page "fund profiles" to be either distributed alone or with the prospectus; a "risk summary" section to be added to all prospectuses; easy-to-understand brochures for fund investors in employee-sponsored plans; and plain-English requirements for all printed fund materials.<BR>

<LI><B>May orders for manufactured durable goods were the highest they've been since the government began tracking them in 1958,</B> the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.  The department said orders totaled a seasonally adjusted $171.8 billion during the month, up 3.3% from April's figures.  Analysts noted, though, that the increase was attributable to commercial aircraft orders for the most part.  Excluding the transportation sector (which includes aircraft), May durables were up only 0.7% after a 1.8% increase in April.  Durable goods are items that are expected to last at least three years, such as home appliances.  Orders are considered a key gauge of the nation's manufacturing sector, and an increase could lead to more production and jobs.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Franklin and Templeton funds agreed to pay Michael Price up to $800 million for his mutual fund company</B> on Wednesday, the second large industry merger this week.  The purchase of Price's Heine Securities Corp. gives Franklin Resources, already the fifth-largest fund company, a solid beachhead in U.S. stocks — until now, Franklin and Templeton funds were primarily known for their international stock and U.S. bond funds.  The 44-year-old Price agreed to remain with the merged firm for five years.  Two of his Mutual Series funds, Mutual Qualified and Mutual Shares, rank among the top growth and income funds over the past five years in the July issue of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>.  On Monday of this week, <A HREF = "dn0624.html">Morgan Stanley bought Van Kampen American Capital</A> for $1.2 billion.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Oil prices rose 20 cents per barrel on Wednesday following the bombing of a Saudi Arabian air base</B> that housed U.S. Air Force personnel, killing 19 Americans and wounding nearly 400 other people.  The truck-bomb blast occurred Tuesday night at the King Abdul Aziz Air Base near Dhahran.  The Saudi Arabian state-run oil company, Saudi Aramco, is based in Dhahran, but sources told Reuters news service that oil tankers were loading normally on Wednesday afternoon.  Still, analysts worry that the bombing could undermine the stability of the world's largest exporter.  Saudi Arabia is home to more than 25% of the world's oil deposits and supplies 11% of the total world demand for crude oil.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Stock funds brought in 3.6% more new money than they gave out in May,</B> the Investment Company Institute said Wednesday.  Total assets of stock funds increased to $1.526 billion during the month, up from $1.474 billion in April.  Assets of the other three classes of funds — bonds, taxable money market and tax-free money market — were up slightly during May, ICI said.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Yields on five-year Treasury notes hit their highest point in more than two years</B> at Wednesday's auction.  The high yield was 6.674%, up from 6.565% at the last auction May 30 and the highest since five-year notes sold for 6.815% on April 26, 1994.  A total of $12.5 billion in notes were sold during the day.<BR>

<H3> The long arm of the Fed: Market jitters here and abroad </H3>

Pacific Rim investors from Australia to Hong Kong were jittery Thursday, leaving the major stock markets across the region mostly lower on the day.  The economic news out of most countries in that area of the globe has been positive of late and company profits are solid, so why the apprehension?  Analysts blame it on the Fed — the American Federal Reserve Board, that is.  Evidently, Pacific Rim investors are worried that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates in the U.S. next week, a move certain to spark a downdraft on Wall Street.<BR>
<BR>
Richard Fontaine, manager of Fontaine Global Growth fund, says many international markets follow the lead of New York these days, which means investors may not be getting as much diversification as they think by sending a portion of their portfolio abroad.  "If you get a bad market in the U.S., you're probably going to see ramifications of that as speculative money gets pulled back from the rest of the world markets," Fontaine says.  "So I don't think it's true that you'll be completely shielded from a bad domestic turn of events by investing overseas."<BR>
<BR>
Which is not to say that some foreign markets aren't more closely correlated with the U.S. than others.  If you're looking to cushion your investments in case the floor drops out from under American stocks, it still makes sense to put a portion of your investments in the international arena, say most analysts.  But which markets are likely to zig when Wall Street zags?<BR>
<BR>
Finance professor Campbell Harvey at Duke University's Fuqua School of Business has a good idea.  <A HREF = "http://www.duke.edu/~charvey/Country_risk/ccr/ccrtab1.htm">Harvey's Web site</A> will tell you how closely the markets in 47 countries follow in lock-step with the U.S. (the lower the number you see in the "Correlation with World Market" categories, the more each differs from the U.S.).  In general, Harvey says, stock markets in the world's developed countries follow Wall Street much more closely than those of emerging markets.  <BR>
<BR>
The most important thing to take away,  Harvey contends, is that putting some of your portfolio overseas is generally a good idea.  "Sometimes it's oversold, but international diversification does reduce the overall volatility of your portfolio regardless of where you're talking about," he says.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<LI><B>Employers are fretting that the low number of available workers may lead to wage inflation,</B> according to the Conference Board's May Help-Wanted Advertising Index, released Thursday.  A measure of job advertisements in 51 newspapers nationwide, the index fell in seven of the nine U.S. regions — possibly because employers are loathe to hire many workers for fear of pushing salaries higher.  "Extremely low unemployment has now been maintained for a year and a half," says Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein.  "Some businesses are worried that strong job growth could lead to labor shortages and upward pressure on wage costs."  Also on Thursday, the Labor Department said that the number of Americans filing first-time applications for state unemployment benefits fell by 2,000 from last week.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A day after agreeing to sell his business, mutual fund manager Michael Price announced plans for a new fund on Thursday</B>.  Mutual European fund will "buy cheap stocks in Europe," value investor Price says of the new offering, which will open for business on Monday.  Only a day earlier, Price agreed to sell his Heine Securities Corp. to the Franklin and Templeton funds for $610 million plus nearly $200 million in incentives and stock options.  Price, 44, is contractually obligated to remain with the company for at least five years after the merger is completed.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Consumers with complaints about the NASD or an NASD-registered broker have a new place to turn Thursday,</B> after the National Association of Securities Dealers announced the creation of a new Office of the Ombudsman.  An ombudsman typically is hired by an institution to investigate accusations against that institution, and the NASD tapped Bernard Thompson from its market regulation department to be the first to fill that role there.  Consumers with complaints about the practices, procedures or personnel of the NASD or Nasdaq stock market can email Thompson at <A HREF = "mailto:ombuds@nasd.com.">ombuds@nasd.com.</A><BR>

<H3>Taking stock at the year's half-way point </H3>

The first six months of 1996, like much of the past 14 years, has been a good time for investors in the U.S. stock market.  The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up almost 9% year-to-date, nearly equal to its historical average of 10% for the entire year.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 blue-chip stocks has done even better, increasing in value by more than 12% since New Year's Day.  And the small-cap Russell 2,000 index is up more than 8%.<BR>
<BR>
While anything is possible during the second half of the year, returns are likely to be more down to Earth in the next six months.  The June 14 issue of <I>The Kiplinger Washington Letter</I> said that stock prices will probably go down somewhat in the months ahead before recovering in the fall.  With the late-summer dip figured into the calculations, the newsletter forecast an overall market gain of around 12% for the year — still good, but not as overheated as the first half of the year might suggest.<BR>

<H3>Keeping your home safe from burglars</H3>
A home-security system buys not only peace of mind but also safety. Having an alarm--along with the yard signs and window decals--makes you nearly four times less likely to be hit. You have many choices, from do-it-yourself devices starting at $70 to elaborate systems that run to six figures.<BR>
<BR>
Want something in between? We shopped for three systems--basic, mid-range and customized--for a four-bedroom, two-story house. Each is hard-wired and can be monitored for about $25 a month. The costs below include a one-time fee of $60 for a phone connection. All come from ADT Security Systems.<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI><B>Basic (Cost: $258).</B> The heart of any system is the control panel. This standard one monitors all protected zones from an illuminated keypad by the door. It also has a battery backup in case the power goes off. A siren and sensors for two doors complete the circuitry around the house. 
A single motion detector can be placed on the keypad or positioned in a high-traffic area--the infrared detector senses body heat and motion and activates the alarm. A smoke detector is also included. When it is tripped, the control panel calls the monitoring service, which then notifies the fire department. Finally, you get a yard sign and window decals to warn potential intruders.<BR><BR>
<LI><B>Mid-Range (Cost: $1,722).</B> Includes everything in the basic package, as well as an upgraded control panel that's both wired and wireless. This can be useful if areas of your house are difficult to wire. Also included: a glass-breakage detector, which can detect vibrations from the impact of a break-in; six lamp modules, which will turn on the lights when the system is activated; six window detectors, a second smoke detector and two additional motion detectors.<BR><BR>
<LI><B>Customized (Cost: $6,077).</B> The mid-range package plus 15 wired screens ($150 per window), which will activate the alarm if an intruder cuts a screen, and a panic button, which will activate the system manually if an intruder gets past the other sensors. You also get a basement heat detector, which would alert you to an overheated furnace; an extra lamp module; nine additional window detectors; and cellular-phone capability, which prevents burglars from disarming the system by cutting your telephone line. This system also makes your house "smarter": It lets you control the system when you're away and allows you to turn on the lights from outside. </UL><BR>

<H3>In brief</H3> 
<UL>
<LI><B>30-year fixed-rate mortgages fell and adjustable rates rose this week,</B> according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. survey.  The 30-year fixed rate fell to 8.29 percent from 8.30 percent, while the initial rate on adjustable-rate loans rose to 5.98 percent from 5.93 percent.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B> An Agriculture Department report showed a startling low inventory of corn, </B>causing the corn future market to leap today.  The USDA report released today estimated 1.7 billion bushels of corn as of June 1, which was some 150 to 200 million bushels short of estimates.  Despite record high prices this spring, both export and livestock feed demand remained surprisingly vigorous.  High corn prices this summer will continue to curb demand before the new harvest.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B> Global toll-free "800" numbers moved closer to reality,</B> when the International Telecommunications Union cleared the way Friday.  Under the plan, a company's "800" number could be dialed from anywhere in the world instead of different numbers for each country.</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The economy grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent through the first quarter of this year,</B> according to the Commerce Department's report on the gross domestic product.  The GDP grew only 0.5 percent for the fourth quarter last year.  Also, the Commerce Department reported that the price index for gross domestic purchases, which measures the prices paid by U.S. residents, increased 2.4 percent in the first quarter.<BR>

<H3> Sino/Hong Kong merger a buying opportunity, say analysts </H3>

At midnight on June 30, 1997, exactly a year from now, Governor Chris Patten will officially turn control of Hong Kong over to the Chinese government — and then high-tail it back to England.  Investors probably shouldn't take their cue from Patten's flight, says Jim Rohwer, chief economist for the region in CS First Boston's Hong Kong office.<BR>
<BR>
In his new book, <I>Asia Rising</I>, Rohwer forecasts faster economic growth in Asia than any other region of the world in the decades ahead.  "If Asia's growth continues even at a somewhat more modest pace for the next quarter-century, the Asian economies by 2020 will be bigger than the economies of Europe and the Americas put together," Rohwer writes.<BR>
<BR>
Analysts we talked to on Monday agree with Rohwer's estimate and say that the region's best long-term growth play may, in fact, be in China and Hong Kong.  Carol Chuang, manager of the Matthews Pacific Tiger fund, says stocks in China and Hong Kong should be selling for 20-30 times earnings according to the fundamentals, but only retail for 12-13 times earnings because of widespread apprehension about the Chinese takeover.  "There's a lot of skepticism regarding Hong Kong and China right now, which provides a great buying opportunity for investors," Chuang says.<BR>
<BR>
Richard Farrell, co-manager of the Guinnes Flight China & Hong Kong fund, agrees.  "We believe China is the most interesting investment in Asia at present and will continue to be for a long time," Farrell says.  All we spoke with agree that Hong Kong residents are likely to lose some political freedom in a year's time, but that China is likely to stick to its agreement to let Hong Kong's economy operate relatively unimpeded — and make money.<BR>
<BR>
Investors looking to buy into emerging Asian stocks have the option of investing through open-end mutual funds, which typically hold stocks from several countries, single-country closed-end funds or individual company American Depository Shares.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<LI><B>Charles Schwab lowered the commission it charges for online trading,</B> the company announced Monday.  Effective immediately, Schwab is charging a flat $29.95 for trades of as many as 1,000 shares on its <A HREF = "http://www.eschwab.com/">e.Schwab</A> online brokerage service, $10 less than customers have paid up to now.  The service requires a $5,000 minimum account balance.  For more information about online brokerages, read our recent article <A HREF = "dn0625.html">"Group poised to submit online stock market proposal to SEC."</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Consumer incomes were higher in May, boosting both spending and saving during the month,</B> the Commerce Department reported Monday.  The level of income after taxes increased 1.3% in May, the largest gain since a 1.6% increase in May of 1994.  With a little extra cash in their pockets, consumers spent 0.8% more during the month than they had in April, the sharpest uptick in three months.  At the same time, the Commerce Department said that four cents of every consumer dollar in May went into savings, up from 3.5 cents a month earlier.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Manufacturing activity surged at U.S. factories in June following May's increase in consumer spending,</B> the National Association of Purchasing Management said Monday.  NAPM's manufacturing index rose to 54.3 in June from 49.3 a month earlier — its highest reading since February 1995.  When the index comes in above 50, factory output is thought to be increasing.  The benchmark 30-year government bond fell seven-eighths of a point immediately after the announcement as traders expressed fear that it increases the odds of a Federal Reserve Board interest-rate hike this week.  Cooler heads prevailed later, though, as the long bond rebounded to finish the day down just slightly.<BR>

<H3> Lawsuit futures pay off with Supreme Court's S&L decision </H3>

The Supreme Court's ruling this week that Congress acted illegally in 1989 when it tightened savings and loan accounting rules is bad news for taxpayers: The decision could add as much as $20 billion to the cost of cleaning up failed S&Ls.  Despite that prediction, though, a few investors found the judgment much to their liking: S&L stocks surged after the ruling and investors holding the case's lawsuit futures turned a tidy 44% profit by day's end Monday.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Lawsuit futures?</I>  Evidently, futures contracts aren't just for farmers who want to lock in a price before harvesting the crops anymore.  John Phillips, a spokesman for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, says that over the past two decades, contracts have emerged on the various commodity exchanges in the U.S. for everything from international currency fluctuation to the price of unleaded gasoline.  "You can trade contracts on all kinds of esoteric things on the exchanges these days," he says.<BR>
<BR>
Because futures are so speculative — investors are essentially betting on the future direction of something over a specified time period — most trading takes place between large, institutional investors who want to hedge their investments to protect against large-scale losses.  But there are still individual speculators who trade in the futures markets, Phillips says.  <BR>
<BR>
For the occasional sophisticated investor who wants to invest a little bit of her portfolio in futures, there are an assortment of related Web sites to peruse (each exchange tends to specialize in a different brand of futures trading):  <A HREF = "http://www.cbot.com">Chicago Board of Trade</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.cme.com">Chicago Mercantile Exchange</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.imex-fx.com/">International Monetary Exchange</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.kcbt.com">Kansas City Board of Trade</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.midam.com">Mid-America Commodity Exchange</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.mgex.com">Minneapolis Grain Exchange</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.csce.com">New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.nyce.com">New York Cotton Exchange</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.nymex.com">New York Mercantile Exchange</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3> 
<UL>
<LI><B>Bond prices dropped for the second day in a row on interest-rate worries,</B> following news on Tuesday that sales of new homes in May reached their highest level in a decade.  The yield on the widely followed 30-year government bond, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose three basis points on Tuesday to close at 6.94%.  The catalyst for the drop was the Commerce Department's announcement that U.S. sales of new single-family homes surged in May, shaking off higher mortgage rates to increase 7.5% over April figures.  Traders worry that such news will push the Federal Reserve Board to increase short-term interest rates during the two-day meeting that started Tuesday afternoon in Washington, DC.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Scudder, Stevens & Clark announced plans for its first junk-bond fund on Monday,</B> unveiling the Scudder High-Yield Bond fund.  The fund is designed for investors willing to accept more risk than Scudder's other fixed-income funds in exchange for higher potential return, according to a company statement.  "Since they are a special hybrid between equities and bonds, offering diversification benefits, [high-yield bonds] can play an important role in the long-term investment portfolio," says Mark Casady, Scudder's domestic mutual fund chief.  Information on the fund is not yet available on <A HREF = "http://www.scudder.com">Scudder's Web site</A>, but investors can still get a prospectus the old-fashioned way — by calling 800-225-2470.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>America Online began offering a new pricing plan this week,</B> responding to competition from smaller companies that provide Web browsers, email and unlimited Internet access for as little as $14 per month.  Under AOL's new scheme, subscribers can opt to pay $19.95 per month for 20 hours of connection time; the previous base rate was $9.95 for ten hours, with additional hours billed at $2.95 each.  AOL's largest competitor, CompuServe, unveiled a new pricing plan in March that charges $17.95 per month for unlimited Internet access.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Index of Leading Indicators rose 0.3% in May,</B> the Conference Board reported Tuesday.  Designed to predict economic trends six to nine months down the road, the index rose for the fourth consecutive month in May.  Analysts said the report bolsters claims that the current economic expansion still has wheels.<BR>

<B>Our selection of consumer, business and financial news that matters to you, your money and your career.</B><BR>
<BR>
by <A HREF = "mailto:snelson@kiplinger.com">Scott Bernard Nelson</A> <BR>
<BR>
<I>Last Updated: July 3, 4:30 p.m. EDT</I><br>
<BR>
<H3> Fed leaves interest rates unchanged — for now </H3>

"The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 12:50 p.m.," Fed spokesman Joseph Coyne said in a brief statement Wednesday afternoon.  "There is no announcement."  <BR>
<BR>
With that simple declaration, weeks worth of hand-wringing on Wall Street (and across the globe; read our recent article <A HREF = "dn0627.html">"The long arm of the Fed: Market jitters here and abroad"</A>) came to a happy end.  Investors could stop worrying that a Fed interest-rate hike would curtail consumer spending — and dig into company profit margins.  The stock and bond markets responded within minutes, reversing several days worth of declines that ran through Wednesday morning.  <BR>
<BR>
But the announcement may only be a brief stay of execution rather than a reprieve, many analysts believe: There is still widespread belief that the Fed will soon begin to apply the economic brakes out of fear that too much growth will lead to runaway inflation.  Some watchers think the Fed will take action at its next meeting, on August 20.  An interest-rate hike at that point would be the first in nearly 18 months, and would come on the heels of a period in which the Fed engineered three rate cuts in an effort to keep the economy out of a recession.<BR>
<BR>
David Kelly, an analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York City, says the Fed is most worried about low unemployment pushing wages up and kicking off a bout of high inflation.  He says the central bank policy-makers will be closely watching the June and July labor reports before the next meeting.  "It will be a close call again in August, but I suspect they will end up raising rates by 25 basis points," Kelly says.<BR>
<BR>
Not everyone agrees, of course.  One of Kelly's counterparts at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, Jennifer Moran, thinks the Fed will either maintain its present course or reduce rates in August.  "The economy will begin to moderate on its own during the second half of the year," Moran says.  "As the third-quarter numbers coming rolling in and appear less than robust, there is a chance the Fed will move to lower rates."<BR>
<BR>
Editors of <I>The Kiplinger Washington Letter</I> would likely side with Kelly.  The June 14 issue of the newsletter correctly forecast that the Fed would hold rates steady at this week's meeting.  But it also said that short-term rates are likely to get boosted by a quarter of a point in the next few months, pushing the prime rate from 8.25% to 8.5%.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3> 
<UL>
<LI><B>Most Americans are keeping their jobs and spending more money,</B> according to new government statistics released Wednesday.  The Commerce Department said orders to American factories increased 1.9% in May, the largest monthly gain since last August.  Orders for durable goods, such as cars and appliances, jumped 3.4% higher during the month; orders for nondurables, such as clothing, only gained 0.1%.  Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that initial claims for state jobless benefits fell to 351,000 last week from 355,000 the week before.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The dollar rose to a 29-month high against the yen in international currency markets Wednesday</B> amid reports that Russian President Boris Yeltsin suffered a heart attack and uncertainty over interest rates in Japan.  The dollar is typically seen as a safe harbor in times of global turmoil, which might explain the American currency's climb to 110.69 yen and 1.5295 deutsche marks to the dollar.  The German newspaper <I>Bild Zeitung</I> set off the buying binge in the dollar when it reported Wednesday that Yeltsin has avoided the spotlight in recent days because of a heart attack he suffered late last week.  The paper cited unidentified sources inside the Russian government.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Nearly 1,000 brokers and financial planners signed up to be among the first wave of Chartered Mutual Fund Counselors,</B> the National Endowment for Financial Education says in the July issue of <I>NEFE Digest</I>.  The quick response broke NEFE records for new-program enrollment as investment advisers all but tripped over themselves in an effort to add the CMFC acronym to their business cards.  To earn the designation, planners, brokers and others have to pass a three-hour exam covering such topics as types of mutual funds, fund expenses and fees, asset-allocation strategies and the concept of risk and return.  For more information, contact the NEFE's Student Service Center at 303-220-4800.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The lead in the horse-race between the major Internet search engines changed hands this week,</B> according to Marlboro, Mass.-based <A HREF = "http://www.lycos.com">Lycos</A>.  In a statement released Tuesday, Lycos advertising director Bill Townsend said his company's search engine now lists the addresses of nearly 51.2 million pages on the World Wide Web, which would make it the largest index available online.  Such services catalog Internet sites online so that users can search the millions of sites by keyword or topic.  Lycos' major competitors include <A HREF = "http://www.altavista.digital.com">Alta Vista</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.excite.com">Excite</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.hotbot.com">Hot Bot</A>,<A HREF = "http://www.infoseek.com"> Infoseek</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.metasearch.com">Metasearch</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.webcrawler.com">WebCrawler</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The gap between the value of American investments held by foreigners and that of international investments owned by Americans grew sharply in 1995,</B> with U.S. investors on the low end of the calculation.  The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that the gap grew 40% in 1995 to $814 billion, if measured according to the price investors paid for the respective investments.  If investments are valued according to current price, though, the increase was even more steep.  In that case, the chasm widened 57% during the year to $773.7 billion.  Analysts attribute much of the increase to the fact that American markets outperformed most world markets in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.14% this week, down from 8.29% a week ago,</B> according to a survey released Wednesday by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  The introductory rate on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 5.94% on the week, down from 5.98% a week earlier.  And fifteen-year mortgages, popular with refinancers, averaged 7.67%, down from 7.82%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>How do your mutual funds stack up against the averages? </B> The typical U.S. stock fund gained 4.77% in the second quarter and 10.84% over the first six months of the year, Lipper Analytical Services reported this week.<BR>

<H3>Aggressive investing may be brokers', not investors', doing </H3>

Mutual fund investors have been pouring money into more volatile sectors such as aggressive-growth stocks and emerging markets of late, much to the concern of market watchers.  A study released over the weekend, though, concludes that the sales practices at full-service brokerages may be as much to blame for that as investor tastes.<BR>
<BR>
San Francisco-based Prophet Market Research & Consulting sent "mystery shoppers" into branches of 21 full-service brokerage houses in recent months.  Each shopper played the role of an unsophisticated prospect with about $30,000 to invest.  The results?  Most brokers made quick investment recommendations before taking time to learn about individual financial situations — and more investors were steered toward stock mutual funds or individual stocks than during a similar 1995 study.<BR>
<BR>
Scott Galloway, one of the study's authors, says that full-service brokers can only justify their high costs by dramatically improving their customer service in the future.  "Why would I need a full-service firm to sit me down and put me into a mutual fund without determining what my needs are," Galloway asks.  "I could get the same service from a discount broker or a no-load fund at a lower cost."<BR>
<BR>
Benjamin Edwards III, chairman and chief executive of A.G. Edwards & Sons, agrees with Galloway's assessment.  In a statement released by the St. Louis-based brokerage house, Edwards said the results "give us a challenge.  Rather than rest on our laurels, we've got to go back to the basics."<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<LI><B>Wobbly U.S. stock and bond markets eased up off the canvas on Monday</B> after getting floored by a surprisingly strong June labor report on Friday.  Bargain hunters jumped into the market to keep Wall Street from getting bloodied further, leaving Monday's market down only slightly after the carnage three days earlier.  On Friday, the Labor Department reported the creation of 239,000 new jobs in June, a six-year unemployment low of 5.3% and the largest jump in hourly wages on record.  Reacting immediately, stocks lost more than 2% on the day and the 30-year Treasury bond posted its fourth-largest price decline in history.  Many analysts fear that the Federal Reserve Board will now be forced to raise interest rates in an attempt to curb wage inflation.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Taxi drivers still have the most dangerous jobs, but workplace violence is up for everyone,</B> according to a government report released Monday.  The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health says murders and physical assaults in the workplace grew to a record level in 1994, the last year for which statistics are available.  Assaults during the year were most common for those who deal with the public, exchange money or provide services.  NIOSH director Linda Rosenstock says that the crime rate may continue to climb as the U.S. economy shifts increasingly toward service industries.  Other high-risk occupations: bailiff, police officer, detective, gas-station attendant and clerk at liquor or jewelry stores.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The New York microbrewery that offered the first online IPO direct to shareholders is back for a second round,</B> Spring Street Brewing Company announced Monday.  Spring Street raised $1.6 million last year in its first online stock sale; it is offering $3.3 million in stock this time, according to a company statement.  In addition to making beer, Spring Street owns 10% of Wit Capital Corporation, a newly formed investment bank that hopes to create the first online stock market.  A company prospectus is available through <A HREF = "http://www.witbeer.com">Spring Street's Web site</A>.<BR>

<H3> Big Bertha threatens Southeastern homeowners — and their insurance </H3>

Hurricane Bertha's 115-mph winds continued to flirt with the coasts of Florida, Georgia and South Carolina on Tuesday — leaving storm watchers unsure whether the gale would belt the Southeastern U.S. or move harmlessly out to sea.  Floridians are praying for the latter, if for no other reason than to keep the state's homeowners-insurance market stable.  Just four years ago, Hurricane Andrew left $16 billion worth of damage in its wake and spooked insurance companies, which suddenly found themselves footing the bill to rebuild South Florida.<BR>
<BR>
Since then, premiums and deductibles for homeowners insurance in Florida have skyrocketed, choices have evaporated and coverage is now more spotty than ever.  Insurers have stepped back from providing coverage in the state, making it increasingly difficult for new homeowners to protect themselves from natural disasters.  It's now rare for a home buyer to have any choice but to join the state government's insurance pool, which was created as a short-term insurer of last resort.  The story sounds familiar to those living in areas vulnerable to serious hail storms, high winds, flooding or earthquakes.<BR>
<BR>
Which means that if you're thinking about moving into your dream house in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, California or other "at risk" locales, make sure you figure the extra cost of homeowners insurance into your budget: It can cost as much as $10,000 per year in some areas.  Floridian Helen Rosenthal, who is still trying to straighten out Hurricane Andrew-related problems with her Broward County condominium, says potential homeowners should ask themselves three questions before moving to such areas: Can we get insurance at all?  If so, can we afford it?  And would we be adequately covered?  "Don't think about buying before you have the insurance situation figured out," she advises.<BR>
<BR>
For more information on coverage in at-risk areas, read "<A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/newsletter/living.html">Homeowners Insurance: It Could Cost More Than You Expect</A>" from the March issue of <I>Kiplinger's Retirement Report</I>.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3> 
<UL>
<LI><B>U.S. money managers are becoming more bearish on American stocks,</B> a new Gallup poll shows.  Over the past two weeks, Gallup surveyed managers at 52 firms handling $1.6 trillion in assets; 17% said they are likely to sell U.S. stock in the near future, compared with 6% in early June.  Slightly more than one-third of the managers expect the general U.S. economic situation to improve in the next 12 months, down from a high of 63% in March.  The professional investors also said they will be more choosy going forward than they have been in recent months.  One-quarter of the managers said they are planning to buy more Japanese stocks; U.S. technology stocks and U.S. bonds were also popular.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>More signs of a strong U.S. economy  today,</B> as the Commerce Department announced the May level of business inventories.  Commerce said that during the month, the amount of unsold goods on wholesalers' shelves fell 0.2% from April figures, which means consumers are buying faster than manufacturers are making.  The new data comes on the heels of Friday's unemployment report, which pointed to a strengthening jobs picture nationwide.  Taken together, such statistics  are bad news for stocks; they point to an energetic economy and, possibly, higher inflation — which many fear will cause the Federal Reserve Board to raise short-term interest rates.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>T. Rowe Price announced the creation of a new value-oriented stock mutual fund on Tuesday.</B>  The T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Value fund is available immediately and will be managed by Greg McCrickard, who has been at the helm of the OTC Securities fund since September 1992.  In the nearly three years since, value-leaning OTC Securities has returned an annualized 20.8%, leading both the Dow Jones industrial average (17.9%) and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index (15.4%).  The minimum initial investment is $2,500, or $1,000 for retirement accounts.  A prospectus is available from the <A HREF = "http://www.troweprice.com/pros/?MCV">T. Rowe Price Web site.</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The cereal-price wars moved to a new front on Tuesday,</B> as Malt-O-Meal announced price cuts on its already lower-priced bagged cereals.  Malt-O-Meal said it is reducing prices by an average of 12% on its Apple Cinnamon Toasty O's, Tootie Fruities, Corn Bursts, Golden Puffs, Honey Nut Toasty O's, Marshmallow Mateys, Colossal Crunch, Coco-Roos, Frosted Flakes and Toasty O's cereals.  In recent months, General Mills, Kellogg, Post and Quaker have slashed prices on their boxed products, but Malt-O-Meal's announcement is the first in the lower-priced bagged-cereal market.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B><A HREF = "http://www.ajb.dni.us">America's Job Bank</A>, the online help-wanted service run by the government, added IBM to its stable of prospective employers,</B> the Labor Department reported Tuesday.  IBM will place its 24,000 annual job openings on the site, adding to the half-million openings already posted there.  The job bank lists openings at private companies and placement agencies.  Positions are removed as they are filled.  Job seekers might check there or at the thousands of related sites that can be found via the major Internet search engines.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The level of consumer debt continued to climb in May,</B> though the rate of growth slowed, the Federal Reserve Board announced this week.  Total consumer debt in the month rose $4.7 billion from April's figures to $1.15 trillion.  The good news, if you can call it that, is that the rate of increase slowed to an annual rate of 4.9% in May, down from 7.2% a month earlier.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Cable TV companies will help equip the nation's schools with high-speed Internet connections, </b>a consortium of the firms announced at a New York City press conference Tuesday.  TCI, Time Warner and other large cable companies said they hope to equip almost all U.S. elementary and secondary schools with high-speed cable modems free of charge.  The cable industry hopes to head off similar overtures by phone companies, several of which recently promised to ante up millions of dollars to get schools online.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>Brokers beware: There's a bull market afoot in no-load stocks </H3>

Catering to investors who would just as soon do their own research and skip trips to the broker, the group of companies allowing people to buy stock directly has doubled in size during the past 12 months.  More than 100 companies now allow investors to leave brokers out of the stock-buying equation — and information about most of them is available online.<BR>
<BR>
Many investors confuse direct-purchase plans — also known as no-load stocks — with their more-common relatives, Dividend Reinvestment Plans (DRIPs).  Both allow you to buy shares straight from the company.  The difference lies in the fact that you have to own shares in a company <I>before </I>you can enroll in its DRIP program, so you have to go through a broker to buy at least one share.  True no-load stocks, on the other hand, allow you to buy shares direct from the get-go.  There is often a small fee to open an account with a no-load-stock plan (to cover paperwork, etc.), but it rarely approaches the $50 or more that most brokerages charge.<BR>
<BR>
There is no single online site that provides information on all companies with direct stock-purchase plans, but there are several good places to begin a search.  The <A HREF = "http://www.natcorp.com/ir/direct.html">National Corporate Services</A> site provides basic information about purchasing stock direct, as well as either hyper-links or phone numbers for 85 companies that offer them.  <A HREF = "http://www.calweb.com/~mkeller/noload/">CalWeb Internet Services</A> provides the same sort of index, with a listing of 79 no-load American companies and 18 foreign firms offering direct-purchase American Depository Shares.<BR>
<BR>
The <A HREF = "http://www.irnet.com/scripts/ethos.exe?WWW+p_IEShareholderComm">Direct Stock Purchase Plan Clearinghouse</A> goes a step further: It will take your address (mailing, not email) and send you actual prospectuses for up to 32 companies with direct-purchase plans.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<LI><B>A dozen large companies have promised a low-cost Internet-access device in recent months, but a small California firm was the first to deliver the goods.</B>  WebTV Networks Inc. demonstrated its invention at a press conference Wednesday, leapfrogging industry big-wigs such as IBM and Oracle.  The company overcame an important hurdle by making Web pages look good on TV screens, which have lower resolution than most computer monitors.  Sony and Philips Electronics said they will start selling VCR-like appliances that cost less than $300 and are based on the technology within three months.  "This could be the hottest thing for Christmas," Philips' marketing chief Ed Volkwein said.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Colonial Mutual Funds and Newport Pacific Management teamed up to offer a pair of new Asia-specific funds,</B> the companies announced last week.  The two firms hope to capitalize on the success of their first joint venture:  Manager Jack Mussey has guided the $1.4 billion Colonial Newport Tiger fund to average annual returns of 18.9% over the past five years, outdoing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index by 4% a year.  The Colonial Newport Japan fund and the Colonial Newport Tiger Cub fund, though, will be directed by two newcomers to the fund-management business.  Information about the funds isn't yet available online, but you can get prospectuses by calling 800-248-2828.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Authorities said Wednesday that some brokers paid other people to take their licensing exams,</B> confirming published reports.  Martin Kuperberg of the National Association of Securities Dealers said the NASD, the New York state attorney general and the Manhattan district attorney are investigating a "substantial" number of brokers at small- and medium-sized firms in the New York City area, but he refused to be more specific.  Results of the investigation will be announced in the next four to six weeks, Kuperberg said.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Nissan's Infiniti division passed Toyota's Lexus division in the race for new-car buyers' customer satisfaction,</B> according to the latest J.D. Power and Associates survey.  The new poll, released this week, marks the first time Lexus hasn't finished atop the widely reported rankings in five years.  Honda's Acura division finished third.  Toyota was also felled from the top position among new-truck buyers for the first time in five years.  Honda, which sells the Passport utility vehicle and the Odyssey minivan, rated highest in that category.<BR>

<H3> Doling out disaster relief:  Who gets help after calamity strikes?</H3>

A million residents of Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas and Virginia spent much of the past week battening down the hatches in preparation for Hurricane Bertha.  Despite the best efforts of coastal dwellers, though, Bertha's 105-mph winds will wreak havoc if and when the storm reaches land.  If that happens, expect the government to quickly step in to help rebuild battered homes and businesses for residents — some more than others, as it turns out.<BR>
<BR>
When hurricanes, floods, tornadoes or other natural disasters strike, a new study finds that statistically it helps to be a young, married, well-educated, white female if you want a helping hand from the government.  If you don't match most or all of those demographic characteristics, you'll probably get less aid, says psychologist Krys Kaniasty of Indiana University of Pennsylvania.  "It's a clear pattern," Kaniasty says.  "The elderly, minorities, poor and under-educated get less help than other groups."<BR>
<BR>
Kaniasty bases his argument on thousands of interviews he and a colleague conducted on storm victims in the Southeastern U.S. over the past two decades.  Regardless of whether victims were displaced by a hurricane in South Carolina or flooding in Kentucky, Kaniasty says he noticed the "rule of relative advantage" favoring those with the knowledge and resources to attract the government's attention.<BR>
<BR>
Marc Wolfson, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, acknowledges that the complexity of the process may have kept some people from getting aid they deserved in the past, but he says times have changed.  Any time the president declares a national disaster area now, FEMA circulates a toll-free phone number for people in the area to call for easy-to-follow instructions to get help.  FEMA also has "one of the government's most extensive Web sites," Wolfson says, designed to provide information quickly and easily.  The <A HREF = "http://www.fema.gov/fema/trop.html">Tropical Storm Watch page</A> on the FEMA site (complete with Hurricane Bertha updates and information), for example, has received nearly a million hits per day this week.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3> 
<UL>

<LI><B>More bad news in the technology sector weighted down stocks on Thursday,</B> after both Hewlett-Packard and United Healthcare said business hasn't been as strong as expected in recent months.  Those announcements came one day after Motorola said its second-quarter profits were far below expectations.  The combined news sent computer and health issues into a tailspin and led the technology-heavy Nasdaq market to its largest drop in more than four years.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The national average for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages is at its highest level in a year-and-a-half,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. announced Thursday.  The rate skyrocketed from 8.14% to 8.42% during the week.  The average for one-year adjustable-rate mortgages also went up, from 5.94% to 6.01%.  Fifteen-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with refinancers, averaged 7.93% during the week, up from 7.67% a week earlier.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Less upbeat economic news from the government on Thursday, </B>as the Commerce Department and the Labor Department both released new batches of statistics.  Labor reported that claims for unemployment benefits rose last week to 369,000 from 351,000 the week before.  Commerce, meanwhile, said that consumer spending in the nation's stores and shopping malls slowed during June following four months of improvement.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Federal officials are considering whether to require credit-rating agencies to disclose when they assign bond ratings unsolicited,</B> according to published reports.  Such a move would require agencies such as Moody's or Standard & Poor's to identify ratings they issue without the permission of the borrower. The Justice Department has reportedly been looking into whether ratings services use the threat of unsolicited evaluations to pressure bond issuers into paying for their services.<BR>

<B>Our selection of consumer, business and financial news that matters to you, your money and your career.</B><BR>
<BR>

<H3>Furniture shopping on the cheap</H3>

Travel brochures from North Carolina often refer to the Tarheel State as the "furniture capital of the U.S.A." — and with good reason.  More than 300,000 people from all over the country descend on the state each year hoping to save as much as 70% on new furniture.  <BR>
<BR>
Around towns such as Hickory, High Point and Lenoir, hundreds of manufacturers churn out the majority of the nation's home furnishings, which allows area furniture stores (of which there are plenty) to routinely offer prices 40% to 60% below the manufacturer's suggested retail price.  Even with the cost of airfare, lodging, meals and post-purchase shipping added in, a carefully planned trip to North Carolina can pay off in thousands of dollars in savings, as well as a wider selection of sofas, chairs and tables than you're likely to find elsewhere.  <BR>
<BR>
But you can get the savings without ever setting foot in North Carolina if you're willing to work at it.  You'll need to identify what you want — manufacturer, line number, item number and fabrics — then contact Carolina stores to check purchase and shipping prices.  One good way to begin your search is with magazines such as <I>Architectural Digest</I>, <I>Country Living</I> and <I>House Beautiful</I>; pay particular attention to manufacturers' ads that offer catalogues or brochures.  <BR>
<BR>
For other ideas, you might check the <A HREF = "http://www.infi.net/lexington/c5.html">Great Reading Materials</A> page on the <A HREF = "http://www.infi.net/lexington/index.html">Lexington Furniture Industries</A> Web site.  You can also get leads from a number of related Internet sites.  <A HREF = "http://ncnet.com/ncnetworks/furn-onl.html">North Carolina Furniture Online</A>, <A HREF = "http://ncnet.com/ncnetworks/hp-furn.html">High Point Furniture Online</A> and <A HREF = "http://ncnet.com/ncnetworks/hky-furn.html">Hickory Furniture Online</A> will get you started.  <BR>
<BR>
If you'd rather let somebody else do the legwork, Carolina Connection will shop the state's showrooms for you once you've decided on pieces of furniture.  For $25 per piece of furniture, owner Brenda Prioletti will survey the top fifty retailers in North Carolina and report back to you within a few days with the lowest price.  For more information, email Prioletti at <A HREF = "mailto:carolina@naples.net">carolina@naples.net</A> or call 800-891-7981.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3> 
<UL>
<LI><B>Investor appetite for mutual funds declined with the stock market this week, </B>according to a new report from AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif.  In the seven days ending Wednesday, AMG says investors placed $2.3 billion of new money into stock funds, down from $4.2 billion the week before.  Taxable bond funds showed a similar slowdown, taking in $16 million after a net gain of $1.2 billion the week prior.  Investors were more cautious during the week, also.  The most popular category of stock funds this week was 'growth and income', following a six-month period in which 'aggressive growth' funds took in the most money.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The largest monthly food-price increase of the decade pushed wholesale prices up in June,</B> the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.  According to the BLS's Producer Price Index, inflation at the wholesale level totaled 0.2% during the month, despite the fact that energy prices actually went down.  Record grain shortages and hot, dry weather in the nation's breadbasket led food prices up 1.6% in four weeks, with the sharpest upticks registered by beef, pork and various fruits.  And as prices went up, consumers bought less.  The Commerce Department reported Friday that retail sales fell 0.2% in June.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Summer travelers heading into the woods have an extra concern this year,</B> says Dr. Jan Humphreys, who conducts Lyme Disease research for the Centers for Disease Control.  Humphreys says cases of tick-borne diseases such as Lyme Disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Ehrlichiosis are on the upswing, which means that hikers, rock climbers and other outdoor travelers need to be especially careful.  The only way to completely protect yourself from ticks is to avoid bushy areas, Humphreys says.  Failing that, wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants, use a tick repellent and conduct a tick-check on each person at day's end.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>AT&T combined forces with the Mayo Clinic, the New England Journal of Medicine and others to open a health-related Internet site</B> Friday.  <A HREF = "http://www.healthsite.com/">AT&T Healthsite</A> provides information about everything from weight-loss programs to information on diseases and treatments to online advice from health and fitness professionals.  Users have to register with the site (at no charge) and the pages tend to come up slowly because of the graphics, but there is a wide variety of information available.  Other major health-oriented Web sites include <A HREF = "http://www.allabouthealth.com/">All About Health</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.social.com/health/index.html">The Good Health Web Site</A> and <A HREF = "http://hsinfo.ghsl.nwu.edu/healthweb/index.html">HealthWeb</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Tourists cutting their vacations short because of Hurricane Bertha may be due a refund </B>if they purchased trip-cancellation insurance through their travel agent.  Violent storms wreak havoc with vacation plans along the southern Atlantic coast and Gulf of Mexico from time to time, but tourists can protect themselves from financial tempests by adding 5% to 7% to the cost of the trip for insurance.  For more information on trip-cancellation coverage, read "What If Your Trip is Canceled?" in the July issue of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>.<BR>

<H3> Should you care whether a bear's on the prowl?</H3>

Technically, the drop in stock prices over the past two weeks doesn't even qualify as a correction, let alone a bear market.  "Bears" are typically defined as stock-market declines of 20% or more, while "corrections" are thought of as falls between 10% and 20%.  Since July 1, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has only lost 7% of its value.  <BR>
<BR>
Of course, such semantics games don't carry much weight with investors who've seen the value of their investments erode in recent days.  The question for many of them is: Should we cut and run now before the bear gets hungrier?<BR>
<BR>
Probably not. Arguments in favor of dumping stocks now are based on a firm belief that the market is about the enter a prolonged bear market.  In truth, market timing is an inexact science at best.  No one knows what the markets will do, and attempting to buy low and sell high will often leave you on the sidelines just when investors are reaping the biggest benefits.<BR>
<BR>
The trick to successful investing is to allocate your money among stocks and bonds on the basis of when you'll need the money — the sooner you'll need it, the more conservative you should be — and then stick to your guns regardless of what the markets do in the short term.  As Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of First Albany Corp., told Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine recently, "It's time in the market, not timing the market, that's the key to success."<BR>
<BR>
We couldn't agree more.  For portfolio suggestions appropriate for several different investment time frames, read our recent article <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/dailynews/dn0627.html">"Best Funds For Your Goals."</A><BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<LI><B>Two new government reports point to tame inflation,</B> good news for investors fearful of a Federal Reserve Board interest-rate hike.  Tuesday, the Fed reported that the nation's factories, mines and utilities operated at 83.2% of maximum capacity in June, up from 83.1% a month earlier.  Analysts said that indicates a lack of production problems that might cause shortages and higher prices.  Also Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said consumer prices edged up a paltry 0.1% last month, the smallest increase in seven months.  It was a volatile month nonetheless: The largest jump in the price of grocery-store food in three years was offset in June by the biggest drop in energy prices in five years.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Chief executives at companies nationwide are more upbeat about the economy</B> than they were in April, according to a Conference Board survey released Tuesday.  In its quarterly poll of 200 CEOs, the Conference Board found that more than two-thirds of the managers predict they will have higher profits during the next 12 months than they've had in the past year.  More than 40% of the business leaders also said the U.S. economy has improved so far in 1996, while 15% say it has gotten worse.  In April, only 16% thought the economy had improved during the previous six months, while 42% said it had gone downhill.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Stock markets around the world fell on Tuesday, dragged lower by trouble on Wall Street.</B>  Every major stock market in Africa, Asia, Europe and Latin America closed lower Tuesday on news that the U.S. market had tanked a day earlier.  European bonds also fell, following U.S. Treasuries.  For information about which international markets tend to follow Wall Street closely and which ones march to their own beat, read our recent article, <A HREF = "dn0627.html">"The long arm of the Fed: Market jitters here and abroad."</A>  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>New industrywide guidelines should make it easier for customers to compare differences between Health Maintenance Organizations,</B> the National Committee for Quality Assurance said Tuesday.  The NCQA already issues "report cards" on the majority of American HMOs, but the new standards are intended to provide more-informative checklists for consumers to evaluate.  If you would like more information in the meantime, the Health Employers' Data Information Set 3.0 (Hedis 3.0), as it's known, can be downloaded from the <A HREF = "http://www.ncqa.org/ftpdocs.htm">NCQA file transfer site</A>.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Charles Schwab & Co. began allowing customers to trade mutual funds on its Web site this week.</B>  You can now buy or sell shares of more than 1,100 funds through<A HREF = "http://www.schwab.com/SORSchwab.html"> Schwab Online</A>, including 575 no-loads.

<H3> Do a doubletake before getting out the checkbook</H3>

Attorney General Janet Reno ended a two-year probe of the securities industry Wednesday afternoon when she announced a settlement between the Justice Department and two dozen brokerage houses that do business on the Nasdaq stock market.  The settlement, in which the brokerages neither admit nor deny rounding up prices to keep commissions high, allows government investigators to enter brokerages and listen in on trader/client conversations.<BR>
<BR>
While the settlement may be comforting to investors, it's still important to check your broker or planner's disciplinary history.  Justice Department eavesdropping or not, you need to know whether your broker has a history of playing fast and loose with clients' money.  This is especially true for somebody just starting out with a new broker or planner.  Fortunately, running a check is relatively quick and painless.<BR>
<BR>
After a $40 million computer-system renovation is completed, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Nasdaq's parent company, will be able to provide detailed information on brokers nationwide on the Internet.  An NASD spokesman says the project should be finished by early 1997.  In the meantime, you can check up on your broker by calling the NASD at 800-289-9999.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<LI><B>Scam artists have passed off hundreds of millions of dollars worth of fake bank notes and letters of credit in the past four years,</B> the Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement director told Congress on Wednesday.  The scam usually works like this: Investors are told that they have access to special bank instruments that they can buy at a discount and resell later for a profit.  By the time investors realize that the "issuing bank" won't honor the notes, the true seller is long gone, McLucas said.  The SEC's William McLucas told the Senate Banking Committee that victims have included the Chicago Housing Authority, the National Council of Churches of Christ and numerous small investors.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Construction companies broke ground on 1.3% more homes in June than they did in May,</B> the Commerce Department announced Wednesday.  Total new-housing starts reversed course after a 3.3% drop in May to grow to 1.48 million units during the month.  Analysts say the announcement adds to evidence that the economy still has strength, since housing starts went up despite rising mortgage rates.  Not everything in the report is positive, though.  Construction permits, which signal future construction activity, fell 2.5% during the month after dropping 0.5% in May.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Americans are more fond of global trade now than they were four years ago,</B> according to a poll released Wednesday.  The survey of 1,000 adults conducted in early June by marketing-research firm Market Strategies found that 82% believe trade is good for the U.S. economy, up from 52% in a similar study four years ago.  The report said the country was just moving out of a recession in 1992, though, and noted that Americans were probably more worried about potential job losses during the earlier survey than they are today.<BR>

<BR>
<H3> What?  Investors worry?</H3>

The financial markets warmed to comments by the Federal Reserve Board chairman on Thursday, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average up 40 points within minutes of Alan Greenspan's semiannual <A HREF = "http://www.bog.frb.fed.us/BOARDDOCS/HH/TEST9607.htm">state-of-the-economy speech</A> to Congress.  America's top economist told the Senate Banking Committee that "sustainable economic growth is likely in store" for the rest of this year and well into 1997.  <BR>
<BR>
That outlook should come as welcome news to skittish investors worried that the economy is about to plunge into a recession after six good years, pulling the stock and bond markets with it.  David Lipton, a professor of securities law at The Catholic University of America, says Greenspan's testimony may ease the "investor psychosis" that has led to the wild market gyrations in recent weeks.  <BR>
<BR>
Lipton says all signs point to a healthy economy in the next 12 to 18 months, which should bode well for the financial markets as a whole.  "The trouble is all in people's minds," he says.  "They know things have been going well for a long time now, so they're starting to wonder when the hammer is going to fall."  As a result, Lipton says, nervous investors are likely to jump in and out of the markets in spite of the strong fundamentals.<BR>
<BR>
Norm Robertson, the former chief economist at Mellon Bank and a lecturer at Carnegie Mellon University, says that while "price multiples of some companies have gotten out of hand," the stock market as a whole is "really quite sound."  He says investors should also be encouraged because the telltale signs that usually precede a recession are nowhere to be seen.  Sharp inflation, overbuilt business inventories, a boom in commercial building and overbuilt housing are typically signals that an economic expansion's days are numbered — and none of those are current problems, he says.<BR>
<BR>
"That's really the irony of all the stock-market mayhem we've seen this week," Robertson says.  "You'd have to look long and hard to find an economy performing better than ours is today."<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3> 
<UL>
<LI><B>New government statistics released Thursday dovetail nicely with Alan Greenspan's rosy economic outlook</B>, as new reports from Commerce and Labor point to continued strength.  First, the Labor Department said the employment situation continues to look good:  364,000 people filed initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits last week--6,000 fewer than the week before.  In a slightly more complicated piece of the puzzle, the Commerce Department announced that the trade deficit in May rose to a four-year high.  That's also a sign of economic strength, analysts say, because it means American consumers are buying lots of imported goods.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>As the stock market hit the skids earlier this week, mutual fund investors headed for the exits,</B> according to the fund-tracking newsletter <I>Liquidity Trim Tabs,</I> of Santa Rosa, Calif.  The publication estimates that if stock-fund redemptions continued at the pace set earlier in the week for the remainder of the month, the net result would be a $10 billion decrease in fund-company assets.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Your friendly neighborhood car dealer may go the way of the Edsel in coming decades,</B> the president of the National Automobile Dealers Association predicted this week.  The number of car dealerships has dropped from a high of 48,000 in the 1950s to about 23,000 today.  NADA head John Peterson said the number will continue to drop for the next 25 years or so, leaving only a few large dealers in most areas.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>More than half of the oil used in the U.S. this year has been imported, up 3% from 1995,</B> the American Petroleum Institute said this week.  API said the amount of imported petroleum used by Americans jumped from 49% to 52% this year because of a drop in output at domestic refineries.  During the first six months of the year, crude oil output in Alaska — home to America's largest oil fields — fell 8%.  <BR>

<H3>Will Atlanta get burned by the Olympic flame?</H3>

Atlanta has spent more than $1.7 billion preparing for the Olympic Games that get underway this weekend, including $512 million for new construction in the city and its environs.  But what happens when the party's over in two weeks?  Will all the money, headaches and international publicity make the city the toast of the American South in the years ahead?  Or will Atlanta quietly return to its station as one in a series of pleasant, rapidly growing and nondescript Sunbelt cities?<BR>
<BR>
In Jim McKenna's mind, there is no doubt about the answer.  "No matter how you slice it, hosting the Olympic Games is definitely worth the investment," the chamber of commerce employee says.  The <I>Lake Placid, New York,</I> Chamber of Commerce, that is.  Lake Placid hosted the winter Olympics in 1932 and 1980, and is preparing yet another bid for the 2022 games.<BR>
<BR>
In 1980, McKenna says, Lake Placid was thought of as a summer resort area.  Consequently, some area residents grumbled about spending $200 million on infrastructure improvements for winter activities, and critics asked many of the same financial questions that dog Atlanta organizers this year.  But nobody grumbles anymore, McKenna says, unless it's about the overabundance of visitors.  Thanks to improved facilities and international name recognition, the number of winter tourists has more than doubled in the years since 1980.<BR>
<BR>
Los Angeles has also more than made up for its investment in the 1984 summer Olympics.  But concentrating just on the bottom line ignores some of the other advantages the host city reaps long after the closing ceremonies, says Diane Wiggins of the Los Angeles tourism board.  An Olympic volunteer in 1984, Wiggins says murals appeared where graffiti had been, city parks and streets were cleaned up as never before and residents "really felt pride in our city."<BR>
<BR>
Los Angelinos still enjoys many of those Olympic benefits, Wiggins says, "and I suspect Atlanta will be just as happy with it's experience."<BR>

<LI><B><I>Morningstar Mutual Funds wants</I> the fund industry to keep shareholders better informed about what stocks it holds,</B> and Congress may be inclined to agree.  Under current Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines, funds only have to disclose their holdings twice each year.  <I>Morningstar</I> editor Amy Arnott says information shareholders receive is often too far out of date to be of any help in making investment decisions.  She says quarterly disclosures would help solve the situation.  Both houses of Congress recently approved a provision that gives the SEC the authority to require more frequent shareholder reports, but the bill is awaiting a House-Senate conference committee.<BR>

<LI><B>Phone companies beware: Yet another firm unveiled a cheap Internet-phone service this week. </B> If you have at least a 486 processor, a 14.4 modem, a sound card and a microphone attached to your computer, you can <A HREF = "http://www.net2phone.com/DOWNLOAD.HTML">download Net2Phone</A> software from the IDT Corporation Web site.  The version you'll get now is still being tested (and is free), but when the system is fully operational by October, the company says you'll be able to call any traditional phone or Internet phone in the world for 10 cents per minute.  There are also several pay Internet-phone providers already up and running, the largest of which is <A HREF = "http://www.vocaltec.com/iphone4/ip4.htm">VocalTec</A>.<BR>

<LI><B>The average home-mortgage rate nationwide went down last week,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. announced Thursday.  The most common type of home loan, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, averaged 8.23% during the week, down from 8.42% only seven days earlier.  Other types of loans fell, also.  The average initial rate offered on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages fell to 5.979% from 6.01%, and 15-year mortgages averaged 7.76%, down from 7.93%.<BR>

<H3>Mutual fund investors bail out of most-aggressive sectors</H3>

Not too long ago, investors were clamoring to get into mutual funds — the more bullish, the better (see our recent article, <A HREF = "dn0529.html">"Mutual fund investors get more aggressive"</A>).  That all seemed to change last week, though: Investors pulled $4 billion out of stock funds amid the roller-coaster ups and downs of the market as the week wore on, including $1.6 billion from aggressive-growth, emerging-growth and international stock funds.  While shareholders in the three volatile sectors were heading for the exits, the assets of conservative U.S. money-market funds actually went up.<BR>
<BR>
There's little mystery as to why investors are suddenly looking elsewhere for greener pastures: 98.7% of mutual funds in the three most-affected categories have lost money since July 1, substantial amounts for many.  This on the heels of sparkling returns for the better part of the past six years.  <BR>
<BR>
Economist Anthony Loviscek of Seton Hall University says the sudden volatility in the market last week might have spooked many investors who got used to making money through their investments, not losing it.  "My parents and other older Americans clearly remember the market crash of 1929 and the recession of 1974, but those memories are certainly fading for a new generation of investors," he says.  "As a nation of investors, we have become increasingly aggressive as the market has done well over the past five years."<BR>

Regardless, Loviscek says last week's outflow is likely to be a short-term reaction.  Over the longer term, he expects investors to keep putting money into stock funds.  "The majority of the investing public is more educated about the trade-off between risk and reward than it has ever been," he says.  "Many will keep making intelligent decisions about how to best save for their long-term goals — and stocks still beat the alternatives over time."<BR>

<LI><B>The Securities and Exchange Commission agreed Friday to relax the stock markets' trading limits,</B> which were put in place to restrain panic selling in the wake of the October 1987 crash.  Under current rules, stock markets are required to stop all trading for an hour if the Dow Jones industrial average loses 250 points in a day, and two hours if the index loses 400 points.  Acknowledging the lower percentage value such drops make now than seven years ago, the SEC agreed to cut the required stoppage times in half.<BR>

<LI><B>Visa introduced a new online buying system Monday</B> that it says will make Internet purchases safer than traditional credit card transactions.  The credit-card firm teamed up with Internet-security company VeriSign Inc. to design the system, which uses encryption codes to protect card users online.  Merchants selling goods online would never receive users' entire card number under this system, which makes it more difficult for cyber-thieves to intercept the numbers in transmission.<BR>

<LI><B>Mitsubishi announced plans Monday to start selling compact disks that can re-record information as often as needed,</B> beginning in December.  The so-called "CD-rewritable" disk will differ from current CD-R disks in that you will be able to record information multiple times, as opposed to the CD-R's one-time-only recording.  A Mitsubishi spokesman didn't release a price for the new CDs, but said they are likely to be one-and-a-half to two times as expensive as current CD-Rs.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Lexis-Nexis information service will soon be available online,</B> the company said Monday.  With 875 million searchable documents (in comparison, the Web has only 39 million sites), Lexis-Nexis is a major research source for academics, journalists, lawyers and others.  Until the firm's Internet site is complete this fall, users still need Lexis-Nexis proprietary software to access the database.<BR>

<H3>Deadbeat parents pick taxpayers' pockets, say experts </H3>

Child support payments, or lack thereof, are President Clinton's designated campaign issues of the week.  In an election-year effort to solidify his support among women's groups, the President said Monday that so-called "deadbeat dads" will soon find their pictures on wanted posters both in post offices and online.  "Robbing our children of their future [is] the biggest robbery of all," he said.  But just how much are deadbeat dads — and moms — bilking their kids out of?  And who ultimately pays for the larceny?<BR>
<BR>
Carl MacBride, of People Locator, Inc., in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has spent 28 years tracking down deadbeat parents and he says the problem is a big one.  "Dads, and it is usually dads, skipping out on their kids is a major pocketbook issue for both the families affected and for the taxpayers who end up footing the bill," MacBride says.  "We're talking about billions of dollars here; somebody's got to pay it."  In 1991, the latest year for which statistics are available, $5.3 billion in child-support payments went unmet, according to the Census Bureau.<BR>
<BR>
Nancy Duff Campbell, co-president of the National Women's Law Center, says about one-quarter of single mothers with orders for child support receive no payment every year and another one-quarter only receive some of the money they're due.  Of those who don't get any payments, 75% receive federal welfare money instead.  "The average award of $3,375 per year may not sound like much, but it's often enough to keep a single mother out of poverty and off the [welfare] rolls," Duff Campbell says.  <BR>
<BR>
There is some disagreement on whether the President's announcement will have any effect, though.  MacBride says "the whole thing is ludicrous" and predicts that few, if any, deadbeat dads will be forced to pay because of any changes made by the federal government.  Duff Campbell, on the other hand, says it may be a step in the right direction.  "If putting some guy's picture on the Internet and embarrassing him makes another guy sit back and say, 'I don't want that to happen to me', then it's at least sending out the right signal," she says.<BR>
<BR>
Six states already post wanted lists of child-support offenders online: <A HREF = "http://www.childsup.cahwnet.gov/">California</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.state.ga.us/Departments/DHR/CSE/csetop10.htm">Georgia</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.ai.org/fssa/cse/poster.html">Indiana</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.mst.oa.net:8002">Massachusetts</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.state.nc.us/CSE">North Carolina</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.state.tn.us/humanserv/w2.htm">Tennessee</A>.  More are expected to follow in the near future.<BR>

<LI><B>Interactive sections on retirement planning and college funding</B> are included in <A HREF = "http://networth.galt.com/www/home/mutual/neuberger">Neuberger & Berman's Web site</A>, launched this week.  <A HREF = "http://networth.galt.com/www/home/mutual/neuberger/college/collegewksheet.html">The College Planning Center</A> will take your financial and predicted college information and tell you have much you'll need to save each year to be able to pay for school.  You can either enter the name of a specific college or go with generic "public" and "private" university choices.  Similar to the college section, the <A HREF = "http://networth.galt.com/www/home/mutual/neuberger/retirement/rws2.html">Retirement Planning Worksheet</A> will take your information and calculate the annual savings rate you'll need to retire and keep your current standard of living.  Neuberger & Berman is a no-load mutual fund company based in New York City.<BR>

<LI><B>The first half of 1996 marked a record-breaking run for the Big Board, </B> the New York Stock Exchange announced Tuesday.  An average of 418 million shares worth $16.4 billion traded hands each day in the year through June 30, up from the previous high-water average of 337 million shares worth $11.3 billion, set in 1995.  The April through June quarter also set a record for three-month trading averages.  At the end of June, the NYSE included 2,755 companies with a market value of $6.6 trillion, both record totals.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Americans think college tuition costs 112% more than it really does, </B> the American Council on Education told a House subcomittee hearing Monday.  Hoping to counter an impression that high costs keep a college education out of reach for many, the trade group for U.S. colleges and universities commissioned a phone survey of 1,019 adults last month to compare impressions with reality.  The survey found that respondents believed tuition at two-year colleges to be $3,524 per year (it's $1,194), four-year public universities to be $6,130 (it's $2,982) and four-year private universities to be $19,590 (it's $14,510).<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>More than 65% of Americans now own their own homes,</B> the highest rate in 16 years.  White House economic adviser Laura Tyson says President Clinton's policies are responsible for the upswing to 65.4%.  "Lower deficits, lower mortgage rates and higher job growth are a good recipe for higher homeownership rates," she says.  The highest percentage on record was 65.8%, in 1980.<BR>

<H3>Reach out and Internet-phone somebody </H3>

Although it's technically possible to bypass the phone company and make calls using your computer, the number of people who regularly do so — about 30,000 worldwide — is hardly enough to keep telecommunications executives awake at night.  A few phone-company managers may find themselves with a bout of insomnia tonight, though, after Intel Corp. became the second firm in a week to unveil a major step forward in the race for a consumer-friendly Internet-based phone service (see Friday's item, "<A HREF = "dn0719.html">Phone companies beware</A>").<BR>
<BR>
Before today, computer users who tried to make online phone calls had to find their way through a complicated technical maze.  The dozens of downloadable phone-software packages speak different languages, so in order to make a connection, the people you call must be using the same software on their computer and they must have it on when you call. <BR>
<BR>
Intel, with the backing of 120 companies including Microsoft, hopes to make its 'Net-phone technical standard the global model.  Once you <A HREF = "http://www.intel.com/iaweb/cpc/iphone/index.htm">download the Intel software</A>, you should be able to make calls anywhere in the world for the cost of connectiong to the Internet. (Intel recommends a Pentium processor and Microsoft Windows 95 to run the software.).<BR>

The encroachment of 'Net phones threatens the $40 billion long-distance phone industry, according to some analysts.  "The Internet is a threat in the long-term to traditional long distance telephony," Jupiter Communications senior analyst Adam Schoenfeld told CNN this week.  Some even believe that within a few years, telephone companies may have to abandon per-call charges and move to a set monthly fee for service similar to what Internet-access companies now levy.  <BR>
<BR>
But that isn't likely to happen any time soon, says telecommunications analyst Michael Balhoff, of the Baltimore-based brokerage Legg Mason Wood Walker.  "You can bet that AT&T, MCI and Sprint are watching these developments very closely," he says.  "But it's way too early in the game to know how much of a factor Internet phones are really going to play."  Balhoff says the inconvenience factor of using the Internet and the limited size of the online audience will keep 'Net-phone growth slow in the near term.<BR>
<BR>
Besides, Balhoff says, Internet phones are not a panacea.  "If you have the capability and you don't mind the inconvenience, enjoy these things for now," he says.  "But keep in mind that you're going to end up paying somebody for this service in the future, whether it's AT&T or Intel.  The free lunch isn't likely to last long."<BR>

The proposal is meant to speed up the current "shelf registration" process.  The pilot program would be for larger companies.  If it proved itself effective, though, it might be expanded to include smaller companies in the future.<BR>

<I>Last Updated: July 25, 5:00 p.m. EDT</I><BR>

<H3>Fund strategies for a choppy market </H3>

Even the most die-hard investor has had the question pop into her head at least once in the past three weeks: "What's going on with the stock market these days?"  The Dow Jones industrial average tumbles 161 points one day, rebounds 87 points the next and drops back down a day after that.  What gives?<BR>
<BR>
The truth is, even Wall Street professionals can't agree on what is happening right now.  Elaine Garzarelli, a former mutual fund manager and now the publisher of a market-forecast newsletter, made a name for herself by correctly predicting Black Monday in 1987.  Yet this month's market roller coaster appears to have her as bewildered as everybody else:  Sunday, <I>The New York Times</I> quoted her as saying the market was about to make "a fairly nice move" upward; on nationwide television two days later, she forecast a 25% downturn and told investors to sell; by Wednesday, she was refusing to comment either way.<BR>
<BR>
Given the turbulence, then, should you leave your investments in a money-market fund or CD and wait out the storm?  Or is this the time to find bargains amid the wreckage and buy stocks while they're down?  We posed those questions to a few fee-only financial planners (they don't get commissions for pushing specific investments) Thursday and, predictably, received different reads on the situation and how best to handle it:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI>Mary Dean of San Diego, who calls herself "a little bit of a contrarian," says investors who are already invested should probably keep their money where it is.  For her clients putting in new cash, though, she recommends a 50/50 split between stock mutual funds and fixed-income investments.  Well-diversified funds with long-term above-average total returns and below-average volatility generally meet her approval for the stock half of the portfolio.  Funds on Dean's radar screen right now include Michael Price's Mutual Series funds, Evergreen Growth & Income Y, Fidelity Equity Income and Equity Income II, Ivy International and Vanguard Index 500.  Dean says she will be convinced stocks are in the "buy" range the next time the market returns come back negative for an entire year, at which point she will be ready to invest the remaining 50% of her clients' money in stocks.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>David Otto of Katonah, New York, is also telling most of his clients to sit tight on money already invested in stocks, but to cut back on new equity purchases.  Depending on the investor's risk tolerance and financial situation, Otto says he recommends buying as little as 50% of the amount of stock they have been buying up to now.  Stock funds he likes include Baron Asset, Dimensional Fund Advisors 910 and Vanguard Index 500.  For the remainder, he is fond of "bond-like" investments — real estate mutual funds, such as Cohen & Steers Realty, and limited partnerships in oil and gas production companies.  For more information on limited partnerships, see "<A HREF = "/magazine/archives/1995/August/partner.html">Partnerships: Safer, But Still Hard to Swallow</A>" from the August, 1995, issue of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine.</I> </UL><BR>

<H3>In brief</H3> 
<UL>
<LI><B>Sales of existing homes fell in June after posting an all-time high a month earlier,</B> the National Association of Realtors said Thursday.  Existing-home sales (as opposed to new-home sales) fell 2.3% in June to 4.18 million units, NAR said, down from 4.28 million units in May.  The real estate group's chief economist, John Tuccillo, says the home resale market should maintain a steady pace through the summer, but others aren't so sure.  Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.32% in June, up one-quarter of a point since May, and some analysts predict that sales will continue to decline through the fall as rates increase further.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>An "inconvenience" virus that infects Microsoft Excel spreadsheets popped up in North America and Africa this week,</B> according to the director of anti-viral research for McAfee Associates in Santa Clara, Calif.  McAfee, which makes anti-virus software, said it hopes to have a detector for the virus in place by the end of the week.  The computer infection allegedly replicates quickly under normal spreadsheet use, but it hasn't permanently destroyed data at companies where it has materialized.  You can <A HREF = "http://www.mcafee.com/down">download a copy of McAfee VirusScan</A> software free of charge for 30 days from the <A HREF = "http://www.mcafee.com">McAfee Web site</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>First-time applications for jobless benefits fell to the lowest level in six months last week,</B> the Labor Department said Thursday.  Unemployment claims fell to 322,000 in the week ending July 20, down sharply from 367,000 the week before.  They haven't been that low since the week of January 13, when blizzard conditions kept tens of thousands away from unemployment offices in the Northeast.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The combined assets of the nation's mutual funds remained relatively unchanged in June,</B> according to figures released by the Investment Company Institute on Thursday.  During the month, the total amount of investor money in the $3.2 trillion industry went up by $6.52 million — or 0.2%.  Bond and fixed-income funds accounted for the majority (69%) of the new money as investors became increasingly wary in June.<BR>

<H3> Beef prices on the way back up </H3>

It looks like those burgers you throw on the grill during weekend barbecues are going to get a little more expensive in the months ahead.  <BR>
<BR>
For six months now, consumers have been watching beef prices slip lower as ranchers nationwide hurried their cattle to market.  Surging grain prices simply made it too expensive to feed large herds, so cattlemen pushed as many animals out the door as they could.  The resulting glut of beef pushed wholesale prices down more than 5% and retail prices down nearly 3% through June.<BR>
<BR>
But now consumers are facing the flip-side of supply-and-demand economics: The relatively low number of cattle left in American herds, along with a steady demand for beef, is expected to force prices back up.  The Agriculture Department's mid-year survey of the nation's cattle inventory, released this week, found more than a million fewer beef cows in the U.S. than during the same period a year ago.  <BR>
<BR>
Ron Gustavson, the USDA's senior beef analyst, forecasts that supermarket prices will continue to rise through early 1997.  Gustavson says he won't be able to predict the magnitude of the increase until August 12, though, when the government releases its estimate of how good the fall corn crop is expected to be (corn is a large part of beef cows' diet).  <BR>
<BR>
"Everybody's in a holding pattern," says a USDA spokesperson.  "A lot of beef and dairy producers are waiting to make their business decisions until they know what the next corn crop is going to be like."<BR>

<LI><B>Investors eased back into stock mutual funds this week,</B> according to statistics released Friday by AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif.  Stock funds saw a net asset gain of $1.88 billion in the week ending Wednesday, AMG says, following a week in which a net $4.04 billion was withdrawn.  The most popular stock funds in the week were growth and income funds, less volatile than the aggressive growth and emerging market funds that attracted the most money through the spring and early summer.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Contributions from Wall Street securities firms and their employees to members of Congress peaked as the securities litigation reform bill was debated,</B> according to a new study by the Center for Responsive Politics, a non-profit watchdog group that follows campaign-finance issues.  The contributions hit a high of $600,000 in June 1995, the period when the Senate was considering the bill to restrict shareholder class-action lawsuits, then dropped sharply after Senate passage.  Contributions picked back up again in the fall, peaking at more than $500,000 in November as the House and Senate negotiated a compromise bill, the study says.  The securities industry strongly supported passage of the legislation, which became law in December.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Strong first-week ticket sales increase the chance that the Olympic Games will finish in the black,</B> a senior official said Thursday.  More than 8.4 million tickets were sold during the first week, including 274,000 walk-up purchases at the gate, putting sales at nearly 95% of the capacity for Atlanta's stadiums and other athletic venues.  The $458 million generated by the sales surpasses the organizing committee's expectations and makes the odds "very favorable" that the game's $1.7 billion budget will be covered, the committee's chief operating officer, A.D. Frazier, said.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>It may be tougher to qualify for credit cards down the road after explosion of personal bankruptcy filings leaves card companies holding the bag,</B> say analysts.  During the second quarter of 1996, bankruptcy filings on an annualized basis topped the one million mark, the highest level on record.  This despite a strong economy.  If the economy moves into a recession, the problem could worsen — leaving card companies with an even larger problem on their hands and forcing them to tighten credit, analysts say.  For the time being, though, most agree that fierce competition in the industry will keep credit widely available.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>President Clinton's proposal to improve security for airline travelers could come with some tradeoffs,</B> according to industry analysts.  Speaking in New York City on Thursday, Clinton called for more searches and screening of baggage at American airports, preflight inspections for any plane flying to or from the U.S. and the addition of more sophisticated bomb-detection machines.  Analysts say such changes will improve safety, but are likely to cause more flight delays, increased turnaround time between flights and higher ticket prices.<BR>

<H3>Bomb-detection stocks may have already seen their day in the sun </H3>

It may sound morbid, but it's almost a Wall Street certainty that stock prices of bomb-detection companies will head up on the heels of a terrorist attack.  It happened after the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, it happened after the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City just over a year ago and it happened again last week after the downing of TWA Flight 800.<BR>
<BR>
In 1993 and 1995, though, stock prices didn't remain inflated for long.  As soon as it became apparent that neither incident would inspire a new rash of orders for bomb-detecting machines, prices came back down.  But this time might be different, claim some analysts.  President Clinton's call for increased security at airports, followed by this weekend's pipe-bomb explosion in Atlanta, could prompt a run on the latest in bomb-detection hardware.<BR>
<BR>
Don't fall for it, warns analyst Al Goldman of A.G. Edwards & Sons.  "Human nature hasn't changed since the last time or the time before that," he says.  "These stocks are going to go up like hot-air balloons for a little while, then somebody is going to stick a pin in them and it's all over."  People should do their research and invest in a company based on its fundamentals, Goldman says, not because the firm is the "investment du jour."<BR>
<BR>
Companies in the industry include American Science and Engineering, Barringer Technologies, InVision Technologies, Magal Security Systems and Thermedics.<BR>

<LI><B>Long-term investors should hold on to their stocks in the current directionless market,</B> according to the July 19 issue of <I>The Kiplinger Washington Letter</I>.  The letter suggests that you seek out firms with proven records of rising dividends and/or reinvesting profits for continuing growth, as well as good earnings prospects for the next several years.  If you think you'll need your money within a couple of years, though, you should probably put them in certificates of deposit, Treasury bills or money-market funds.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The average cost of a gallon of gasoline dropped another penny over the past two weeks,</B> according to a survey released Monday.  The Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide found the average price across all grades to be $1.32 a gallon on Friday, down 1.11 cents from a similar poll two weeks ago.  Also Friday, wholesale oil prices fell to their lowest level in a month, which bodes well for consumers hoping for future gasoline price cuts.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Orders for U.S.-built machine tools rose 18.7% in June from a month earlier,</B> the Association for Manufacturing Technology said Sunday.  Orders during the month totaled $447.8 million, up from $377.1 million in May and 19.3% higher than June 1995's figure.  Machine tools are used by manufacturers to shape metal and are considered a gauge of whether companies see their business prospects increasing or decreasing in the near future.<BR>

<H3>Have banks become (gasp) <I>growth</I> companies?</H3>

Bank stocks, the old tried-and-true of the financial-services sector, have long been thought of as sleepy, cyclical and highly dependent on interest rates and the economy.  Times are changing, though, as online banking and competition for consumers' savings dollars threaten the industry.  <BR>
<BR>
Fear of becoming irrelevant has pushed banks to reshape their image, with mergers and acquisitions the makeover of choice.  Brokerage house CS First Boston estimates that more than one out of every five banks has been absorbed since the Reagan years.  And many of the resulting companies mimic firms in growth-oriented industries, with flexible, efficient operations that aim to dominate specific niches.  <BR>
<BR>
But have things really changed as much as they appear?  Yes and no, says Tom Finucane, an assistant portfolio manager of the John Hancock Regional Bank fund.  "We've gone from 14,500 banks ten years ago to around 9,800 today, but that doesn't mean we have a sexy growth industry on our hands," Finucane says.  "Things are much better than they were, but banking is still an inefficient, highly fragmented industry."<BR>
<BR>
That said, Finucane thinks the second half of 1996 will be a good time to buy bank stocks.  The traditional Wall Street read on banks is that when interest rates rise, the difference between what a bank can charge on a loan and what it has to pay on deposits tends to narrow, cutting into profits and sending stock prices lower.  What investors haven't figured out, Finucane says, is that banks have largely solved that problem.  <BR>
<BR>
"If [the Federal Reserve Board] raises interest rates in August, expect a knee-jerk reaction to send bank stocks down,"  he says.  "But they will come back quickly, and investors who stay in based on the fundamentals will be rewarded."<BR>

<LI><B>Consumer confidence in July advanced to its highest level in six years,</B> according to a report released today by The Conference Board.  The Consumer Confidence Index hit 107.2, the highest since May 1990 and an increase of more than 7 points over June's figure.  "Latest survey results confirm that consumers are clearly confident about current economic conditions and anticipate further economic growth in the months ahead," said Edgar R. Fiedler, The Conference Board's vice president and chief economist.<BR>

<BR>
<LI><B>New-home sales decreased 5.3 percent in June,</B> as potential buyers felt the pinch of the highest mortgage rates in more than a year.  Despite the drop, new-home sales remained above the figure from a year ago.  Analysts had been expecting the decline as mortgage rates increased by more than one percentage point since the beginning of the year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The purchasing of both move-up and first-time home buyers fell during the second quarter</B> as home prices and mortgage rates continued to rise, according to the National Association of Realtors' Housing Affordability Index released today.  The composite Housing Affordability Index, which measures the affordability factors for all home buyers dropped to 122 in the second quarter of 1996 from 131.5 in the previous quarter.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Employment costs increased 0.8 percent in the second quarter</B> and 2.9 percent for the past fiscal year according to a Labor Department report.  The rate of increase was the fastest in four years.  However, these increases were slightly below analysts' predictions.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Corporate mergers and acquisitions for the first half of 1996 moved away from emerging markets and toward more advanced economies,</B> according to a report released today by KPMG Peat Marwick.  Also, the number of cross-border deals, where the purchaser and target are based in different countries, dropped 12 percent for the first half of 1996 compared to the same period last year.  "We're seeing a flight to safety," said Steve Blum, a KPMG Corporate Finance partner.  "Cross-border activity fell in emerging markets where the perceived risks are greater because of political, trade and overall economic uncertainties."<BR>

<H3> Americans in denial about estate planning, study finds </H3>

While you may not want to spend too much time thinking about death, particularly your own, it's a good idea to spell out who gets what after you're gone and to do what you can to hold Uncle Sam's estate-tax bite to a minimum.  Yet the majority of wealthy Americans — those with the most to lose — remain in denial about the subject, according to a study released Wednesday by polling firm Roper/Starch Worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
"The survey clearly shows that while most investors have focused all their attention on picking mutual funds and other investments as a means to accumulate wealth, far too few have thought about preserving that wealth [at their death]," says Jerry Potts of the MFS family of mutual funds, which commissioned the study.<BR>
<BR>
Roper/Starch surveyed adults with household incomes above $50,000 and found that fewer than half have appointed a durable power of attorney (46%), prepared a written list of assets and their whereabouts (42%), drafted a living will (43%), purchased long-term-care insurance (38%) or established trusts (35%).  The poll's authors concluded that while the majority of wealthy Americans say they are concerned about issues such as financial planning for their children, few have actually taken steps to ensure that their wishes on the matter would be followed were they to die.<BR>
<BR>
If you're among the procrastinators, <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I> recently published <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1995/June/estatepl.html">"An Estate-Planning Kit for Dawdlers"</A> that will help get you get up to speed.  It includes sections on taking stock of what you own, divvying up your assets, deciding who to name as executor and minimizing your estate-tax bill.  <BR>
<BR>
For suggestions about more-specific situations, other recent articles include <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1995/January/blended.html">"Estate-Planning Musts for Blended Families"</A> and <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1994/August/fambus.html">"Estate-Planning Solutions for Small-Business Owners."</A>  <BR>

<LI><B>A Canadian group on Wednesday urged winter tourists to skip Florida this year</B> in response to a U.S. law that punishes foreign firms that do business with Cuba.  The "Boycott Florida Coalition" said at a news conference in Ottawa that it is protesting Title III of the recently passed Helms-Burton law.  Scheduled to go into effect in six months, Title III allows U.S. citizens and companies to sue foreign firms dealing with any Cuban entity that uses land seized after the 1959 Communist revolution.  Last winter, 1.7 million Canadians visited Florida, spending $1.3 billion.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>It was tougher to get a home mortgage last year than in 1994,</B> according to the government's annual release of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data.  The percentage of all groups of borrowers whose applications were rejected increased during the year: 20.6% of white applicants were turned down, as opposed to 16.4% in 1994; 29.5% of Hispanic applicants were turned down, versus 24.6% a year earlier; and 40.5% of black applicants were turned away, up from 33.4% in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The low unemployment rate is finally starting to cause labor shortages,</B> the National Association of Business Economists said this week.  The NABE's quarterly survey of labor conditions found a record 47% of companies saying they are having difficulty finding enough qualified workers, up from 32% three months ago.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>If you buy or sell stocks via online brokers, the National Council of Individual Investors wants to know what you think.</B>  Starting this week, the <A HREF = "http://www.irnet.com/scripts/ethos.exe?WWW+p_IENCIISurvey">NCII Online Discount Brokerage Survey</A> is available to take your opinions on such topics as the range of investment services offered online, the timeliness of trades and the willingness of brokers to deal with your complaints.  Regularly updated survey results will be available on the <A HREF = "http://www.ncii.org/ncii">NCII Web site</A> beginning in mid-August.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The big are getting bigger when it comes to U.S. farms,</B> the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.  In its latest count, USDA found 2.06 million farms in the country, with an average size of 469 acres.  A decade ago, there were 190,000 more farms and each one averaged 447 acres in size.<BR>

<H3> More than a million people to give Medical Savings Accounts a test run </H3>

Congress put to rest months of partisan bickering this week and passed legislation to make it easier for Americans to keep their health insurance if they change jobs or have medical problems.  While it didn't receive as many headlines as other areas of the debate, one provision of the new act clears the way for an experiment to test Medical Savings Accounts nationwide.  Up to 1.5 million people will be allowed to sign up for MSAs over the next four years — and you can expect to hear much more about them in the months ahead.<BR>
<BR>
MSAs are designed to work somewhat like Individual Retirement Accounts do now: You, or your employer, could put around $2,000 per year (or $4,000 for families) into a tax-deductible account, which could then be used to pay for medical care during the year.  Any money left over in your account at the end of the year can be rolled over into the following year.  After the MSA account is depleted and a deductible is paid in a given year, an employer's catastrophic insurance coverage would kick in to cover large bills.<BR>
<BR>
Since catastrophic coverage is less expensive than the comprehensive insurance most employers now offer, MSA proponents say the cost of providing health care to workers will drop considerably under such a plan.  But critics, including many consumer advocacy groups, aren't convinced.  They argue that younger and healthier people will be drawn to MSAs, which will leave older, sicker Americans to pool the risk in traditional health plans — forcing premiums higher.  <BR>
<BR>
Which is why Congress decided not implement MSAs now, along with the other parts of the new legislation.  The idea behind the four-year experiment, basically, is that the proof is in the pudding.  Rather than decide whether proponents or opponents are correct, Congress will wait to see what happens as Americans set up MSA accounts.<BR>

<LI><B>The economy grew at its fastest pace in two years during the second quarter,</B> the Commerce Department announced Thursday.  Commerce said that nation's gross domestic product shot up at an annualized 4.2% rate during April, May and June, more than double the pace seen in the first three months of the year.  Most sectors of the economy were strong during the second quarter, but strong consumer spending and a sharp uptick in home building led the way.  GDP, the total output of goods and services produced in the country, is widely thought of as the nation's broadest measure of economic health.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Starting today, anyone who files for government benefits and has a bank account will be paid by direct deposit,</B> a change brought about by this year's Debt Collection Improvement Act.  People who receive paper checks from the government now will be switched over to direct deposit plans over a three-year phase-in period.  Since writing a paper check costs the government 42.5 cents and arranging for direct-deposit transfers costs only 2.5 cents, Congress hopes to save more than $115 million annually through the change.  The Social Security Administration says that 61% of its 43.5 million beneficiaries already receive their money by direct deposit each month.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Interest rates on the most common type of mortgage edged higher during the week,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said Thursday.  Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages rose to an average of 8.23% in the week ending Wednesday, up from 8.19% a week ago.  That is the highest mid-point since July 18, when rates also averaged 8.23%.  Fifteen-year mortgages, popular with refinancers, averaged 7.75% this week, up from 7.71%.  Meanwhile, the average interest rate on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages fell 0.03% during the week to 5.98%.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Employers are advertising more in newspaper help-wanted sections,</B> the Conference Board said Thursday.  The business group's Help-Wanted Advertising Index rose to 85 in June, up more than 6% from May figures.  The number of help-wanted ads increased in six of the nine regions of the country, according to the monthly study, with the largest growth registered in the New England (8.2%) and Mountain (7.8%) states.<BR>

<H3> Where to turn if you're feeling the credit squeeze </H3>

Community-college tuition, medical bills and a pair of new cars landed newlyweds Rick and Tammie Meyer in a $35,000 hole in 1994.  "When we had to move in with Rick's parents, we knew we were in trouble," Tammie says.<BR>
<BR>
It hasn't been easy, but the North Bend, Ore. couple has slashed $20,000 from their outstanding debt since then by following a strict budget designed for them by the nonprofit <A HREF = "http://www.powersource.com/cccs">Consumer Credit Counseling Service</A> — and they're back in their own apartment.  The Meyers aren't alone in their debt problems, though.  Americans are increasingly spending more than they can quickly repay, pushing overall consumer debt levels up 13% annually over the past five years.  Not surprisingly, a record number of people are expected to declare personal bankruptcy in 1996.  <BR>
<BR>
But bankruptcy has long-lasting effects on your credit record, and it could keep you from borrowing money to buy anything — a house, a car, etc. — for the next 10 years.  Before resorting to that extreme step, you should probably consider other preventative measures:<BR>
<BR>
<DD><I>Check your credit reports. </I> To find out whether any black marks are already on your credit reports, contact the major reporting agencies: <A HREF = "http://www.equifax.com/consumer/faqs/docs/answer2.html">Equifax</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.trw.com/iss/is/isq1.html#question4">TRW</A> and Trans Union Corp. (800-916-8800).<BR>
<BR>
<DD><I>Find more cash.</I>  Before borrowing money to pay existing bills, consider selling nonessential things you have around the house or temporarily taking a second job.<BR>
<BR>
<DD><I>Consolidate.  </I>Taking out a personal loan to cover other debts can reduce the overall amount you pay each month by lengthening the pay-back period, lowering the interest rate or both.  Check with your local bank about home-equity loans or personal loans.  Tapping into your retirement plan or a life insurance policy can also make sense — but only if you're sure you will pay yourself back once the bills are covered.<BR>
<BR>
<DD><I>Stall for time.</I>  Don't wait until you get late notices.  Call your creditors as soon as you know you'll be late, and emphasize your plan to get back on your feet.  Some creditors will temporarily reduce or stop payments or let you pay only interest for a short period of time.  Some will also waive interest charges or late fees.<BR>
<BR>
<DD><I>Put it in writing.  </I>Send each creditor that agrees to temporarily reduce or waive fees a certified letter outlining the payment plan.  Once a company accepts a reduced-payment plan and you make the payments, it isn't allowed to report you to the credit services.  Make sure you keep copies of any letters.<BR>
<BR>
<DD><I>Get help.</I>  Like the Meyers, you can get help through nonprofit groups such as the Consumer Credit Counseling Service or your local Debtors Anonymous group.  Once you agree to follow its plan, CCCS will arrange reduced-payment schedules with your creditors, effectively calling off the hounds.<BR>
<BR>
<DD><I>Avoid quick fixes.</I>  Avoid any firm that offers to clean up your credit for a fee.  For more information on companies that provide such services, read <A HREF = "http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/credit/repair.htm">"Credit Repair: Self-Help May be Best"</A> on the Federal Trade Commission's Web site.<BR>
<BR>
<DD><I>Know your rights. </I> Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, you have <A HREF = "http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/credit/fdc.htm">rights to protect yourself from bill collectors</A>.  For instance, collectors have to comply with your written request that they stop calling and writing to you at home and work.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<LI><B>The jobless rate edged higher and new-job creation slowed in July,</B> the Labor Department said Friday.  The unemployment rate moved from 5.3% to 5.4% during the month while 193,000 new jobs were created, down from the 273,000 new positions in June.  Neither statistic is cause for alarm, say analysts, but the numbers indicate that the economy may be backing away from its rapidly growing pace of earlier in the year.  That's good news for investors who fear the Federal Reserve Board will be forced to raise interest rates if the economy grows too quickly.  Meanwhile, the Commerce Department said Friday that Americans reduced spending and increased savings in June despite the largest average pay increase in a year and a half — yet another sign of a slowing economy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The government's most-aggressive anti-trust cop in decades announced Thursday that she plans to step down in the fall</B> for "purely personal reasons."  Anne Bingaman, the Justice Department's chief anti-trust investigator and the wife of Democratic Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, told Attorney General Janet Reno that she will leave her post on or before November 15.  The government initiated more investigations of companies for price-fixing in the first year of Bingaman's tenure than during the entire decade preceding it.  Last year, the Justice Department filed a record 60 anti-trust complaints and obtained $41.5 million in fines from firms.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A maker of high-end cigars cashed in on the stogie's comeback this week,</B> holding an initial public offering on the Nasdaq Small-Cap Market.  Miami-based <A HREF = "http://www.caribcigar.com">Caribbean Cigar Company</A> appreciated 54% in value during its first two days of trading Thursday and Friday, moving from $7 per share to $10.75.  The offering came as cigars are back in fashion among young, well-to-do crowds, especially in the nation's cities.  Sales for premium cigars went up more than 30% in 1995 and jumped 50% in the first half of this year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The amount of money flowing into stock mutual funds went down sharply this week,</B> according to research firm AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif.  In the week ending Wednesday, AMG says investors spent $620 million on investments in stock funds, down 300% from a week earlier.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The opening weekend of the Olympics didn't cut into home video rentals,</B> according to a weekly survey by polling firm Alexander & Associates.  If that trend continues through the closing ceremonies this weekend, video companies such as Blockbuster Entertainment might receive an unexpected boost heading into the third quarter, say analysts.<BR>

<H3> The supply-side foundation of a presidential dream </H3>

Trailing by a wide margin in most polls, Republican presidential candidate Robert Dole moved on Monday to bridge the gap between 1996 and his party's Reagan-era glory days.  Specifically, Dole made supply-side theory the cornerstone of his economic plan, drawing immediate comparisons to Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential race.  <BR>
<BR>
"If our economy was a patient, the doctor would have it committed to the hospital as anemic," Dole told a national television audience during a campaign stop in Chicago.  "The economy can and will grow faster than it has since 1992."  Following the most basic supply-side prescription, Dole proposed tax cuts totaling $548 billion, which, he says, will pay for themselves by generating economic growth and increased revenue.<BR>
<BR>
Most economists agree that tax cuts can, in fact, boost long-term economic growth, but their opinions vary widely on just how much that increase might be and how likely it is to affect government revenues.  Supply-siders argue that decreasing the tax burden and government regulation will encourage savings, which will lead to more investment, which means more economic growth and, eventually, increased prosperity.  Dole needs 3.5% annual growth rates over the next six years for his projections to balance out, compared to President Clinton's forecast of 2.3% annual growth.<BR>
<BR>
 Naysayers have three caveats to such rosy predictions:<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Reagan cut taxes 25% in the early 1980s, yet the economy didn't reach annual economic growth rates equal to those of the 1950s and 1960s — the same benchmark Dole hopes to hit with a 15% across-the-board cut.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Unlike during the Reagan years, the U.S. is now very near "full employment," with joblessness at its lowest point in decades.  It will be difficult to increase growth without putting upward pressure on wages, leading to inflation levels that might offset any economic gain.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI>The deficit is higher now than it was at the beginning of Reagan's administration and Americans are more conscious of it, which means Dole has less 'wiggle-room' to be off the mark with his calculations.  Should growth not equal Dole's forecast, the deficit is likely to grow.<BR>
<BR>
"As a taxpayer, I know this plan would benefit me and I'm interested in pursuing it," says economics professor Anthony Loviscek of Seton Hall University.  "But as an economist, I would say that it is based on a perfect-case economic scenario that is pretty difficult to achieve."<BR>
<BR>
What are your thoughts on this issue?  Disregarding the obvious partisan angles to this question, do you think a 15% tax cut is likely to spur enough economic growth to overcome the resulting loss of revenue?  <A HREF = "mailto:snelson@kiplinger.com">Email us</A> with your thoughts.<BR>

<LI><B>The Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose to a record high in June,</B> the Conference Board said Monday.  Designed to gauge economic activity six to nine months in the future, the leading indicators went up 0.5% in June, following 0.3% and 0.2% gains in April and May, respectively.  The June total of 102.9 also represents the highest reading since the government began computing the index nearly three decades ago.  The strong reading may create concern on Wall Street about the economy's strength heading into the Federal Reserve Board's August 20 meeting on interest-rate policy.  If the Fed feels that the economy may be growing too fast and thereby inciting inflation, it is might raise short-term interest rates — bad news for investors.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A larger number of Olympic athletes will cash in on their fame than ever before,</B> <I>Advertising Age</I> predicted in its new issue, released Monday.  Instead of a small number of athletes emerging to become instant celebrities, such as Mary Lou Retton and Bruce Jenner have done following previous Olympic games, the weekly newspaper of the marketing crowd says that a large number of athletes will take advantage of a broader array of endorsement opportunities and speaking engagements.  Best bets, according to the publication: record-setting sprinter Michael Johnson, the entire women's gymnastics team, decathlete Dan O'Brien and swimmer Tom Dolan.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Make investments, not war,</B> six-year-old Jeremy Herrmann of Pepper Pike, Ohio, told the Nasdaq stock market as part of the exchange's recent essay contest on "What Stock Markets Mean to America."  Jeremy wrote: "I asked my dad what a stock market is.  He said that I had to know about stocks and bombs.  I know what a bomb is.  I don't know what a stock is.  But a stock market must be better than a bomb market.  So I think that stock markets are good for America."  Nasdaq invited Jeremy to the awards ceremony in Washington, DC, over the weekend and presented him with a special award — The Nasdaq Peace Prize.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>America West Airlines initiated a new round of fare-cutting on Monday,</B> offering tickets as low as $50 each way on long-haul routes.  One-way fares of $50, $100 or $150 will be offered on most America West routes, with exceptions at "capacity-controlled airports" such as Los Angeles' Orange County, New York's La Guardia and DC's Washington National.  <A HREF = "http://www.americawest.com/awainc/facts/facts3.html">A list of cities America West serves</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.americawest.com/cgi-bin/awa2.cgi">specific flight information</A> are available on the company's Web site.<BR>

<H3> Sandwich generation tries to balance work/home life </H3>
Many middle-aged Americans are in a tough spot these days.  A typical scenario involves two working adults with kids still in school and parents who are getting up in the years — leaving them caught in a financial squeeze between paying for their kids' college education and possibly supporting their parents, all while trying to save for their own retirement.  A 1995 survey by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation found that middle-agers are just as concerned about taking care of their aging parents as they are about crime, losing their job or paying for their kids' education.<BR>
<BR>
Yet only 36% of employers now offer elder-care assistance programs, according to a new nationwide survey by William Mercer, Inc., which leaves many workers sandwiched between taking care of their parents and keeping their jobs.  That's likely to change in the years ahead, says Mercer's Marc Vallario.  "Interest in [elder-care benefits] is likely to grow as the population continues to age," the Richmond, Va.-based consultant says.<BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, though, those thinking about taking a leave of absence or quitting their jobs may want to think twice.  In addition to the added financial strain, quitting can lead to loneliness, bitterness and depression, say experts.  "There are a lot of social supports for young mothers, but almost no classes or neighborhood get-togethers for people staying at home with an elder," says gerontologist Helen Susik.  <BR>
<BR>
One option for people who would like to take time off work without quitting entirely is the Family and Medical Leave Act.  It allows workers at companies with more than 50 employees to take up to three months of unpaid leave each year to care for a sick parent and still return to their old job or an equivalent one.  If you do decide to quit your job eventually, you should use your leave first.  That way, you'll gain an extra 12 weeks of health insurance coverage under your employer's plan.<BR>

<LI><B>The new manager of Fidelity's Magellan fund slowly started to move away from his predecessor's defensive positions in June,</B> according to a company report released Tuesday.  Robert Stansky, who took over management of the $55 billion fund from Jeffrey Vinik on June 3, reduced bond holdings from 19.3% of assets to 18.6% of assets in his first month on the job, the "Perspective on Performance" report says (which you can download from <A HREF = "http://www.fid-inv.com/mutual/fund_data/EQ/21.html">Fidelity's Web site</A>).  Vinik loaded up on bonds at the end of 1995, just before bond prices headed down sharply.  That hurt the fund's performance this year and led to widespread criticism of his management style, which ultimately contributed to his departure.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Brokerage houses routinely pressure their analysts to give high marks to companies that work with the brokerage,</B> a new study by Columbia University's business school suggests.  Conducted between 1989 and 1993, the study found that analysts at brokerage firms that work with a company give its stock a better evaluation than disinterested raters 93% of the time.  The study's authors plan to officially release the results at the annual meeting of the Academy of Management, this weekend in Cincinnati.  The brokerages' trade group, the Securities Industry Association, denies that any industry-wide bias exists in analysts' reports.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Major airlines initiated a new fare war on Tuesday,</B> slashing prices on long-haul routes in response to an America West reduction announced Monday.  American, Delta, TWA and United quickly matched America West's fares on routes with direct competition, offering cross-country trips for as little $200 round-trip.  The tickets must be purchased before Saturday, but can be used through December 15.  The "holiday weekends" of November 17-22 and November 30-December 2 are not included, though.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Atlanta Olympics will turn a small profit when all is said and done,</B> organizing committee co-chair Andrew Young said late Monday.  A former mayor of Atlanta and ambassador to the United Nations, Young said he expects the organizing committee to end up "slightly in the black" after ongoing merchandise sales are included.  He also predicted $5 billion worth of new business will be attracted to Atlanta in the next four years because of the Olympics.<BR>

<BR>
<H3> Your broker can make her fortune without any help from you </H3>
Lest you're worried about your broker being able to put food on her table, the Securities Industry Association released the average broker's 1995 salary this week — and it isn't chump change.  Thanks in part to a good year in the stock and bond markets, the average earnings for a retail broker rose 6% to nearly $124,000 last year.  They did even better at big Wall Street firms like Goldman, Sachs and Morgan Stanley, averaging close to $300,000 for the year.  <BR>
<BR>
Suffice it to say that your financial adviser won't be forced out of house and home if you're stingy with the commissions you pay.  Keeping in mind that jumping in and out of investments bumps up your commission charges, then, we have compiled seven questions your broker should be prepared to answer when she calls recommending a change to your portfolio.  If you don't get the answers you like, nix the trade.<BR>
<BR>
<I><LI>Why switch and why now?<BR>
<BR>
<LI>How does this fit with my overall investment objectives?<BR>
<BR>
<LI>What are the capital-gains tax consequences?<BR>
<BR>
<LI>What are the costs involved and how will the broker be compensated?<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Are there any recent changes in a company's (or a fund's) management that I should know about?<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Where can I get more information?</I>  Value Line Investment Survey (for stocks, 800-833-0046) and <A HREF = "http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/msmf.pl">Morningstar Mutual Funds</A> can be particularly useful.<BR>
<BR>
<I><LI>Are there alternative ways to accomplish the same goal less expensively?<BR></I>
<BR>
The point of all this is not to begrudge brokers their salaries, but to make sure your broker puts your interests above her commissions.  For information about selecting a broker in the first place, read <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1996/July/broker.html">"Less Than Full Disclosure"</A> from the July issue of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>.  <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>In brief</H3> 
<UL>
<LI><B>The number of layoffs continued to rise in July</B> according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, which tracks layoff announcements daily.  A total of 41,843 layoffs were announced during the month, up from 40,163 in June and 23,283 in July of 1995.  The largest cutbacks in July were announced by Digital Equipment Corp., which shed 7,000 jobs, and Allied Signal Inc., which eliminated 6,100 positions.  "The current job picture is a paradox," says John Challenger of Challenger, Gray & Christmas.  "In some industries, job shortages are starting to drive up wages and some areas of the country report nearly full employment."  In others, evidently, the picture is less rosy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A "Superstar of Tomorrow" switched fund companies this week.</B>  Mary Lisanti, <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1996/June/stars.html">tabbed a superstar fund manger</A> in the June issue of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>, left Bankers Trust this week for Strong Capital Management.  Lisanti has managed BT Capital Appreciation and BT Small Cap funds since 1993, beating the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index since then in both cases.  Lisanti takes over the Strong Small Cap fund, which has been managed by Charles Paquelet since its inception last year.  Paquelet moved on to become co-manager of the Strong Discovery fund.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Most Americans don't think the presidential election will have a large impact on the economy,</B> according to a Reuters poll released this week.  The survey, conducted by John Zogby Group International, found that independent voters — those least inclined to have an emotional attachment to either major party — are apparently disillusioned with the election-year promises of both parties.  Most voters overall felt that interest rates will either rise or stay the same in the near future and most are downbeat about the economy's near-term outlook regardless of who wins in November.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>New cash flowing into stock and bond mutual funds dropped 86% in July,</B> the Investment Company Institute estimated Wednesday.  While the final statistics won't be released until later in the month, ICI estimates that stock funds gained about $3.5 billion during July, down from $14.5 billion in June.  Bond and fixed-income funds, on the other hand, had $1.5 billion more taken out during the month than was placed in the funds.  That compares to a smaller, $207 million net outflow during June.<BR>

<H3> As conventions near, political maneuvering hits the Web
</H3>

Concerned about the pocketbook implications of the presidential race?  This fall, you can easily bypass the traditional news media and get the nitty-gritty economic details straight from the donkey's (or elephant's) mouth via the Internet.  In fact, if you have the patience to sift through the partisan ax-grinding, you may just be able to dig up information that affects you — but doesn't make the nightly news.<BR>
<BR>
The campaigns have been taking pot-shots at each other since Monday, when Republican candidate Bob Dole unveiled his economic prescription for what ails America.  For an update on the mudslinging, both <A HREF = "http://www.dole96.com/news/hottopics/htaug0596a.html">Dole's Web site</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.cg96.org/main/br/econo/index.htm">President Clinton's site</A> provide partisan arguments for each candidate's economic policy.  For more information about the Dole plan, read Monday's News of the Day <A HREF = "dn0805.html">"The supply-side foundation of a presidential dream."</A>  <BR>
<BR>
With the Republican national convention opening this weekend in San Diego, political junkies can also take heart in the fact that up-to-the-minute coverage of both major conventions will be available online.  Both the <A HREF = "http://www.democrats.org/party/convention/index.html">Democrats</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.convention96.rnc.org/live.htm">Republicans</A> have created "official" convention Web sites offering live coverage of events, as well as schedules of speakers.  Unofficial sites have also popped up in <A HREF = "http://www.a2z.com/underground/under.htm">Chicago</A> (site of the Democratic convention August 26-29) and <A HREF = "http://www.electriciti.com/~crowe/">San Diego</A>.<BR>
<BR>
For a primer on where the candidates stand on economic issues, you can also read <A HREF = "/magazine/aug96/maaug96.html#guide">"Clinton vs. Dole: A pocketbook guide"</A> from the August issue of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine.</I><BR>

<LI><B>Free e-mail and Internet-access backups are available in case your online provider has a system meltdown</B> similar to America Online's 19-hour crash on Wednesday.  If your business depends on e-mail or file-transfer capabilities, such delays can cause serious headaches.  Two services, <A HREF = "http://www.freemark.com"> Freemark</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.juno.com">Juno</A>, offer no-charge email if you're willing to fill out a marketing questionnaire and put up with advertising.  Depending on the area, you may also be able to hook up with "free-nets" that provide text-only Internet access and, often, file-transfer abilities.  To find one in your area, go to your search-engine of choice and do a little sleuthing.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Retail sales were strong in early July, then tapered off during the Olympics,</B> according to the Salomon Brothers retail index.  Released Thursday, the statistics point to a 2.3% overall sales increase during the month, despite the fact that many shoppers stayed home to watch the summer games on television late in the month.  Analysts said the increase is good news for store owners, whose sales recovered during the spring and early summer after a lackluster Christmas season.  The Commerce Department will release its sales figures on Tuesday, but those statistics also include sales in restaurants and car dealerships.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Interest rates on fixed-rate mortgages fell this week to the lowest levels since April 5,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said Thursday.  Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages fell to 7.88% this week, down from 8.23% a week ago.  Fifteen-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with refinancers, also plunged during the week - moving from 7.75% to 7.40%.  Introductory rates on adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 5.89%, down 0.09% from a week ago.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Despite last week's uptick, the four-week average of new applications for unemployment insurance is at its lowest level in a year and a half,</B> according to Labor Department statistics released Thursday.  The number of Americans filing jobless claims increased from 294,000 to 318,000 last week, but the monthly average still dropped to 325,000, it's lowest reading since late 1994.  Many analysts prefer to keep track of the four-week average, since it tends to smooth out one-time spikes in the numbers.<BR>

<H3> Gold-medal global investing </H3>

Like most Olympians competing at the summer games last month, Mark Holowesko didn't go home with a medal.  The 36-year-old from Nassau, Bahamas, teamed up with countryman Myles Pritchard to finish 18th in the two-man sailing competition, but the lack of a medal didn't tarnish the experience for him.  "To spend two-and-a-half weeks with a group of world-class athletes and to be competitive with the best sailors on the planet was just an incredible experience," Holowesko says.<BR>
<BR>
Those athletes would have been wise to pick Holowesko's brain for money-management tips while they had the chance.  It turns out that Holowesko is a world-class mutual fund manager, controlling more than $30 billion in assets for the Templeton family of funds.  He has managed Templeton's Foreign, Growth and World funds since 1987, racking up above-average returns on all three by zeroing in on value plays around the globe.  <BR>
<BR>
Now that he's had a little time to recover from his Olympic experience, we caught up with Holowesko in his Nassau office this week to get his thoughts on global investing in the second half of 1996.  Predictably, he sees buying opportunities in several locales that are off the radar screens of more growth-oriented fund managers — especially in Europe, which Holowesko sees as the land of opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
"In many respects, European companies are exactly where U.S. firms were in the early 1980s," he says.  "Costs are too high, companies employ too many workers and the idea of shareholder value is a foreign concept.  But, like the U.S. was eventually forced to do, Europe is starting to put its financial house in order."<BR>
<BR>
As a result, Holowesko says, the region provides one of the better global investment opportunities for the next three to five years.  He is especially fond of The Netherlands' Philips Electronics, which you can buy shares of on the New York Stock Exchange (ticker PHG).  Philips' share price is low relative to the value of its holdings, Holowesko says, one of his favorite buying scenarios.  "It's hard to lose when you buy $1 worth of assets for 50 cents," he says.  <BR>
<BR>
Holowesko also sees future profits in Asian travel stocks.  He says the standard of living is increasing across the region, which will lead to a huge new "consumer class" of Asians who want to travel more.  "When people make more money, they want to take more vacations and go other places," he says.  "It's as simple as that."  <BR>
<BR>
Good ways to cash in on that trend, Holowesko says, include aircraft manufacturer Boeing (BA, New York Stock Exchange) and Cathay Pacific Airways (CPCAY, trades over the counter).  Boeing stands to profit as the primary maker of new Asian planes, Holowesko says, and Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific is a dominant air carrier that "still has room to grow."<BR>

<LI><B>The Securities and Exchange Commission censured a major stock market for the first time this week,</B> chastising Nasdaq for allowing brokers to overcharge investors.  The report released Thursday ordered Nasdaq to add $20 million to its annual enforcement budget for the next five years, culminating a two-year investigation into the market's operations.  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversees Nasdaq, allowed a fraternity-like culture to flourish on the exchange.  "The NASD was not blind to these practices in the marketplace," Levitt said.  "It simply looked the other way."<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Businesses find the suburbs more appealing than cities,</B> according to a study released Friday by brokerage house Cushman & Wakefield.  The study of office-building vacancy rates during the second quarter showed vacancies at office buildings in both city-center areas and suburban areas declining — but they went down faster in the suburbs.  The suburban rate dropped from 15.1% to 14.2% during the quarter, while the city rate moved from 16.1% to 15.9%.  "Suburbs offer buildings that are a little newer, technologically smarter and closer to where people live," says Cushman & Wakefield's research director, Maria Sicola.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Wholesale prices didn't change during July,</B> the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday.  The Producer Price Index remained unchanged during the month, following a moderate 0.2% increase in June and a 0.1% drop the month before that.  The PPI measures the prices of finished products before they reach the retail-sales level.  The BLS will release a report of the Consumer Price Index, which measures retail inflation, on Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>An early freeze could send heating oil prices through the roof in the Northeast,</B> analysts said this week after September heating oil futures jumped to 59 cents-per-gallon on Thursday, up from 50 cents at this point a year ago.  The amount of heating oil stored by retailers is expected to hit an all-time low this winter as companies try to reduce overhead costs, forcing up prices.<BR>

<H3> Fidelity Magellan loses record $3.5 billion in latest month </H3>

The nation's largest mutual fund got a little smaller in July, Fidelity Investments admitted on Monday.  In its monthly "Perspective on Performance," Fidelity said the assets of its flagship Magellan fund declined from $54.47 billion on June 30 to $50.97 on July 31.  Nearly $2.5 billion of the loss is attributable to the fund's 4.65% drop during the month, while the remaining $1 billion came as investors redeemed their shares during the month's stock-market volatility.<BR>
<BR>
"It's the biggest dollar loss in a month in our memory," says Michael Lipper of Lipper Analytical Services, which has been tracking fund assets for three decades.  For the year, Magellan ranked 620th out of the 665 "growth funds" followed by Lipper, mostly because the fund missed the early-year runup in stock prices when previous manager Jeff Vinik stockpiled defensive holdings.  <BR>
<BR>
New manager Bob Stansky, in his first full month on the job, did what he could to change that.  Stansky got rid of both cash and bonds during the month, while increasing the fund's percentage of stock holdings from 72.2% to 79% and boosting the fund's exposure to foreign equities.  Stansky is "undertaking a process of reviewing the fund holdings," the Fidelity statement said.<BR>

<LI><B>The New York Stock Exchange may move from Wall Street,</B> a spokesman confirmed Monday following published reports.  "We are in the very preliminary stages of examining our needs for physical space," spokesman Andrew Yemma said.  "We are determining whether we are running out of space" at the exchange's headquarters on the corner of Broad and Wall streets in New York.  The <I>New York Post</I> reported in Monday's edition that the exchange is considering two other sites in lower Manhattan.  One plan calls for a new building 2 Broadway and the other would have developer Donald Trump build a new exchange at New York's South Street Seaport.  The NYSE has been based at its present location since 1903.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Orders for U.S.-made machine tools remained strong in June,</B> according to a report released jointly over the weekend by the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association and the Association for Manufacturing Technology.  Machine tools are used to shape metal during the manufacturing process; demand for them is thought to provide an indication of how strong manufacturers think future orders will be.  The report estimates the June orders at $643.1 million, but it's difficult to compare with earlier numbers since this is the first jointly issued statement from the groups.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Rates paid by short-term Treasury bills fell in Monday's auction,</B> dropping to the lowest level since late spring.  The Treasury Department sold $12.6 billion in three-month bills at an average rate of 5.04%, down from 5.08% a week ago and the lowest since May 28.  Another $12.5 billion was sold of six-month bills at an average rate of 5.08%, down from 5.13% last week and the lowest since April 22.<BR>

<H3>Online help with back-to-school financial aid </H3>

When the University of Virginia called a couple of weeks ago to offer a spot among its class of first-year law students, 24-year-old Katrina Reinhardt jumped at the chance despite the late date.  "Since it was already late in the summer, I knew that I had missed the traditional financial-aid application period," she says.  "But I also knew that I might not get another chance at this."  <BR>
<BR>
After spending months on the waiting list, Reinhardt figured that her decision to take the Virginia offer would cost her about $30,000 more than if she had accepted the scholarship offered by a smaller school — unless she came up with some financial aid on her own.  Only weeks before she was supposed to arrive on campus in Charlottesville, Va., Reinhardt took her financial-aid search online.  In less than half an hour, much less time than it would have taken hunting through scholarship books at the library, she identified eight grants and five loan programs for which she qualified.<BR>
<BR>
With college costs higher than ever before, many students — and their parents — are looking for financial aid in every nook and cranny these days.  Reinhardt tapped into one source available to anybody who is capable of reading <I>News of the Day</I>: <A HREF = "http://www.fastweb.com">FastWEB</A>, a free aid-tracking database that compares nearly 200,000 private and state-funded sources of financial aid with each student's profile.  <BR>
<BR>
There are several dozen companies that will run similar searches, but they typically charge between $5 and $150 to do so.  FastWEB is unique in that it is supported by the advertising it sells to companies wanting to reach students.  Individual colleges and universities also pay for the right to market FastWEB as their own scholarship service.<BR>
<BR>
Another good starting place for cybersearches is <A HREF = "http://www.finaid.org/finaid.html">FinAid</A>, a site organized by the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.  It includes financial-aid calculators, tuition-payment plans and information broken down by type of academic program.<BR>

<LI><B>The Consumer Price Index increased 0.3 percent in July.</B> This follows a 0.1 percent increase in June and a 0.3 percent increase in May.  Analysts had been expecting an advance of  0.2 percent for July.  Contributing to the Commerce Department's CPI figures were increases in food, housing and medical costs.  During July, food prices increased 0.5 percent and housing costs increased 0.4 percent.  Energy costs decreased by 0.4 percent.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Retail sales increased by 0.1 percent in July,</B> according to a Commerce Department report released today. Automobile sales bore the brunt of the decline with a drop of 0.6 percent.  This on the heels of a 1.7 percent decline in automobile sales for June.  Food sales increased 0.8 percent in July, which was its largest increase since December.<BR>

<H3> Surprise!  Internet casting a wider net </H3>
<P>
More than 48 million people in the U.S. and Canada now have Internet access.  Maybe. According to a new Nielsen poll, almost a quarter of all adults in North America now <I>claim</I> to have access to the Internet, a 70% increase over a similar survey six months ago. But Nielsen wouldn't project the actual number of people using the Internet.  "The focus here was to measure change," not raw numbers, says Paul Lindstrom of Nielsen Media Research, which  released the survey this week.  Regardless of the exact number, though, the increased use portends a similar increase in cyber-content, as data providers and others strive to reach the growing market.<BR>
<P>
But the bigger story out of the survey, some would argue, is the "democratization of the Internet," because the growth in users appears to be coming from newcomers who are older, have less money, are less educated and spend less time online than the medium's early users.  "What we're seeing is that Internet access and use are becoming increasingly mainstream," says David Harkness of Nielsen.  <BR>
<P>
Nielsen first tried to pin down the number of online users six months ago, but received widespread criticism from academics who said the poll's estimates were too high.  Consequently, Nielsen was much more cautious this time around, choosing not to state an actual estimate for the number of users in North America.  The results still provide the most convincing evidence to date about the explosive growth of the 'Net, say analysts.  "This is a validation about some of the hype about the Internet," says Asim Abdullah of the Internet industry consortium Commercenet.<BR>
<P>
If you prefer to decide for yourself, an <A HREF = "http://www.nielsenmedia.com/commercenet/exec.html">executive summary of the study</A> is available online (the full report can be yours for $5,000).  <BR>

<LI><B>China, Cuba, France, Iran, Israel and Russia routinely try to steal high-tech business secrets from the U.S.,</B> the Central Intelligence Agency claims in a report released Wednesday.  "We have only identified about a half-dozen governments that we believe have extensively engaged in economic espionage as we define it," the CIA said in its report to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which was dated May 10.  "Japan and a number of other countries [also] engage in economic collection, but we believe their efforts are mostly legal and involve seeking openly available material or hiring well-placed consultants."  Spokespersons from the French and Israeli embassies immediately denied the charges.<BR>
<P>
<LI><B>Home prices went up at twice the rate of inflation over the past year,</B> the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday.  As of the end of June, the median price of an existing home in the U.S. was $118,900, according to NAR statistics.  That represents a 7% increase from the same period in 1995; over the same time, inflation has registered about a 3.5% gain.  The Southeast saw the biggest price jumps during that 12-month span, according to the nationwide survey that the association conducts each quarter.<BR>
<P>
<LI><B>Productivity at American companies weakened during the second quarter,</B> the Labor Department said Wednesday.  A measure of output per worker per hour, productivity fell 0.1% for non-farm companies during the April through June period, following a 1.8% gain during the first three months of the year.  Also Wednesday, the Commerce Department announced that business inventories rose 0.1% during June.<BR>

<H3> GOP convention sends Clinton futures down a nickel </H3>
The Republican convention this week in San Diego has boosted Bob Dole's stock as a presidential contender — literally.  Since Sunday's close, Dole shares on the <A HREF = "http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/index.html">Iowa Electronic Market</A> have risen from 29 cents each to 32 cents.  President Clinton still fares better on the exchange, although his shares have dropped nearly a nickel to 66 cents during the week.<br>
<br>
Managed by the University of Iowa's business school, the Iowa Electronic Market is a financial exchange that has proven itself more accurate than polls in forecasting the past two presidential elections.  To get started, investors have to pony up between $5 and $500 for an equal number of futures contracts on each candidate.  If you think the market is overly optimistic on the president's chances, you can sell some of your Clinton shares to buy more of Dole's.  If the Republican nominee pulls off an upset, you'll make money by cashing in each Dole share for $1.  If Dole loses, the shares are worthless.<br>
<br>
The premise behind the market, says University of Iowa economics professor Forrest Nelson, is that voters don't have any incentive to tell phone surveyors the truth.  When their investment is on the line, though, people are likely to make better judgments.  "If a pollster calls me up, I'll answer as quickly as possible so that I can get back to the ballgame," Nelson says.  "People will pay more attention when they have money on the table."<br>
<br>
But the presidential race isn't the only election tracked by the market.  You can also place your bets on which party will control Congress or even the parliamentary election in Vienna, Austria.<br>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<LI><B>Industrial output is stalled and unemployment is up slightly,</B> according to a pair of government reports released Thursday.  The Federal Reserve Board said that output at the nation's factories, mines and utility companies increased a paltry 0.1% in July, the smallest gain in four months.  Separately, the Labor Department said new applications for unemployment benefits totaled 321,000 last week, up from 316,000 a week earlier.  The announcements were seen on Wall Street as indications that the Fed might not raise interest rates when it meets next week, since the economy appears to be slowing on its own.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Interest rates on the most common type of home mortgage didn't change this week, </B>the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said Thursday.  Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.88% this week, unchanged from the week before and the lowest its been since early April.  The introductory rate on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 5.81% during the week, down from 5.89% last week.  Fifteen-year mortgages were also down, dropping from 7.40% to 7.39%.  For potential homebuyers in the market for a mortgage, a new service, <A HREF = "http://www.mortnet.com">MortNet</A>, also made its debut this week.  It will match you with lenders in your region.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Coffee futures jumped sharply higher this week on news that the supply of premium coffee beans is running low.</B>  At the Coffee, Sugar & Cocoa Exchange in New York City, for example, the stockpile of high-end coffee fell from 627,000 bags a year ago to fewer than 10,000 bags today.  Supply last dwindled in 1994, when frost and drought damaged Brazil's coffee crop and sent consumer prices soaring in the U.S.  A spokesman for the Starbucks coffee chain said he doesn't expect prices to be affected this time around.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $20 million to the state of West Virginia to settle a lawsuit filed seven years ago,</B> the New York firm acknowledged Thursday.  The suit accused Morgan Stanley of selling inappropriately risky securities to the state's board of investments, leading to a $280 million loss in 1986 and 1987.  The state had already received about $28 million in settlements from other securities firms.  As part of the settlement, Morgan Stanley did not admit wrongdoing.<BR>

<H3> Lord, won't you buy me a (diesel-powered) Mercedes-Benz?</H3>
Need one last, little nudge to buy a new Mercedes this weekend?  Try this: Next week will bring an end to the federal tax credit for folks who buy diesel-powered cars and pickups.<BR>
<BR>
That credit — worth $102 to buyers of new diesel-powered cars and $198 to those who buy new diesel-powered trucks and vans — will disappear the day after President Clinton signs the legislation that will raise the minimum wage, which he is expected to do next week.  A provision to kill the diesel car credit was tucked into that bill.<BR>
<BR>
If you buy a qualifying vehicle before the law changes, you'll get your savings when you file your 1996 tax return next spring.  Mercedes-Benz may be the most-affected manufacturer, since it sells about 3,000 diesel-powered sedans each year.<BR>
<BR>
The credit is designed to compensate buyers of new diesel-powered cars, light trucks and vans for an increase in the diesel fuel tax that was aimed at commercial users.  Until it became a victim of the budget-cutting frenzy this year, the tax break was originally supposed to be available through 1998.<BR>

<LI><B>Construction of new homes and apartments fell in July to the lowest level in four months, </B>the Commerce Department said Friday.  New housing starts fell 1.3% to 1.46 million units during the month, but varied widely by region.  Strong 17.1% growth in the Midwest, for example, was offset by a 12.2% decline in the Western states.  Despite the drop, starts during the first seven months of the year were 12.4% higher than during the same period last year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Money flowing into stock mutual funds in August appears to be on par with June's inflows,</B> according to statistics released Friday by AMG Data Services of Arcata, Calif.  During the week ending Wednesday, AMG says investors added $1.62 billion to stock funds, down sharply from $5.64 billion a week earlier.  The money also appears to be moving into more conservative sectors of stock funds.  AMG found that "growth and income" funds were the most popular during the week, following a six-month span in which "aggressive growth" funds led the way.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Younger Americans started retirement planning earlier than their Baby Boomer parents,</B> according to a new study by the American Stock Exchange.  AMEX found that about 63% of Americans between 25 and 34 years old have started saving for their retirements and 43% of them have begun setting aside money for their children's education.  Investors in the younger age group are also more likely to do their own investment research, the study concluded.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Fidelity wants to shield holders of its 40 money market funds from losses,</B> according to a filing the company made with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week.  Fidelity would like to establish an affiliated insurance company that will guarantee holders of its money market funds that they won't lose money if the issuer of a security owned by the funds were to default.  Unlike money market accounts, money market funds are not typically insured against loss.<BR>

<H3> Netscape joins the battle over browser supremacy</H3>
Netscape Communications Corp. came out of its corner swinging Monday in its bid to topple software giant Microsoft and remain atop the heap of Internet browsers.  Netscape unveiled the newest incarnation of its leading Navigator browser only one week after Microsoft threw a haymaker of its own with the release of its Internet Explorer 3.0 browser.  <BR>
<BR>
And the brawl between the industry heavyweights is probably just beginning, given the resources each company has at its disposal.  Microsoft already controls much of the software world, manufacturing the widely used Windows operating system among other things, and would like to similarly dominate the Internet market.  But Netscape is no lightweight itself.  Depending on whose numbers you believe, between 80% and 90% of current Internet users move through the online world via Netscape's software.<BR>
<BR>
To entice users, both Navigator 3.0 and Internet Explorer 3.0 are packaged with free access to Web sites that otherwise charge an entrance fee.  Navigator comes with five months of free access to the online version of <I>The New York Times</I>, SportsLine USA and other sites.  Internet Explorer's package includes the online version of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> and ESPNET SportsZone.  Most of the bells and whistles are also common to both browsers, as neither company wants to give the other an advantage.<BR>
<BR>
There are a few differences between the browsers, though.  In its favor, Navigator 3.0 digests information more quickly than Internet Explorer 3.0 and it's available for more types of computers.  The Netscape browser is free for a three-month trial and then costs $49.95 for a license to use it, although educational users or those in non-profit organizations can continue to use it indefinitely without paying.  You can <A HREF = "http://www.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_3.0/index.html">get more information</A> or <A HREF = "http://www.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/client_download.html">download Navigator 3.0</A> from the Netscape Web site.<BR>
<BR>
The biggest advantage of Internet Explorer 3.0 is that it's free.  Since the Redmond, Wash. company can subsidize its Internet battle with proceeds from other profitable types of software, it can afford to discourage competition by offering its browser at no charge.  You can <A HREF = "http://www.microsoft.com">download Internet Explorer 3.0</A> from the company's Web site.<BR>

<LI><B>The nation's largest health-maintenance organization and a nationwide doctors' group pledged Monday to work together,</B> as Kaiser Permanente issued a joint report with the American College and Emergency Physicians.  The statement represents a truce of sorts between doctors and HMOs, which have been feuding in recent months over how to cover emergency room visits that some insurance companies think are unneeded.  The two groups pledged to work together to come up with new federal guidelines about what HMOs should be required to cover.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>AT&T's president and chief operating officer resigned unexpectedly on Monday,</B> sending shares of the telecommunications giant down 2.5%.  Alex Mandl, 52, said he is leaving AT&T to become the president and chief executive officer of Associated Communications, a new enterprise working to develop wireless networks in the U.S.  Share prices of The Associated Group, Associated Communications' parent company, rose $5.25 to $30.25 on the news.  Some analysts said Mandl was in line to replace AT&T CEO Robert Allen in four years.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>UPS on Monday began giving away new computer package-tracking software,</B> following similar service by rival Federal Express.  The software, which only works on windows operating with a Windows environment, interacts with UPS' Web site to find package drop-off points, request a package pickup or compare shipping costs.  Up to 100 packages can be simultaneously followed.  Both <A HREF = "http://www.ups.com/tracking/tracking.html">UPS</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.fedex.com/track_it.html">FedEx</A> also have package-tracking pages on their respective Internet sites.<BR>

<H3>Fed stays the course amid signs of a moderating economy</H3>
So the Federal Reserve Board decided not to increase short-term interest rates today.  You probably expected that.  The larger issue is what the Fed is likely to do in the months ahead, right?<BR>
<BR>
The basic equation comes down to this: The Fed lowers interest rates when it thinks the economy needs a boost, and raises them when it wants to slow things down to prevent inflation.  Because of interest rates' effect on consumer spending, lower rates tend to send stock prices up and higher ones typically depress the markets.  Tuesday, Fed policymakers did none of the above, evidently deciding that the economy was slowing down enough on its own after a sizzling spring.<BR>
<BR>
Under normal circumstances, such a decision would send stock prices up sharply, but no big rally materialized today.  The reason?  Some analysts think the basic equation doesn't apply during the months leading up to a presidential election.  Not wanting to appear to support either political party's take on the economy, according to this school of thought, the Fed attempts to stay out of the headlines during the crucial months of presidential campaigns.  In fact, the Fed hasn't raised rates in the months preceding an election since 1980, the last time inflation was in double-digit territory.<BR>
<BR>
If that argument turns out to be correct, then rates should be stable until election day, after which all bets are off.  The August 16 issue of <I>The Kiplinger Washington Letter</I> forecast that the Fed probably won't weigh in until after November 5, and will watch wage increases and jobless numbers closely between now and then for signs of inflation.  Continued tight labor markets would lead to higher inflation, and higher interest rates, later in the year.<BR>

<LI><B>Acura and Isuzu sport utility vehicles may roll over during quick turns,</B> the testing director of <I>Consumer Reports</I> magazine said on Tuesday.  R. David Pittle said that 1995 and 1996 Acura SLXs and Isuzu Troopers failed avoidance-maneuver tests this month and were given rare "not acceptable" ratings, the magazine's first since 1988.  Pittle said the test involved a fast turn into the left lane to avoid an unexpected problem, a turn back into the right lane to miss oncoming traffic and a final turn to the left to straighten out.  The models are clones of each other, and about 35,000 have been sold in the U.S. with no serious accidents reported, according to the manufacturers.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>President Clinton signed into law the first minimum wage increase in five years on Tuesday,</B> giving the lowest-paid workers a 90-cent raise that will be phased in over the next year.  Currently $4.25 an hour, the minimum wage will increase to $4.75 on October 1 and to $5.15 on September 1, 1997.  Strongly supported by unions and other traditionally Democratic power bases, the bill was supported by Republicans in Congress because it included $22 billion worth of tax cuts for small businesses — traditionally one of <I>their</I> power bases.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The U.S.'s largest trade deficit in June was with China for the first time,</B> the Commerce Department said Tuesday.  Exports of American-made goods to China declined for the fourth consecutive month in June, bringing the total trade deficit between the two countries to $15.7 billion during the first six months of the year.  Meanwhile, the deficit with Japan has steadily improved during the year, Commerce said.  The second-quarter deficit with Japan of $10.5 billion was the smallest quarterly figure reported in five years.<BR>

<H3> An old idea receives newfound attention </H3>
Since the day Richard Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard in 1971, economists have been bickering at high-brow cocktail parties about whether we should return to it.  After more than 15 years of inflation-free economic growth, though, most Americans probably haven't given it a second thought.  That may change now that Jack Kemp, a long-time supporter of the gold standard, has been tabbed as the Republican vice presidential candidate — giving new life to the old arguments.<BR>
<BR>
Under the gold standard, a government has to keep enough gold on hand to cover whatever paper money it prints.  The idea is to keep governments from raising revenue by simply printing more money, which can lead to a devaluation of the currency and rising prices.  Kemp has argued for years that a return to the gold standard would limit inflation and lead to lower interest rates, which would spur new economic growth.  If the Republican ticket wins in November, he would be in position to push for the system's return.<BR>
<BR>
Economist M. Northrup Beuchner of the Ayn Rand Institute in New York City thinks that would be a fabulous idea.  In the absence of a link between cash and gold, the Federal Reserve Board guides the nation's money policies, and that worries Beuchner.  "The financial well-being of the country is in the hands of a very small number of men in Washington, DC," he says.  "The overwhelming advantage of the gold standard is that it bases the money supply on an objective, physical commodity, which can't be increased without a lot of work."  Beuchner admits that the Fed has been well run since 1980, but he fears that it's only a matter of time before a mistake there pushes the U.S. into high inflation similar to that of the late 1970s.<BR>
<BR>
But others have doubts.  Economics professor James Tompkins of Georgia's Kennesaw State University says he'd rather let human beings at the Fed make monetary policy than tie it to gold, which limits the nation's flexibility.  Besides, he points out, in a fixed system, governments occasionally have to adjust the value of their currency in relation to gold to afford things on the international market, which can lead to devaluations like the one that devastated Mexico's economy in December 1994.  "How would you like it if you woke up one morning and the president announced that the dollar was suddenly worth half what it was the day before?" he asks.  "That could lead to much greater economic shocks than we're accustomed to."<BR>

<H3> How to find a great car at a reasonable price </H3>
The idea of paying $10,000 to $12,000 for a used car is sure to shock anyone. Anyone, that is, who hasn't shopped for a new car lately.<BR>
<BR>
But that price range can seem suddenly and utterly reasonable when you realize that the average price of a new car this year will kiss $21,000. No wonder the used-car market is booming.<BR>
<BR>
Financing a middle-of-the-road new car — even with 10% down and a relatively cheap 8.5%, four-year loan — costs more than $450 a month. That's $125 a month more than buyers are comfortable paying, according to surveys by CNW Marketing/Research, in Bandon, Ore. Company vice-president Art Spinella says consumers are turned off when monthly payments pass $325.<BR>
<BR>
One solution lies in the used-car market, where the average cost at a franchised dealer — whose prices are generally the highest — was recently $11,533. Financing a used car over four years — with 10% down and a 10.5% loan (used-car loans are more expensive than new-car financing) — would cost about $265 a month. Generally, prices are lower at independent used-car lots, and you can expect to pay even less if you buy from an individual.<BR>
<BR>
But which cars are the solid values? To help find the answer, <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I> recently started with a list of more than 5,000 used cars selling for around $12,000 or less. Our goal was to come up with two dozen first-rate values in the $10,000-to-$12,000 range — cars you can buy for about half the price of the average new car. The price information comes from Chrome Data Corp., of Oregon City, Ore., and reflects typical prices nationwide on cars with average mileage for their age. (Lower-mileage cars command premium prices, while those with higher mileage usually sell for less.)<BR>
<BR>
From the initial list, we dropped most of the cars priced out of our range and weeded out those with a history of serious problems. Next, we rejected vehicles with above-average upkeep costs according to IntelliChoice, publisher of The Complete Car Cost Guide ($49; 800-227-2665).<BR>
<BR>
The 50 or so cars that were left had to run the gantlet of complaints, recalls and service bulletins on file with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). We threw out the 1990 Lincoln Town Car, for example, because of a high level of complaints but kept the 1991 model because it had relatively few.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>"Voluntary simplicity" catching on with harried workers </H3>
Overwork, stress and information overload are familiar complaints among Americans. People are toiling overtime to pay the bills or to pick up the slack in a downsized work force. Two-income families are cramming the job of running a household into a frenzied Saturday of errands and chores. And the array of choices in everything from finances to leisure time is exploding. Even your morning cup of coffee can be complicated: You are asked to choose from among a couple dozen flavors, brands and styles of brew, and then you often have to decide whether to pay with cash, check, credit card or debit card. <BR>
<BR>
But in a grass-roots movement that trend watchers are calling "voluntary simplicity," Americans from all walks of life are dropping out of the race — or at least slowing the pace. Some are giving up high-pressure jobs or a second income in exchange for more free time and a saner family life. Others are taking less drastic steps to streamline household and financial tasks and to shed clutter that needs to be stored, maintained or insured. <BR>
<BR>
In a 1995 survey by the Merck Family Fund, a nonprofit philanthropic foundation, 28% of Americans polled said that within the past five years they had made voluntary changes in their lives that had decreased their earnings, such as reducing their work hours, switching to lower-paying jobs or quitting jobs to stay at home. With their new-found time and energy, they're devoting more  resources to leisure, hobbies, family or volunteer work. <BR>
<BR>
It all boils down to three questions, says Gerald Celente, director of the Trends Research Institute, in Rhinebeck, N.Y., which for three years running has put voluntary simplicity on its list of top-ten trends: How much do I really need? How much do I really want? How much work am I willing to do to get it?<BR>
<BR>
Among simplifiers, the answers vary. But those who have addressed those questions in one way or another seem pretty darned happy.  For more information about some who've done just that and how they accomplished it, read <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/aug96/down.html">"Resources for Downshifters"</A> in the August issue of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>.<BR>

<H3>Ticket Tax Roars Back to Life on Tuesday</H3>

Travelers planning to fly between now and the end of 1996 can trim their costs by buying their tickets before midnight Monday. That's when the 10% federal tax on domestic tickets comes back to life after an eight-month hiatus.<BR>
<BR>
The tax expired at the end of 1995, an unintended victim of the legislative gridlock over tax and budget issues. The bill that revived the tax, which was signed into law last week, gave travelers one extra week to beat the increase. <BR>
<BR>
How much did the government lose during the eight months the ticket tax and other airport taxes were in a state of suspended animation? More than $3 billion. Passengers didn't save that much, though, since some airlines simply increased ticket prices to absorb some, or all, of the savings.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the 10% tax on domestic tickets, a $6 per-person tax on international departures will also be reinstated on Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
Tickets purchased by midnight dodge those fees, regardless of when you actually travel. But don't rush to buy tickets for flights after December 31. That's when the tax is scheduled to expire. . .again.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<UL><LI><B>Gasoline prices fell more than half a cent during the past two weeks,</B> according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations.  For the week ending August 23, the national average for unleaded gasoline sold at self-service stations was $1.2307.  The average per-gallon retail price for all grades was $1.2982. Both averages are approximately 8 cents a gallon higher than a year ago.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Sales of previously owned homes dropped 0.5% in July, </B> according a report released today by the National Association of Realtors.  Sales of existing homes had also dropped in June after increasing in May.  Except for the Midwest, all regions of the county experienced decreases in home sales.  The NAR also reported that the median price of an existing home increased to $121,400 in July--compared to $116,000 a year earlier.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The fourth quarter job outlook improved,</B> as a survey showed that 25% of firms intend to increase their workforce during the year-end quarter, while 9% plan staff reductions.  Conducted quarterly by Manpower Inc., the Employment Outlook Survey polled 16,000 firms, and showed that the best outlook was for wholesalers and retailers--with 36% of those polled adding extra help.</UL><BR>

<H3>What If Your Trip is Cancelled?</H3>

As the last week of summer vacation comes to an end, can planning and paying for fall and winter getaways be far behind?<BR>
<BR>
The great vacation takes a great deal of planning--and a lot of  up-front cash.  But what if after booking and paying for the whole thing you can't go?  Or something sends you home early?<BR>
<BR>
To protect your vacation dollars you may want to consider purchasing trip-cancellation insurance. Coverage costs about 4 to 8 percent of the trip's cost.  The policies, usually sold through travel agents, will reimburse you for nonrefundable expenses if you're forced to cancel or interrupt your vacation for one of the covered reasons.  The policies do not pay if you cancel due to business demands or if you have a change of heart.<BR>
<BR>
Even without insurance, you may recover most of your prepaid expenses if you cancel early enough.  Most hotels allow same-day cancellations, but many top resorts require you to cancel at least three days in advance.  Cruise lines will refund much of your money if you cancel early enough for them to rebook your spot.  Cancel six days or less before sailing and you could forfeit the full fare.  Even "nonrefundable" airline tickets don't lose their value if you can't make the gate, but expect to pay $25 to $50 per ticket for rebooking.<BR>
<BR>
For those considering fall and winter vacations, you may want to book early as reservations are running significantly ahead of last year, according to Steve Loucks of The American Society of Travel Agents..<BR>

<H3>That seat on the fifty yard line will cost more this fall</H3>

This weekend marks the start of another National Football League season, and along with high expectations for team performance come higher attendance costs for the fans.<BR>
<BR>
According to the Team Marketing Report's Fan Cost Index survey, a family of four will pay an average of $208.45 to see an NFL game this year, compared to $199.09 last year.  The Fan Cost Index includes the cost of tickets, concessions, souvenirs and parking for a family of four.<BR>
<BR>
The average NFL ticket price this year is $35.74, an increase of 6.6% from $33.52 in 1995.  And if  you think a team's performance affects its ticket price, think again.  The Green Bay Packers played for the NFC championship last season, yet they have the second lowest average ticket price in the NFL this season--$30.61.  But the Oakland Raiders, who were 8-8 last year, have the highest average ticket price in the league at $51.41.<BR>
<BR>
After the Raiders, the most expensive teams to follow this season are the San Francisco 49ers, the Philadelphia Eagles and the Baltimore Ravens.  Baltimore fans will have to pony up 20 percent more to watch their new team than Cleveland fans paid last year when the team was the Browns.<BR>
<BR>
The least expensive teams to follow are the New York Jets, followed by the Green Bay Packers, the Houston Oilers and the Atlanta Falcons.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<UL><LI><B>Rules to improve individual investors' access to the best prices available for stocks traded on the Nasdaq were approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission today. </B> The new rules will require the public display of the prices and size of customer limit orders and the display of prices of orders entered by market makers in certain private trading systems.  SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said, "these rules are intended to empower all investors by planing orders on a level playing field and by providing the disclosure needed to make informed decisions."<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>H&R Block has decided not to spin off its remaining share in CompuServe,</B> citing problems with the online service industry.  CompuServe lost $17.1 million, or 19 cents a share, in the first fiscal quarter and is expected to post another loss for the second quarter.  H&R Block had already spun off 20 percent of CompuServe in April.<BR>

<H3> Investors' group says IPO deck stacked in favor of high rollers </H3>
When a hot new company like Netscape or Planet Hollywood announces plans to start selling stock to the public, the script often reads something like this: The initial public offering is hyped in the financial press in the weeks before its opening day; the price of the stock then quickly skyrockets as investors clamor to get their hands on the catch of the day; finally, the price drops and settles into a normal trading range for the longer-term.<BR>
<BR>
The only problem with that scenario, according to the National Council of Individual Investors, is that small investors are typically locked out of the early run-up as the nation's stock-underwriting companies reserve shares for big-money institutional buyers.  "Small investors are only let in when new issues are at their highest price," says the NCII's Gerri Detweiler.  "Not surprisingly, it is the small investor who gets burned when the inevitable correction sets in and the stock settles down to a more realistic price."<BR>
<BR>
Detweiler estimates that 10-15% of IPO shares generally end up in the hands of small investors, with the remainder going to "institutions and the ultra wealthy."  If small investors had been allowed to purchase 25% of new shares in 1995, she says, they would have made a collective year-end profit of $2.7 billion on the issues, instead of the $1.6 billion they actually earned.  Tens of thousands of small investors would have been affected, according to an NCII study.<BR>
<BR>
In response, the NCII unveiled a campaign Thursday designed to force the country's largest underwriters to reserve at least one-quarter of IPO shares for small investors.  The non-profit group's Web site includes <A HREF = "http://com.primenet.com/ncii/ipopet.html">a petition</A> asking firms such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers and Prudential to consider taking that step.  Names of those who sign the petition (or say they agree with it via the Internet) will be forwarded to the 25 largest underwriters on a monthly basis.  <BR>
<BR>
The NCII also issued a new book on the subject this week.  <I>Getting Your Share: An Investor's Guide to the Profits and Pitfalls in Initial Public Offerings</I> is available for $5 by calling 888-624-4111.  It includes sections on how the IPO process works and why IPOs aren't appropriate for all investors.<BR>
<BR>
Mutual funds are among the largest institutional investors that gobble up most IPO shares.  In a nod to the 'if you can't beat 'em, join 'em' school of thought, the NCII book also includes a section identifying the top 139 funds in terms of assets invested in IPO shares.  The top three listings: Ark Special Equity, BT Investment Small Cap and Govett Smaller Companies A.  <BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<LI><B>The economy grew more quickly in the second quarter than it has in the past two years,</B> according to statistics released by the Commerce Department on Thursday.  The nation's gross domestic product, a measure of the total output of goods and services, increased nearly 5% in the second quarter — the biggest quarterly jump since 1994.  Commerce also reported that sales of new single-family homes jumped 7.9% in July to 783,000, after falling 1.8% a month earlier.  Taken together, the news sent both the stock and bond markets down on Thursday as traders worried anew about higher interest rates.  The Federal Reserve Board meets again on September 24, and many worry that signs of higher inflation could force the policymakers to bump up short-term rates then.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The jobs picture nationwide held steady in July, getting better in some regions and worsening in others,</B> according to the Conference Board's monthly Help-Wanted Advertising Index, released Thursday.  During the month, help-wanted advertising at large, metropolitan newspapers fell in five regions of the country and increased in four.  The mountain states and the Northeast showed the sharpest declines, registering 5.9% and 4.2% drops respectively.  At the other end of the spectrum, the Mid-Atlantic states showed the most strength, posting a 7.3% increase.  "The labor market has been expanding throughout 1996, but in a very uneven pattern," Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>One of the online world's best-known trademarks is in jeopardy,</B> after Miss King's Kitchens Inc. asked a federal judge Wednesday to make search-engine firm Yahoo! come up with a different name.  Miss King's registered its trademark in 1989 for "The Original Texas Ya-hoo! Cake," and the company's lawyer contends that <A HREF = "http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo!'s search engine</A> and associated products infringes on that.  "The intent of filing for the injunction isn't to get them to pay a lot of money, but to get them to stop using our trademark," says lawyer Roger Mandel.  A spokesperson for the Internet company says trademark laws allow companies to use the same word for products that don't compete with each other, so the injunction request "has no merit."  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Cable television rates are up more than 10% this year to an average of about $25 per month,</B> the Bureau of Labor Statistics said this week.  The increases are allowed under the new Telecommunications Act, and some in the cable industry say they are just trying to make up for several years in which their hands were tied by legislation intended to keep rates low.  The nation's largest cable company, Telecommunications Inc. (TCI), has raised prices an average of 13.5% this year.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>How much does a semester of college <I>really</I> cost?</H3>
College tuition this year will cost, on average, more than $6,000 a semester at private schools and nearly $1,500 a semester at state-supported institutions.  But, as parents of college students know well, the costs don't end there.  Depending on the college or university in question, incidental expenses can easily reach thousands of dollars in a given semester.<BR>
<BR>
With summer drawing to a close and the school year getting under way, <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I> recently surveyed 15 colleges and universities of varying sizes and in different areas of the country to find out what it costs to get a college education these days.  In each of ten categories, here is an average response for each expense, as well as the range of costs, from lowest to highest:<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE="SQUARE"> <I>Dorm room per semester (double occupancy).</I>  An average of $1,530.  <A HREF = "http://www.nsula.edu/">Northwestern State University</A> in Natchitoches, La., $490, to St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wis., $2,575.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE="SQUARE"> <I>Full meal plan per semester.</I>  An average of $1,686.  $548 at the <A HREF = "http://www.uwstout.edu/">University of Wisconsin—Stout</A> in Menomonie, Wis., to $1,701 at <A HREF = "http://www.mckenna.edu/">Claremont McKenna College</A> in Claremont, Calif.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE="SQUARE"> <I>Computer with a Pentium chip, eight megabytes of RAM and a 500-megabyte hard drive, or an equivalent machine, through the campus bookstore.</I>  An average of $1,714.  $1,200 at <A HREF = "http://www.guilford.edu/">Guilford College</A> in Greensboro, N.C., to $2,690 at Claremont McKenna College.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE="SQUARE"> <I>500 sheets of computer paper in the bookstore.</I>  An average of $7.72.  $3.28 at <A HREF = "http://www.depauw.edu/">DePauw University</A> in Greencastle, Ind., to $11.99 at Northwestern State.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE="SQUARE"> <I>Annual campus parking permit.</I>  An average of $27.50.  Free at <A HREF = "http://www.austinc.edu/index.html">Austin College</A> in Sherman, Tex., to $104 at the <A HREF = "http://www.missouri.edu/">University of Missouri</A> in Columbia, Mo.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE="SQUARE"> <I>Semester rental of a dorm-sized refrigerator.</I>  An average of $47.60.  $17.50 at  Wisconsin—Stout to $60 at the <A HREF = "http://www.du.edu/">University of Denver</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE="SQUARE"> <I>Fraternity or sorority dues.</I>  An average of $205 per semester.  $70 at St. Norbert to $600 at the University of Denver.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE="SQUARE"> <I>Backpack at the campus bookstore.</I>  An average of $34.  $22.95 at <A HREF = "http://www.fhda.edu/foothill/">Foothill College</A> in Los Altos Hills, Calif., to $43.95 at <A HREF = "http://www.sbu.edu/">St. Bonaventure University</A> in St. Bonaventure, N.Y.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE="SQUARE"> <I>Twenty-five loads of laundry (about how many most students need per semester).</I>  An average of $35.25 (or $1.41 per wash/dry cycle).  $25 at Guilford College to $56.25 at Salem Academy and College in Winston-Salem, N.C.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE="SQUARE"> <I>Ten large pepperoni pizzas at the campus hangout.</I>  An average of $84.49 (or $8.45 a pizza).  $46 at DePauw University to $125 at Foothill College.<BR>
<BR>
Taken together, these incidentals total $5,371.  Take out the one-time expenses of the computer and backpack, and you still arrive at a figure of $3,623 each semester — far from chump change.<BR>
<BR>
Other universities participating in the survey included the <A HREF = "http://www.wooster.edu/">College of Wooster</A> in Wooster, Ohio, <A HREF = "http://www.lafayette.edu/home.html">Lafayette College</A> in Easton, Pa., and <A HREF = "http://www.wheatonma.edu/">Wheaton College</A> in Norton, Mass.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Good economic news sent the financial markets reeling for the second session in a row on Friday,</B> as July factory orders and August manufacturing statistics continued to point toward a surging U.S. economy.  The Commerce Department reported that orders for manufactured goods rose nearly 2% in July, twice the rate anticipated by Wall Street.  The Chicago purchasing managers index also came in stronger than expected, rising to 60 from 51.2 in July.  Any reading higher than 50 indicates that the manufacturing sector is expanding.  Investors in the fixed-income arena worry that strong economic growth will lead to rising inflation, which eats away at the value of their bonds.  Stock investors, meanwhile, fret that inflationary signals will force the Federal Reserve Board to raise short-term interest rates in the fall, which slows consumer spending and puts pressure on company profits.<BR>

<H3> Iraqi conflict rattles Wall Street</H3>
Tuesday was anything but boring in the financial markets.  On news that the U.S. fired 27 cruise missiles into southern Iraq overnight, Wall Street stocks and bonds were rocked early before staging a dramatic turnaround at midday and finishing on the upside.  Oil prices, meanwhile, hit a post-Gulf-War high in the morning before dropping off and stabilizing in afternoon trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Both gold and the dollar, traditional havens during international turmoil, rose in heavy trading during the day.<BR>
<BR>
The markets pulled out of their slide after a key economic indicator, the National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly index, came in slightly below analysts' expectations for August.  The release of the index late Tuesday morning eased investors' fears of a short-term interest rate hike this month.  Bargain hunting by mutual fund managers and other institutional investors later in the day also helped to push the stock averages back up, analysts said.<BR>
<BR>
Oil company stocks benefited the most from the day's action, as investors rushed to cash in on rising prices.  Shares in Chevron rose $1 to $59.88; Exxon gained $2.25 to $83.63; Mobil climbed $2.63 to $115.38; and Texaco moved $3 higher to $91.75.<BR>
<BR>
At the other end of the spectrum, higher oil and jet-fuel prices pushed most of the major airline stocks down for the day.  Delta Airlines suffered the most, losing $2 to close at $68.88, but others lost as well.  Continental Airlines lost 25 cents to close at $22.38; UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, lost 50 cents to $47.50; and the USAir Group closed 50 cents lower at $17.38.<BR>

<LI><B>The July Index of Leading Indicators added to widespread sentiment that the economy is growing strongly.</B>  Released by the Conference Board on Tuesday, the leading indicators are designed to forecast economic trends six to nine months ahead of time.  The index rose 0.2% during the month, pulled higher by beefed-up commodity prices, fewer claims for unemployment benefits and more orders for consumer products and services.  The July improvement was the sixth consecutive gain for the index.  Economy watchers typically consider three months of movement in the same direction as indicative of a trend.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>General Motors will be the first U.S. carmaker to offer used-car warranty programs nationwide,</B> <I>Automotive News</I> reported on Monday.  According to the article, GM will offer no-haggle pricing, three-day/150-mile money-back guarantees and one-year/12,000-mile warranties on some used cars sold through its dealerships.  To qualify for the program, vehicles will have to be less than three years old and have less than 60,000 miles on them.  Scheduled to start this fall, the program will affect Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Geo, GMC, Oldsmobile, Pontiac and Saturn vehicles.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>One of the last remaining vestiges of the Olympic Games came down on Labor Day,</B> as Coca-Cola closed its $30 million theme plaza adjacent to Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta.  After opening on May 23, Coca-Cola Olympic City was visited by an estimated 800,000 people during the summer, despite being closed for three days following a pipe-bomb explosion nearby.  Coke spokesperson Stu Cross says organizers of the World Cup soccer tournament contacted him during the summer, asking if the company might be interested in constructing a similar theme park in France two years from now.  The company hasn't made any decisions on the matter, Cross says.<BR>

<H3> Working nine to five?  Not likely.</H3>
Fewer people are making a living these days by laboring during the traditional work week.  That according to a new study by University of Maryland sociologist Harriet Presser, who found that less than one-third of employed Americans over the age of 18 work a traditional 35- to 40-hour, Monday through Friday work week.  Even if you take out the condition of working 35 to 40 hours a week, Presser notes, only 55% of employees work primarily during the day on weekdays.  <BR>
<BR>
Presser attributes a shift toward evening and weekend work hours to the economy's movement from manufacturing jobs toward service-oriented work.  And she expects the trend to continue in the decade ahead.  "A revolution in work-schedule behavior is in the process throughout the industrial world," Presser says.  "The movement toward a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week economy is continuing, [so] diversity in work schedules will increase as well."<BR>
<BR>
The change is likely to have both positive and negative consequences for workers and their families, Presser writes in the study.  On the positive side, split shifts might allow parents to share child-care duties so they don't have to pay for day care.  Flexible hours might also allow some adult students to go back to college.  But the flipside of odd-hour work schedules might include "sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal disorders and chronic malaise," as well as "less availability for family interaction and leisure."<BR>
<BR>
If you're dead-set against working night and weekend shifts, you should probably avoid the restaurant business.  Presser found that the jobs most likely to require such hours were waiter, waitress and chef.<BR>

<LI><B>The key to employee loyalty differs by country,</B> according to a study released Wednesday by the polling firm Walker Information.  Walker surveyed 7,500 employees of large firms in 13 countries, seeking worker perceptions about their employers. Workers in Canada and the U.S. claim to be more loyal when companies focus on the employees' needs.  Asian employees, on the other hand, tend to be more committed when firms focus on product quality and customer service.  Canadian workers ranked highest in overall company loyalty, with a score of 4.19 out of 5, followed by Finnish (4.15), Spanish (4.14) and American (4.06) employees.  British and German workers scored the lowest, both registering a 3.53 out of 5.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Rising mortgage rates are finally taking their toll on new construction activity,</B> the Commerce Department announced Wednesday.  Construction spending fell 1.4% in July, the largest decline since February and the second drop in three months.  Total construction spending on public and private projects during the month totaled $554.7 billion, the lowest overall level in five months.  Long-term interest rates, which affect mortgages, were pushed higher during the summer by investor fears that the economy is growing too rapidly — which could force the Federal Reserve Board to raise short-term rates in an effort to control inflation.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Companies listed on the Big Board reported record after-tax profits and revenues during the second quarter and over the first half of the year,</B> the New York Stock Exchange announced Wednesday.  NYSE member firms reported a profit of $2.3 billion on revenues of $30.6 billion during the second quarter, breaking highs set during the second quarter a year ago.  Over the first six months of the year, NYSE companies reported a profit of $4.3 billion on revenues of $60.1 billion, also records.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Russian consumer prices fell in August for the first time since the country instituted economic reforms four years ago,</B> the State Statistics Committee announced Wednesday in Moscow.  Prices for consumer goods overall fell 0.2% during the month, fueled by a 1.7% drop in food prices.  President Boris Yeltsin has said controlling inflation is an economic priority, and the statistics committee predicted Wednesday that consumer prices will increase about 1% a month for the rest of 1996.  That pales in comparison to recent years, when monthly inflation rates hovered around 20%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Delta Air Lines plans to supply power sources aloft for laptop computers in a six-month trial run,</B> the company confirmed this week.  Delta has wired the first-class seats in one of its Boeing 767 planes with power sources at each seat in an effort to avoid the problem of passenger computer batteries going dead.  If the program proves popular over the next six months, Delta — and its competitors — are expected to add similar capabilities to a wide range of planes.  Batteries can typically power laptops for a maximum of five hours.<BR>

<H3>Companies eyeball high-tech identification systems</H3>
In spy flick <I>Mission: Impossible</I>, the third-largest box office hit of the summer, actor Tom Cruise outsmarts high-tech security gadgets designed to record everything from the sound of his voice to the makeup of his cornea — devices designed to thwart would-be electronic trespassers from gaining access to top-secret files.  In the real world, computers that control such systems are virtually foolproof and may soon be standard in banks and stores nationwide.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the same premise as fingerprinting, used by law enforcement for decades, so-called "biometric" security systems record unique physical characteristics of a person and compare the results to a computer database of information on that person.  Ideally, you get quick, reliable identification without being forced to remember a pin number.  Until recently, though, the technology either wasn't available or was too expensive for widespread use.<BR>
<BR>
Organizers of the Atlanta Olympic Games brought attention to biometrics this summer, measuring handprints to make sure unauthorized people were kept out of certain areas.  But others are testing its applications, also.  For example, hoping to combat the fraud that costs them a combined $1.3 billion each year, both Visa and Mastercard are testing finger-scanning cards that only allow authorized cardholders to use them.  And Chase Manhattan Bank recently began using voice-recognition software to identify customers who make transactions over the telephone.  Home Depot stores are testing a related technology, signature verification systems, which is designed to keep crooks from passing off fake checks.<BR>
<BR>
But bank ATMs may be the first place most people notice biometric technology.  Sensar Inc., a research and development firm in Princeton, N.J., teamed up with ATM company Oki Electric this year to put iris-scanning bank machines in Japan.  Six times more accurate than fingerprinting, the "IrisIdent" process works from three or four feet away as customers insert their cards into an ATM.  Sensar plans to unveil its American prototype of the system in December, followed by field testing at ATMs around the country in April.<BR>
<BR>
"As I understand it, the technology is here," says John Hall of the American Bankers Association.  "The challenge now is getting our customers used to the idea of having their eyes scanned or their fingers mapped."<BR>

<LI><B>Stocks fell in light trading Thursday as positive economic news incited inflation concern,</B> but many investors stayed on the sidelines ahead of Friday's August jobs report.  Thursday's economic news came in the form of the Labor Department's weekly report on unemployment benefits.  In that report, Labor said new claims for jobless benefits fell by 15,000 during the week ended August 31, to 316,000.  Investors are concerned that a strong employment picture, coupled with rising wages, could prompt the Federal Reserve Board to raise interest rates when it meets later this month.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Back-to-school retail sales were good, if not spectacular,</B> according to the Salomon Brothers retail index, released Thursday.  The index rose 3.6% in August after a 2.3% gain a month earlier.  It went up 1.5% in August a year ago, which was generally considered a poor back-to-school season.  Analysts said the sales figures were good, although the benefits weren't spread evenly among stores.  The Commerce Department releases its retail-sales numbers on September 13.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Ameritech and IBM announced plans Thursday to provide high-speed Internet access in Chicago during a trial run,</B> using existing copper lines instead of phone lines.  Designed to deliver information 50 times faster than conventional phone-line modems, the ASDL — asymmetric digital subscriber line — modems will be available for a six-month test starting in October.  Customers using the service will be able to connect to the Internet and talk on the phone at the same time through one line, the companies said.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Mortgage rates were at their highest point since mid-summer this week,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said Thursday.  Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.34% for the week, up from 8.09% a week earlier.  Fifteen-year fixed-rate mortgages also went up, from 7.60% to 7.88%.  The initial rate on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages moved 0.1% higher during the week, also, to 5.85%.<BR>

<H3>What a jump in interest rates might mean for you</H3>
The number of unemployed Americans in August fell to 5.1%, the Labor Department announced Friday — its lowest jobless figure since March of 1989.  Many on Wall Street are convinced that such a tight labor market is the final nail in the coffin that will force the Federal Reserve Board to raise short-term interest rates to keep the economy from overheating (it next meets September 24).  Even if that's true, though, what does that mean for you?  If the Fed bumps up the discount rate from 5% to 5.25% in a couple of weeks, how will that affect <I>your</I> pocketbook?<BR>
<BR>
The quick answer, of course, is that it depends on how much debt you have.  If you're not borrowing money, then the rate people charge to lend money won't matter.  The rub is that consumer debt levels are near all-time highs, so it will matter to a lot of Americans.  If you owe a substantial amount of money to a credit card company or have an adjustable-rate mortgage, for example, any increase in short-term interest rates is likely to mean money out of your pocket.  The more debt you have, the more pain you'll feel from a rate jump.<BR>
<BR>
While it's probably a safe bet that banks will raise all short-term interest rates to match any Fed increase, longer-term rates are more difficult to gauge, says University of Kentucky economist Don Mullineaux.  He says that it's even possible that long-term borrowing rates, typical of many bonds and 30-year mortgages, will go down on news of a Fed uptick.  If the threat of inflation eating away at the value of fixed-income investments is diminished by the Fed's action, long-term rates might react positively.  <BR>
<BR>
"It's all a guessing game at this point," Mullineaux says.  "Nobody knows for sure what will happen if the Fed raises interest rates, but you'll read and hear plenty about it in the weeks ahead anyway."<BR>

<LI><B>The number of homeowners who fell behind in their mortgage payments went down in the second quarter,</B> the Mortgage Bankers Association announced this week.  According to the MBA's quarterly National Delinquency Survey, 4.35% of homeowners fell behind in their payments between April and June, down from 4.46% during the first three months of the year.  Delinquency rates were unchanged from the first quarter in the Northeast, but the rest of the country showed improvement — led by a 0.18% drop in the West.  "What we're seeing now is a modest improvement in the level of delinquencies spurred by a growing economy and interest rates that are still low by historical standards," says the MBA's Warren Lasko.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The U.S. economy will continue its rapid growth well into 1997, pushing inflation higher,</B> economist Gail Fosler told a group of foreign exchange dealers in Germany on Friday.  Chief economist at the Conference Board in New York City, Fosler said the country's rapid growth probably won't slow until inflation starts to weigh it down next summer.  The Federal Reserve Board will be forced to tighten interest rates at least 0.50% in response, she predicted.<BR>

<LI><B>America Online can't keep firms from sending junk email to its members,</B> a federal judge in Philadelphia ruled Friday.  U.S. District Judge Charles Weiner ordered AOL to remove a block it had placed on five companies that send out unsolicited commercial mass mailings, known as "spam" in cyber-speak, at least until a trial can be held on the matter.  AOL lawyer David Phillips said the company is considering an appeal.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A new Web site devoted to no-load mutual funds made its debut this week,</B> sponsored by the Mutual Fund Education Alliance.  <A HREF = "http://www.mfea.com">The Mutual Fund Investor's Center</A> provides links to 25 fund-company home pages and information on 15 other firms, including individual profiles on nearly 1,000 funds.  MFEA says that daily net asset values will be available for all funds by the end of September.  The site also includes an investor education center that covers such topics as "How to read a prospectus."  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Employers have until Saturday, September 7, to restore delinquent contributions to their 401(k) plans or risk fines and other sanctions</B> by the Labor Department.  Offending employers also owe interest on back payments, so affected workers could get an unexpected boost in their pension-plan assets.<BR>

<H3> Hurricane Fran puts the spotlight on homeowners insurance </H3>
Insurers breathed a sigh of relief on Monday when it became clear that Hurricane Fran hadn't packed the devastating punch many had feared.  Preliminary estimates from the Insurance Information Institute put insured losses from the storm at $625 million, not chump change yet far from the $16 billion Hurricane Andrew cost the industry four years ago.  <BR>
<BR>
But the insurance companies' gain could be the consumers' loss in this case.  Because the worst of the damage in North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia came from the flooding in Fran's wake — not typically covered by homeowners insurance — a large percentage of the rebuilding costs will be borne by consumers.  Some will be covered by the federal government's national flood insurance program, but only about 20% of eligible homeowners in flood-prone areas participate (for information on the program, call 800-427-4661).<BR>
<BR>
And if fixing flood damage to their homes out-of-pocket wasn't bad enough, homeowners may feel the real pain when they try to upgrade their current insurance policies or get new ones.  Dazed by five catastrophes in the 1990s in which the industry had to pay more than $1 billion in claims, insurers are making coverage more expensive and harder to get in "at risk" locales.  In areas such as California, Florida, Louisiana and Texas, homeowners insurance can cost as much as $10,000 per year these days.<BR>
<BR>
With rates rising to that level, the payoff for shopping among insurers is greater than ever.  To get an apples-to-apples comparison, put your request for a price quote in writing.  Give insurance agents a copy of your current coverage statement and ask for their price for a comparable policy.  Then consider these tips:<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"><I>Increase your deductible.</I>  If you bump it up to $500 from $250, you can save 10% or more each year.  For a $500 premium, that's $50 a year in savings.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"><I>Ask about discounts.</I>  It's common to get 3% to 5% off for installing deadbolt locks and fire extinguishers or even for being a nonsmoker.  Discounts go up to about 12% for homes with alarm systems.  You can also get a discount of 5% to 10% at many companies if you have your car insured by the same company.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"><I>Double-check the facts on your policy statement.</I>  If it says your house has wood-frame construction when it's really block, you're paying too much.  Premiums for a wood-frame house could be 10% to 15% more than for a similar block house.  The difference could be even greater in a rural area with limited fire-fighting service.  Mistakes on square footage and distance to a fire hydrant could also cost you.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>The economy will keep growing, inflation will remain in check and the chances of a recession are slim though 1997,</B> economists at 41 of the nation's largest companies predicted Monday.  In its latest quarterly outlook, the <A HREF = "http://www.nabe.com/">National Association of Business Economists</A> revised upward its expectations for growth both this year and next, forecasting 2.3% growth in the gross domestic product each year.  The GDP, a measure of the country's total output of goods and services, increased 2% in 1995.  Only one of the economists said that the threat of a recession is a "serious current problem," and the group predicted consumer prices would increase 3% this year and next.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>White-collar workers are too busy to get away from the office for conventions and other business-related trips,</B> the president of the Travel Industry Association of America said this week.  The association's quarterly travel forecast found 24% of adults "somewhat or very likely to travel for business" this fall, down from 26% a year ago and a high of 29% in 1992.  "Business travel appears to be plateauing," TIA president William Norman said of the survey.  "This is the result of a cautious corporate climate characterized by leaner staffs and executives who have saturated schedules."  In comparison, 60% of adults said they are likely to take a pleasure trip this fall, the same percentage as in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Mutual fund company chief executives will earn more than $1 million, on average, in 1996,</B> according to a survey released over the weekend by Buck Consultants Inc.  The survey found that CEOs at the 50 largest fund companies will earn an estimated $1.02 million this year, up 6% from 1995's average of $964,200.  In 1995, the highest-paid manager in Buck's survey was Lawrence Lasser of Putnam Investments, who earned about $5.8 million.  Among publicly traded companies, George Collins of T. Rowe Price earned the highest salary that year, at $1.7 million.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Federal Reserve Board is watching inflation closely because of the economy's "considerable momentum,"</B> one of the policy-making board's newest members said Sunday.  Speaking at the National Association of Business Economists' annual convention in Boston in his first public speech in two months as a Fed governor, Laurence Meyer said that "a prudent central bank must exercise heightened surveillance of the inflationary risks and stand ready to respond if necessary."  The Fed next meets on September 24 in Washington, DC.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Airlines raised fares 2.5% last week, the second en masse price increase in a month.</B>  Continental Airlines initiated the increase and the other large carriers immediately followed suit.  Airlines also bumped prices up 10% in recent weeks to compensate for the reinstated airline ticket tax.  <BR>

<H3>New millennium could pose a threat to your business</H3>
Maryland Congresswoman Connie Morella has an idea of what December 31, 1999, could be like: champagne flows, toasts are raised — and computers crash all over the world.  <BR>
<BR>
Morella told a Congressional committee Tuesday that the "year 2000 problem" could create serious backlogs for federal agencies just over three years from now.  But the government isn't the only one potentially vulnerable to a massive computer lockup, others say.  While you probably don't need to worry about your home computer, it makes sense to take stock now of how your business could be affected.<BR>
<BR>
The seeds for the problem were planted decades ago, when programmers decided to save memory space in large, mainframe computers by abbreviating years using two digits (i.e. 1996 would be shortened to "96").  The result?  At the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve 1999, computer systems that recognize "00" as 1900 instead of 2000 will go haywire.  Firms that service your bank and mutual fund accounts, insurance policies and credit card billing might be affected, as could many small businesses.<BR>
<BR>
The first thing small-business owners should do is decide which computer systems are essential, and figure out if they will be affected by this problem, says William Ulrich, author of <I>The Year 2000: The Challenge of the Century</I>.  "You need to find out which systems have the greatest impact on your business," Ulrich says.  Once that's done, you have to decide whether to replace the suspect systems altogether or start researching other remedies.<BR>
<BR>
A host of technology companies offer "millennium date" software designed to prepare computers for the changeover to the new century.  More information is available about the problem and possible solutions at a wide variety of sources online, including:  <A HREF = "http://www.year2000.com/cgi-bin/y2k/year2000.cgi">Year 2000</A>, <A HREF = "http://www.club.innet.be/~janjedsp/y2k.htm">The Year 2000 Computer Crisis</A>, the <A HREF = "http://www.itaa.org/yr2000-1.htm">Information Technology Association of America's site</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.psd.k12.co.us/Newsletter/Current_Issue/stories/pc-test.html">Testing for the Y2K Problem</A>.<BR>

<LI><B>The Federal Reserve Board has to be alert to the risk inflation could pose to the economy,</B> Fed governor Janet Yellen told Reuters on Tuesday.  "We're in an inflationary danger zone [and] there's definitely a chance inflation will rise," Yellen said.  At the same time, she cautioned that, "the evidence isn't utterly definitive that we're going to see inflation rise."  Analysts said Yellen's comments suggest that she might be willing to support a one-quarter point rise in short-term interest rates in an effort to ward off higher inflation.  Such an increase would be the central bank's first in 18 months.  The Fed meets again on September 24.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The trade deficit jumped 11.2% higher in the second quarter,</B> the Commerce Department said on Tuesday.  In the April through June quarter, the U.S. imported $38.8 billion more than it exported.  That works out to an annual rate of $147.3 billion, a small change from last year's total deficit of $148.2 billion.  Also Tuesday, the Labor Department reported that workplace productivity increased 0.5% during the second quarter.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Consumer credit card debt shot up at a 19.4% annual rate in July,</B> the Federal Reserve said this week.  During the month, consumers tapped credit to buy $7.7 billion worth of goods and services, up $1 billion from June figures.  According to some analysts, strong job growth in recent months has made consumers willing to spend money more freely, which could lead to higher inflation if the Fed doesn't take action.<BR>

<H3>Rocket attack scores a direct hit on world oil markets</H3>
Oil prices today reached their highest levels since the Gulf War, reacting to news that Iraqi troops fired a surface-to-air missile at U.S. planes overnight.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light sweet crude prices soared 63 cents to nearly $25 a barrel.  And in London, North Sea Brent crude jumped 72 cents to trade at $23.60 a barrel, the highest price in more than five years.<BR>
<BR>
Iraqi oil exports have been forbidden by the United Nations since the country invaded neighboring Kuwait in August of 1990.  Prior to this week's tension in the region, though, the world body had decided to lift the embargo and permit Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil to raise money for food and medical supplies.  That plan has now been scuttled because of the renewed Iraqi aggression.<BR>
<BR>
In recent months, some refineries let their supplies run low, hoping to replenish their stocks when the infusion of Iraqi oil forced prices down in the fall.  Now that it's clear that won't happen, refineries are rushing back into the market to buy at higher prices to satisfy orders they already have, says consultant Vahan Zanoyan of the Petroleum Finance Company in Washington, DC.  "What you end up with is a big, one-time demand, which forces prices up for a while," Zanoyan says.<BR>
<BR>
Another factor is the approaching winter months in the Northern Hemisphere.  Demand for heating oil is always highest during the cold months, which further squeezes the oil markets.<BR>
<BR>
Despite it all, says Zanoyan, sky-high prices for oil and gasoline aren't likely to be long-term problems.  He expects higher prices to last a few weeks before settling back into the trading range seen before the latest flare-up in the Middle East.  "We're seeing a high level of anxiety about the situation right now," he says.  "But without a true disruption in supply somewhere, it has to be temporary."<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<LI><B>The economy is "expanding moderately" at this point,</B> the Federal Reserve Board said Wednesday.  The statement is part of the latest "beige book," a survey of the Fed's 12 regional banks, which the board will consider when it debates whether to raise interest rates on September 24.  "Business activity in most districts is reported to be generally good," the survey's authors concluded.  According to the study, the regions around San Francisco and St. Louis bucked the national trend, continuing to grow rapidly in recent weeks.  Fed chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress over the summer that interest rates would have to be increased unless there was "persuasive evidence" of an economic slowdown soon.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Investors started moving strongly back into mutual funds in August,</B> according to estimates released by the Investment Company Institute on Wednesday.  ICI said the fund industry held $19.5 billion more in assets at the end of August than it did at the beginning of the month.  In contrast, the net gain during July was $4.8 billion.  Despite the historically high level, the August figures are far below the $24.7 billion average of the first five months of the year, says ICI chief economist John Rea.  Stock funds accounted for most of the gain, posting a $19 billion increase.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Credit card users should drop any issuer that penalizes them for on-time payments,</B> the president of the Bankcard Holders of America says.  Ruth Susswein's comments this week are in response to plans by GE Capital Corp. to levy a $25 annual fee on users who pay their balance in full each month, thereby avoiding finance charges.  If a significant number of users don't quit in response to the new fee, Susswein warns, GE's competitors are sure to add similar charges.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The pre-announcement season rolled on in earnest on Wednesday,</B> as Motorola issued a statement saying its third-quarter earnings are likely to fall "significantly below" analysts' expectations.  The Shaumberg, Ill.-based company said the computer chip industry will drag down its earnings in the quarter (the Semiconductor Industry Association reported Tuesday that August orders were down 38% from a year ago).  Officially, companies will release third-quarter earnings reports during the first two weeks of October, but many firms prefer to forewarn analysts and investors about bad news in the weeks before.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>No-load fund family Scudder, Stevens & Clark announced the formation of two new growth funds on Wednesday:</B> Scudder 21st Century Growth and Scudder Classic Growth.  The former will focus on small growth stocks and the latter will focus on medium- to large-cap companies already established in their fields, according to a company statement.  Peter Chin will manage 21st Century Growth and William Gadsden, current manager of the AARP Capital Growth fund, will oversee Classic Growth.  Also Wednesday, State Street Research announced a new bond fund, Strategic Income, which will be managed by Jack Kallis.  Kallis already runs State Street's Government Income and Intermediate Bond funds.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Milk prices may be on their way up at the supermarket,</B> the Agriculture Department announced on Wednesday.  Higher feed prices and short supplies of hay have forced dairy farmers to cut back on milk production in recent months.  USDA chief economist Keith Collins said the reduction in supply is likely to lead to "record-high milk prices."<BR>

<H3>Business insurer undercut by Congress</H3>
For 25 years, American companies with operations abroad have turned to a little-known federal agency to protect them from the possibility that revolutionary armies or malevolent dictators might seize their property.  And for 25 years, the Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC) has relished its obscurity, quietly selling insurance policies to companies like Citicorp, Ford and Union Carbide — usually turning a profit for the government in the process.  <BR>
<BR>
That all changed this week, as a coalition of anti-big-government Republicans and anti-foreign-investment Democrats teamed up to spotlight OPIC's "corporate welfare" policies.  OPIC's charter expires September 30 and it couldn't have come at a worse time for the agency, with politicians staking out populist positions before the November elections.  Following several days of political wrangling this week, the House of Representatives rejected a bill to renew the charter by a vote of 260 to 157.  If OPIC's authority isn't renewed before the end of the month, it won't be allowed to sell new policies or underwrite new foreign investments.<BR>
<BR>
But don't shed tears for American multi-national companies, says economist William Stoever.  Whether Congress eventually decides to kill OPIC or not, companies will find ways to safely invest in foreign markets, he predicts.  An officer with the U.S. Agency for International Development and an economics professor at Seton Hall University, Stoever doesn't think OPIC's loss of funding would have a lingering impact on the investment decisions of most firms.<BR>
<BR>
"Companies will try to self-insure or private insurers will fill the void [left by OPIC]," Stoever says.  "There are always other options."<BR>
<BR>
But the battle for OPIC's future isn't over yet.  Even the agency's most vocal critics were shocked by the suddenness of the action this week.  Republican Congressman John Kasich of Ohio, the point man for the troops campaigning against the agency, said the vote was "totally unexpected."  And blindsided agency chief executive Ruth Harkin said she will spend the weeks ahead negotiating for her agency's future, "working with Congress on a measure that will preserve OPIC's ability to create American jobs and U.S. exports."<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<LI><B>The Dow Jones industrial average shrugged off its summer laziness and spent most of Thursday in record territory,</B> the first time it has flirted with such heady levels since May 23.  The Dow quickly covered the 24 points it needed to eclipse the index's record close during the morning session and resumed its climb, albeit more slowly, during the afternoon.  In its final 30 minutes of trading, though, the Dow gave up much of its gain to finish six points shy of the mark.  Analysts attributed the quick start to government reports released Thursday morning (see below) that eased investor worries about the Federal Reserve Board's need to bump up interest rates later this month.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A pair of government reports Thursday gave mixed signals about the economy.</B>  In the first report, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said wholesale prices in August rose 0.3%, their biggest jump in five months.  Food pulled the overall index higher, increasing 1% during the month.  Among food products, meat showed the strongest signs of inflation, with pork products up 8.7% and beef up 4.9%.  In the second report, the Labor Department said first-time claims for jobless benefits reached their highest weekly level in two months, up by 21,000 this week.  In contrast to the wholesale price report, a relaxing labor market would reduce inflationary pressure on the economy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Nasdaq might be the most costly exchange for institutional traders to buy and sell through,</B> according to two studies released this week.  One study, in the <I>Journal of Financial Economics</I>, found that it costs an institution about $140 more to place a $100,000 trade on Nasdaq than it does on the New York Stock Exchange.  A Nasdaq rival, the American Stock Exchange, funded the second study.  In it, the Plexus Group found that all the costs associated with trading on Nasdaq total around 1% of a trade's value, substantially higher than the 0.55% on the NYSE and 0.6% on AMEX.  Nasdaq has also been under intense scrutiny in recent years for overcharging individual investors.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Isuzu Motors defended the safety of its utility vehicles</B> at a press conference Thursday in Washington, DC.  On August 20, <I>Consumer Reports</I> magazine said the 1995 and 1996 Isuzu Trooper and Acura SLX (also manufactured by Isuzu) are unstable in sharp turns.  The magazine urged Isuzu and Acura to stop selling the vehicles until the problem is fixed.  Rather than recall the vehicles, though, Isuzu commissioned an independent engineering study that found the Trooper and SLX to be safe.  The Trooper "exhibits a generous margin of safety for its driver and occupant," Isuzu spokesman Norihiho Oda says.  Sales of the Trooper and SLX have plummeted in the three weeks since the magazine released its rating.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Mortgage rates edged lower this week,</B> the Federal Home Loan Corporation said Thursday.  Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.28% nationwide during the week, down from 8.34% last week.  Fifteen-year mortgages averaged 7.81%, down from 7.88% the week before.  And the initial rate on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 5.90% during the week, up 0.05%.<BR>

<H3>Employee training programs on the rise</H3>
Not too many years ago, people generally accepted the trade-off between loyalty from employees and job security from employers.  Those days are gone.  In the '80s and '90s, firms and their workers have developed a free-agent mentality, with an understanding that employment relationships aren't necessarily long-term.  "I not only don't expect lifetime employment at one place, I don't want it," says 24-year-old advertising representative Geoff Horning of Milwaukie, Oregon.  "But I will work hard as long as I feel the people at the top are looking out for my interests."<BR>
<BR>
Such sentiment isn't lost on company executives, says human resources specialist Brian Hackett of The Conference Board in New York City.  "The 'new deal' [between employers and employees] is about getting and keeping the best people," he says.  In a Conference Board study released Thursday, 83% of chief executives nationwide said "developing leadership skills . . . through management development programs" is one of the best ways to keep good employees from jumping ship.<BR>
<BR>
Responding to the call from CEOs, short, intensive training programs are popping up all over the country of late.  This week, the Public Broadcasting System announced plans to use Internet, video-on-demand, fiber-optic and satellite technologies to offer executive training programs via desktop computers.  And phone-company Nynex recently forged a partnership with 23 universities in its calling area to create a customized associate's degree in telecommunications for its entry-level workforce.<BR>
<BR>
High-brow business schools have also yielded to the demand for non-degree training programs.  Top-ranked business schools at Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, UCLA and the University of Virginia have jumped on the bandwagon, some going so far as to build their own hotels and conference centers to attract companies to their executive education programs.<BR>
<BR>
Expect the trend to continue in the years ahead, says Charles Hickman of the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business.  "Training programs help both business schools and the firms they serve," Hickman says.  "Companies attract and retain higher-skilled workers through the programs, and business schools have a whole new market to sell their services to."<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<LI><B>Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed in record territory Friday,</B> rallying on news that the economy is not exhibiting signs of strong inflation (see below).  Analysts said investors are starting to feel confident that the Federal Reserve Board won't have to raise short-term interest rates at its September 24 meeting.  If the Fed believes inflation is about to pull the economy into a recession, it will raise interest rates to curtail consumer spending.  The Dow's previous record was 5,788.00, on May 22, and the S&P 500's was 678.51, set on May 24.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Consumer prices and retail sales in August edged up modestly,</B> according to separate government reports released Friday.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.1% last month, following an uptick of 0.3% in July.  According to the report, food prices rose, while clothing and energy prices went down.  In the day's other major report, the Commerce Department said total retail sales rose 0.2% in August to $205 billion, well below analysts' expectations.  Taken together, the reports signaled little inflationary pressures on the economy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>One-page plain-English car leases may be on the way,</B> if federal regulators have their way.  Consumer groups have complained for years that car dealers use the confusing and ambiguous government leasing guidelines to keep customers in the dark about how much money a vehicle will cost them.  According to published reports, the Federal Reserve Board has written new guidelines intended to shed some light on the leasing process.  The new rules are scheduled to be voted on next Wednesday.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Both Clinton and Dole oppose a California measure that would make it easier for shareholders to sue companies,</B> according to an advertising campaign kicked off in the Golden State on Friday.  Citizen-initiated Proposition 211 would make it easier for shareholders to sue corporations, their directors and business partners for fraud in state court.  A coalition of business interests opposes the measure, including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, both of which donated $250,000 for the anti-initiative ads.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Mutual fund investors poured more than $3.8 billion into stock funds this week,</B> according to research group AMG Data Services.  The numbers were up from $825 million a week ago and the highest they've been in a month, according to AMG.

<LI><B>Nearly one in seven business executives stretch the truth on their resumes,</B> according to a survey released this week by Werra & Associates.

<H3>AOL jumps ship, joins the Big Board</H3>
The online world's largest marketing machine was running at full capacity on Monday. Steve Case kicked the day off mugging for the cameras and ringing the opening bell of the New York Stock Exchange at 9:30.  Within half an hour, the chief executive of America Online was sitting down for the first in a day-long series of interviews, as police cordoned off the corner of Wall Street and Broad Street in Manhattan for a block party in honor of AOL.  A series of network television commercials is also scheduled to start this week on the heels of the day's events.<BR>
<BR>
The occasion?  The world's largest online service jumped ship from Nasdaq to the NYSE, taking its six million paying customers and its marketing juggernaut with it.  AOL has been one of Nasdaq's highest-profile companies since it went public four years ago, but shareholders have grown increasingly disgruntled in recent months as the stock's price slid from a high of $70 to Friday's close of $27.  <BR>
<BR>
But the stock's decline has a lot more to do with the company's fortune than Nasdaq's, so what do shareholders have to gain from the change?<BR>
<BR>
AOL probably had a couple of reasons for moving from Nasdaq to the NYSE, says Hilliard Terry, the director of investor relations at Verifone, Inc. in Redwood City, Calif.  Verifone made the same jump in August of 1995, and Terry says the change has been a good one for the firm's "mom and pop investors."  Since the NYSE prices its stocks in  narrower increments than does Nasdaq, he says, the share prices often make smaller moves up and down than they would on Nasdaq.  "For small investors, less volatility can be important for peace of mind," Terry says.  <BR>
<BR>
The NYSE can also be more advantageous for the company as a whole, Terry says, because the liquidity of "The Big Board" is greater than Nasdaq's.  Another consideration is that some institutional investors in foreign countries are required to invest in NYSE stocks when they want American shares, he says.<BR>
<BR>
During an online chat with NYSE chairman Dick Grasso on Sunday night, though, Steve Case himself hinted at the real reason for the change — and potentially the biggest advantage for shareholders.  Answering reader questions in an AOL chat room, Case and Grasso repeatedly spoke of the increased prestige and visibility the company will receive by making the switch.  Translation: It places the media spotlight firmly on AOL, at least for the time being, which is exactly where the company's marketing staff likes it.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>A pair of NBC shows open the new television season as the first to charge $1 million per minute of advertising,</B> according to an article in Monday's edition of <I>Advertising Age</I>.  NBC has dominated Thursday evenings on network television for several years, boasting three of the four top-watched shows on the same night.  Cashing in on its success, the network is charging advertisers $550,000 per 30-second advertising spot during <I>ER</I> and $500,000 per ad during <I>Seinfeld</I>, starting with this week's new episodes.  The third Thursday-night staple, <I>Friends</I>, charges $450,000 for the same amount of time.  The only other network show charging more than $400,000 for 30 seconds is ABC's <I>Home Improvement</I>, which offers spots on Tuesday nights for $455,000.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Merger-related layoffs dropped 84% during the summer,</B> despite an increase in the total number of consolidations, according to a survey released Monday by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.  The total number of jobs lost because of mergers fell to 6,083 from nearly 38,000 during the same period a year ago.  More than 5,300 U.S. companies with a market value of $280 billion have tied the knot this year, according to the study, compared with about 4,300 with a market value of $190 billion to this point in 1995.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Business inventories reached an all-time high of $1 trillion during July,</B> the Commerce Department reported Monday.  That represents a 0.4% increase from June — double Wall Street's expectations.  Inventories have only fallen twice this year, in March and in May, as companies have continually filled their shelves in anticipation of strong consumer buying.<BR>

<H3>Safety board recommends change in air bag standards</H3>
What's good for most people most of the time isn't necessarily good for small kids and some older adults, the National Transportation Safety Board decided Tuesday.  It turns out that passenger-side air bags, designed to keep car and truck passengers from slamming into the dash board or windshield during an accident, inflate with enough force to kill or seriously injure the more frail among us, including young children.<BR>
<BR>
"This has got to stop," NTSB chairman Jim Hall said after reviewing a two-year study of the issue.<BR>
<BR>
The current air bag standards, established by the National Highway Transportation Board with NTSB input, call for passenger-side bags to come out of their casings at close to 200 miles per hour.  That standard was established to protect front-seat passengers who don't wear seat belts, since a relatively large amount of counter-force is needed to stop an unbelted body during an accident.  But the NTSB decided to rethink its standards after determining that bags were to blame for the deaths of more than two dozen infants strapped into child-safety seats in recent years.<BR>
<BR>
But passenger-side airbags have proven themselves effective in protecting most adults wearing belts.  So rather than scrap the system entirely, the NTSB recommended Tuesday that NHTSA consider reducing the suggested speed at which air bags deploy, as well as pushing manufacturers to come up with "smart bags" that adjust for occupants' size and proximity to the dash board.  NHTSA also urged car makers to put air bag warning labels on all vehicles on the road that are equipped with passenger-side bags.  Most new cars already come with such labels, but many older models don't.<BR>
<BR>
Andrew Card, president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, agrees with the new NTSB standards, but says drivers also need to exercise a little common sense.  Card recommends that parents always place small children, especially those in car seats, in the back of the vehicle — outside the reach of passenger-side air bags altogether.<BR>

<LI><B>Credit card users are behind on their payments in record numbers,</B> the American Bankers Association said Tuesday.  During April, May and June, 3.66% of card users fell 30 days or more past due on their payments, according to the ABA's quarterly delinquency survey.  That's up from 3.53% during the first three months of the year and the highest in the 22 years the ABA has kept such statistics.  Just last week, the Federal Reserve Board reported that the use of credit cards increased 19.4% in July.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Industrial production at the country's factories, mines and utility companies increased 0.5% in August,</B> the Federal Reserve Board said Tuesday.  Factory output increased 0.3% during the month, identical to the July change, but the overall average was pulled higher by a surge from the electric companies and mines.  Factory output averaged 83.5% of capacity in August, up from 83.3% in July but still below the 83.9% figure of a year ago.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Despite advertising claims, high-octane gasoline may not make your engine run cleaner or reduce maintenance costs,</B> the Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday in bringing a complaint against Exxon Corp.  The FTC said Exxon misleads consumers by making such claims of its Exxon 93 Supreme gas, which costs as much as 20 cents per gallon more than regular unleaded.  If the government wins the court case, Exxon could be forced to back up future claims with scientific evidence.  Previously, the FTC settled similar cases against Amoco Corp., Sun Co. and Unocal Corp., a spokesperson said.  Exxon had no immediate comment.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Smart cards can pay off for small businesses even if only 2% of customers use them,</B> according to a survey released by an industry coalition this week.  The Smart Card Forum released the study during its convention Monday and Tuesday in San Francisco.  The group's survey of 65 merchants found that between 2% and 10% of customers need to use the plastic cards embedded with a computer chip before the business makes up for its investment in card-reading technology.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Lucent Technologies plans to provide businesses and consumers with high-quality online voice and video transmissions,</B> the former AT&T subsidiary announced Tuesday.  Lucent established a new software group, elemedia, which it said will offer real-time videoconferencing products by the end of the year.  Other products will include telephone-quality online phone systems and CD-quality music-on-demand software.<BR>

<H3>U.S. trade deficit hits an eight-year high</H3>
Just about any consumer item you buy these days was made somewhere outside the U.S.  Your kids' toys? Probably made in China or Taiwan.  Nike tennis shoes?  Korea.  Bugle Boy jeans?  Nicaragua.  Ralph Lauren sweatshirts?  Pakistan. And the list goes on.  Put simply, we have become a nation of consumers importing a lot more products than we export.<BR>
<BR>
It should come as no surprise, then, that the country's trade deficit grew to $11.7 billion in July, the largest gap since the Reagan Administration.  The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the July shortfall was 43% higher than June's deficit, putting the country on pace to run up a total imbalance of $109.6 billion this year.  In 1995, the year-end total was $105.1 billion, and that was the highest it had been since 1988.<BR>
<BR>
Economists pin much of the blame for the jump on large decreases in the export of airplanes and computers during the month, both of which are highly cyclical.  "You have to be careful not to read too much into a one-month blip in the numbers," says Mike Lehmann, an economics professor at the University of San Francisco.  "A month from now, the deficit could swing $3 billion back in the other direction."<BR>
<BR>
But the larger trend still points to long-term deficits by the U.S., and that's where analysts start to split into warring factions.  <BR>
<BR>
One camp argues that running the country in the red for a while isn't necessarily a bad thing.  International trade attorney Sherman Katz says that because the U.S. economy has been stronger than European and Asian economies in recent years, Americans are simply buying more goods and services than their foreign counterparts.  "The situation will more than likely take care of itself when those other economies come out of their doldrums and start consuming as much as we have been," he says.  "In and of itself, a deficit just means that our economic engine is running hotter than other countries' engines right now, so we're importing a little grease to keep it going."<BR>
<BR>
Others worry, though, that the U.S. is exporting high-paying manufacturing jobs overseas and replacing them with lower-paying service jobs, which could explain the low level of unemployment coupled with record imports.  "I think our trading partners rub their hands in glee every time we talk about our service economy," says Bill Lynott, president of the Buy America Foundation in Abington, Penn.  "Over time, they're importing all of our manufacturing jobs and laughing all the way to the bank."<BR>
<BR>
One point of consensus among the economists we spoke with: You'll be hearing much more about this between now and Election Day in November.  "If it wasn't 60 days from the presidential balloting, I don't think this would be causing the waves it is," says economist Wayne Leighton at the trade advocacy group Citizens for a Sound Economy.  "But since it is, you can be sure trade will be too tempting of a target for some politicians to avoid."<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Congress this week agreed to make government computer records available to the public,</B> with both houses passing an amendment that subjects online information to Freedom of Information Act requirements.  If a person requests information in computer format, according to the amendment, the federal agency in question has to comply if it can.  For three decades, the Freedom of Information Act has opened up a wide range of government paper documents to the public, but this would be the first time government computer files would fall under the act's provisions.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Sydney, Australia, is the city more Americans want to visit than any other,</B> according to the October issue of <I>Travel & Leisure</I> magazine.  The magazine polled 6,000 readers about their travel tastes, finding Sydney to be their favorite city and Australia as the place most wanted to visit next.  Survey respondents also said that The Oriental in Bangkok, Thailand is their favorite hotel, Singapore Air is the best airline and Paris is the city with the best food.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>Can you make money following the insiders?</H3>
The Securities and Exchange Commission's insider-trading lawsuit involving Duracell and Gillette this week brought back memories of Michael Milken, Reaganomics and the "Me Generation" on Wall Street.  As happened with many mergers in the early- to mid-1980s, insiders used offshore brokerage accounts to load up on one firm's options (Duracell) before its merger with another company (Gillette) was announced.<BR>
<BR>
Despite the cloak-and-dagger image such cases invoke, most insider trading is a fairly boring affair — and completely legal, provided the insiders report their transactions to the SEC.  The people who run companies cash in their options and buy stock if they feel the share price is too low, or they sell if it looks a little high.  "Executives who buy and sell company stock are value players, not market timers," says Jim Cemprola of CDA Investment Technologies, publisher of <I><A HREF = "http://www.cda.com/investnet/">The Insiders' Chronicle</A></I> newsletter.  "But we watch them because they tend to know the fundamentals of their companies and industries better than the rest of us."<BR>
<BR>
That said, analysts we talked to Thursday have seen insiders in several industries loading up in recent months.  "And when you see officers and directors buying, they're often three to four months ahead of the curve," says Ron Barrett of <I>Pharmaceutical Stock Watch</I> newsletter.  "Industries with a lot of activity now might be making moves toward the end of the year."<BR>
<BR>
Cemprola has noticed "strong accumulation patterns" in the last two months in regional banking, chemicals, furniture, REITs, restaurants and petroleum.  A competing newsletter on insider-trading trends, the <I><A HREF = "http://www.wsdinc.com/products/p2162.shtml">Vickers Weekly Insider Report</A></I>, has buy recommendations in insurance, health care, utilities and waste management.  And Seattle's Market Profile Theorems Inc. cites recent insider buying among banks, brokerages, REITs and water utilities.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The number of new home and apartment construction projects increased 4.5% in August,</B> the Commerce Department revealed Thursday.  Construction starts totaled more than 1.5 million during the month, the highest number since March of 1994.  The government's 30-year Treasury bond fell on the news, as analysts said the unexpectedly strong statistics increase the likelihood of a Federal Reserve Board interest rate hike next week.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Former financial talk show host Sonny Bloch bilked investors out of $21 million,</B> he admitted in federal court this week.  Bloch said he was paid to promote some firms on his radio show, urging listeners to invest in worthless precious metals, wireless cable and communications companies.  The 60-year-old Bloch faces 70 years in prison and millions of dollars in fines for nine felony convictions.  <I>The Sonny Bloch Show</I> was broadcast for 15 years from Tampa, Florida, reaching a peak of 1.5 million listeners six days a week.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Trading was light in the financial markets this week in advance of the "triple witching" on Friday,</B> as options, index options and futures contracts expire simultaneously.  Traditionally, the markets are highly volatile on triple-witching days — the third Friday in March, June, September and December — as hedge strategists, arbitrageurs and brokers make large bets on the same day.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The interest rate on the most common type of home mortgage is lower this week,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said Thursday.  Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.14% this week, down from 8.28% last week, according to Freddie Mac's national survey.  The initial rate on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages also fell this week, down 0.07% to 5.83%.  Likewise, fifteen-year mortgages moved from 7.81% to 7.64% during the week.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of unemployed Americans filing for government assistance edged lower last week,</B> the Labor Department said Thursday.  Claims for unemployment insurance fell from 331,000 to 329,000 during the seven days ending September 14, according to the weekly report.  The overall jobless rate is also at a seven-year low of 5.1%.<BR>

<I>Last Updated: September 20, 5:09 p.m. EDT</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Airlines offer big discounts to the cybersavvy</H3>
The recipe for a successful sale?  Don't advertise, mark 75% off the regular price and wait for customers to happen by.  While it may not be the traditional approach to retail sales, some airlines have discovered that such tactics help them pad the bottom line — and they can help you save a bundle.<BR>
<BR>
Northwest Airlines this week priced round-trip tickets between Chicago and Memphis at $79, well below the typical full-fare price of $215 on that route.  But you couldn't get $79 tickets unless you were browsing the <A HREF = "http://www.nwa.com/nwa/flight/promos/auction.shtml">Northwest Airlines Web site</A> and stumbled upon the special fare. The price was not advertised and ticket agents wouldn't tell you about it unsolicited, but there are dozens of special offers just like it every week from major airlines.<BR>
<BR>
Several of the larger carriers figured out recently that the Internet can help solve a traditional thorn in the travel industry's side: How to fill, at the last minute, seats that would otherwise go empty.  Each Wednesday, the airlines slash prices 70% to 80% below full fare for any seats unsold for the upcoming weekend and offer them online.  Doing business that way helps put bodies in otherwise empty seats, while saving the carriers money on advertising expenses, travel agent commissions and the cost of printing tickets.<BR>
<BR>
And travelers with Internet access have been only too happy to snap up the discounted tickets so far.  American Airlines was the first to launch its cybersales program, in March, and a spokesman says the carrier has made several million dollars in online sales since then.  More than 200,000 subscribers are also signed up for its weekly email updates.  While they decline to provide specific numbers, other airlines say their Internet sales have proven equally fruitful.<BR>
<BR>

<LI><B>The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rode a wave of heavy trading volume to close in record territory Friday,</B> finishing the day up more than four points at 687.03.  The previous record close was Monday's 683.98.  The Dow Jones industrial average also reversed a three-day losing streak to finish higher on the day, closing 0.74 points shy of its all-time high at 5888.46.  Volume was high on the day because of the simultaneous expiration of options, index options and futures contracts, which happens only four times a year.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Microsoft admitted this week that the government is looking into antitrust claims about its Internet marketing practices,</B> attributing the investigation to "complaints from competitors."  The Justice Department has said for months that its investigation into Microsoft was ongoing, but the company has contended that no requests for information have been submitted for more than a year — until this week.  Rival Netscape Communications has complained loudly and often that Microsoft uses its dominant Windows platform to influence computer makers to install its Internet browser on new machines rather than Netscape's browser.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A California judge refused Friday to throw out a class-action lawsuit against oil refiners in the state,</B> forcing nine companies to respond to the price-fixing charges within 25 days.  The suit alleges that the refiners used their combined clout to limit the amount of new, cleaner-burning gasoline sold in the state, artificially forcing prices up.  The average price of unleaded gas in California rose from $1.15 per gallon in February to $1.54 in May, but the oil companies said the increase was due to market factors.<BR>

<H3>FBI investigates senior Fed officials over rate-hike leak</H3>
On the eve of the Federal Reserve Board's closely-watched meeting over interest-rate policy, <I>The Washington Post</I> reported Monday that the FBI has been called in to ferret out a leak at the central bank.  Citing unnamed "sources familiar with the inquiry," the newspaper said Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan asked the FBI for help tracking down the person who told a wire-service correspondent that eight of the 12 Fed governors support a rate hike.  <BR>
<BR>
The story that resulted from that leak last week caused bond prices to fall and pushed interest rates higher, as investors concluded that a boost in the federal funds rate was probable at Tuesday's meeting.  Most banks adjust their short-term interest rates in response to any change in the federal funds rate, so the decision can have a major impact on consumer spending and borrowing patterns.  Spokespersons at both the Fed and the FBI refused to confirm or deny the story on Monday.<BR>
<BR>
The fear is that someone with such inside information could use it to make investments that are likely to rise in value after a rate hike.  More likely in this case, say analysts, a Fed official might have leaked the information in an effort to strong-arm the central bank's policy-making committee into taking action.  Only members of the Fed's central committee and a few senior agency staff members have access to the information in question, the newspaper noted, so the investigation is focused on a small number of possible culprits.<BR>
<BR>
The only other time the FBI has investigated a leak at the Fed was in 1989, when a member of the New York Federal Reserve Bank spent six months in jail for tipping off a broker about interest-rate decisions.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Gasoline prices may have bottomed out after declining throughout the summer,</B> according to a national survey released over the weekend.  The nationwide average for all grades of gas was $1.29 this week, unchanged from the last survey, conducted September 6.  A year ago at this time, the average price was $1.20 across all grades.  In this week's Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations across the country, the average price for regular unleaded at self-service pumps was $1.22, while mid-grade averaged $1.32 and premium averaged $1.41.  The price at full-service stations was about 34 cents per gallon higher for each grade.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Farm exports are likely to reach record levels this year,</B> the Agriculture Department said Monday.  During the first 10 months of the government's fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, agricultural exports were up 12% to $50.4 billion.  Based on those numbers, the USDA forecast Monday that total exports for the year would reach $60 billion, the highest level ever recorded.  "Strong prices and robust demand from Asian Pacific Rim countries, Mexico and the European Union were key factors boosting the value of the U.S. bulk exports," according to the USDA report.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>More Americans now connect to the Internet via direct providers than commercial services,</B> the most recent survey by San Francisco's Odyssey Incorporated found.  According to the semiannual national survey, 48% of all home computer users say they get online through direct providers, 35% use commercial services, such as America Online or CompuServe, and 17% can't remember which they use.  The percentages have flip-flopped since polling six months ago, in which 54% of households used the commercial services, 30% used direct connections and 16% couldn't remember.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Russian financial markets fell Monday following reports that President Boris Yeltsin's health is worse than originally thought.</B>  Over the weekend, Yeltsin's doctors said he only stands a 50/50 chance of surviving heart-bypass surgery, which he needs this fall.  Newspaper reports last week said Yeltsin suffered his third heart attack in the past 12 months during the weeks leading up to his reelection in July.  The Times Index of Russian stocks closed nearly 5% lower on the day, at 290.10.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>America Online received court permission Friday to block "junk e-mail" directed at its customers,</B> reversing an earlier judge's ruling that doing so might be an invasion of bulk e-mailers' free speech rights.  AOL contends that customers often complain about receiving unsolicited e-mail touting products and services for sale, but a spokesman said the company hasn't decided if and when it will reinstate its blocking policy.  A lawsuit over the matter is scheduled for November.<BR>

<H3>Investment scams on the rise, regulators warn</H3>
Douglas Wright, Yuji Hitomi and Motohichi Muto promised clients of their financial planning business above-market returns with little or no risk.  Buy a piece of the Japanese government's next $500 million bond, the trio said, then sit back and let the interest coupons come rolling in.  There was just one problem: No such bond existed.  The operation was nothing more than a scam to bilk investors, prosecutors say.  Monday night, the planners were convicted of fraud by a federal jury in Columbia, South Carolina; each now faces 10 years in prison.<BR>
<BR>
Similar cases of investment fraud are on the rise nationwide, the president of the North American Securities Administrators Association announced this week.  "An increasingly common tactic is to lull investors into complacency by first providing a sound financial service, such as tax-preparation or accounting, then moving in to offer a bogus investment that promises a large and supposedly safe return," says Mark Griffin, NASAA president and director of the Utah Division of Securities.  "In Utah alone, over the past 18 months, five people have been criminally prosecuted for this conduct."<BR>
<BR>
In a newly-released <I>Investor Alert</I>, NASAA suggests six steps investors can take to avoid being conned:<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "square"> Investigate the investment adviser and salesperson thoroughly.  Check with your state securities agency to make sure the individual is licensed in the state to provide investment advice.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "square"> Make sure the investment itself is registered for sale in your state. Again, check with your state securities agency.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "square"> Educate yourself.  Read one or more of the magazines devoted to the subject (such as <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/maghome.html"><I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I></A>) and always double-check account statements closely.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "square"> Don't get sweet-talked into investments you don't need or want.  Remember that con-artists are usually extremely polite, Griffin warns.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "square"> Keep greed in check.  If an investment sounds too good to be true, it most likely is.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "square"> Leave a paper trail.  Keep notes about phone conversations and meetings, including dates, times, places and the basics of what was said.<BR>
<BR>
For more information, contact NASAA at 202-737-0900 or check out the <A HREF = "http://www.fraud.org/">National Fraud Information Center's Web site</A>.  For information about online fraud specifically, read <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1995/February/cybersca.html">"Cops and Robbers on the Net"</A> from the February, 1995 issue of <I>Kiplinger's Magazine</I>.<BR>

<LI><B>You won't have to pay a higher interest rate to borrow money, thanks to the Federal Reserve Board's determination Tuesday that inflation is under control.</B>  Meeting in Washington, DC, the Fed ignored Wall Street's expectations and decided to hold the federal funds rate at 5.25%.  Technically, the federal funds rate only affects the percentage commercial banks charge each other for short-term loans, but it also serves as a general benchmark that banks use to price other lending — including credit cards, home mortgages and car loans.  The decision can still be a mixed bag for consumers, though.  "For the average household, higher interest rates would mean somewhat higher mortgage rates and more expensive consumer credit," says economist A'Amer Farooqi of Cornell College in Mt. Vernon, Iowa.  "But if the Fed misses the boat, consumers can lose out anyway because inflation will eat into their earnings."<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Consumer confidence continues to run high heading into the holiday shopping season,</B> the Conference Board said Tuesday.  The New York City-based business research group said its September index of consumer confidence came in at 111.8, essentially unchanged from a six-year high of 112.0 in August.  Based on a monthly survey of 5,000 households across the country, the index found consumers "quite optimistic about the next six months," says the Conference Board's Lynn Franco.  "With consumers in high spirits, the outlook for holiday spending appears to be bright," she says.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Contrary to widespread sentiment that wages are stagnant, per capita income posted its fastest growth of the decade in 1995,</B> the Commerce Department announced Tuesday.  According to the report, per capita income in the U.S. was $23,208 last year, 5.3% higher than in 1994.  Inflation for "personal expenditures," meanwhile, went up by 2.4% during the year, according to department's Bureau of Economic Analysis.  Income gains in every state except Hawaii and North Dakota exceeded inflation during the year.<BR>

<H3>President unveils inflation-proof Treasury bonds</H3>
The complex world of government Treasury bonds entered the universe of sound-bite, keep-it-simple presidential politics Wednesday, if only for a day.  Stumping at Robert Morris College outside Pittsburgh, President Clinton outlined plans for the first Treasury bonds tied to the rate of inflation — guaranteeing buyers above-inflation interest rates for the life of the bonds.<BR>
<BR>
Current Treasury bonds pay a fixed rate of interest until the date they can be redeemed.  As interest rates move up and down in the meantime, the bond's value fluctuates accordingly.  The Treasury Department has to pay a premium to bondholders to accept the risk that higher inflation and interest rates will erode the bond's value before the redemption date.  Reducing the bondholder's risk by taking inflation out of the equation will allow the government to lower the premium it has to pay, Clinton said Wednesday, which saves the government money.<BR>
<BR>
The first batch of 10-year "inflation protection notes" will be auctioned off in $1,000 increments in January, with another auction to be held every three months thereafter.  The bonds will be benchmarked against the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index, Clinton said.  If the CPI increases 3.5% in a given year, the value of a $1,000 bond would be adjusted to $1,035 at the end of the year.  <BR>
<BR>
Clinton also announced plans for a related investment — a savings bond tied to the inflation rate — which will be available in $50 increments starting in 1998.  The <A HREF = "http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/dispatch/092596.html">White House Web site</A> has more information on Wednesday's announcements, although many of the details are still sketchy.<BR>
<BR>
Inflation-indexed bonds have been available for decades in Australia, Canada, Great Britain, Israel, New Zealand and Sweden.  The U.S. versions are expected to pay 3% to 4% in interest, approximately what current 10-year notes pay when inflation is disregarded.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The financial statements companies provide to investors are inadequate,</B> the government's General Accounting Office said in a report released this week.  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) usually require firms to list the value of their assets based on historical cost, essentially the initial price less a predetermined rate of depreciation.  The problem with that system, according to the GAO report, is that such values don't tell investors what assets are really worth on the open market.  The GAO urged the Securities and Exchange Commission to take the lead in pushing for new standards, which are technically under its purview.  The SEC has historically allowed the Financial Accounting Standards Board to establish and update GAAP rules, preferring to stay out of debates over the bean-counters' art.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>August marked the third consecutive month that sales of existing homes dipped lower,</B> the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday.  NAR reported that August sales of previously owned homes fell to 4.13 million from July's 4.15 million — a 0.5% drop.  While higher mortgage rates appear to have spooked away some buyers, home sales have remained above the 4 million mark since March, NAR noted.  Also on Wednesday, the real estate lobbying group said that the median price of an existing home in the U.S. was $122,300, up from $121,500 in July.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>America West Airlines announced Wednesday that it is cutting prices through the holiday travel season,</B> all but unheard-of in the industry.  For travel between November 23 and January 8 — which includes the peak travel season of the year — the ninth-largest U.S. carrier now offers round-trip fares as low as $120 on most routes.  For specifics on fares or routes, visit the <A HREF = "http://www.americawest.com/fltinfo/fltnfsub.html">America West Web site</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Mutual fund company Scudder, Stevens & Clark says it will open a series of discount brokerage offices by the end of the year,</B> joining fund rivals Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and Vanguard in an already crowded brokerage industry.  Scudder spokesman Ed Canaday says the $100 billion firm is launching the service "to respond to the interests and needs of our customers."  Canaday says more details will be announced later in the fall, closer to the actual launch date.<BR>

<H3>Nasdaq announces plan to educate investors — and clean up its image</H3>
After years spent fighting allegations that it doesn't give small investors a fair shake, the Nasdaq stock market fell back on an old truism this week: If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.  Nasdaq president Alfred Berkeley pledged Thursday to correct some of the market's past problems as he kicked off a campaign to convince the public that things will be better for small investors from now on.<BR>
<BR>
"We had a real structural problem with our market, where individual investors were often not getting the same prices as institutional investors," Berkeley said.  "But we're leveling the playing field now, and we need to get that into the common knowledge."<BR>
<BR>
In large measure, reform was forced upon Nasdaq in recent months.  In the face of intense public pressure and a two-year investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, Nasdaq agreed to require the market's brokers to make customer limit orders public.  Limit orders specify a price at which investors would like to buy or sell individual securities, and public disclosure ensures that other investors will be able to select the best price for making trades.  In the past, such information was readily available to institutional investors, but not individuals.<BR>
<BR>
The new regulations will take effect in January, but Berkeley said the goal of the campaign announced Thursday takes it one step further.  "We want to get <I>all</I> the information that's easily available for institutional investors and put it at the fingertips of individual investors," he said.<BR>
<BR>
The easiest way to do that, Berkeley noted, is through <A HREF = "http://www.nasdaq.com">Nasdaq's Web site</A>, which was pegged to play an integral part in the market's newly polished image.  Starting Friday, Nasdaq will initiate a series of newspaper ads and 15-second television commercials playing up the Web site.  Within a few months, Berkeley said, the site will include helpful investor resources such as historical stock price information and insider-trading patterns at individual companies.  <BR>
<BR>
Consumer groups Thursday welcomed Nasdaq's actions as a step in the right direction.  "Investors and the markets both benefit when investors are well informed," the Consumer Federation of America's Barbara Roper said.  "We appreciate any efforts to advance that goal."<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The Federal Reserve Board's recent decision not to raise interest rates was vindicated Thursday by a new round of government reports,</B> as both the Commerce and Labor Departments pointed to an economy that appears to be slowing under its own power.  Commerce said factory orders of big-ticket durable items, such as cars and home appliances, fell 3.1% in  August — the sharpest decline in 16 months.  Also Thursday, Labor announced that new claims for first-time jobless benefits jumped by 11,000 last week to 340,000.  The number of people applying for unemployment insurance hasn't been that high in a single week since early July.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The interest rate on fixed-rate mortgages inched higher this week, while adjustable-rate loans became more affordable,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said Thursday.  Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages, the most popular type of home loan, averaged 8.16% during the week, up from 8.14% a week ago.  Fifteen-year fixed-rate mortgages rose 0.04% to 7.68% this week.  The initial rate offered on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, on the other hand, dipped slightly, from last week's 5.83% to 5.82%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Cost increases at four-year colleges and universities continue to outpace inflation,</B> the College Board said this week.  Undergraduate students at the nation's public and private institutions will pay 5% more for tuition and required fees this year than during the 1995-96 school year, roughly the same level of increase seen the last four years.  Inflation, meanwhile, continues to rise about 3% a year.  "College costs have consistently exceeded the inflation rate, which could leave parents and children alike in a cruel fiscal bind in the years ahead," says Stanley Egener of Neuberger & Berman mutual funds, which recently added a <A HREF = "http://networth.galt.com/www/home/mutual/neuberger/college/collegewksheet.html">worksheet </A>to its Web site that allows parents to estimate future college expenses.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of Americans living below the poverty line dropped more than 4% in 1995,</B> the Census Bureau reported Thursday.  The bureau said 36.4 million Americans continued to live below the government's designated poverty level during the year, down from 38 million in 1994.  In percentage terms, that translates to 13.8% of the U.S. population in 1995 and 14.5% in 1994.  Poverty rates fell for both African-Americans and whites, but remained essentially unchanged for other ethnic groups, including Asians and Hispanics.  According to the government definition, a family of four that made less than $15,569 during 1995 lived in poverty.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Rising stock prices and reduced market volatility brought investors back into mutual funds in August,</B> Investment Company Institute chief economist John Rea said Thursday.  According to ICI statistics, the amount of money in stock funds during the month jumped 4.4% to $1.53 trillion, slightly lower than the record asset level set in June.  Bond funds didn't change as much during the month, increasing 0.6% to $4.98 billion.  Assets of taxable and tax-free money market funds rose 1.9% and 1.4%, respectively.<BR>

<H3>Securities industry kicks off online stock-market game</H3>
For 19 years, the Securities Industry Association has coordinated a national stock-picking game for school children, teaching them about the economy and giving them experience managing investment portfolios.  Starting Monday, adults will be able to get in on the game for the first time, but they'll be gunning for a less altruistic objective — prize money.<BR>
<BR>
"We aren't exactly clear about what the adult winners will get as prizes, since this is a first-time deal, but you can bet it won't be plaques or T-shirts like the students get," says SIA's Dennis Hartenstine.  Possibilities include small cash prizes and even stocks or bonds.  "But our primary purpose is still to educate, not to be a profit maker," Hartenstine is quick to point out.<BR>
<BR>
One change this year is that everybody, students and adults alike, will be managing their hypothetical portfolios and keeping track of their virtual profits online.  Individuals or teams that register at <A HREF = "http://www.smg2000.org/">The Stock Market Game's Web site</A> will be given a $100,000 virtual portfolio to manage for 10 weeks.  Each portfolio's value will be calculated every day the markets are open, and players can check in on their current holdings, brokerage commissions and total return, as well as where they stand in comparison to other players.  Ten-week games are scheduled to start each of the next two Mondays, with prizes awarded in December. <BR>
<BR>
The game won't be available in every state this fall, but SIA's Dennis Hartenstine says more states should be on board before the spring contests.  To find out whether you're eligible to play this time around, <A HREF = "http://www.smg2000.org/coord.shtml">check with your SIA state coordinator</A>.  There is a registration fee that varies by state, usually between $15 and $40 per game.<BR>
<BR>
But SIA isn't the only group offering a chance at virtual profits from online stock-market games.  Until recently, online brokerage E*Trade's monthly stock-picking games were also popular with Internet stock-market wonks.  You're not required to have an account with the brokerage and there's no fee, yet monthly winners collect $50.  The game is being updated right now, though, and a company spokesperson says it won't be accepting new players until November.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The economy grew more quickly last spring than it has in two-and-a-half years,</B> the Commerce Department said Friday.  During the April through June quarter, the nation's gross domestic product increased at an annualized rate of 4.7%, the highest it's been since a 4.9% jump during the second quarter of 1994.  A measure of the total amount of goods and services produced in the U.S., the GDP grew at a 2% pace during the first three months of the year, and a 0.3% rate at the end of 1995.  Analysts cautioned Friday not to read too much into the robust statistic, though.  Many contend that the economy has slowed considerably since the second-quarter numbers were calculated.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The self-styled "Billy the Kid" of computer hackers was indicted on 25 separate charges Friday by a federal grand jury,</B> but 33-year-old Kevin Mitnick avoided 22 others through a plea-bargaining agreement.  Mitnick is accused of stealing computer programs from companies, damaging the system at the University of Southern California and using stolen cellular-phone passwords to tap into computer networks.  Previously, Mitnick spent a year in jail in 1988 for breaking into Digital Equipment Corporation's computers.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Hotels continue to get more expensive as occupancy rates rise,</B> according to the Travel Industry Association of America's August index of travel prices.  While the overall cost of traveling — which includes gasoline prices, airline fares and public transportation — went down 0.2% in August, hotel prices jumped 6% from July's figures.  Through the first eight months of the year, the TIAA's Travel Price Index outpaced general inflation rates by 0.5%.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>Government ends another fiscal year in the red</H3>
What started with a bang last fall amid angry political rhetoric and government shut-downs ended quietly Monday, as the government closed out another fiscal year in the red.  While the final numbers won't be released for a couple of weeks, analysts figure the government spent between $130 billion and $145 billion more than it brought in during the year.<BR>
<BR>
In fairness, this year's deficit is well below the $164 billion shortfall of a year ago.  But most of the spending compromises negotiated last year were given back this week in a frenzy of election-year backpedaling.  The new budget agreement passed by Congress on Monday pushes government spending back above the $500 billion level, up sharply from this year's $488 billion.  Before last fall's balanced-budget debate, the government-spending figure topped $508 billion.<BR>
<BR>
If you have a hankering that you could do a better job than the politicians, go to the <A HREF = "http://garnet.berkeley.edu:6997/longbudget.html">National Budget Simulation site</A> to try your hand at balancing the budget.  Hosted by the University of California at Berkeley, the Web site lets you adjust national spending and tax levels, then shows you how your decisions would affect the budget picture.  <BR>
<BR>
If you manage to make ends meet, there are probably a couple of presidential candidates who could use your advice.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Americans made more and spent more in August,</B> the Commerce Department said Monday.  Both personal incomes and consumer spending rose 0.6% during the month, to $6.5 trillion and $5.2 trillion, respectively.  Disposable income, the amount left over after taxes, increased 0.5% in August after remaining flat a month earlier.  The high level of consumer spending sent the national savings rate down slightly, from July's 5.3% to 5.2%.  One of the things consumers spent money on during the month was new homes.  Commerce said new home sales increased 4.7% — the largest jump in a decade.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>State securities regulators will lose control over mutual fund sales in their states,</B> according to the new securities legislation passed by the Senate on Monday.  Agreed to by the House of Representatives over the weekend, the overhaul of securities legislation passes the responsibility for fund watching to the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The bill would also allow funds to include more performance information in advertisements.  President Clinton is expected to sign the measure.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>ValuJet stock closed slightly higher Monday as the beleaguered airline resumed operations.</B>  After trading as high as $34.75 per share in the spring, ValuJet stock bottomed out at $4.50 on June 18, when the carrier was forced to suspend operations because of lax safety procedures.  Standing under a banner reading "low fares are back" in Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport, company president Lewis Jordan pledged that the low-cost airline will return to profitability soon.  "ValuJet was profitable in every quarter it ever operated prior to the [May 11 crash in the Florida Everglades], and we believe we will work our way back," Jordan said. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>AT&T formally untethered Lucent Technologies on Monday,</B> freeing its former equipment division to make its way as an independent company.  Based in Murray Hill, N.J., Lucent begins life as the thirty-fifth largest company in the U.S., with more than $20 billion in revenues and 125,000 employees.  In the days ahead, AT&T shareholders will receive one Lucent share for every three AT&T shares they own.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The dollar jumped to its highest level against the yen since early 1994 on Monday,</B> reacting to news that the Japanese parliament was dissolved over the weekend.  Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto disbanded the 500-seat lower house of parliament and called for national elections October 20, dampening enthusiasm among traders about a Japanese economic recovery.  The dollar rose to a high of 111.50 yen during the day, before closing slightly lower at 111.34.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>American Airlines leapfrogged rival Delta in the race to equip planes with at-seat power sources for laptop computers.</B>  According to published reports Monday, American will provide outlets at first- and business-class seats beginning as early as January — the first U.S. airline to do so.  Delta recently said it would test outlets on one jet, but it hasn't announced plans to expand the project to the rest of its fleet.  An official announcement from American is expected this week.<BR>

<BR>
<I>Last Updated: October 1, 4:36 p.m. EDT</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Latest baseball brouhaha spotlights deeper problems</H3>
The first day of baseball's post-season went pretty much according to the script on Tuesday: Threats of a strike, eleventh-hour court orders and, eventually, a couple of playoff games.  Ah, take me out to the ballgame...<BR>
<BR>
"Today's focus was supposed to be on baseball and apple pie, on the re-emergence of the sport," says Andrew Zimbalist, economist and author of the book, <I>Baseball and Billions</I>.  "Instead, the spotlight was on the league's disorganization and lack of leadership at a time when fans already think everyone in the game is greedy and egotistical."<BR>
<BR>
That type of sentiment spells trouble for Major League Baseball, the organization.  MLB has spent much of the past two seasons working to regain fans' loyalty (and money) after a bitter players' strike in 1994 led to the cancellation of the World Series.  Despite improvement this year, attendance is down 15% from the pre-strike peak, merchandise sales are down 19% and broadcast television ratings have slumped a whopping 53%.  <BR>
<BR>
Tuesday, it was the umpires, not the players, who were threatening to strike.  The referees were angry that Baltimore Orioles second baseman Roberto Alomar had spit in the face of an ump Friday, yet wasn't suspended for this week's playoffs.  MLB received an injunction 20 minutes before game time that forced the umpires to abide by a no-strike clause in their contract, narrowly averting another black eye for the league.<BR>
<BR>
Several prominent sports columnists this week said that a strong MLB commissioner would have overruled the decision to let Alomar play, defusing the situation.  But acting commissioner Bud Selig, owner of the league's Milwaukee Brewers, is a "one-issue leader," Zimbalist says.  <BR>
<BR>
"Selig is in there for the sole purpose of negotiating the next labor contract with the players," Zimbalist says.  "Once that process is over and the owners are happy with the labor situation, they'll bring in a new commissioner who will address the league's other pressing needs."  In addition to bringing fans back, he says, those needs include international expansion and luring big-money corporate sponsors to the game.<BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, MLB's ship may continue to list a little, even though it's not likely to sink any time soon.  "Yes, the league has made a recovery since 1994, but it won't be a complete recovery until a new labor agreement is in place and there is fresh blood at the helm," Zimbalist says.  "It's just like in any other company: The leader provides the vision, or lack thereof, that everybody else looks to."<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The first step in the minimum-wage hike passed by Congress six weeks ago took effect Tuesday,</B> upping the entry-level rate from $4.25 an hour to $4.75.  Despite the high level of political mud-slinging on Capitol Hill that precipitated the wage hike, the increase is only expected to affect around 3% of American workers.  Labor Unions fought for its passage, though, because the wage bases of higher-paid workers are sometimes tied to the minimum rate.  Economists predict 100,000 to 200,000 people will lose their jobs over the next two years because of the increase, mostly teenagers working part-time.  The minimum wage will go up again on September 1, 1997, to $5.15 an hour.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose for the seventh-consecutive month and set a record high in August,</B> the Conference Board said Tuesday.  Designed to forecast economic activity six to nine months ahead of time, the index posted a 0.2% gain in August.  The report's 103.2 reading surpassed July's record high of 103.1, pointing to continued expansion in the months ahead.  Also Tuesday, the National Association of Purchasing Management's monthly index fell to 51.7 in September, from August's 52.6.  Any reading above 50 is considered a sign of an expanding industrial economy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Fifty-nine percent of Americans would like to invest some Social Security taxes themselves,</B> according to a survey released Tuesday by the Employee Benefit Research Institute and American Savings Education Council.  In the study, 64% of the 1,000 adults polled said some Social Security money should be invested in stocks instead of government securities, which happens under the current system.  A slightly lower percentage, 59%, said they would like to be responsible for allocating the stock portion of their own retirement plan.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Presidents of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund said Tuesday that corruption is a cancer on the economic growth of developing countries.</B>  The leaders spoke at the opening of the annual planning session between the two groups that combined lend tens of billions of dollars to developing countries each year.  "Governments that fight corruption will, over time, attract the larger volume of investment," World Bank president James Wolfensohn said.  "Governments must demonstrate that they have no patience for corruption in any form," IMF director Michel Camdessus agreed.<BR>

<H3>Group addresses online-privacy concerns</H3>
It didn't take long for the word to get around that research firm Lexis-Nexis was selling what some people thought should be private information through its Web site.  A widely circulated anonymous e-mail claimed that "[your] mother's maiden name, [your] birth date and other personal information are now available to anyone with a credit card" through Lexis-Nexis.  After newsgroups picked up on the e-mail's claims, the Dayton, Ohio-based company was swamped with thousands of angry phone calls, faxes and e-mails demanding that it stop releasing such information.<BR>
<BR>
Turns out that claims about the sales plan were exaggerated — that your mother's maiden name was not available, for example, and that the database was only available to deep-pocketed companies that can afford Lexis-Nexis's high fees.  But the sentiment behind the flaming of Lexis-Nexis remains: People are worried about breaches of privacy online.  "People are really concerned about Big Brother watching over their shoulders," says Tim Dick, president of <A HREF = "http://www.worldpages.com/text/privacy.html">the Privacy Assured coalition</A> of online businesses.<BR>
<BR>
Wednesday, Privacy Assured responded to that concern.  The group kicked off a program that that grants the use of its logo to any Web site operator who agrees to four privacy-related requirements:<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE">To not knowingly list personal information online unless it has been volunteered for publication.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE">To not allow so-called reverse searches, which track down individuals' names using e-mail addresses.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE">To only release site-usage statistics that can't be tied to any identifiable person.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE">To allow people to have their information removed from any list on the site.<BR>
<BR>
Privacy Assured plans to eventually merge with <A HREF = "http://www.etrust.org/faq.html">eTrust</A>, a more extensive program run by San Francisco's Electronic Frontier Foundation that will be up and running some time in 1997.  Unlike Privacy Assured, which only asks sites to agree to the above terms, eTrust will audit and certify sites to make sure they comply with privacy standards.  <BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

<LI><B>Poor people and the elderly fare worst in HMO care,</B> according to a study published Wednesday in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I>.  Study author John Ware of the New England Medical Center polled more than 1,500 patients in Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles and found that switching to HMO coverage from traditional insurance plans "doesn't have the same effect on everybody."  Younger and wealthier patients did equally well in either type of plan, Ware says, but older and poorer patients felt overwhelmingly that their health declined after switching to managed care.  Susan Pisano of the American Association of Health Plans says HMOs have greatly improved care of the poor and elderly since the Ware's survey was conducted in 1990.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello received heavy criticism at home Wednesday for pushing around the American bond markets.</B>  Costello met with Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan Monday in Washington, DC, then told an Australian reporter that the Fed leader didn't intend to raise U.S. interest rates in the near future.  American bond traders went on a buying spree after hearing the news, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down 0.06% Tuesday and 0.03% Wednesday.  "[Costello] has embarrassed us in the eyes of the world," former Aussie foreign minister Gareth Evans said Wednesday.  "How can he ever be trusted again with a confidence by any senior minister or senior bank official?"<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Sallie Mae's days as a government enterprise are numbered,</B> President Clinton said this week as he signed legislation forcing the quasi-government student-loan organization to become a private firm by 2013.  Technically known as the Student Loan Marketing Association, Sallie Mae buys student loans from banks and uses some of its revenues to finance state-run student-loan programs.  Sallie Mae chief executive Lawrence Hough says the change is long overdue.  "[This] is one of the most significant developments in the corporation's 23-year history," he says.  "In taking this important step, Congress has given us the flexibility to apply our financial, marketing and processing skills in new, creative ways that will significantly benefit consumers and higher education."<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Construction spending in August reversed course after a July downturn,</B> the Commerce Department said Wednesday.  After dropping 1.1% a month earlier, spending on construction projects nationwide rebounded 0.9% in August to $562.1 billion.<BR>

<H3>Bridal-registry choices: silverware, a new blender...or a house</H3>
Scott and Karen Safford of Folsom, Penn., are fed up with renting.  But in the year and a half they've been married, the Saffords haven't been able to scrape together enough for a down payment on a new house.  "It can be frustrating, watching $750 a month go down a rat hole instead of into equity in a house," Scott says.  "But you're talking about $10,000 or $20,000 for a standard down payment these days, and it'll take us a few years to save that kind of money."<BR>
<BR>
The Saffords were married too early, as it turns out.  Starting Thursday, couples can open a bridal registry savings account at participating Federal Housing Administration banks so friends and family can contribute toward a down payment for the newlyweds.  Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros kicked off the program with a press conference in New York City, touting the interest-bearing accounts as a way to promote home ownership among the under-35 crowd.<BR>
<BR>
"There is a myth that young couples can't afford a home of their own, [so] many couples are resigned to renting," Cisneros said.  "But in many cases it may be easier than they think.  This effort will help couples take that first step."<BR>
<BR>
Under the new policy, FHA banks will establish a savings accounts for couples and send out information on the homeowners program to friends and family.  After the wedding, the account will earn interest and the couple can continue to add to it until they're ready to make a down payment.  Since the savings accounts don't have tax advantages like Individual Retirement Accounts, couples wouldn't be penalized if they needed to take the money out for something other than a house.<BR>
<BR>
Thirty-three FHA lenders are signed up for the plan, but Cisneros expects more to jump on the bandwagon in the near future, along with many non-FHA banks.  To find out more about the bridal registries, check with <A HREF="dntab103.html">the participating FHA lender nearest you</A> or call the agency's Washington, DC, office at 800-225-5342.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The number of people filing for unemployment benefits remained steady last week,</B> the Labor Department said Thursday.  The total number of new applications for state benefits came in at about 340,000, unchanged from the week before and the highest level since mid-July.  The government will release a broader view of the national labor market Friday, when it announces the overall September unemployment rate.  According to Labor Department statistics, 5.1% of Americans were unemployed in August.  Also Thursday, the Commerce Department announced that orders to U.S. factories fell 1.9% in August, the sharpest monthly decline since January of 1993.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Mortgage rates fell this week as inflation fears subsided,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said Thursday.  Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.06% during the week, down from 8.16% only seven days earlier.  Fifteen-year mortgages also fell one-tenth of a percentage point, to 7.58%.  The initial rate charged for one-year adjustable rate mortgages dropped even further during the week, moving from 5.82% to 5.70%.  The Federal Reserve Board's decision last week not to raise short-term interest rates was interpreted by many as a signal that inflationary pressures will be low the rest of this year.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>If you get in an accident, you're best off driving a van, station wagon, utility vehicle or mid-sized luxury car,</B> the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said this week.  The Arlington, Va.,-based group annually compiles lists of cars with the best and worst safety records.  On the basis of the number of driver deaths per 10,000 accidents, IIHS said this year's safest cars were, in order, the Saab 9000, Chevrolet Caprice Wagon, Mazda 626, Lexus LS 400 and Acura Legend sedan.  The most dangerous were the Chevrolet Camaro, Geo Tracker, Chevrolet Corvette, Hyundai Scoupe and Geo Metro.<BR>

<H3>Weak jobs report boosts stock market to new high</H3>
Wall Street finished a record-breaking week in record-breaking fashion Friday, as the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average crossed the finish line with all-time highs.  Both the S&P and the Dow track large-company stocks, but everybody else did well, also.  Bonds and small-company stocks gained on the day, and even a few foreign stock markets raced into record territory.<BR>
<BR>
The reason for the worldwide party in stocks and bonds?  The Labor Department reported Friday that 40,000 Americans lost their job in September.  "Sometimes what appears to be bad news for main street turns out to be good news for Wall Street," says economist Tony Sanders of Ohio State University.  "It seems odd, but that's just the way it works."<BR>
<BR>
In this case, Friday's report eased fears in the financial markets that too-rapid growth would lead to higher inflation, higher interest rates and lower consumer spending.  During the second quarter, the economy grew at a blistering-hot 4.7% rate, which caused analysts to fret about an over-heated economy toppling into a recession.  And August's 5.1% unemployment rate, a seven-year low, did little to cool those worries.  The September unemployment numbers released Friday, though, edged up to 5.2% — the clearest evidence to date that economic growth is letting off steam under its own power.<BR>
<BR>
According to the report, non-farm jobs fell by 40,000 in September, a far cry from the 160,000-job increase economists had forecast, on average.  The switch could prove to be a mixed blessing in the long run, though.  Some analysts Friday said that a slowing economy could lead to lower third- and fourth-quarter corporate earnings, which would likely push stock prices back down.<BR>
<BR>
"Analysts always have to worry about something," Sanders says.  "But for now, at least, things look pretty good."<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The 104th Congress glided to a quiet close Friday afternoon,</B> with no serious issues on the agenda since most members were already home campaigning for the November elections.  As for this Congress's impact on pocketbook issues, economists we talked to Friday rated it as merely average.  Both the 103rd Congress (1993-94) and 99th Congress (1985-86) had greater impact, most agree, thanks to passage of watershed legislation such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the 1986 tax reform act.  "Those were big-time pocketbook changes," says economist Lawrence White of New York University's Stern School of Business.  But that's not to say this was a do-nothing Congress.  Economists point to several pieces of legislation passed by this Congress that will affect your pocketbook, including the welfare reform bill, the telecommunications act and the minimum-wage increase.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A computer glitch at the Social Security Administration may have shortchanged 700,000 retirees more than $850 million over the past 24 years,</B> SSA spokesman Phil Gambino said on the CNN cable television network Friday afternoon.  Gambino said the problem involved a mathematical formula used to compute benefits for people who continued to work after receiving Social Security benefits.  Some recipients didn't get credit for post-retirement income as they went along, he said.  The SSA is in the process of tracking down recipients, Gambino said, and providing back payments that average $1,500 a person.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Former financial radio-show host Sonny Bloch was sentenced to 21 months in prison Thursday,</B> as well as three years of probation and 750 hours of community service.  U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin imposed the sentence after Bloch, 60, pleaded guilty to seven counts of income tax evasion.  The former host of "The Sonny Bloch Show" still faces 35 years in prison and more than $4 million in fines for unrelated fraud charges.  Also Thursday, 72-year-old Charles Keating Jr. walked out of an Arizona prison after serving nearly five years for allegedly stealing millions of dollars as part of the savings and loan meltdown during the 1980s.  Keating was originally sentenced to nearly 13 years behind bars, but was released this week pending a new trial.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Health Maintenance Organizations will raise premiums nearly 3% next year,</B> according to a survey released this week by consultant Sherlock Co.  The annual poll of 103 HMO chief executives found them anticipating an average 2.6% increase in 1997.  The study also found that the average profit margin in the industry has declined from 9% to 0.8% over the past two years, which has forced down stock prices for many.  Douglas Sherlock, the consulting firm's CEO, said stiff competition has kept HMOs from raising premiums in recent years while the cost of doctors, hospitals and drugs has gone up significantly.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Trucks claimed three of the top five spots on the list of best-selling vehicles during the 1995 model year,</B> according to data released this week by Autodata Corp.  In order, the top-selling vehicles for the year were:  Ford F-Series pickup; Chevrolet C/K pickup; Ford Explorer utility vehicle; Ford Taurus; Dodge Ram pickup; Honda Accord; Toyota Camry; Dodge Caravan; Ford Escort; and Ford Ranger pickup.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>South African companies were listed on a U.S. exchange Friday for the first time in more than a decade.</B>  Five South African mining companies — Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining, Durban Roodeport, Harmony Gold Mining, Grootvlei Propriety Mines and Buffelsfonetin — officially listed their American Depository Shares on Nasdaq on Friday, as their country eased back into the world financial scene after dismantling its racist government.<BR>

<H3>Funny numbers litter debate battlefield</H3>
Eventually, it seems, all presidential elections work their way through the clutter to zero in on the one issue that matters above all: how voters feel about their economic well-being.  That certainly held true in this year's first presidential debate between incumbent Bill Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole, staged Sunday night in Hartford, Conn.  <BR>
<BR>
"Are you better off than you were four years ago?" Dole asked the national television audience.  "Are you working harder to put food on the table, to feed your children?"  <BR>
<BR>
"I think it's clear that we're better off than we were four years ago," Clinton responded.  "We have ten and a half million more jobs . . . [and] the average family's income has gone up over $1,600."<BR>
<BR>
So far, so good; we had the makings of an honest exchange of ideas over the nation's economic situation.  But then things went awry.  Hoping to sway undecided voters, the candidates soon launched into a game of statistical one-upmanship in which the factual underpinnings were slight, at best.  A few examples:<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"><I>Clinton: "We cut taxes for 15 million working Americans."</I>  In 1993, Congress passed — and Clinton supported — tax credits for low-income workers, designed to keep them above the poverty line.  But the credits are essentially a welfare subsidy, not the tax cut for middle-class Americans that Clinton tries to play it up as.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"><I>Dole: ". . . your tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America."</I>  In nominal dollars, Dole was correct that Clinton's $220 billion tax increase passed three years ago was the largest ever.  But when adjusted for inflation, the 1993 boost is smaller than a Republican-engineered tax increase passed with Dole's support in 1982.  Taking into account Americans' spending power at the time, the 1982 increase would be worth $298 billion in today's dollars.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"><I>Clinton: "[Dole's] budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion."</I>  Under the Republican plan Clinton vetoed, Medicare spending would have continued to rise over the next seven years, albeit at a slower clip than the 10% rate of recent years.  What the president called a "cut," Republicans call "savings" that are necessary to rescue Medicare from insolvency.<BR>
<BR>

[Clinton] inherited a growth of 4.7% or 4.8%; now it's down to about 2.4%."</I>  Since Clinton's inauguration, the gross domestic product has grown at a 3.2% annual clip.

<BR>
<H3>Companies reign in road warriors</H3>
More employees than ever are traveling on business these days, and more companies than ever are fretting over travel costs.  That according to American Express, which released its biennial business travel survey on Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
"We've been doing this survey for 16 years, and we've never seen this level of travel or this much concern about [travel] costs on the part of managers," says Ed Gilligan, president of American Express Corporate Services.  "The bottom line is that with more business travelers on the road, companies are treating travel less as a perk and more as an ordinary business expense."<BR>
<BR>
Translation: Firms are aggressively slashing travel-related costs anywhere they can.  The most obvious target is airline tickets, which make up 42% of all travel costs.  Seventy-eight percent of the 1,200 firms polled this year require employees to take the lowest airfare available regardless of how inconvenient it might be, up from 69% two years ago.  And 37% of companies require employees to stay over a Saturday night when it will significantly reduce ticket prices.<BR>
<BR>
Hotel and meal expenses are also coming under the knife, according to the survey, since they make up the second- and third-largest components of travel costs, respectively.  Only 19% of companies say their employees commonly stay in deluxe or first-class rooms, down from 28% in 1994.  Two-thirds report that moderate hotel rooms are most commonly used by travelers, while 14% say economy rooms are typical.  As for meal costs, 53% of companies now cap the amount employees can spend per meal, up from 50% two years ago.<BR>
<BR>
But the news isn't all bad for regular business travelers.  Almost all companies have given up trying to capture frequent-flier miles that employees accumulate on business trips, for example, and many firms say they allow workers to fly first class on international or long-haul trips.  "With so-called hardship travel, I think companies have decided that allowing their employees to arrive fresh is worth the expense of upgrades," Gilligan says.<BR>
<BR>
The two best ways for a company to reign in travel costs are to make a single manager responsible for all travel arrangements and to put your travel policy down in writing, says Kim Lewis, vice president of American Express Corporate Services.  "There are financial rewards for companies that take these fairly simple steps," Lewis says.  "Firms in our study [that took such steps] spend 19% less on travel costs than the average company."<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Business executives feel less confident about the economy than they did earlier this year,</B> according to a quarterly Conference Board study released Tuesday.  The group's Business Confidence Index registered a 53 during the third quarter, down two points from the previous quarter.  Any figure greater than 50 indicates that more chief executives gave positive responses than negative ones.  Regardless, CEOs are getting more skeptical about the economy as the year goes on.  "Executives' outlook for the next six months is less optimistic than it was," says the Conference Board's Lynn Franco.  "About one of every four CEOs anticipate a pickup in overall economic activity, down from almost one out of three in the second quarter."<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Consumer debt levels continued to climb in August, but at the slowest rate in more than three years,</B> the Federal Reserve Board said this week.  According to the Fed, total consumer credit rose $3.3 billion in August to slightly less than $1.2 trillion.  But the annualized growth rate of 3.5% during the month is less than half of July's 7.6%, and adds to mounting evidence of a slowing U.S. economy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Dow Jones industrial average spent time above 6,000 for the second day in a row Tuesday,</B> before retreating ahead of third-quarter earnings reports due this week and next.  The Nasdaq market, the New York Stock Exchange and the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index all fell from record highs set Monday, also.<BR>

<H3>Web surfers beware the online ponzi scheme</H3>
While death and taxes may be the only sure things in life, another maxim has proven itself to be a pretty safe bet throughout human history: Wherever the masses congregate, scamsters will be doing what they can to unload the good people of their wallets.  And where people are beginning to gather these days is on the Internet, which has at least 35 million regular users and is growing by the day.<BR>
<BR>
"The fast-growing arena of cyberspace has become the new frontier for scam artists," says Kim Michalski of the National Consumers League in Washington, DC.  "All online users are potential targets from the scam artist's point of view."<BR>
<BR>
Wednesday, the NCL released the results of a six-month study into the types of rip-offs most common in the online world.  Not surprisingly, perhaps, the bad guys' scam of choice on the Internet is the good, old-fashioned pyramid scheme.  Also called ponzi schemes, pyramids attract people by offering high rates of return with little or no risk.  Investors who jump in early will generally get that high return as the swindlers pay them off using money deposited by late-comers.  As soon as the pace of new investors slows down, though, the scamsters generally take the money and run, leaving investors with nothing.  Think of it as a sophisticated version of a chain letter.<BR>
<BR>
Other widely-seen scams over the past six months, according to NCL study, include the sale of phony Internet services or computer equipment, exaggerated business opportunities and bogus work-at-home offers.  In general, be wary of anybody who asks you to send them money before you know if the product is legit or who makes claims that seem overstated, Michalski says.<BR>
<BR>
For more information or if you would like to report someone you suspect of fraud, visit the <A HREF = "http://www.fraud.org">NCL's Web site</A> or send the group an <A HREF = "mailto:nfic@internetmci.com">email message</A>.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Hong Kong's Hang Seng index set a record on Wednesday,</B> pushed higher by high levels of foreign investment.  The Hang Seng rose 144 points on the day to close at 12,250.57, nearly 50 points higher than the previous record set two and a half years ago.  The record culminates three weeks of surging markets in Hong Kong, after investors shrugged off fears about the island's turnover to China on June 30.  Earlier in the year, investors had worried that China might impose its authoritarian system on Hong Kong in 1997, which would stifle economic growth.  The Chinese government has denied any plans to do that, however.  "China has too much at stake not to keep its word," says Richard Farrell, manager of the Guinness Flight China & Hong Kong mutual fund.  "They desperately need overseas investment, so they don't want to risk irritating the world's investors by screwing up Hong Kong."<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>New money flowing into mutual funds slowed in September,</B> the Investment Company Institute estimated Wednesday.  ICI said net new cash flow into stock, bond and income funds totaled about $17.5 billion in September, down from $17.93 billion in August.  Stock funds accounted for most of the slowdown, bringing in nearly $2 billion less than they had the month before.  Bond and income funds slowed from a $1.6 billion gain in August to $1.5 billion in September.  ICI chief economist John Rea said the slowdown is partially seasonal and partially due to investor worries about the possibility of an impending bear market.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>U.S. stocks suffered their worst losses in a month on Wednesday,</B> hurt by profit-taking after the past week's series of record highs.  Even the technology-heavy Nasdaq market finished lower on the day, despite Tuesday's announcement that the Semiconductor Industry Association's book-to-bill ratio moved higher in September.  A higher book-to-bill ratio is a strong indication of strength in the computer industry over the next six to 12 months, which should benefit high-tech companies.<BR>

<I>Last Updated: Thursday, October 10, 5:05 p.m. EDT</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Microsoft steps up battle for hearts, minds and wallets of Internet users</H3>
"You have to keep your wits about you when everyone says you're going out of business within a year," Netscape Communications chief executive Jim Barksdale said this week.  "I would just say that we have a fighting chance."<BR>
<BR>
Wait a minute.  Three out of four people who surf the Internet use Netscape's omnipresent Navigator browser.  And this is the same Netscape that took Wall Street by storm a year ago, watching its share price more than double in the hours after its initial public offering.  Now it's worried about going out of business?  What gives?<BR>
<BR>
Barksdale's melodramatics aside, what gives is that software giant Microsoft Corp. is rapidly encroaching on Netscape's turf, as well as that of online service companies such as America Online and CompuServe.  Thursday, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates stepped up his company's attack on that turf, outlining a strategy for ruling the Internet much like Microsoft already dominates the computer software market.<BR>
<BR>
One key element of the plan laid out Thursday includes a beefed-up Microsoft Network, MSN, which is already the third-largest online service in the world.  In addition to new bells and whistles for MSN, Gates announced a $19.95 per month flat-fee pricing plan that matches or beats competitors' best prices.  And, in a direct challenge to Netscape, Gates unveiled a new beta version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer software, designed specifically to one-up the leading browser.<BR>
<BR>
For nearly a year, Microsoft has thrown much of its considerable resources at developing Internet products, but many industry analysts still have a wait-and-see attitude about the company's chances of dominating 'Net commerce.  Still, Microsoft's competitors know better than to relax.  "Microsoft has an awful lot of resources, so I would never count them out," says Netscape founder Jim Clark.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits fell by 22,000 last week,</B> the Labor Department reported Thursday.  Analysts on Wall Street had expected the number to rise, not fall, so the announcement sent shudders through the stock and bond markets on renewed inflation fears.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The FBI arrested 45 people on charges of securities fraud in a nationwide sting Thursday,</B> cracking down on a stock promotion scheme the government says was illegal.  The Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers were also involved in the investigation of penny-stock promoters in California, Florida and New York who bribed brokers to put investors in small stocks — artificially running up the price until insiders could cash out.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Time Warner reassumed its position as the largest media company in the world Thursday,</B> as shareholders voted to approve a merger with Turner Broadcasting Systems.  Disney had taken over the top spot when it merged with Capital Cities/ABC earlier this year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Home-mortgage rates dropped to a six-month low this week,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said Thursday.  Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.86% during the week, the lowest average since April 4.  Fifteen-year mortgages and one-year adjustable-rate mortgages also dropped during the week, to 7.38% and 5.68%, respectively.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Interest rates on one-year Treasury bills hit a five-month low in Thursday's auction,</B> with the average discount rate coming in at 5.34%.  That's down from 5.57% at the last auction, held September 12, and the lowest rate since May.<BR>

<I>Last Updated: Friday, October 11, 5:09 p.m. EDT</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Should you care whether the bull market is growing long in the tooth?</H3>
Six years ago this weekend, the longest bull market in the history of U.S. stocks was born — and it's still going strong today.  On October 11, 1990, the widely followed Dow Jones industrial average bottomed out at 2,365 following a 21% drop; this week, the Dow topped 6,000 for the first time, up 154% since that 1990 trough.  The question on investors' minds on this anniversary is, 'how much longer can it last?'<BR>
<BR> 
Even a moderate bear market by historical standards might be enough to spook investors accustomed to smooth sailing, analysts say.  The eleven market downturns that have struck during the past four decades cost the stock market more than one-quarter of its value each time, on average.<BR>
<BR>
But should investors should care?  If you need your money relatively soon, say within two or three years, you should be drawing down the percentage of your portfolio that's in stocks, regardless.  And if you don't need the money right away, you're probably better off leaving it where it is through the ups and downs that lie ahead.  That according to a recent study by Boston polling firm Dalbar, Inc., which found that over time, "total return is far more dependent on investor behavior than on [market] performance."<BR>
<BR>
While it may sound strange, that finding is based on the assumption that few people are smart enough or lucky enough to buy low and sell high on a regular basis.  In other words, a simple buy-and-hold strategy works better for most people than a market-timing strategy.  If an investor shunned stocks in 1995, for example, thinking the already aging bull market was about to collapse, he would have missed out on a 38% gain that year — not to mention 15% more so far in 1996 (using the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index as a proxy for the market).<BR>
<BR>
The Dalbar study compared the average total return for mutual fund investors with that of the S&P 500 between 1984 and 1996.  Over that 12-year span, mutual fund investors averaged 6.3% in annualized total return, which pales in comparison the S&P 500's 15.5% average.  "The difference," the report says, "is attributable to poor market-timing attempts by investors and the fact that investor cash does not remain invested in stocks for the entire period."<BR>
<BR>
It may be easier to advocate a buy-and-hold philosophy now than it will be when the markets tank, though.  When a bear market takes hold is when your investment mettle will be tested — and when the difference will be made in your long-term total return.  "You have to realize that at some point your stocks will go lower, inevitably, than they are today," says Michael K. Farr, president of Farr, Miller & Washington investment advisors in Washington, DC.  "But that shouldn't make any difference to your long-term investment philosophy or your investment horizon."<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Columbia University economist William Vickrey died of a heart attack Friday, three days after winning the Nobel Prize for Economics.</B>  Vickrey, 82, suffered the attack while on the way to Boston for a conference.  British professor James Mirrlees shared the prize with Vickrey this year, for separate work the two did on how organizations make decisions based on incomplete information.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Producer prices rose a moderate 0.2% in September,</B> the Labor Department reported Friday.  The Producer Price Index had gone up 0.3% in August.  Also Friday, the Commerce Department announced that retail sales increased 0.7% in September, the highest growth rate in four months.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Serious safety violations in the workplace jumped more than 30% in the past year,</B> the Occupational Safety and Health Administration said Friday.  OSHA issued 165 citations for "significant and egregious" cases during the fiscal year that ended September 30, up from 125 the year before.<BR>

<H3>Ask Dr. Tightwad</H3>
<I>For the Columbus Day holiday, in place of the regular "News of the Day" column, we decided to give you a taste of the children-and-money fare we hope to add to Kiplinger Online as a regular feature in the near future.  "Ask Dr. Tightwad" is courtesy of Janet Bodnar, mother of three, senior editor of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I> and author of the book, <I>Kiplinger's Money-Smart Kids</I>.</I><BR>
<BR>
<B>Dear Dr. Tightwad:</B> It's not even Halloween yet and my seven-year-old is hard at work on his Christmas list. So far there are 24 things on it, including a laptop computer for kids, and he isn't finished yet. He doesn't have a chance of getting half that stuff. How should I handle this?<BR>
<BR>
<B>A.</B> Don't panic. Just because your child makes a long gift list doesn't mean that the holidays have gotten out of hand. In fact, you can use your son's list to help keep your spending under control.<BR>
<BR>
Let him make the list as long as he wants, as long as he knows that he's not going to get everything that's on it. If certain things are out of the question—that laptop, for instance—tell him now so that he doesn't get his hopes up. <BR>
	<BR>
As for the rest, tell him it's a wish list from which Santa, Mom and Dad and others can choose some gifts. But they may also want to come up with a few surprises of their own. <BR>
	<BR>
As the annual visit to Santa gets closer, have your son whittle down the list to a more manageable number of gifts—say, ten items. With all the work Santa has to do at this time of year, he probably won't have time to read much more than that anyway. And the shorter the list, the more likely that Santa will remember what's on it. <BR>
	<BR>
Kids have short memories and careless habits, so you may get lucky. The list your son made in October may be lost and forgotten by December. The things that survive are the things your son really wants. You're going to be buying him some gifts anyway, so knowing what to look for will mean less wasted time and money when you do your own shopping. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Dear Dr. Tightwad:</B> We know a couple who have an unusual way of teaching their children about money. They leave small amounts of cash around the house for the kids to find. When the kids find the money, they get to keep it and decide what to do with it. What do you think of this system?<BR>
<BR>
<B>A.</B> What system? Giving the children the money as a regular allowance would be a system. All they're learning from this exercise is how to pick up money that doesn't necessarily belong to them. <BR>
	<BR>
Dr. T advises that you not leave cash lying around your house when these kids come for a visit--and that you show their parents this column. <BR>

<BR>
<H3>GM struggles with just-in-time production system</H3>
Times are good at General Motors Corp., the world's largest car maker.  Third-quarter earnings were nearly double those of a year ago, the stock price is trading in a predictably lofty range and the company just came to terms with the United Auto Workers on a new labor contract.  <BR>
<BR>
There is the small matter of GM's Canadian workers going on strike in recent weeks.  But they account for a small percentage of the company's worldwide labor force, so how big a deal can that be?<BR>
<BR>
Pretty big, as it turns out.  GM was forced to lay off more than 3,000 workers at its Cadillac assembly plant in Detroit on Tuesday as a result of the strike — on top of the 2,000 employees who were already let go at other plants over the past week.  That a relatively small number of disgruntled employees was able to wreak such havoc comes as no surprise to many analysts, given GM's production system.<BR>
<BR>
"One potential problem with a just-in-time system is the fact that a temporary shutdown at one stage of production will stop production at [other] stages," says Lawrence Gordon, co-editor of the <I>Journal of Accounting and Public Policy</I> and a business professor at the University of Maryland.  <BR>
<BR>
GM and many other firms switched to just-in-time production processes in recent years in an attempt to cut costs associated with building up inventories.  For example, it costs money for GM to manufacture seats for its vehicles, money that can't be recovered until finished vehicles are sold.  The longer a stockpile of seats sits in the factory unused, the longer it will take to recoup that investment.  A just-in-time production system reduces that cost by making sure the goods in one stage of production are completed just before they're needed at the next stage.<BR>
<BR>
Just-in-time systems can save manufacturing companies a lot of money, but the GM case highlights their primary drawback.  To deal with it, managers instituting such plans have to be willing to adjust on the fly, Gordon says.<BR>
<BR>
"In designing a just-in-time system, it is important to consider a contingency plan for potential problems," he says.  "Managers need to develop a flexible manufacturing system that is capable of quickly and easily being reconfigured."<BR>

<LI><B>A federal court on Tuesday derailed the government's plans to break up the nation's local phone monopolies.</B>  The appeals court put a halt to the Federal Communications Commission's plans to open up the $100 billion local-phone market to long-distance carriers, cable-television operators and others, at least until the court can hear a trial on the matter in 1997.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The U.S. is widening its international-trade dispute with Japan over photographic film,</B> a government official told the Associated Press on Tuesday.  The official said the government plans to tell the World Trade Organization that Japanese regulations discriminate against imported film and photo paper — accusations that go beyond an American complaint filed in June on behalf of Eastman Kokak Co.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Agricultural company Archer Daniels Midland's guilty plea to charges of "anticompetitive conduct" won't end a four-year government investigation,</B> the Justice Department said Tuesday.  Attorney General Janet Reno said the government will fine the company $100 million, the largest antitrust fine in history, and will continue to investigate company executives.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, Netscape Communications decided on Tuesday.</B>  During its self-proclaimed "Netscape Strategy Day," Netscape unveiled new intranet products that are designed to work with rival Microsoft Corporation's Windows software — something the company had avoided in earlier products.<BR>

<H3>Texas principal cited as nation's "best boss"</H3>
Although my desk calendar doesn't say so, I have it on good information that Wednesday was National Boss' Day.  Don't rush out to buy a belated Hallmark card, though.  Rather,  spend a few moments contemplating what it takes for you to be a good manager.  Top managers tend to lead departments with motivated employees and low rates of turnover — qualities that might make <I>your </I>boss take notice.<BR>
<BR>
Each year at this time, James B. Miller releases his selections of the best and worst managers of the year, based on hundreds of employee nominations.  Author of the book, <I>Best Boss, Worst Boss</I>, Miller this year tapped the principal of Spring Garden Elementary School in Bedford, Texas, as the nation's top manager.  Principal Bill Barnes, Miller says, "motivates, is sensitive to family needs and provides an excellent working environment."  Runners-up included a district sales manager, a military officer and the president of a small company.<BR>
<BR>
An unidentified Spring Garden employee submitted the following entry for Barnes:<BR>
<BR>
"The boss leading the Macarena during a staff meeting?  The boss dressed as an Olympian to emphasize our theme, 'Carrying the Torch of Education' during in-service?  That was our principal, Bill Barnes, inspiring staff enthusiasm.  Bill has dressed in many costumes (fortune teller, Blues Brother, waiter, clown and motorcycle messenger) to motivate, inspire and to have fun with his staff.  He shows his appreciation of the 70-member staff by taking us to lunch, giving 'comp' time to teachers while he teaches the class, taking lunch duty and awarding prizes to staff for giving time to after-school student clubs, for outstanding achievements and for obtaining improved test scores and attendance.  He shares videos, books, articles, music and tapes for professional/personal growth.  We attended 1,255 hours in workshops last year alone.  He challenges his staff to maintain a balance between family and work, to be active in professional organizations and to become politically knowledgeable and active."<BR>
<BR>
The unnamed winner of the "worst boss" designation was cited for eating employee lunches without asking, submitting employee receipts for his own reimbursement and rigging company raffles to keep the merchandise himself, among other things.<BR>
<BR>
Miller says he received 484 nominations for male bosses this year and 175 for female bosses, with at least one nomination from every state and the District of Columbia.  He won't start looking through nominations for the 1997 best and worst boss designations until next summer, but you can get an application in the meantime by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to: Best Boss/Worst Boss Contest, P.O. Box 200907, Arlington, TX 76006.  <BR>

<UL> 
<LI><B>Consumer prices rose 0.3% in September,</B> according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly Consumer Price Index.  Food costs were higher for the fourth month in a row, led by inflation in dairy, fish, meat and poultry products. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The World Trade Organization established a three-member panel Wednesday to look into a trade dispute between the U.S. and Japan.</B>  The U.S. claims the Japanese government uses complicated rules and regulations to keep American company Eastman Kodak from competing with Japan's Fuji Photo Film.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Social Security benefits will increase 2.9% after the latest cost-of-living adjustment,</B> the Social Security Administration announced Wednesday.  The average check will jump from $724 to $745 as a result.  Social Security benefits increased 2.6% in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>China has banned the import of poultry from 10 U.S. states,</B> the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.  Chinese officials are worried that some American poultry might carry a virus, although the U.S. says its $500 million worth of annual poultry exports are safe.<BR>

<I>Last Updated: Thursday, October 17, 4:56 p.m. EDT</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Increasing economic clouds just the forecast Wall Street was looking for</H3>
Same story, different day: Bad economic news released Thursday turned out to be good news for Wall Street, pushing blue chips further into record territory.  Four government reports released during the day point toward an economy that is slowing down after a period of high growth — which Wall Street embraced as a sign that the government may not need to raise interest rates any time soon.<BR>
<BR>
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index, both of which track large-company stocks, closed in record territory on the day.<BR>
<BR>
In the first report, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing for state unemployment benefits rose to 340,000 last week, up from 328,000 the week before.  Moreover the weakening of the job market was widespread, with all 50 states showing an increase during the week.  Analysts said the unemployment report may have been the most important of the day's reports, since a tight labor market will ultimately lead to higher wages and increased inflation.<BR>
<BR>
Also Thursday, the Federal Reserve Board announced that the nation's gross domestic product increased a paltry 0.2% in September after jumping twice that much in August.  And the Commerce Department said that new housing starts fell to a nine-month low and the stock of unsold goods on store shelves rose to a 14-year high last month.<BR>

<LI><B>Interest rates on the most popular type of home loan went up this week,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said Thursday.  The average rate on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.88% this week, up 0.02% from a week ago.  Fifteen-year mortgages were up 0.1%, to 7.39%, but one-year adjustable rate loans dropped 0.06%, to 5.62%.<BR>

<H3>Travel professionals forecast higher hotel prices, airfare for '97</H3>
Travel agents, airline employees, rental car agents and others in the travel industry packed the Radisson Plaza Hotel in Alexandria, Va. this week to wine, dine and talk about business prospects in the year ahead.  Most left with smiles on their faces Friday after a keynote speech in which the Travel Industry Association's Suzanne Cooke said a strong economy in the year ahead will push consumers to spend more money than ever on travel.<BR>
<BR>
"Good weather, favorable economic conditions, confident consumers and growth in major sectors of the [travel] industry like air and hotel all portend well for 1997," Cook said.  "Incomes are up, people are confident and they're spending money."<BR>
<BR>
Cook told the gathering that TIA's economists are forecasting a 3% to 4% increase in the number of people traveling in 1997, following a paltry 1% uptick this year (which she blames on bad weather).  <BR>
<BR>
But the boom for the travel industry could be a bust for some consumers, since prices are expected to rise with the increased demand.  Smith Travel Research in Hendersonville, Tenn., expects the average price for a hotel room to climb 5% next year to $74.81, up from $71.25 this year.  And the American Express Domestic Airfare Index, which follows airline-ticket prices, is up 19% from this time a year ago and is expected to continue rising.<BR>
<BR>
Cooke said she doesn't expect higher costs to deter travelers, though, unless the economy goes into a tailspin.  "Consumer confidence is at levels we haven't seen in years," she said.<BR>

<LI><B>The government released good news and bad news about the trade deficit on Friday.</B>  First, the good news: The Commerce Department said the monthly trade gap narrowed to $10.8 billion in August, down 6.6% from July figures.  The bad news?  That's still the second-largest trade deficit recorded since the government began tracking monthly figures in 1992.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Executives of the nation's largest businesses think the economy will keep humming along for the next year or so.</B>  The Business Council, which includes executives from 100 of the largest firms in the U.S., predicted Thursday that the economy will grow moderately over the next 12 months as inflation hovers around 3%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Two Archer Daniels Midland executives under investigation for price fixing resigned,</B> the company announced late Thursday.  Tuesday, ADM pleaded guilty to price fixing and agreed to pay a $100 million fine, but the Justice Department said several individual executives were still under investigation.  One of those departing is vice chairman Michael Andreas, son of company chairman Dwayne Andreas.<BR>

<H3>Lemon Laws could cut into Chrysler's sales</H3>
In what could be a major blow to the country's third largest automaker, Chrylser Corp., California's Department of Motor Vehicles last Thursday banned the carmaker from shipping new cars and trucks to dealers in the state for 45 days.  Chrysler was slapped with this sanction for 116 violations of the state's "lemon laws" for failing to notify used car buyers that they were purchasing cars that had already been returned because of persistent problems.<BR>
<BR>
Chrysler has said it will appeal the decision and that the ban will not become effective until the appeals process is exhausted.  Chrysler sold 169,800 new cars and trucks in California in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
While this ban affects only California, what do other states do to protect consumers?  The first "lemon law" passed was the federal Magnuson-Moss Federal Trade Commission Act.  Since then, all 50 states have passed their own laws to protect consumers.  And while all of these state laws have some common protections and procedures, they do vary from state-to-state.<BR>
<BR>
According to the book, <I>Lemon Law, A Manual for Consumers</I>, there are 12 essential features to lemon laws affecting individuals, vehicles and defects covered, repair attempts, duration of problem, manufacturer's defenses, remedies, notice and arbitration requirements, civil suit, attorney fees, and resale of a "lemon."<BR>
<BR>
If you feel your vehicle may be a "lemon" the book offers the following tips; take the vehicle to an authorized repair shop, be sure your complaints are written on the repair order before you sign it, keep a record of who you spoke with and what was said, if the defect recurs take it promptly to an authorized facility.  Repeat these steps until the defect is repaired or the vehicles qualifies under your state laws as a "lemon."<BR>

<BR>
<I>Last Updated: Tuesday, October 22, 5:30 p.m. EDT</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Tax code due for an overhaul?</H3>
Republican presidential hopeful Steve Forbes caught the nation's eye last spring when he proposed scrapping the tax code and implementing a simple, flat-rate federal tariff in its place.  Forbes' candidacy ultimately fizzled, but the word was out: A large block of voters began publicly calling for a simpler tax code, usually in the form of a flat tax or a national sales tax.<BR>
<BR>
Such grass-roots movements don't always fall on deaf ears in Washington, DC.  Ten years ago Tuesday, the last overhaul of the tax system became law after calls to simplify the process.  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was the largest rewrite of tax law since the income tax was born in 1913, and it had an immediate impact on millions of Americans ( if not always the intended one.  For many, the law complicated matters and increased the need for tax experts to wade through it all.<BR>
<BR>
A decade later, the prospects of wholesale tax changes are slim to none, according to the October 18 issue of <A HREF="/newsletter/tax.html"><I>The Kiplinger Tax Letter</I></A>.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the ever-present Capitol Hill dogfights likely to stall major tax changes, the publication noted, policymakers are worried about the economic disruption forced on those who've made plans based on the current system.  For example, senior citizens who have saved for retirement would be hit disproportionately hard by a consumption tax during their golden years.  Or businesses that have purchased assets with the intention of depreciating them according to current law would be hammered by a flat tax.<BR>
<BR>
While a major rewrite probably isn't in the cards for at least a decade, <I>The Kiplinger Tax Letter</I> said many small changes can be expected in the years ahead, including the possibility of converting a portion of your Social Security tax to a private savings fund.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Investors' top concern is having enough money in order to retire comfortably,</B> according to a study released this week by the College for Financial Planning in Denver.  The study's authors further concluded that such concern is well founded, since most investors wait until middle age to start planning for retirement(missing decades of investment growth.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The strong economy has led to a bull market in corporate giving,</B> according to a Conference Board study to be released later this week.  The study found that company contributions to health and community organizations increased 20% in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>General Motors and the Canadian Auto Workers reached a tentative agreement to end their three-week old strike.</B> The vote by the CAW rank and file is scheduled for tomorrow.  The strike has idled 26,300 workers and stopped GM operations in Canada and has also affected an additional 19,931 workers in the U.S. and Mexico.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The U.S. has made significant gains in competitiveness, but faces long-term vulnerabilities, </B>according to a study released Tuesday by the Council on Competitiveness.  The study, which looked at the past decade, pointed to U.S. gains in recapturing global market share, growth in per capita GDP, budget deficit reduction and job creation.  The report also found U.S. weaknesses stemming from wage inequality, weak savings and investment, poor return on educational spending, and lower overall productivity growth.<BR>

<H3>Vanguard beware: International index funds catch on</H3>
Over the past decade, mutual fund investors have become increasingly interested in index funds. At the same time, global investing has seen a huge surge in popularity.  It was only a matter of time, then, before the two trends would combine in the creation of global index funds.<BR>
<BR>
Six months ago, two companies began offering such investments within days of each other.  Both Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell introduced single-country, foreign index funds in March, and both have done well in the months since.  Morgan's World Equity Benchmark Shares (WEBS) are available for 17 individual country markets and trade on the American Stock Exchange; Deutsche Morgan Grenfell's CountryBaskets track the indexes of eight foreign countries and trade on the New York Stock Exchange.<BR>
<BR>
Surprising enough, the Vanguard fund family, which has for years ruled the roost of American index funds, has yet to tap this market. The company does offer several international "index funds," however these funds target groups of countries rather than individual markets, which differentiates them from traditional single-country index funds.  Of the newcomers, seven of the eight countries with CountryBaskets have corresponding WEBS funds.  Only South Africa appears exclusively in the Deutsche Morgan Grenfell offerings.  A list of the markets that have index funds is available on each company's Web site (see below).<BR>
<BR>
Total expenses for the funds, including quarter-of-a-point 12b-1 fees, average 0.88% for the WEBS funds and 0.86% for the CountryBaskets.  That compares with 1.82% and 1.85% for closed-end and open-end international stock funds that are actively managed, according to Morningstar, Inc.<BR>
<BR>
Albert Fredman, author of <I>Building Your Mutual Fund Portfolio: A Passport to Low-Risk, High-Return Investing</I>, says WEBS and CountryBaskets are only the beginning.  He expects both open-end and closed-end imitations to pop up in the near future for most foerign markets.  "These things appear to be working well, given their short history," Fredman says.  "I suspect they will grow with increased demand, which will force the creation of new products."<BR>
<BR>
In the meantime, prospectuses for the <A HREF = "http://websontheweb.com/cgi-bin/webs_prospectus.pdf">Morgan Stanley</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.countrybaskets.com/html/prospec.html">Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</A> funds are available on their Web sites.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>AT&T Corp. named John R. Walter as its new president, chief operating officer and heir apparent.</b>  Walter replaces Alex Mandel who left AT&T in August to head a wireless start-up company.  Walter had been the president and chief executive at printer R.R. Donnelley & Sons.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Tetris met Microsoft today, </B>with the former joining the giant's game software group.  Former Soviet Alexey Pajitnov, who invented Tetris during the 1980s now lives in Washington state, will continue to be a co-owner of The Tetris Co.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A five-year-old girl who was killed by an expanding air bag was wearing her seat belt correctly,</B> according to government highway safety investigators.  While at least 28 children have been killed by air bags, this marks the first time the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has found that a child was killed while buckled properly into a seat by an air bag in a low-speed accident.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Conrail received another takeover bid today</B> as Norfolk Southern topped rival CSX Corp.'s prior offer for the freight rail company.  It is estimated that Norfolk Southern's offer would translate to about $100 per share for Conrail's stockholders compared with CSX's offer of $81.51 per share..<BR>

<H3>Wall Street has the pre-election jitters</H3>
Two days, two morning stock plunges, two afternoon recoveries and, finally, a late-afternoon meltdown — all caused by an election still two weeks away.  That was the pattern Wednesday and Thursday, as Wall Street nervousness about the November 5 elections made for schizophrenic stock and bond markets.  The Dow Jones industrial average even closed below the 6,000 barrier Thursday for the first time since breaking into the heady territory more than a week ago.<BR>
<BR>
The cause for concern, analysts say, is Republican challenger Bob Dole's inability to erode President Clinton's wide lead in the polls.  Not that investors think Dole can win, or even care.  Most analysts say the market absorbed the fact months ago that Clinton will win his reelection bid.  But Wall Street also expects Republicans to maintain control of Congress, and now some are worried that Clinton may sweep Democrats back into control on his coattails.<BR>
<BR>
Basically, Wall Street has assumed since spring that more of the same is on the way from Washington — a Democrat in the White House and Republicans in Congress.  With the two parties checking each other, Wall Street counts on the fact that nothing too extreme is likely to emerge from the political arena.  If either party were to take control of both the legislative and executive branches of government, on the other hand, that party's agenda would have to be examined more carefully by investors.  <BR>
<BR>
"The markets are pricing in a Clinton victory and GOP control of Congress," says Steve Leuthold of the Leuthold Asset Allocation mutual fund.  "Wall Street would have to rethink things in light of a Democratic sweep, because you're looking at the potential for a big expansion of the government."<BR>
<BR>
In other words, expect more yo-yo action in the markets between now and November 5 unless Dole stages a late-inning rally.<BR>

<LI><B>The Columbus Day holiday helped keep applications for unemployment benefits low last week,</B> according to Labor Department statistics released Thursday.  The number of new applications for unemployment insurance fell to 320,000 in the week, down from 342,000 a week earlier.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Mortgage lending rates edged lower this week,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said Thursday.  The average rates nationwide for both thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages and fifteen-year adjustable-rate mortgages were 0.2% lower during the week, at 7.85% and 7.37%, respectively.  The introductory rate on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages averaged 5.57%, down from 5.62% the week before.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Honda Motor Company may relocate production of its Accord Wagon from the U.S. to Japan,</B> a spokesman said Thursday.  The switch, which Honda said could take place as early as a year from now, would be the first time a Japanese automaker has changed from overseas production to domestic production on a model.  The vehicle is currently made in Ohio.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A report disputing the glass ceiling effect for women was released this week,</B> based on research by the American Enterprise Institute and Emory University.  The study found that women in the corporate world are promoted to top positions as often as men with "similar characteristics," including educational attainment and number of consecutive years on the job.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The percentage of Americans who own a home rose to a 16-year high during the third quarter,</B> the Census Bureau reported this week.  The bureau found a record 66.3 million families to be homeowners during the quarter, accounting for 65.6% of the U.S. population.<BR>

<H3>Study finds bias against those with ill-fitting genes</H3>
It's old news that scientists can find out through genetic testing whether you're likely to get various illnesses decades from now.  But it may surprise you to find out you could lose insurance coverage, or even your job, because of your genetic makeup.<BR>
<BR>
A study published in Friday's issue of the journal <I>Science </I>found that people with identified genetic disorders report a relatively high rate of discrimination in getting insurance or employment.  Based on research by Georgetown University and the Alliance of Genetic Support Groups, the study said 43% of individuals with genetic disorders reported test-related "problems with health insurance, life insurance and/or employment."<BR>
<BR>
One woman cited in the study was fired from her job the day after she told her boss she was genetically more likely to get Marfan's syndrome, a skeletal disorder.  The termination notice was withdrawn after her lawyers intervened, but such cases can keep people from taking tests that may help them ultimately live longer lives, worries study author E. Virginia Lapham.  "We are going ahead with wonderful research that is terribly important, but we haven't paid much attention to the fiscal, legal and social implications," she says.<BR>
<BR>
The study highlights as a major concern life insurance, which about seven in ten American adults have.  Nationwide, only 3% of life insurance applications are rejected, yet 25% of applicants in the <I>Science </I>study say they were rejected after submitting to genetic testing.<BR>
<BR>
Such numbers should probably be taken with a grain of salt.  The survey was conducted on 332 respondents who are members of genetic support groups, those most likely to have encountered problems.  Rather than dispute the statistics, though, some in the insurance industry defend the practice of basing coverage on genetic conditions.  David Lack, executive director of the Council for Affordable Health Insurance, says allowing insurers to evaluate candidates based on medical history, age and genetic makeup will keep premiums affordable for healthy people.<BR>
<BR>
The complete study is available on the <A HREF = "http://www.sciencemag.org/science/scripts/display/full/274/5287/621.html"><I>Science </I>Web site</A>.<BR>

<LI><B>The Benham Group and Twentieth Century Mutual Funds formally merged their names Friday,</B> announcing that the combined company will now be known as American Century Investments.  While new funds will carry the American Century name, most existing Benham and Twentieth Century funds won't change.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Factory orders for expensive durable goods jumped 4.6% higher in September,</B> the Commerce Department said Friday.  The uptick marked the sharpest increase in nearly four years, raising questions on Wall Street about whether the economy is slowing down as widely speculated.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the safety of air bags in several General Motors cars,</B> the government agency confirmed this week.  Because rapidly deploying air bags can injure or kill small children, NHTSA recommends that all children under the age of 12 ride in the back seats of cars equipped with passenger-side air bags.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Medigap insurance premiums jumped 20-40% in most areas this year,</B> consumer group Families USA said this week.  Approximately three-quarters of senior citizens have a Medigap policy to cover health-related conditions that Medicare won't.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Existing home sales dropped 2.9% in September,</B> the National Association of Realtors reported Friday.  NAR president Art Godi said fewer people were buying during the month because of rising interest rates.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>Get ready: The next generation of computers are on the way</H3>
There are about 35 million Americans with Internet access, and about 17 or 18 million of them go online regularly.  That's not bad, considering the short amount of time the 'Net has been widely accessible.  But it's not good, either, if you ask the companies trying to make a living online.  What the statistics don't say is that there are still some 230 million Americans who aren't plugged in and who aren't necessarily interested in getting plugged in.<BR>
<BR>
One way to reach those people, analysts agree, is to make the Internet a more user-friendly and more affordable place for the masses to congregate.  Two announcements Monday went a long way toward that end, moving so-called "network computers" a step closer to the shelves at your neighborhood computer store.<BR>
<BR>
First, software giant Microsoft announced new standards for network computers, with the backing of computer makers such as Hewlett-Packard, Compaq and Dell, as well as chip maker Intel.  The new hardware, which should be available within the next several months, won't include disk drives. Instead, it will download software from the Internet and from computer networks.  The primary advantage: A Microsoft NetPC will retail for $300 to $500 instead of the $2,000 to $3,000 price tag that is common for personal computers today.<BR>
<BR>
Also Monday, Oracle Corporation and Netscape Communications said they were teaming up to offer their own version of the network computer, as well as joint software products.  Oracle is the world's second-largest software manufacturer, behind Microsoft, and Netscape controls 75% of the Internet browser market (with Microsoft's Internet Explorer as its primary rival).<BR>
<BR>
Another announcement is expected Tuesday, when Sun Microsystems will unveil its own network computer.  Aimed at business users, Sun's stripped-down computer reportedly is the size of a normal sheet of paper, weighs four pounds and has no hard drive or disk drive.<BR>
<BR>
With competition starting to heat up, though, network computers won't be the only Internet evolution to come along in the months ahead.  Analysts we talked to said that monitors with the option of displaying half Internet and half television will be available later this fall in the $100 price range.  And "Web TVs," that allow you to surf the Internet with a remote control instead of a keyboard, should hit the shelves at about $300.<BR>

<LI><B>The average price for a gallon of gasoline rose from $1.27 to $1.28 over the past two weeks, </B>according to a nationwide Lundberg Survey.  Prices at self-service pumps averaged $1.23 for regular, $1.33 for mid-grade and $1.41 for premium as of Friday's polling — about 34 cents per gallon less than at comparable full-service pumps.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The amount of money invested in American mutual funds increased 3.1% in September, </B>the Investment Company Institute said Monday.  Stock fund assets rose by more than $90 billion, or 5.9%, and bond and fixed-income funds gained 2.3%.  Money market funds, meanwhile, lost 1.2% during the month.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The United Auto Workers decided not to walk off the job at General Motors factories Monday despite the passage of a strike deadline, </B>giving negotiators another chance to mend fences Tuesday.  Neither side revealed what issues are holding up a work agreement.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>Edgy markets rally on wage, consumer-confidence data</H3>
Investors have been skittish for days now, uneasy about a spate of economic statistics scheduled for release later this week and downright fearful of next week's elections (see <A HREF = "dn1024.html">"Wall Street has pre-election jitters"</A> from Thursday).  Bond traders evidently tired of the waiting game on Tuesday, though, pulling the financial markets back into positive territory on the strength of faltering consumer confidence and slowing wage growth.<BR>
<BR>
In the first big announcement of the day, the Conference Board said its monthly index of consumer confidence fell to 106.2 in October, down more than 5% from September.  At about the same time, the Labor Department reported that its employment cost index only registered a 0.6% uptick during the third quarter, down from 0.8% in the second quarter and slower than expected by Wall Street.  <BR>
<BR>
Bond traders took the combined reports as evidence the economy is applying the brakes on its own, which would allow the Federal Reserve Board to remain on the sidelines with its interest rate policy.  In response, the 30-year Treasury bond, which has many consumer and business borrowing rates tied to it, jumped to its highest point since early August.  Yield to maturity on the bonds, which moves in the opposite direction of price, fell to 6.68% Tuesday after closing at 6.83% Monday.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The world's largest proprietary online service announced plans Tuesday to offer several new pricing options,</B> responding to competition from hundreds of small, regional Internet providers.  Virginia-based America Online said it will offer unlimited Internet access for $19.95 per month, with discounts for users who sign long-term contracts.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Former copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka admitted forging documents empowering himself to engage in unauthorized trading,</B> his lawyer said Tuesday outside the Tokyo prosecutors' office.  Sumitomo Corporation's resulting $2.6 billion trading loss is said to be the largest loss ever recorded in the world's financial markets.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Dutch farm-equipment maker New Holland appointed Lloyd Bentsen as chairman of the board Tuesday.</B>  Bentsen is a former U.S. senator, vice presidential candidate and presidential cabinet member.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The cost of traveling dropped 1.6% in September,</B> the Travel Industry Association of America announced this week.  Responding to the end of the summer travel season, hotel prices pulled the index lower, dropping nearly 6% during the month.  Year to date, though, TIAA's Travel Price Index has outpaced inflation 3.4% to 2.8%.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>Retailers are dreaming of a green Christmas</H3>
Normally, the presidents of large trade associations are a fairly serious lot, but Tracy Mullin couldn't help herself Wednesday.  In fact, the chief of the National Retail Federation was almost giddy as she released the association's eighth-annual holiday-spending forecast.<BR>
<BR>
"It isn't often that economic factors are this positive for both retailers and consumers," she said.  "It's as if everything came together in some great cosmic alignment."<BR>
<BR>
In other words, Mullin expects the traditional holiday shopping season between Thanksgiving and Christmas to be a good one this year, probably the best since 1992.  Accounting firm Deloitte & Touche conducted the survey for NRF, polling 1,000 consumers and 500 stores nationwide.  Reversing three years of consumer pessimism and mediocre holiday spending, it found shoppers planning to spend 12% more on gifts this year than in 1995 — an average of $764, up from $685 a year ago.<BR>
<BR>
NRF chief economist Rosalind Wells said the optimism is based on the fact that 86% of the consumers questioned feel secure about their jobs, which leads them to spend more freely.  Wells also noted that more consumers think the economy is improving right now than at any time over the past four years.<BR>
<BR>
Burned a year ago by the government shutdown, a pre-Christmas blizzard on the East Coast and lower consumer confidence, store owners and managers were more cautious than their customers in the NRF poll.  Overall, retailers projected a sales increase of 5% over 1995 figures.<BR>
<BR>
"Retailers have learned that reality usually is not as good in strong years or as bad in weak ones as experts predict in these kind of studies," says Richard Feinberg, director of the Purdue Retail Institute at Purdue University.  "From what I've seen in Indiana, though, I'd guess that you will see a holiday surge this year — somewhere between 5% and 10% better than a year ago."<BR>
<BR>
That's holiday music to the ears of the nation's retail stores, which count the month between Thanksgiving and Christmas as make-or-break time each year.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The nation's gross domestic product grew in the third quarter at less than half the rate of the second quarter,</B> the Commerce Department announced Wednesday.  Commerce's initial GDP estimate, which will probably be revised in the months ahead, pegged economic growth in the third quarter at 2.2%, down from the second quarter's 4.7%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Despite a "tight" labor market,  inflation remains in check,</B> according to the Federal Reserve Board's latest survey of economic conditions at its 12 regional banks.  The national summary, known as the Beige Book, is based on interviews with officials at the regional banks between mid-September and October 22.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A Web-site change Wednesday made it easier for consumers to locate fee-only financial planners,</B> those who charge a flat price instead of accepting sales commissions.  The National Association of Personal Financial Advisors will send you a free list of such planners if you fill out a questionnaire at the new <A HREF = "http://www.napfa.org/planner.htm">"Find a Fee-Only Planner Near You"</A> section of its Web site.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Sales of new homes edged lower in September,</B>  the Commerce Department announced Wednesday.  Sales slipped 0.5% during the month to an annualized rate of 816,000, slightly below August's 820,000.  It was still the second-highest level reported in more than a decade, though.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Safeway offered to buy out competitor Vons Companies on Wednesday,</B> in a merger that would create the second-largest supermarket chain in the country.  Safeway already operates more than 1,000 grocery stores in 16 states, the District of Columbia and five Canadian provinces.  Vons operates 325 stores in California under the Vons and Pavilions names.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The United Auto Workers moved to increase the pressure on General Motors late Tuesday,</B> sending workers off the job in Indianapolis and Janesville, Wis.  The UAW and GM are negotiating a new labor agreement.<BR>

<H3>Auto group names 10 scariest commutes</H3>
Halloween is supposed to be a day to focus on the dark side of life.  But for millions of workers in America's cities, <I>every </I>day might as well be Halloween — marked by hours of commuting to and from work in congested traffic.  <BR>
<BR>
"Even the thought of driving to work scares me," 25-year-old Coast Guard officer Matt Paz says of commuting over Washington, DC's Woodrow Wilson Bridge.  "I ended up paying more to get an apartment near a subway station, just so I wouldn't have to deal with that mess every day."<BR>
<BR>
Not everybody has that option, though, which means they have to deal with the mess.  "Motorists are battling the bottleneck blues out there," says James Kolstad of the American Automobile Association.  "They are feeling the stress caused every day by slow-moving traffic and ever-longer commutes."<BR>
<BR>
Thursday, AAA released a list of 10 of the worst commuting bottlenecks in the country (which includes the Woodrow Wilson Bridge).  The nation's highways are more or less unchanged from a decade ago, Kolstad says, while at least 13 million new vehicles have taken to the roads in that time.  Consequently, AAA's list includes areas from Los Angeles to Boston where the volume of traffic has simply outpaced the road's ability to cope.<BR>
<BR>
"A highway system is only as efficient as its most congested point," Kolstad says.  "Road sections that have not been upgraded to handle current capacity cause miles of vehicle backup and thousands of hours of lost productivity."<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Kids probably aren't the only ones wolfing down sugar-coated treats this Halloween.</B>  According to the trade group American Sugar Alliance, the average person in the U.S. ingested 65 pounds of sugar in 1995.  If you include sweeteners such as dextrose and high-fructose corn syrup, the per-capita total jumps to 148 pounds.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Help-wanted advertising increased in September at 44 of the 51 largest newspapers in the country,</B> the Conference Board reported Thursday.  That signals a tight labor market that is likely to remain as-is into 1997, says the group's chief economist, Ken Goldstein.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Consumer spending rose slowly despite higher incomes in September,</B> the Commerce Department said Thursday.  While income from wages, salaries and other sources climbed 0.6% during the month, consumer spending edged up only 0.1% to $5.18 trillion.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The average interest rate charged on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages fell from 7.86% to 7.78% this week,</B> the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said Thursday.  Fifteen-year mortgages averaged 7.30% during the week, down 0.07% from a week ago, and the initial rate charged on one-year adjustable rate mortgages rose from 5.57% to 5.60%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits rose last week,</B> the Labor Department reported Thursday.  Labor said 342,000 people filed first-time claims for unemployment insurance during the week, up from 319,000 the week before.<BR>

<H3>"Notorious Traffic Bottlenecks," courtesy of the American Automobile Association</H3>
<B>Boston, Mass., Interstate 93 north and south</B><BR>
<LI> Boston's central artery cuts an elevated pass through downtown.  It was built in the 1950s to carry 90,000 cars daily, but now overflows with 190,000 cars each day.  There are now between six and eight hours of stop-and-go traffic each day.  Without improvements, the traffic jams will stretch to 14-16 hours daily by 2010.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Chicago, Ill., I-88/Eisenhower Expressway</B><BR>
<LI> Traffic from the western suburbs comes to a halt as 34,000 vehicles per day from I-88 merge with 43,000 vehicles per day from the Eisenhower Expressway (I-290).  The road goes down to a single lane for 1.5 blocks before opening up to multiple lanes.  What should be a 20-minute trip now takes 1.5 hours.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dallas, Texas, I-35/I-30</B><BR>
<LI> Known as "The Mix Master" by locals, these two major highways merge and struggle to carry more than 200,000 vehicles per day from downtown through the steep inclines and declines of "The Canyon."<BR>
<BR>
<B>Houston, Texas, U.S. 59 at the 610 Loop</B><BR>
<LI> Only one lane exits U.S. 59 to the 610 Loop, causing significant delays in all directions at this intersection that handles more than 330,000 vehicles each day.  Stop-and-go conditions occur for five to six hours a day here.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Los Angeles, Calif., I-5 at the intersection with I-10, State Road 60 and State Road 101</B><BR>
<LI> An estimated 566,000 vehicles per day travel through this intersection, overwhelming the capacity of this major commuter highway.  Motorists making lane changes as they approach the intersection create a traffic bottleneck that extends for miles.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Milwaukee, Wis., I-94 (East-West Freeway, Milwaukee County)</B><BR>
<LI> This is Wisconsin's oldest and busiest stretch of interstate highway.  It was designed in the 1950s and built in the 1960s to outmoded design standards.  Stretches of the road that were designed to handle 80,000 vehicles per day now are clogged with twice that volume.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Minneapolis, Minn., Northbound I-35W at Minnehaha Creek (South Minneapolis)</B><BR>
<LI> Only three lanes are available on this major route into downtown for a daily flow of 100,000 vehicles.<BR>
<BR>
<B>New Orleans, La., I-10 and I-610 in both directions</B><BR>
<LI> Lanes are reduced from three to two at this interchange.  Traffic backs up even when conditions are clear and visibility is restricted as drivers move from an elevated interchange to a surface-level roadway.  This stretch of road handles about 174,000 vehicles per day.<BR>
<BR>
<B>New York, NY, Gowanis Expressway (Brooklyn)</B><BR>
<LI> The Gowanis Expressway (I-278) is a major route connecting Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and Long Island.  The primary congestion point is a 3.8-mile segment between the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel and the Belt Parkway that carries 175,000 vehicles a day.  Significant delays occur in this area for more than six hours a day.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Washington, DC, Woodrow Wilson Bridge</B><BR>
<LI> This six-lane bridge is fed by the eight-lane Capital Beltway (I-95 and I-495) and has a two- to three-mile backup every rush hour.  170,000 vehicles cross the span each day.  Additionally, the bridge — the only federally owned bridge in the nation — is deteriorating and is in urgent need of replacement.  A new bridge is scheduled for completion in eight years.<BR>

<B>Our selection of consumer, business and financial news<BR>
that matters to you, your money and your career.</B><BR>
<BR>
by <A HREF = "mailto:snelson@kiplinger.com">Scott Bernard Nelson</A> <BR>
<BR>
<I>Last Updated: Friday, November 1, 5:37 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Brokerage bargains for the do-it-yourself investor</H3>
Almost as soon as the World Wide Web hit the mainstream, brokerage houses started popping up with offers of cheap online trading.  And customers have taken notice: The number of online trading accounts has more than doubled in the past 18 months, and some experts think that trend will accelerate through the rest of the decade.<BR>
<BR>
It was with some interest, then, that we read an e-mail message this week from a reader worried about getting gouged through online stock trades.  Since cyber-brokers don't have to pay the overhead costs of a traditional brokerage, the writer theorized, "online trading should cost a fraction of what a discount broker could offer.  However . . . in many cases, investors end up paying commissions in excess of what a discount broker would charge and often even [more than] what a full-service broker would charge."<BR>
<BR>
Our interest piqued, we decided to compare online-trading commissions with those deep-discount houses charge for traditional trades.  <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I> recently surveyed the deep discounters, so information on traditional brokers' fee structures was readily available.  The cyber-commissions took a little more work.<BR>
<BR>
Under "online trading," the <A HREF = "http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo search engine</A> pulled up 21 brokerages that claim to buy and sell securities online.  After discarding the ones that specialize in overseas markets, we pared the list down to the 10 cheapest (as the magazine had done for traditional deep discounters) and compared numbers.  <BR>
<BR>
On average, the 10 frugal online brokerages were a little cheaper than the comparable traditionals, as it turned out.  To buy 50 shares of a stock trading at $30 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, for example, the traditional deep discounters charge an average of $28.30 in commissions.  The cyber-brokers, on the other hand, average $22.50 in fees.<BR>
<BR>
But the point of the reader's email is well-taken, nonetheless.  As they do in the non-Internet world, online full-service brokers charge more for their services than discounters.  Fidelity Investments, for example, didn't qualify for the list of 10 least-expensive online brokers because it charges $55 to buy the 50 shares in the above example.<BR>
<BR>
In other words, just because a broker is online doesn't make it cheap — so shop around.  A good place to start might be our <A HREF = "dn11012.html">list of online and off-line deep discounters</A>.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Workers feel less secure about making 401(k) investment decisions than they did two years ago,</B> according to a survey released this week by Merrill Lynch.  Only 50% of those questioned feel "knowledgeable," down from 67% in a 1994 survey.  Surprisingly, the results might be a product of better education programs, say the study's authors.  "As you begin to gain knowledge about some things, you realize how little you know," says Merrill Lynch's John Steffens.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Nasdaq put a temporary stop to trades involving MCI Communications shares on Friday,</B> after the telecommunications firm confirmed that it is in merger talks with British Telecommunications.  "MCI anticipates that its deliberations [with BT] will be concluded this weekend and an announcement will be made prior to Monday morning," MCI said in a statement Friday afternoon.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The national unemployment rate held steady at 5.2% in October,</B> the Labor Department said Friday.  In the last major economic announcement before Tuesday's elections, Labor reported that the overall jobless rate remained near a seven-year low in September and October.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Index of Leading Economic Indicators went up for the eighth consecutive month in September,</B> the Conference Board announced Friday.  Designed to forecast economic trends six to nine months ahead of time, the index gained 0.1% in September — the smallest of the eight most-recent gains.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Jeffrey Vinik jumped back into the money-management saddle Friday,</B> announcing the formation of an $800 million hedge fund at his new company, Vinik Asset Management.  From early 1992 until early 1996, Vinik managed $50 billion Fidelity Magellan, the world's largest mutual fund.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Tax-filers with adjusted gross incomes higher than $185,715 were among the top 1% of earners in 1993,</B> the Internal Revenue Service reported this week.  That's up from $181,904 in 1992.  At that pace, which is a conservative estimate given recent income gains, the top 1% of earners will report $197,634 in adjusted gross income this year.<BR>

<B>Our selection of consumer, business and financial news<BR>
that matters to you, your money and your career.</B><BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<I>Last Updated: Monday, November 4, 4:56 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Wall Street anticipates more of the same from voters</H3>
On the eve of Tuesday's presidential and congressional elections, Wall Street seemed confident that no radical changes are on the horizon.  The financial markets have assumed for months that the Democrats would keep control of the White House and Republicans would hold onto Congress, meaning neither party would have enough power to push its agenda without facing plenty of checks and balances.  <BR>
<BR>
"To a fair degree, everybody seems to be expecting the status quo," says Steve Leuthold of the Leuthold Asset Allocation mutual fund.  "In a larger sense, though, it doesn't really matter who wins what — as long as we have a balance of power between one side and the other."<BR>
<BR>
Most analysts agree that the chances are slim that either party will be able to upset that balance of power Tuesday, which explains Wall Street's laid-back approach.  But there is still one plausible outcome that would almost certainly roil the markets: a tie or a near-tie in the House of Representatives.  The one thing that upsets the market more than anything else is uncertainty, and the lack of a clear controlling party in congress could lead to a wildly unpredictable Capitol Hill.<BR>
<BR>
In a front page story last week, Capitol Hill newspaper <I>Roll Call</I> termed such an outcome "the spookiest scenario."  If the two major parties end up within a few seats of each other, the paper predicted, a few moderates in each faction will control the balance of power.  They might well choose to dump the two House leaders, Republican Newt Gingrich and Democrat Richard Gephardt, or they might bargain with party leaders to switch allegiances in exchange for committee chairs or other benefits.  These are outcomes not anticipated by Wall Street, so the stock and bond markets would likely get highly volatile until the situation worked itself out.<BR>
<BR>
In other words, if 217 Democrats, 217 Republicans and one independent are elected Tuesday night — or something close to it — hold on for a possible roller coaster ride in the markets for a couple of weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Remember, though, that this type of conjecture shouldn't matter to investors.  Over time, a buy-and-hold strategy will outdo a market-timing strategy.  So, while you're sitting back in your armchair watching the returns roll in Tuesday night, relax with the thought that equities have historically returned about 10% a year regardless of short-term fluctuations.  Your portfolio can be expected to do roughly the same thing, regardless of who wins the sixth-district House seat in Ohio.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>President Clinton will be reelected, but Republicans will hold their ground in the House and increase their majority in the Senate,</B> according to futures prices in the <A HREF = "http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/iem/">Iowa Electronic Markets</A>.  Investors collect $1 after the election for each winning futures contract they hold.  As of Monday afternoon, Clinton futures sold for 92.4 cents apiece and Dole futures sold for 6.7 cents apiece.  In the Congressional races, contracts predicting continued Republican control were selling for higher prices than Democratic futures.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>MCI and its phone-company rivals painted different pictures Monday of the company's $20.8 billion weekend merger with British Telecom.</B>  Competitor AT&T predicted the merger will reduce competition and send rates up; MCI and BT, on the other hand, said the merger will create a global telecommunications battle that will force phone prices lower.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Carl Icahn on Monday kicked off a second attempt to unseat the board of directors at RJR Nabisco,</B> hoping to force the company to separate its food business from its tobacco products.  Icahn, who owns 7.3% of the firm's outstanding stock, supported a similar effort that failed earlier this year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Britain's Invesco mutual-fund family announced Monday it is taking over the Houston-based AIM funds.</B>  The $1.6 billion stock and cash buyout would be the largest takeover of an American fund company by an overseas firm on record.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Spending on new construction projects rose at its fastest rate in six months during September,</B> according to government reports released Monday.  Analysts attributed the 1.9% gain to public-sector projects, noting that construction spending for single-family houses went down during the month.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>General Motors employees went back to work Monday following a five-day strike at two Midwest plants.</B>  Labor negotiators reached an agreement Saturday night, but the contract still has to be approved by rank-and-file union members this week.<BR>

<BR>
<I>Last Updated: Tuesday, November 5, 5:05 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>In election's wake, investors ponder the future</H3>
At campaign time, presidential candidates love to lay claim to economic upswings — or lay blame for downswings.  But what about after the election?  One non-partisan truth holds true: Eight of the nine economic recessions since World War II have come on the heels of a presidential election, regardless of which party earned the office.  In the stock market, nine of the eleven bear markets over the same time period started their downward spiral within 15 months of election day.  <BR>
<BR>
Many analysts find those statistics especially troubling this year, since there are strong signals that economic growth is headed south regardless of who controls the government.  The worriers point out that both a recession and a short-term downdraft on Wall Street are inevitable after six years of nothing but good times — it's just a question of when.<BR>
<BR>
When, indeed.  According to the market forecasters at <I>The Kiplinger Washington Letter</I>, it will be at least a year before the sky is likely to fall on the Chicken Littles of the world.  <BR>
<BR>
On October 4, the letter painted a rosy picture of the months ahead: <BR>
<BR>
	"<U>The stock market will stay on an upward course the rest of '96.</U>  Even allowing for a few bumps, the Dow will probably finish over 6,000.  <BR>
	<U>Good third-quarter earnings</U> will help support further increases.  As long as the Fed doesn't tighten [interest rates], most stocks will continue to do well.<BR>
	<U>The market is still the place to be</U> for long-haul investors."<BR>
<BR>
The letter addressed next year's prospects on October 25:<BR>
<BR>
	"<U>Stock market:</U>  Start with fundamentals of the economic outlook . . . slow-growing economy in '97, inflation around 3%, stable interest rates.  Corporate earnings won't rise as much, but most firms will do all right.  Thus, solid companies, large and small, will have another healthy year.  Those enjoying decent growth this year will probably do the same in '97."<BR>
<BR>
In other words, yes, a recession and market correction are inevitable.  But things still look relatively good for the near future, and you shouldn't change your long-term investment outlook.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Stocks jumped higher Tuesday and interest rates hit a seven-month low,</B> with Wall Street increasingly confident that neither major political party would gain a free hand in the elections.  Investors hope a moderate government will keep government spending and inflation under wraps.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Old rivals Apple and IBM announced plans to work together on Tuesday.</B>  The two companies said they are combining forces to produce a smaller and lighter version of the laptop computer for the Japanese market.  Apple chief executive Gilbert Amelio said the new computer will be introduced next year, and will be released in other markets if it is successful.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Russian stocks rallied after president Boris Yeltsin underwent successful heart surgery Tuesday. </B> The Moscow Times Index finished the day 1.36 points higher at 327.92 after Yeltsin's surgeons reported "complete success" in the seven-hour operation.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>America Online can block direct marketing firms from sending junk e-mail to its customers,</B> a federal judge in Philadelphia ruled this week.  U.S. District Judge Charles Weiner said mass mailers have "no right under the First Amendment" to force AOL to allow unsolicited advertisements to reach its customers.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Nasdaq delisted Canadian firm Cam-Net Communications on Tuesday</B> "in order to protect . . . public confidence" in the market, according to a Nasdaq statement.  Cam-Net's chief executive resigned last month after being charged with stock fraud in the Federal District Court in Brooklyn, NY.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Yields on three-month Treasury notes fell to their lowest point since February</B> in Tuesday's auction.  The average yield was 5.879%, down from 6.118% at the last quarterly auction in August.<BR>

<I>Last Updated: Wednesday, November 6, 4:30 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Post-election party sweeps through Wall Street</H3>
As expected, elation on Wall Street over the election returns sent stocks higher Wednesday.  Everybody got in on the fun, with the major stock markets and indexes all posting robust gains on the day.   Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index finished in record territory.<BR>
<BR>
The post-election fun was especially sweet for computer firms, thanks to the defeat of a California ballot measure that would have lowered the legal hurdles needed for shareholders to sue companies on the grounds of securities fraud.  Silicon Valley companies spent more than $30 million fighting the proposal, arguing that they already face an avalanche of "frivolous lawsuits" whenever their stock prices drop a few points.  Companies such as Compaq Computer, Dell and IBM all surged higher Wednesday.<BR>
<BR>
Drug stocks also outperformed the markets during the day as investors shed concerns that a Democratic congress might try to overhaul the health-care system.  <BR>
<BR>
Overall, though, analysts said investors should concentrate on long-term issues rather than reading too much into Wednesday's run-up.  <BR>
<BR>
"You should never base your investment strategy on what happens in a single day," says Don Hays of Wheat First Butcher Singer in Richmond, Va.  "Still, I think what the market is saying is that it expects the president and congress to be conciliatory and work well together over the next four years — and that <I>is</I> good news."<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor told President Clinton that he doesn't want to remain in the cabinet during a second administration,</B> television network CNN reported Wednesday afternoon.  Kantor, 57, replaced the late Ron Brown at Commerce earlier this year after serving as the nation's top trade negotiator.  Before Wednesday's announcement, Kantor had been mentioned as a possible candidate for attorney general during Clinton's second administration.  One day after Clinton's reelection, rumors also swirled in Washington about the impending departures of Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary William Perry and Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>As many as 126 women may join a class-action sexual harassment lawsuit against brokerage house Smith Barney,</B> according to published reports Wednesday.  Coordinated suits filed in California and New York within the past two weeks allege that women were "systematically excluded from lucrative broker jobs amid a male-dominated fraternity-house atmosphere."  The New York Stock Exchange and the National Association of Securities Dealers were named as co-defendants because of their arbitration records in related cases.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Nynex shareholders overwhelmingly approved a merger with Bell Atlantic,</B> the regional phone company's chief financial officer said Wednesday.  More than 96% of shareholders voted to approve the combination, Frederic Salerno said.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>New York City can't carry the Fox News Channel on city-controlled public-access channels,</B> a federal judge ruled Wednesday.  U.S. District Judge Denise Cote's ruling represents a victory for Time Warner, which is attempting to keep competitors of its CNN news channel out of one of the nation's largest television markets.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The plot thickened at RJR Nabisco on Wednesday,</B> as shareholder Bennett LeBow proposed a new board of directors for the company.  LeBow's actions give shareholders a third board to choose from at their annual gathering in April: the current directors, LeBow's group or an alternative proposed by shareholder Carl Icahn.  LeBow owns 1.3% of the RJR Nabisco and Icahn owns 7.3%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Berger mutual funds kicks off a joint-venture with the Bank of Ireland Asset Management on Thursday,</B> opening the Berger/BIAM International fund to the public.  The no-load fund had previously been managed by BIAM, returning 11.8% over the past 12 months and an annualized 13.9% over the past five years.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Southwest Airlines again ranked highest in on-time performance in September,</B> the Department of Transportation reported this week.  More than 83% of Southwest's flights arrived on time during the month.  Northwest, USAir, Continental and Delta rounded out the top five carriers in the monthly ranking.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Heating oil prices fell in recent weeks despite the onset of winter cold,</B> according to statistics released late Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute.  API said refiners have been producing heating oil in near-record amounts lately, which should keep prices lower through the winter months.<BR>

<I>Last Updated: Thursday, November 7, 4:53 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>The future looks bright for class of '97 grads</H3>
Much has been made in recent months of the fact that college graduates are taking on more student loans than ever before.  During his re-election campaign, for example, President Clinton fretted that students are forced to "leverage their future" to keep up with tuition and expenses that are growing faster than incomes.  <BR>
<BR>
While that may be true, college seniors should find some solace in a new study released Thursday.  According to nationwide polling by the National Association of Colleges and Employers, members of the class of '97 are likely to find more — and better-paying — jobs awaiting them on graduation day.<BR>
<BR>
"Businesses are expanding and they need to bring in new talent to stay competitive," says NACE spokeswoman Dawn Traub.  "The market for new grads is improving as a result, which is a trend we expect to continue."<BR>
<BR>
According to the survey, employers plan to hire 17% more new graduates next year than they did this year.  Entry-level salaries are also expected to increase an average of 3.9% for new graduates.  <BR>
<BR>
To land those jobs at those salaries, though, graduates still have to compete with an ever-growing field of college-educated candidates.  In the NACE survey, employers said the four most important characteristics they look for in candidates, in order, are: oral communication skills; the ability to work well with others; technical skills (i.e. computers and software); and work or internship experience.<BR>
<BR>
You can get more information, search help-wanted listings or add your name to the position's wanted listing at the <A HREF = "http://www.jobweb.org/careers.htm">NACE Web site</A>.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Blue-chip stocks recovered from early-session profit taking to close in record territory again Thursday.</B>  Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index closed at all-time highs for the second consecutive session.  The technology-heavy Nasdaq index didn't fare poorly, either, closing 3.96 points shy of the high-water mark it set October 15.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A mass-mailing firm filed suit for the second time against America Online on Thursday,</B> arguing that AOL's policy of blocking "junk mailings" to its seven million customers amounts to unfair competition.  The action comes two days after a federal judge rejected Cyber Promotions Incorporated's attempt to block the AOL policy on free-speech grounds.  AOL, CompuServe and Prodigy all have policies forbidding junk e-mailings.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Workplace productivity inched higher during the summer after recording strong growth earlier in the year,</B> according to Labor Department statistics released Thursday.  Non-farm productivity rose at an annualized 0.2% rate during the July-September period, following 0.5% and 1.7% growth in the previous quarters.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Bill Gates' net worth eclipsed $20 billion Wednesday,</B> after Microsoft stock rose $3 to $144.50 during the day.  Gates, who owns 24% of Microsoft, was named the richest man in America by Forbes magazine last month.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of Americans filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell 3.2% last week,</B> the Labor Department reported Thursday.  Labor said 331,000 people applied for unemployment insurance during the week, down from 342,000 the week of October 28.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>H. Wayne Huizenga's firm, Republic Industries, made a $625 million all-stock bid for Alamo Rent-A-Car on Thursday,</B> a company spokesman says.  Previously a waste-management company, Republic has been on a buying spree since Huizenga acquired it in 1995.<BR>

<BR>
<I>Last Updated: Friday, November 8, 4:49 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>If it sounds too good to be true . . .</H3>
An unidentified source, the online newsletter <A HREF = "http://sgagoldstar.com/sga/">SGA Goldstar</A> announced May 29, "informed us of a rumored Federal Government order so large [that] we do not even want to rumor the size of the order."  SGA editors Ted Melcher Jr. and Shannon Terry were recommending that readers buy shares of little-known video teleconferencing firm Systems of Excellence before Wall Street caught wind of the big sale.  Get in on the ground floor of this great new company, in other words, and get rich quick.<BR>
<BR>
As it turned out, the only people that got rich were the newsletter editors and Systems of Excellence's chairman.  A federal judge froze the assets of all three this week at the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  According to the SEC complaint, chairman Charles Huttoe gave Melcher and Terry 300,000 shares of SE stock in exchange for promoting the firm.  Once the share price reached $4.75 in early June, all three cashed out and left SGA's readers to suffer through the stock's subsequent 90% loss.  <BR>
<BR>
The newsletter's coverage, according to SEC statements, was "highly promotional, strongly urging accumulation of the stock, discouraging sales and even discouraging investors from independently verifying SGA's information."<BR>
<BR>
The case marks the first time federal regulators have filed suit to stop online securities manipulation, but it won't be the last.  In many ways, the Internet has replaced cocktail parties and health clubs as the place to pick up hot stock tips.  Problem is, you don't always have a good idea of who's whispering in your ear on the Internet.  It could be a company chief executive, a 13-year-old hacker in Minnesota or a broker with an interest in unloading a few shares.<BR>
<BR>
The situation is especially troubling in online chat rooms and financial bulletin boards, says San Francisco financial planner Dave Hammonds.  "The biggest caveat to getting investment information online is that, in many cases, you have no way of verifying the reliability of what people say," he says.  "They could be making this stuff up or exaggerating dramatically — you just don't know."<BR>
<BR>
But the Web can also be a fabulous source of information.  You can download copies of companies' annual reports, for example, or trade investing advice with people all over the world.  The best way to separate the good information from the bad is the same online as it is off-line, says SEC investigator Richard Jacobson.  "If something doesn't make sense, you should be careful," Jacobson says.  "A lot of these schemes we've seen promise unreasonably high rates of return with little or no risk — the kind of offering that's literally too good to be true."  <BR>
<BR>
In other words, approach <I>all</I> stock tips — from an online source or from somebody in the barber shop down the street — with a healthy dose of skepticism.  For more information about online investment tips, read the <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I> piece, <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/nov96/wildbox.html">"Safe Surfing: Don't Trust, Verify."</A>  <BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index set records for the third day in a row on Friday,</B> and Nasdaq inched closer to an all-time high.  Nasdaq recorded its record high on October 15, closing at 1258.10; Friday, it closed 0.6 points short of that mark.  The indexes all had to overcome early-session profit taking with late-afternoon rallies.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The distilled spirits industry's decision to lift its 48-year self-imposed ban on TV and radio advertising could have a major impact on the magazine world,</B> media analysts said this week.  The decision pits TV and radio stations squarely against magazine publishers in the race for liquor ads, which have traditionally been the exclusive domain of magazines.  A spokeswoman at the Magazine Publishers of America declined Friday to speculate about how much the new competition could cost its members, but she did say liquor companies spend $230 million a year in magazine advertising — 1.5% of the industry's total ad revenue.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The September inventory of goods on store shelves dropped at the sharpest rate since Ronald Reagan's first administration,</B> the Commerce Department reported Friday.  Overall inventories fell 1.3% from August's figures as retail sales strengthened, Commerce said.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Already strong retail sales are expected to beef up even more for the holidays,</B> according to a pair of surveys released this week.  The Salomon Brothers retail index rose 4.8% in October, up from 0.4% during the same time a year ago, and a new Gallup poll found consumers expecting to spend 23% more this year than last.  For more information, read our recent article, <A HREF = "dn1030.html">"Retailers are dreaming of a green Christmas."</A><BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>More homeowners are refinancing their loans as mortgage rates drop,</B> according to a survey released by the Mortgage Bankers Association this week.  The group found that 26.4% of all loan applications were for refinancing last week, up from about 15% during the summer months.  Over the same period of time, the average rate charged for 30-year mortgages has fallen from a high of 8.57% to 7.92%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Bell Atlantic shareholders overwhelmingly approved the regional phone company's merger with Nynex,</B> according to a Bell Atlantic statement released Friday.  In a recent proxy vote, more than 97% of shareholders cast ballots supporting the merger.  Nynex also announced this week that shareholders approved the deal.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Consumers broke a three-year trend and paid off more debt than they accumulated in September,</B> the Federal Reserve Board said Thursday.  As a result, consumer installment debt fell at an annualized 2.7% pace during the month.<BR>

<H3> IRS commissioner lashes out at critics </H3>
The tax system was a popular punching bag for candidates during the congressional and presidential election this year, and IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson is none too happy about it.  Speaking to a group of business editors in Chicago over the weekend, Richardson denounced the candidate-critics as short-sighted.<BR>
<BR>
"Politicians like to complain about the present system without suggesting much in its place," she said.  "Once you start looking at the details, many systems that people batted around during the campaigns would just add complexity to the what we have now—the opposite of what they intended."<BR>
<BR>
Richardson came before the group to outline IRS's changes for the 1997 tax-filing season.  Major revisions include an expansion of the telephone-filing plan for 1040EZ taxpayers and a simplified procedure for getting a refund via direct deposit.<BR>
<BR>
A <A HREF="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/tax_regs/reglist.html">plain-language description of the changes</A> as well as <A HREF="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/forms_pubs/index.html">downloadable tax forms</A> are available on the IRS Web site.<BR>

<LI><B>The ability to use information technology has become the primary driver of corporate decision-making, </B>according to a survey of business leaders released today by Deloitte & Touche.  Of the executives surveyed, 93% felt that without the use of information technology their companies would not have undergone the changes necessary to conduct business successfully. In addition, more than 80% of those surveyed viewed information technology as a strategic investment rather than a cost center to be managed..<BR>

<LI><B>Going home for Thanksgiving just got cheaper</b> as several major airlines announced reduced fares for select domestic and international round-trip flights.  American Airlines announced their lower fares on Sunday, and now other major carriers have followed suit and matched them. <BR>

<LI><B> Machine tool orders increased 44% in September from the previous month,</b> the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the American Machine Tool Distributors Association reported Sunday.  Machine tool orders by U.S. manufacturers for the month totaled $960 million compared with $667 million in August.<BR>

<H3>Tax-free funds that could spell trouble</H3>
Closed-end funds that invest in tax-free bonds look like super bargains. Some have been trading at big discounts to their net asset value recently. <BR>
<BR>	
But James Lynch, editor of <I>Lynch Municipal Bond Advisory</I> (212-663-5552), is wary of this group. He contends that 40% to 70% of the assets in many of these funds are in municipal bonds with high-interest coupons that are likely to be called, or redeemed early, probably within the next few years. The funds would have to replace those bonds with ones that offer lower yields. That in turn would lead to dividend cuts and probably to lower share prices, Lynch says. Because shares of closed-end funds trade like stocks, such bad news could result in exorbitant price drops.<BR>
<BR>	
Lynch recommends selling any closed-end fund that has more than 45% of assets in municipal bonds callable within the next five years. Two such funds, he says, are Nuveen Municipal Opportunity (NMO) and Nuveen Premium Income (NPI). A phone call to any closed-end fund should help you determine its holdings in such issues.<BR>

<B>Our selection of consumer, business and financial news<BR>
that matters to you, your money and your career.</B><BR>

<I>Last Updated: Wednesday, November 13, 4:28 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Government cracks down on self-employment schemes</H3>
Getting laid off is tough stuff.  Besides worrying about how you're going to make the next mortgage payment or put food on the table, there's often the nagging doubt about whether your career will recover from the setback.<BR>
<BR>
Some scam-artists prey on that doubt, according to Jodie Bernstein, director of the government's Bureau of Consumer Protection.  They target newly laid-off workers—who often receive large severance packages—with promises of "proven" or "lucrative" business opportunities or chances to be their own bosses, she says.  <BR>
<BR>
"We're not talking about uneducated, inarticulate people that are being targeted here," Bernstein says.  "What it comes down to is that when a business opportunity knocks, consumers today have to take more than a quick look before opening the door and investing—particularly when they're already feeling vulnerable."<BR>
<BR>
Wednesday, federal and state regulators announced the results of "Operation Missed Fortune," in which 75 of the alleged get-rich-quick schemes had their offices raided and their assets frozen.  The cases involved operations based in 25 different states, with thousands of victims and millions of dollars in losses.<BR>
<BR>
Con artists in such cases generally locate their victims through trade shows, advertisements on TV or in the newspaper, or through Internet chat rooms, according to Mark Griffin, president of the North American Securities Administrators Association.  In some cases, they even use celebrity promoters (who didn't do their homework before signing on).  Common ruses include franchises with exclusive territories or rock-solid guarantees of future income—after the victim pays anywhere from $30 to $30,000 in start-up costs, of course.  <BR>
<BR>
"Just remember that most financial success comes from hard work," Griffin says.  "If somebody guarantees that your income will exceed the purchase price of a franchise or some piece of equipment, be wary.  Above-board businesses aren't likely to make such claims."<BR>
<BR>
Details of the schemes involved in "Operation Missed Fortune" and steps you can take to avoid being duped are available on the <A HREF = "http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/getrich/index.htm">Federal Trade Commission Web site</A>.  If you suspect you may have already fallen prey to a scam-artist, contact the <A HREF = "http://www.fraud.org">National Fraud Information Center</A> and/or the FTC.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<B>The Federal Reserve Board decided Wednesday that high inflation and an over-heated economy are not likely to develop,</B> opting to hold short-term interest rates at the current level.  Earlier in the day, the Labor Department announced that the so-called "core rate" of the Producer Price Index (which excludes food and energy prices) fell 0.3% in October.  With the two volatile sectors added to the mix, though, wholesale prices overall increased 0.4% during the month.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Nervous investors put less new cash into mutual funds in October,</B> according to Investment Company Institute estimates released Wednesday.  ICI chief economist John Rea estimated that $13 billion flowed into stock funds during the month, down from $17.4 billion in September.  Rea said bond and fixed-income funds saw about half a billion dollars more cash leave funds in October than it took in, after gaining $1.93 billion a month earlier.  Official statistics of the data will be released in 2-3 weeks, ICI said.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some of the world's largest financial companies were dragged into the Sumitomo Corporation debacle Wednesday,</B> as former copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka was arrested for the second time on fraud charges.  A statement released by Japanese prosecutors said Hamanaka secured money from France's Credit Lyonnais, England's London Metal Exchange and the U.S.'s Merrill Lynch and Morgan Guaranty Trust to cover some of his $2.6 billion in trading losses during recent years.  The firms were not accused of wrongdoing. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Westinghouse Electric announced plans Wednesday to split its broadcast and industrial components into separate companies,</B> only a year after buying CBS television.  Westinghouse makes nuclear-power generators and refrigerated trucks on one hand, but also owns 16 TV stations and 77 radio stations.  Westinghouse shares fell more than 5% following the announcement.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Correction:</B>  Microsoft Corp. did declare a two-for-one stock split at its annual directors meeting Tuesday.<BR>

<H3>Bogle says fund "gunslingers" shoot down investor returns</H3>
John Bogle was never one to mince words before undergoing heart-transplant surgery in February, and the experience evidently hasn't mellowed him.<BR>
<BR>
After spending eight months out of the public spotlight following his operation, the chairman of the Vanguard fund family returned to the stage this week to lambaste his peers at a gathering of business writers and editors in Chicago.  Bogle said most fund managers these days "act like gunslingers," trying to attract the attention of new investors and the media rather than providing long-term money management.<BR>
<BR>
"The industry's traditional focus on the suitability of funds for long-term investors is quickly becoming a focus on investing for the short-term and, even more baneful, a focus on enticing shareholders to use their mutual funds as vehicles for rapid switching," he said.  "Either for the purpose of getting investors to time the market or to jump on the bandwagon of the latest hot fund, turnover in [fund] investment portfolios averages almost 100% a year."<BR>
<BR>
Bogle had especially strong words for the popular mutual-fund "supermarkets," which allow investors to buy and sell hundreds of funds without paying transaction fees.  He blamed the supermarkets, and the attitude surrounding them, for the fact that the average investor holds a stock fund about 2.5 years before selling, down from a 12.5-year average two decades ago.<BR>
<BR>
"Buy any funds that catch your fancy, but buy them from us, these [supermarkets] say; trade them often, and by shifting the cost of that trading from your own account to the amorphous, voiceless mass of the longer-term shareholders, do it for free," Bogle continued.  "It's noteworthy how far such a strategy departs from what I regard as the two most basic principles of investing—invest for the long term and don't expect miracles from management."<BR>
<BR>
Several firms that offer fund supermarkets issued statements disputing Bogle's assertion that they promote short-term speculation.  "The mutual-fund supermarkets have provided tremendous benefits to millions of individual investors, including access to the best money managers," a Charles Schwab spokesperson said, for example.  "The reason we distribute many different funds from many families is to provide wider choice," according to Fidelity.<BR>
<BR>
But Bogle, ever the industry critic, wasn't impressed.  In an interview, he chastised the chairman and namesake of Charles Schwab for valuing long-term investing for himself, yet creating an investment company based on "switch and get rich" and "pick the hot manager" philosophies.  "I am troubled by the idea that one's personal principles can so blatantly contradict one's business principles," he said.  <BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Retail sales in October were up more than 5% from a year ago,</B> the Commerce Department reported Thursday.  Sales totaled $206.6 billion during the month, up from $206.2 billion in September and $196 billion in October 1995.  Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's economic activity, and activity during the upcoming holiday season can amount to as much as half of yearly sales and profits.  In related announcements Thursday, retail outlets Gap, Lands End and Saks all reported higher earnings for the third quarter.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Stocks closed in record-high territory for the seventh consecutive session on Thursday,</B> buoyed by government reports (see below) indicating that inflation remains under control.  The big news of the day, though, was that the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average closed above 6,300 for the first time.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The first mass-produced electric cars rolled off the assembly line Thursday,</B> as the General Motors EV1 two-door coupe made its debut.  Marketed as "pollution-free transportation," EV1s will be available at Saturn dealerships in Los Angeles, Tucson, Phoenix and San Diego in December.  Powered by lead-acid batteries, the cars can travel 90 miles on the highway or 70 miles in the city before needing a recharge — perfect for commuting to and from work, according to GM.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Consumer prices rose a fairly moderate 0.3% in October,</B> according to Consumer Price Index statistics released Thursday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  The data seems to support the Federal Reserve Board's decision a day earlier not to raise interest rates, hinting at inflation that remains under control.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The interest rate charged on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages fell this week,</B> according to a nationwide survey released Thursday by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  The average rate came in at 7.59% during the week, down from 7.67% last week and the lowest rate since March 7.  Fifteen-year mortgages and one-year adjustable-rate mortgages also moved lower, to 7.11% and 5.52%, respectively.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of Americans filing first-time jobless claims fell by 4,000 last week,</B> the Labor Department said Thursday.  A total of 328,000 new people filed applications for unemployment during the week, down from 332,000 the week before.<BR>

<H3>Congressional snafu delays social security withholding</H3>
Count on confusion rather than convenience in January, when social security recipients are supposed to be able, for the first time, to ask that income taxes be withheld from their monthly checks. Although the IRS is ready to go with the plan—and plans to announce it soon—withholding on benefits is actually against the law.<BR>
<BR>
Confused?  Here's what's happening:<BR>
<BR>
Two years ago, Congress decided to allow social security beneficiaries to volunteer to have taxes withheld from their monthly checks. That's not as crazy as it might sound. Monthly withholding might let you avoid the hassle of making estimated tax payments on your benefits or on other income every quarter.<BR>
<BR>
To make sure there was plenty of time to get the system up and running, though, Congress delayed the start until 1997. Turns out that it wasn't quite enough time...<BR>
<BR>
While the lawmakers altered the tax law to okay withholding, they failed to change a provision in the Social Security Act that forbids it. The problem was noticed long ago and, figuring Congress would act to correct it, the IRS proceeded to develop a special form—W4-VOL—for taxpayers who wanted to have taxes withheld from their checks. The tax agency, in fact, plans to announced the availability of the forms within the next few weeks.<BR>
<BR>
That may well lead to confusion, though, since the goof <I>didn't </I>get fixed and the Social Security Administration won't allow withholding as is. The House of Representatives passed the necessary legislation in September, but it fell through the cracks in the Senate as the lawmakers rushed to adjourn for the fall campaign.<BR>
<BR>
The legislation will be revived soon after the new Congress convenes in January. Once it is passed and signed by the President—we'll let you know when—you really will be able to request that taxes be withheld from your checks. Withholding will be at a flat 7%, 15%, 28% or 31%, whichever you choose. <BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Government statistics released Friday point to a slowing economy,</B> although analysts say the three reports simply coincide with consumer demand that has been slowing for several months.  First, industrial output fell 0.5% in October, the first decline in seven months.  Second, factories operated at less than 83% of capacity in October, the lowest rate since March.  Finally, business inventories edged up 0.1% in September.  Growing inventories tend to point to a slowing economy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>New Internet users are bypassing online services such as America Online and CompuServe,</B> according to a survey released Friday by Louis Harris and Associates.  According to the telephone poll of 1,032 adults, 35% have used the Internet at least once—one-third more than in a similar poll in January.  Over the same time, though, the number of people who use the online services has remained essentially unchanged as users opt for less-expensive direct-access providers.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Several members of the Federal Reserve Board argued for higher interest rates at the group's September meeting,</B> according to records released Friday.  Although the minutes of the September 24 meeting didn't identify members by name other than chairman Alan Greenspan, "a few members indicated that they could vote for some slight tightening in policy."  Greenspan, evidently, urged restraint.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Airline prices could be on their way up worldwide,</B> after the International Air Transport Association voted Friday to boost ticket prices 3%.  The IATA, which represents 254 airlines around the world, said it was proposing the increase to offset higher fuel costs.  Contingent upon the approval of various governments around the world, the price hike will take effect December 15.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Texaco settled a class-action racial-discrimination lawsuit Friday,</B> agreeing to pay more than $176 million to black employees.  The case attracted attention this week after civil-rights leader Jesse Jackson called for a boycott of Texaco products.  Earlier, company executives were allegedly caught on tape making racist remarks.<BR>

<I>Last Updated: Monday, November 18, 4:33 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>MasterCard bets on the future of e-cash</H3>
Bowing to environmentalists, supermarket cashiers have long asked shoppers whether they prefer paper or plastic bags.  If MasterCard has its way, the "paper or plastic" question will become just as ubiquitous when it comes to the type of cash shoppers prefer.  <BR>
<BR>
Not "would you like to put that on your credit card or debit card," mind you, but "would you like to use paper or plastic<I> cash</I>?"<BR>
<BR>
Betting that consumers will buy into the idea of using electronic cash stored on plastic cards, MasterCard on Monday agreed to buy controlling interest in British smart-card firm Mondex International.  Mondex cards can be loaded up with cash at ATMs or through specially equipped telephones that transfer money from a bank account.  You can then use the cards to pay retailers, taxi drivers or street vendors, or even to zap a few extra dollars onto your kids' cards.<BR>
<BR>
"Mondex truly represents the future of money," says MasterCard's Henry Mundt.  "[It] offers consumers the most sophisticated, best-tested product on the market."<BR>
<BR>
Mondex and other so-called "smart cards" differ from credit and debit cards in that they try to mimic the properties of cash.  Credit and debit cards are identification cards owned by a bank and restricted to one user, for example, while cash is a bearer instrument—whoever has it owns it, in essence.  And cash, whether paper, coin or on plastic, can be held and used by anyone, even if they don't have a bank account or credit rating.  Credit and debit cards, obviously, can't be.<BR>
<BR>
Mondex has been testing its cash card in Swindon, England, for nearly a year, with 10,000 card holders and 700 retail outlets equipped to handle them.  This fall, it also initiated small-scale tests in Guelph, Ontario; Hong Kong; Christchurch, New Zealand; and San Francisco.  Mondex claims the Swindon experiment has been successful to date, although it anticipated as many as 40,000 users before the test started.<BR>
<BR>
"I thought it would be chaos on Friday nights if everybody had Mondex cards, that they would be slow to process like credit cards," says bartender Lyn Notton of Rudi's Bar in Swindon.  "But it turned out to be even quicker than putting money in the till."<BR>
<BR>
But Mondex, as well as competing smart cards from Visa and American Express, has some questions to answer before coin and paper is relegated to the history books.  Chief among them: What's in it for consumers?  Mundt has a quick answer: You always have the equivalent of exact change and you don't have to carry around more-bulky cash.<BR>
<BR>
While that's true, skeptics wonder whether those benefits will be enough to get consumers to abandon well-entrenched cash habits any time soon.  And there are likely to be huge costs involved in getting the required technology to both consumers and retailers—after all, plastic cash is worthless if nobody accepts it.<BR>
<BR>
Sonya Simmons of Wilsonville, Oregon is just the kind of consumer MasterCard is aiming for: She hates carrying around a purse full of change.  But while Simmons suspects e-cash will eventually become the order of the day, she thinks it won't happen as quickly or as painlessly as MasterCard would have you believe.  "It sounds nice," she says.  "But it's going to take a long time to convince people to give up cash—especially if they have to pay fees to some bank to do it."<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The president of Texaco said racial discrimination in the workplace extends far beyond his company,</B> speaking over the weekend on nationwide television shows.  "I would suggest that we are just seeing the tip of the iceberg here," Peter Bijur said.  "It's important to drill down below that very tip and get down into what's beneath and find out what's going on."  Texaco settled a class-action discrimination lawsuit Friday for $176.1 million.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Three computer companies announced plans for handheld computers Monday,</B> kicking off their products on the first day of <A HREF = "http://www.comdex.com/comdex/owa/home">Comdex</A>, an industry trade show in Las Vegas.  Compaq, Casio and NEC all launched 16-ounce computers that are expected to retail for $500 to $700, and are expected to compete with laptops in the portable-computer market.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Mattel announced Monday that it is buying rival Tyco Toys for $755 million,</B> offering shareholders $12.50 worth of Mattel stock for each Tyco share they own.  Tyco closed Friday at $7 per share.  Mattel failed in a bid earlier this year to acquire fellow toymaker Hasbro.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Companies are rushing to the Internet even faster than consumers,</B> according to a Reuters survey released Monday.  The survey found that 83% of large, consumer-related firms in the U.S., Western Europe and Japan have created home pages to date, a far higher percentage than that of adults who use the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Tosco Corporation became the largest independent oil refiner in the U.S. on Monday,</B> spending $2 billion to buy Unocal Corporation.  Tosco chairman Thomas O'Malley said in a statement that the company would finance the deal through a combination of debt and equity.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>Health groups urge investors to dump funds with tobacco holdings</H3>
Alfred Munzer skipped the normal pleasantries and cut to the chase Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
"It is morally and ethically indefensible to share in the profits of an industry that serves no productive purpose in society and that thrives on addiction, death and disease," the doctor and one-time president of the American Lung Association told a gathering of business writers in Washington, DC.  "Big tobacco may make money for investors, but at what cost to all of us?"<BR>
<BR>
Munzer and representatives of other health groups such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and Center for Tobacco-Free Kids gathered Tuesday to kick off a campaign urging investors to avoid mutual funds with tobacco holdings.  The only way to get mutual funds to stop bankrolling tobacco companies, the group argued, is for investors to "vote with their feet"—and take their money out of ones that invest in the industry.<BR>
<BR>
As part of the campaign, the health groups endorsed a new Web site, <A HREF = "http://www.calvertgroup.com/KNOW/index.html">Know What You Own</A>.  Investors simply plug the name of a fund into the page, and up pops a list of any tobacco holdings and the fund's top 10 holdings overall.  The site is managed by the "socially responsible" fund company Calvert Group, and utilizes information provided by Morningstar Mutual Funds.<BR>
<BR>
Calvert chief executive Clifton Sorrell says the impetus for the Web site came from a recent study by Yankelovich Partners, which found that two-thirds of mutual fund investors don't know what stocks their funds own.  "We're not trying to tell people what to invest in," Sorrell says.  "But this [Web site] gives investors a chance to make an informed decision about whether they want to invest in a fund that holds tobacco stocks or not."<BR>
<BR>
Tobacco firm Philip Morris released a statement saying, "fund managers have a fiduciary responsibility to manage their portfolios to produce the best financial returns for beneficiaries [irrespective of holdings]."  A spokeswoman for RJR Nabisco Holdings, the parent of RJ Reynolds Tobacco, declined to comment for this story other than to point out a recent shareholder vote involving the TIAA-CREF institutional funds.  She said more than 80% of shareholders in the TIAA-CREF funds voted not to sell their tobacco holdings, fearing they would lose too much return.<BR>
<BR>
Sorrell says the "Know What You Own" campaign complements the "Great American Smokeout," which starts Thursday.  As part of that effort, smokers are challenged to quit for a day.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>New housing starts fell in October to their lowest level in more than a year,</B> the Commerce Department announced Tuesday.  Construction of new homes and apartments totaled 1.37 million during the month, down from 1.44 million in September.  The decline came despite lower mortgage rates and continued strong home sales in October, which means that builders likely expect a slowdown in the near future.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The recent economic slowdown only represents a temporary lull,</B> the Conference Board said Tuesday.  Chief economist Gail Fosler says consumer spending will heat back up through the holidays and continue into next year.  "Both the level and change in consumer confidence indicate that holiday sales will be up over last year," Fosler says.  "Overall, consumer spending will probably peak in the first half of 1997."<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Federal Reserve Board may yet raise short-term interest rates before the end of the year,</B> Reuters reported Tuesday.  Citing an unnamed Fed source, Reuters said the central bank "came very close to raising rates" at its September 24 meeting, and is still thinking seriously about the idea.  The federal funds rate and discount rate have remained unchanged since January 31.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The government filed obstruction-of-justice charges against at least one Texaco executive,</B> according to an FBI complaint unsealed Tuesday at a federal court in White Plains, NY.  The FBI says Richard Lundwall and other unidentified Texaco officials shredded documents relevant to a recent racial-discrimination lawsuit brought against the company.  Friday, Texaco settled the case for $176.1 million.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Nasdaq censured and fined nine brokers Tuesday suspected of cheating on a qualification exam,</B> fining each $25,000.  Nasdaq says it is "continuing its investigation and more disciplinary action is expected soon."<BR>

<BR>
<H3>Grove, Gates and Barksdale outline visions of the future</H3>
Curious about what life will be like in, say, a decade?  If you believe the trio of keynote speakers at  this week's <A HREF = "http://www.comdex.com/comdex/owa/home">COMDEX 96</A> computer-industry convention in Las Vegas, super-fast computers will run household appliances, the Internet will be an integral part of everyday life and PCs will be controlled through voice-recognition or eyeball-tracking software instead of a mouse.<BR>
<BR>
You <I>could </I>dismiss such projections as idle speculation—but consider that the speakers are no run-of-the-mill prognosticators and COMDEX is no ordinary gathering.<BR>
<BR>
More than 200,000 people from around the world descended upon Las Vegas this week for COMDEX, the computer industry's largest annual showcase of new technology and trends. The opening speeches Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were presented by the chief executives of three of the world's most influential technology firms: Andy Grove (Intel), Bill Gates (Microsoft) and Jim Barksdale (Netscape).<BR>
<BR>
Grove started things off by calling for a battle between television and the computer world for viewers/users.  He said incredible technological advances lie ahead if the Internet and computer software become compelling enough to draw users away from TV, thereby guaranteeing the industry enough money to spend on a high level of research.  <BR>
<BR>
"He who captures the most eyeballs wins," he said.  "In our battle for eyeballs, users' experience on the PC must not only meet the expectation levels set by TV viewing—it must exceed them."<BR>
<BR>
Gates and Barksdale, direct competitors in the burgeoning Internet marketplace, followed with their projections for the PC future.  Information about their predictions is available on the <A HREF = "http://www.comdex.com/comdex/owa/home">COMDEX Web site</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The September trade deficit was the second-worst ever,</B> the Commerce Department said Wednesday.  Pushed by increasing oil imports and an influx of Chinese products, the deficit shot up 10.1% during the month to $11.3 billion.  During the first nine months of the year, the deficit grew at an annualized rate of $114 billion, making it likely to top 1995's total of $105 billion.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Newt Gingrich said it's possible to maintain economic growth while protecting the environment,</B> speaking to congressional Republicans after they nominated him for the Speaker of the House post Wednesday.  "With all of the technological breakthroughs of the information age, with all the opportunities available for problem solving, there is no necessary conflict between a healthy sound environment and a healthy sound economy," Gingrich said.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Two-thirds of the wealthiest Americans are concerned about raising their kids around money,</B> according to a survey released Wednesday by the U.S. Trust Company.  In the poll of those who earn at least $200,000 a year or with net worths above $3 million, 68% said they worry their children "will place too much emphasis on material possessions" and 64% said they were concerned their kids "will be naive about the value of money."  Half said they fear that a wealthy lifestyle could sap their kids' motivation.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>CIA Director John Deutch said Wednesday that he thinks American business executives are in little danger overseas,</B> despite the fact that an alleged spy working for Russia may have compromised some who voluntarily passed information to the U.S. government.  Harold Nichnolson is accused of turning over the names of CIA spies and American executives to Moscow over a four-year period.  "I think this will be quite easily managed by U.S. businesses," Deutch said.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Police used tear gas and batons to subdue rioters outside the Dhaka Stock Exchange in Bangladesh,</B> after fighting broke out between groups of off-hours traders outside the building Wednesday.  The DSE all-share index lost nearly 5% of its value this week after an opposition political leader said the market is propped up by illegal funds from India—increasing tensions in Dhaka.<BR>

<I>Last Updated: Thursday, November 21, 4:48 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<I>Editor's Note:  Today's coverage is the first in a two-part series.  Over the weekend, we'll cover legal and ethical ways managers might go about so-called "competitive intelligence."</I>
<BR>
<H3>Most large companies infiltrated in past 12 months, survey finds</H3>
Few managers spend much time thinking about the cloak-and-dagger world of corporate espionage—as in companies stealing secrets from other companies.  Mark Gembicki thinks maybe they should.<BR>
<BR>
"Some of the stories I hear would make the hair on the back of your neck stand up," says Gembicki, vice president of WarRoom Research in Baltimore.  "We're talking about substantial amounts of money at risk."<BR>
<BR>
WarRoom conducted a survey of Fortune 1,000 companies for a Senate subcommittee this fall, but waited to release the results until Thursday.  The findings?  Nearly six out of 10 firms had their computer systems infiltrated by competitors or hackers in the past year.  Of those, 66% estimated that the losses totaled more than $50,000.  Furthermore, more than half said they lost more than $200,000 and 17% estimated their losses to be at least $1 million.  <BR>
<BR>
Companies cited every dirty trick from hackers actually moving money between bank accounts to competitors finding out about proprietary projects, Gembicki said.  "Some firms value documents at $20,000 a page," he said.  "To put that in perspective, how much would it be worth for Saban Entertainment's competitors to sniff out what the latest Power Ranger toy will be?  They sell $1 billion a year worth of Power Ranger merchandise."<BR>
<BR>
What really surprised Gembicki about the results, though, is the hush-hush approach most companies take toward the subject.  In comments he wrote to Senators William Roth of Delaware and Sam Nunn of Georgia in October, Gembicki noted that "41% [of survey respondents] do not want public release [because they fear a] loss of public confidence—what does this say?"  He answered his own question: "Not good."<BR>
<BR>
"This survey should serve as a wake-up call to Corporate America: Computer crime and espionage are real facets of information warfare," agrees Winn Schwartau, president of the <A HREF = "http://www.infowar.com/">infowar.com Web site</A>, an information clearinghouse on the subject.  "It's time to take them seriously."<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Boeing and American Airlines reached a tentative agreement Thursday on a deal involving as many as 630 planes and more than $20 billion.</B>  American agreed to buy 103 planes immediately, and retained an option to purchase 527 more at a fixed price over the next two decades.  The deal is contingent upon a December vote by the pilots' union.  The news marked the second blow in as many weeks to Boeing competitor McDonnell Douglas, which last week was knocked out of the race to develop a new U.S. fighter jet.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Russia sold its first international bonds since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution on Thursday,</B> issuing U.S. $1 billion worth of five-year Eurobonds.  The bonds are expected to yield around 9.4%, nearly 3.5% more than comparable American government securities.  Russia is rated Ba2 by Moody's Investors Service and BB- by Standard and Poor's, below investment grade on both counts.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Twenty-three states agreed to settle deceptive-advertising claims against a group of carmakers,</B> the Federal Trade Commission announced Thursday.  The state attorneys general had accused General Motors, Honda, Isuzu, Mazda and Mitsubishi of misleading customers with advertisements offering "$0 down" financing.  The ads failed to disclose additional lease terms, which FTC rules require.  The states will share $1 million in damages.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose last week to its highest level since July 13,</B> the Labor Department reported Thursday.  Total applications during the week jumped 17,000 to 344,000.<BR>

<I>Editor's Note:  Today's coverage is the second in a two-part series.  For more on this topic, see <A HREF="dn1121.html">Thursday's News of the Day column</A>. </I>
<BR>
<H3>Countering competitive intelligence</H3>
Stephen Miller thinks "corporate intelligence gathering" gets a bum rap.  "Most people think this business is about spy vs. spy stuff, like breaking into hotel rooms to steal your competitor's computer disks," says the managing editor of the <I>Competitive Intelligence Review</I> newsletter in Alexandria, Va.  "In reality, we deal with honest, above-board ways for people to get, or to protect, business information."<BR>
<BR>
While that may not paint nearly as glamorous a picture as James Bond movies, the bottom line can be just as sexy.  Consider this: Before launching a new foray into health-care products recently, 3M hired a consultant to find and interview former employees of its primary competitor, Johnson & Johnson.  "Good competitive intelligence work like that can tell you a lot about the way your competitor and your industry work," says Steve Shaker, president of WarRoom Research in Baltimore.  "It's amazing how much helpful information is out there if you know how to look for it."<BR>
<BR>
But not everything in competitive intelligence requires pricey consultants.  There are a couple of basic things managers can do to protect themselves from a probing competitor—or maybe to gain the upper-hand themselves.  Jerry Miller of Simmons College in Boston, who teaches a class in competitive intelligence, says the most important thing a manager can do is remind her staff not to give out company information over the phone, through e-mail or to people at conferences or trade shows.<BR>
<BR>
"No matter how innocuous it seems, people can take information you give them and piece it together until they have a pretty good idea about your pricing schedule or your strategic plans," Miller says.  "On the flip side, though, as long as you never misrepresent yourself, feel free to let other people tell you as much as they want about their companies."<BR>
<BR>
Another ethical and legal way to glean information on your competitors, notes Penn State competitive intelligence researcher Linda Klebe Trevino, is to simply keep up on your reading.  Trade journal articles, a competitor's hometown newspaper and documents that firms have to file with the government are all fair game, and they can be a source of helpful information.<BR>
<BR>
"What most business people will tell you is that a lot of competitive intelligence work comes down to doggedly searching databases and the Internet," she says.  "All that public-domain information is there for the taking."<BR>
<BR>
More tips are available at the <A HREF="http://www.scip.org">Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals</A> Web site.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Government safety regulators released new air-bag standards Friday,</B> responding to a wave of criticism over injuries and deaths of small children hit by the bags during car accidents.  The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued the recommendations, which include requiring warning labels on vehicles and allowing mechanics to disable safety devices, if asked by customers.<BR>

<BR>
<LI><B>Russia sold its first international bonds since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution on Thursday,</B> issuing U.S. $1 billion worth of five-year Eurobonds.  The bonds are expected to yield around 9.4%, nearly 3.5% more than comparable American government securities.  Russia is rated Ba2 by Moody's Investors Service and BB- by Standard and Poor's, below investment grade on both counts.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The national trade group for fee-only financial planners doubled the number of continuing-education hours its members are required to put in each year,</b> the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors said Friday.  The new 60-hour minimum will take effect in 1998, spokesman Tom Grzymala said.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Lockheed Martin Corp. agreed Friday to pay $13 million and rehire 450 employees,</B> settling a class-action age-discrimination lawsuit brought by older workers.  The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed the suit on behalf of 2,000 former employees who were laid off during recent restructuring.<BR>
<BR>
<li><B>The October trade deficit was 78% higher than a year ago,</B> the Treasury Department reported Friday.  The gap totaled $40.3 billion this year, up from $22.6 billion in October, 1995.<BR>

<H3> More good times ahead, say Michigan researchers </H3>
Ronald Reagan once threatened to cut federal funding for the University of Michigan's annual state-of-the-economy research.  Economists from around the country protested, though, and Reagan backed off.  A decade later, Bill Clinton—whose popularity is closely tied to the economy—is probably happy about that turn of events.<BR>
<BR>
Over the weekend, University of Michigan economists released the results of this year's survey of consumer confidence, as well as their outlook for the next two years.  And the news was all good.<BR>
<BR>
"More consumers in [this year's] survey expected the economic expansion to continue uninterrupted than to be halted by recession within the next few years," says university spokeswoman Deborah Gilbert.  "Such favorable long-term prospects have rarely been recorded during the past 20 years."<BR>
<BR>
Most people polled during the October survey said they expected job prospects to remain at least as good next year as they were this year, notes survey director Richard Curtin.  He said 90% of respondents felt their financial situation would "stay the same" or "improve" in 1997, with only 10% expecting their finances to "worsen" in the year ahead.<BR>
<BR>
When consumers are comfortable in their jobs and in their financial situations, they will spend more money, Curtin said.  "The most important aspect of the outlook for consumers is that the growth in the economy will be strong enough to keep the unemployment rate at its current low level during the year ahead," he said.  "With that in mind, the outlook for consumer spending next year is quite favorable."<BR>
<BR>
Based on the consumer-confidence survey and others conducted recently by Michigan researchers, university economists Saul Hymans, Joan Crary and Janet Wolfe also released the following projections for 1997 and, in some cases, 1998:<BR>
<BR>
<LI type = "square"> The nation's gross domestic product will grow by 2.4% and 2.3%, respectively, in the next two years—essentially unchanged from the 1996 rate.<BR>
<BR>
<LI type = "square"> Consumer prices will rise by 2% in 1997 and 2.4% in 1998, led by price increases in services rather than products.<BR>
<BR>
<LI type = "square"> Unemployment will edge up from its current rate of 5.2% to 5.4% by the end of 1998, bumped higher by increases in labor productivity.<BR>
<BR>
<LI type = "square"> Both short- and long-term interest rates will remain flat over the next two years, with 30-year mortgage rates hovering around 7.8%, the 30-year Treasury bond yielding something near 6.5% and the three-month T-bill holding at about 5%.<BR>
<BR>
After reviewing 44 years of Michigan forecasts, though, Curtin knows better than to couch any projections as a sure thing.  "This could all change if economic growth is weaker than now anticipated," he says.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>America Online reversed course and backed away from a controversial new pricing plan</B>, succumbing to pressure from at least 15 state attorneys general.  AOL had planned to switch its seven million subscribers to a $19.95 flat-rate plan December 1 unless they contacted the company and requested otherwise—a policy known as "negative option."  Over the weekend, AOL changed its mind and said customers could stick with the current basic plan ($9.95 for five hours a month, $2.95 an hour thereafter) until they had more time to review their options.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The traditional 'January slump' in hiring won't be as severe this year</B> as it is most, according to a quarterly employment outlook released Sunday by Manpower Inc.  The poll of more than 16,000 companies found that 21% plan to increase hiring during the first quarter of 1997, up from 20% during the first three months of this year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Sales of  existing homes dropped for the 5th month in a row</B> in October according to The National Association of Realtors.  Sales levels dipped 1.5% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 3.97 million units.  <BR>

<H3>FCC moves to lower rates on international calls</H3>
Thinking of calling a friend or relative overseas during the Thanksgiving weekend?  It'll cost you about 99 cents a minute—roughly twice as much as it should, says Federal Communications Commission chairman Reed Hundt.<BR>
<BR>
"American consumers are paying an extra five billion bucks a year to foreign telephone companies," Hundt said Tuesday, announcing the first in a series of steps designed to lower the cost of international calls.  "And we're not going to put up with it anymore."<BR>
<BR>
The high charges, Hundt says, are mostly the result of phone-company monopolies in many foreign countries, not a higher cost for moving calls over a longer distance.  Hoping to pressure what he calls the "international telephone-pricing cartel" to open up to free-market forces, the FCC chairman announced new rules giving U.S. companies such as AT&T, MCI and Sprint more flexibility in negotiating rates with foreign firms.  <BR>
<BR>
The changes topple old regulations requiring American companies to charge the same rate to connect all foreign callers, which limits the firms' ability to negotiate with overseas phone companies.  Those changes also end an FCC limitation on the percentage of international traffic to and from a country that a single U.S. firm can control.<BR>
<BR>
But the new regulations won't have an immediate impact, industry analysts predicted Tuesday.  The relaxed rules only apply to negotiations with foreign carriers that the government considers "open to competition."  For now, the only countries whose carriers are likely to meet that definition are Canada, Chile, Mexico and a half-dozen European nations, an FCC spokesman said.<BR>
<BR>
Still, Tuesday's announcement is a step in the right direction, says Don Gips, head of the FCC's international division.  "[The new rules] will allow competitive pressures, rather than archaic rules, to govern the telecommunications market," he says.<BR>
<BR>
Next month, the FCC plans to announce even further-reaching rules changes, including "benchmark" rates limiting what U.S. carriers can pay to foreign phone companies.  International firms that refuse to comply with the benchmarks may face trade sanctions or other, as-yet-undetermined, penalties.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Confident consumers will spend more this holiday season,</B> Conference Board economist Lynn Franco said Tuesday.  "The strong level of confidence coupled with low unemployment, modest inflationary pressures and continuing wage growth should translate into healthy holiday sales in coming weeks," she said.  The Conference Board's November Consumer Confidence Index, released Tuesday, registered 107.3—unchanged from October.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Baseball owners reversed an earlier vote and accepted a new collective-bargaining agreement Tuesday,</B> all but ending four years of negotiations with the players' union.  Approved by a 26-4 margin, the new agreement calls for revenue sharing between teams and the first regular-season interleague play in 125 years.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The amount of money invested in mutual funds increased 2.1% in October,</B> the Investment Company Institute said Tuesday.  Stock funds gained 1.9% during the month and bond funds ended the month with 1.5% more assets than they started it with.  Assets of taxable and tax-exempt money market funds rose 3% and 2.3%, respectively.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Securities and Exchange Commission suspended trading Tuesday in Alliance Industries stock,</B> saying the company may have distributed false information about itself through its Web site.  Based in Bakersfield, Calif., Alliance has divisions in home construction, tree farming and animal husbandry, among other things.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The television and computer industries agreed on common standards for new high-definition TVs,</B> the Federal Communications Commission announced late Monday.  Many manufacturers have waited to produce TVs or video cameras with the new technology until a compromise was forged.  Analysts Tuesday said so-called HDTV products should be in stores by 1998.<BR>

<H3>Seven card tricks that can save you money</H3>
With the holiday shopping season now officially upon us, two credit card sponsors announced plans to give their card holders a break this year—a temporary waiver of interest charges on new purchases.<BR>
<BR>
The American Association of Retired Persons said holders of its affinity MasterCard won't pay interest on things they buy in November, December or January.  AARP cardholders have to call the group's toll-free number before November 30 to sign up.  Similarly, the AFL-CIO announced that holders of its Union Privilege card can buy interest-free between now and the end of the year.<BR>
<BR>
But the waivers offer only a temporary fix for card holders who can't pay off their balances.  Eventually, the bills will come due, adding to the record-high mountain of debt Americans already face.  <BR>
<BR>
The best way to avoid getting crushed by that mountain, obviously, is to live within your budget and pay off card balances every month.  Short of that, though, there are some steps you can take to minimize the chunk of change card companies lift from your pocket each month—or even to make a little money off the cards.  <BR>
<BR>
Robert McKinley of the <A HREF = "http://www.ramresearch.com/">RAM Research Group</A> in Frederick, Maryland, follows changes in the credit-card industry for a living.  He says there are seven easy tactics people can employ to save money with their credit purchases:<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "square"> <I>Squeaky Wheel:</I>  As in, "gets the grease."  McKinley says most credit card firms are willing to lower your interest rate, especially if you cite a competitor's offer.  But they're not going to call you about it, so you have to take the initiative.  "Acquisition costs are high in this industry," McKinley explains.  "In most cases, they'd rather cut your interest rate than lose your business."<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "square"> <I>Hop, Skip & Run:</I>  You know those offers you get in the mail for cards with super-low teaser rates?  They usually stay low for six months before jumping to 18.9%.  Take advantage of the teaser rate, then bail out just as it's about to expire—for another card's super-low rate, of course.  One caveat: Make sure the credit bureaus keep up with your rapid switching, or the low-rate offers will stop appearing in your mailbox.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "square"> <I>Peter, Paul or Mary:</I>  Carry two cards, one that offers frequent-flier miles or money back (and probably has a high interest rate) and one that has a low interest rate.  Charge everything initially on the rebate card, piling up the benefits, then transfer the balance each month to your "cheap" card.  Not all low-rate cards allow regular balance transfers, though, so make sure yours does before putting this into practice.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "square"> <I>Timing is everything:</I>  If you pay off your balance each month, McKinley recommends waiting to make the payments until the last possible day.  "Play the grace period for all it's worth," he says.  "You might as well make interest on your money in the meantime."<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "square"> <I>Churning:</I>  Similar to the "Peter, Paul or Mary" strategy above, this calls for earning extra goodies by transferring balances between as many rebate cards as you can.  "Issuers are starting to wizen up about this, but there are still opportunities out there," McKinley says.  As with the above strategy, make sure your cards allow free balance transfers before trying this out.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "square"> <I>Pedal to the Metal:</I>  Business users who routinely charge thousands of dollars on credit cards can really take advantage of rebate cards, McKinley says.  RAM Research earned a free plane ticket one month by charging its phone bill to a credit card before paying it off.  Another time, it put its monthly mail charges on a card.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "square"> <I>Uncle Sam:</I>  There are ways to deduct credit card debt on your taxes, McKinley points out.  Some banks, for example, offer cards tied to a home-equity line.  Debt is treated the same as a mortgage on such a card.  Another tax trick is to keep all business expenses on one card and private expenses on another.  If you don't have much co-mingling of expenses, it's easy to expense the business costs.<BR>

<LI><B>The nation's third-quarter economic growth was even slower than previously thought,</B> the Commerce Department admitted Wednesday.  A month ago, Commerce said the gross domestic product increased at a 2.2% annualized rate between July and September—down from 4.7% in the spring.  That figure was revised down to 2% Wednesday, after Commerce realized it had undercounted the trade deficit and overcounted business stockpiles.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Car makers and consumer groups will take advantage of the Thanksgiving holiday to get out the word on air-bag safety,</B> passing out leaflets at the nation's busiest rest areas and mailing educational letters to car owners this week.  The message: All children under the age of 12—in a car seat or not—should ride in the back seat with seat belts properly worn.  The campaign comes after a Boise, Idaho toddler was killed by an inflating air bag Tuesday.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of Americans filing for jobless benefits held steady this week,</B> according to the Labor Department's weekly report, released Wednesday.  First-time applications for state benefits totaled 342,000, the same as during the week of November 16.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The U.S. Public Interest Research Group released its annual "Trouble in Toyland" survey this week,</B> citing 21 toys that it says pose choking hazards to small children.  The list includes the Puppy Play House, Disney's 101 Dalmatians Puppy Pal, Impact Racer, Soft 'N Snug Doll Care Accessories, Free Wheeling Dump Truck, Baby-in-a-Bottle, Nia Gift Set Dress-Me-Up Doll, Birthday Party Stamper Kit, Small Ball, Fun Novelty Erasers, Magic Capsules, Lego System Trial Size Imagination, NBA Squirt Balls, Chunky Rescue Set, Soft Cow Pull Toy, Big Fun Chuffa Puffa train, Little Snoopy, Catchin' Shark game, Stomp Rocket and any balloons.<BR>

<I>Last Updated: Monday,  December 2, 4:33 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Blue chips bull their way through November</H3>
The investors' version of the urban legend has long been about the friend of a friend who bought in on the ground floor of a little computer company called IBM and now spends his or her life traveling the world.  Well, that friend's friend had a fabulous November, as Big Blue surged more than 20%—pushing the Dow Jones industrial average to its largest one-month point gain in history.<BR>
<BR>
The Dow rose 22.36 points Friday to finish the month at 6521.70, nearly 500 points higher than it closed on October 31.  That gain easily eclipsed the Dow's previous one-month record of 319 points set last November, but fell short of breaking the record for a single month's runup in percentage terms.  That honor stays with April 1933, when the average jumped a whopping 40.2% (compared to a mere 8.3% last month).<BR>
<BR>
The stock market's other major indexes didn't fare badly during November, either.  The Standard and Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.6% and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks posted a 4.1% gain.  <BR>
<BR>
The markets have been rallying since mid-summer on investors' confidence that the economy can support higher corporate profits without creating runaway inflation.  So far, most analysts agree that outlook has been on target—with increased consumer confidence underpinning hopes for a strong 1997.  <BR>
<BR>
But there are still a few bears on Wall Street warning that the good times won't last forever.  The president of the American Association of Individual Investors, for example, calls himself a "long-term contrarian, if anything."  That doesn't mean you should run out and put all your investments in cash or bonds, says John Markese.  It just means you should be wary of the current flood of optimistic news.<BR>
<BR>
"Don't get caught up in the herd mentality," Markese says.  "You're better off sticking to your investment guns regardless of the group-think that's going on at the moment."<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Sales were brisk on the opening weekend of the holiday shopping season,</B> according to a survey of 24 shopping malls and more than 1,000 individual stores by the International Council of Shopping Centers.  Monday, ICSC said sales rose 11% over the same weekend a year ago.  Still, the president of the National Retail Federation released a statement urging caution.  "What we've seen indicates this has been an extremely good weekend," Tracy Mullin said.  "[But] you never know how the season is going to pan out until it is over."  The weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas traditionally account for about one-quarter of annual retail sales.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Bankrupt Dow Corning Corporation filed a $4.4 billion reorganization plan Monday,</B> including as much as $3.4 billion to pay women who say they were harmed by the company's silicone breast implants.  Dow Corning filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 18 months ago after thousands of women sued the company over allegedly faulty implants.  Dennis Meir, an Atlanta lawyer who represents some of the plaintiffs, immediately criticized the plan as "grossly inadequate."<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Microsoft topped this year's list of corporate philanthropers,</B> according to the December issue of <I>Corporate Giving Watch</I> newsletter.  The publication said Microsoft donated $73.2 million during the latest fiscal year to various charities, mostly in the form of free software.  Rounding out the top five were: Johnson & Johnson, $72.8 million; IBM, $72.2 million; Eli Lilly, $71.9 million; and Hewlett-Packard, $71.2 million.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The manufacturing sector of the economy grew in November for the sixth straight month,</B> the National Association of Purchasing Management said Monday.  NAPM's monthly index rose from 50.2 in October to 52.7 in November, the association reported.  Any reading above 50 is supposed to signal that the nation's manufacturers are expanding.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Two American companies are among more than 70 worldwide suspected of doing business with shell companies set up by drug traffickers,</B> Colombia's Foreign Trade Ministry said Friday.  Warner Lambert and B.F. Goodrich were included on a list of firms from 15 nations that allegedly worked with front companies that drug dealers used to launder "dirty money" in 1994 and 1995.  The non-Colombian companies are not accused of knowingly doing anything legally or ethically wrong.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The United Nations took up the topic Monday of copyright laws online,</B> seeking to "protect rights in an era when national borders have been made irrelevant" by the Internet.  Over the next three weeks, delegates from the UN's 160 nations will hammer out international standards on how to protect "literary and artistic works" such as books, compact discs and proprietary databases.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The American Stock Exchange added an interactive financial dictionary to its Web site Monday,</B> providing definitions of fairly sophisticated investing terms.  Search terms can be entered at <A HREF = "http://utah.e1.com/amex/findic/search.html">The Dictionary of Financial Risk Management</A> page of AMEX's site.<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<I>Last Updated: Tuesday,  December 3, 5:04 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Are <I>you </I>saving enough for retirement?</H3>
Ken Feltman announced good news and bad news at a press conference Tuesday in Washington, DC.  First, the good news: Americans are setting aside more money for retirement than ever before.  The bad news: It still isn't enough.<BR>
<BR>
Feltman, executive director of the Employers Council on Flexible Compensation, issued the results of his group's annual Workplace Pulse Survey.  They show that the average American will save $2,388 for retirement this year, 11% more than last year and 34% more than in 1994.  <BR>
<BR>
"More workers now realize they can't depend on employers or the government [to fund their retirement years]," Feltman said.<BR>
<BR>
Despite the savings boost, though, most Americans will come up short of their retirement expectations, according to the survey.  Workers expect, on average, to need $26,256 a year in retirement to maintain their current lifestyles.  Few are saving enough to reach that goal, Feltman said.  Assuming a 4% inflation rate, 11% return on investments and lifespans based on the current actuarial tables, Feltman said Americans of all age groups are saving less than half of what they need to bring in the equivalent of $26,000 a year in retirement.<BR>
<BR>
Such calculations tend to overstate the problem, since they don't include <I>any </I>government or employer retirement plans.  But that doesn't mean you can ignore the underlying message, notes John Penko of Colonial Life & Accident Insurance in Columbia, South Carolina.<BR>
<BR>
"There is a huge gap between what people expect and what they will likely receive," Penko says.  "For younger workers, there may be time to catch up.  For older workers, it is going to be very hard, if not impossible, for them to live their retirement dreams."<BR>
<BR>
For a few tips about how you can boost your savings, read <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/archives/1994/November/savers.html">"Super Savers Have More Fun"</A> from the November 1994 issue of <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The Index of Leading Economic Indicators gained 0.1% in October,</B> the Conference Board announced Tuesday.  The index registered 103.6 during the month, up from 103.5 in September and 103.3 in August.  The gain marked the index's ninth consecutive uptick and the sixth straight month it has set a record.  The Conference Board took over management of the index from the government in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Three current or former Archer Daniels Midland Company executives and a Japanese businessman were charged Tuesday with price fixing,</B> as federal prosecutors alleged they conspired to keep lysine prices high worldwide.  Among those charged are Michael Andreas, son of ADM chief executive Dwayne Andreas, and Mark Whitacre, the government's primary whistle-blower in the case.  A Korean company also agreed to pay a $1.25 million fine for its role in the alleged conspiracy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation issued an all-points-bulletin Tuesday for 2,700 Americans who are owed retirement money,</B> setting up a <A HREF = "http://search.pbgc.gov/missingp.htp">Pension Search Directory</A> online and kicking off a national advertising campaign.  The workers earned pension benefits at companies that later went bankrupt, but are still entitled to benefits from the PBGC.  People on the list—which can be searched by name or company—are owed an average of $3,700.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Outgoing ambassador Walter Mondale suggested Tuesday that trade reforms between the U.S. and Japan will continue to be slowed by the island nation's social traditions.</B>  Speaking to the Foreign Correspondents Club of Japan, the former vice president said "the same bureaucratic and business sectors of the economy which have historically resisted change will continue to frustrate well-intentioned efforts to open the Japanese economy."  Mondale, 68, cited the Japanese tradition of giving retiring government bureaucrats high-ranking corporate jobs as especially troubling.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>New home sales fell 8.7% in October to the lowest level since March,</B> the Commerce Department said Tuesday.  Sales of single-family houses totaled an annualized 714,000 during the month, down from 782,000 in September.  Analysts said much of the pent-up demand for new homes was spent as consumers bought at an annualized rate of 819,000 through the summer.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Charles Keating Jr.'s federal fraud conviction was overturned late Monday in Los Angeles,</B> after judge Mariana Pfaelzer determined that the jury had learned about Keating's state conviction before deliberating.  The 72-year-old Keating is accused of deceiving investors so he could take money from savings and loans to invest in high-risk projects.  Federal prosecutor Sharon McCaslin said the government will try Keating again.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The economy should continue to grow slowly in the fourth quarter,</B> Federal Reserve Board governor Edward Kelley forecast Tuesday.  Kelley said he expects the nation's gross domestic product to increase at an annualized 2.3% in the fourth quarter, down from 2.7% in the third quarter.<BR>

<B>Our selection of consumer, business and financial news<BR>
that matters to you, your money and your career.</B><BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<I>Last Updated: Wednesday,  December 4, 4:26 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Commission says government should fix faulty inflation numbers</H3>
Michael Boskin, a Stanford University economist and former economic adviser to President George Bush, has long maintained that government inflation statistics are fundamentally flawed.  Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan and many other economists agree—on the problem, if not on a solution.  <BR>
<BR>
Wednesday, Boskin and four other economists in a government-appointed commission took their case to the Senate Finance Committee, submitting a 93-page report arguing that the government's Consumer Price Index overstates inflation by 1.1 percentage points.  Boskin called on Congress and the Clinton Administration to correct the situation, which he says costs the government billions of dollars in excess benefits payments and lost tax revenues each year.<BR>
<BR>
"We have no doubt our recommendations would greatly improve the accuracy of the nation's price statistics," Boskin told the senators.  "Even small differences compound over time and matter a lot." <BR>
<BR>
On that point, at least, there is little disagreement.  If the government acted on Boskin's proposal, changes to the CPI would cost retirees about $100 in Social Security benefits next year, force some Americans to pay taxes in a higher bracket and trim the annual raise given to government employees and some unionized workers.  And, as Boskin points out, the effects would become even more significant over time.<BR>
<BR>
But any reduction in the inflation adjustments would also ease the task of balancing the federal budget by 2002, which both major political parties claim is a priority.  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, even a reduction of one percentage point in the CPI would save the government $34 billion in benefits payments and bring in $21 billion in additional tax revenue by 2002.  <BR>
<BR>
None of those effects are lost on politicians or various advocacy groups.  The American Association of Retired Persons and several unions are already gearing up to fight any proposal to alter annual cost-of-living adjustments, for example.  And Democrats and Republicans alike are tiptoeing quietly through the political minefield, willing to support change but waiting for someone else to take the lead.<BR>
<BR>
In other words, Boskin's report may be the beginning, not the end, of a long and potentially divisive debate on the subject.  "Don't hold your breath waiting for change," says Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution, a Washington, DC think tank.  "Politically, I don't see it happening right away, although that doesn't mean I don't think it would be a good thing." <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Inflation remains in check and retailers are upbeat about the holiday shopping season,</B> a Federal Reserve Board study released Wednesday shows.  "Moderate economic growth continues to be reported in nearly all Federal Reserve districts [and] retail prices are stable," the survey, known as the beige book, says.  "Retailers' expectations for sales in the upcoming holiday season are moderately optimistic."  The study will be reviewed by Fed officials when they meet December 17 to consider interest-rate policy.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The third-largest and fifth-largest U.S. airlines are considering a merger,</B> according to reports published Wednesday.  Continental Airlines and Delta Air Lines have reportedly been in negotiations since summer over the terms of a possible union.  A combined company would create the largest U.S. carrier, leapfrogging American Airlines and United Airlines.  Spokespersons for Continental and Delta declined to comment Wednesday.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Charles Keating III's investment-fraud conviction was overturned late Tuesday in Los Angeles,</B> one day after fraud and racketeering convictions against his father were reversed.  Judge Mariana Pfaelzer ruled that jurors were improperly tainted in both cases by their knowledge of prior state-court convictions on similar charges.  A federal prosecutor said new trial dates for the pair would be set on January 16.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Russian inflation was 58% higher in November than in October,</B> the State Statistics Committee said Wednesday in Moscow.  Consumer prices rose 1.9% during the month, up from 1.2% in October.  So far in 1996, inflation has risen at an annualized 22% rate, down drastically from the 131% pace set last year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Viacom Inc. exercised an option Wednesday to purchase half of the UPN Network for $160 million,</B> announcing the decision 11 days before the option would have run out.  Viacom owns MTV, VH-1 and Paramount Pictures, but few television stations; UPN has 152 station affiliates reaching 92% of U.S. television households.<BR>

<I>Last Updated: Thursday,  December 5, 5:15 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>SEC lifts Omnigene trading restriction ... or does it?</H3>
A strange thing happened to the stock price of tiny Omnigene Diagnostics Inc. on Thursday: nothing.  <BR>
<BR>
That was supposed to be the first day of trading for OMGD shares in two weeks, following a suspension imposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 20.  The SEC said it had "questions about the accuracy and adequacy of publicly disseminated information" by and about the firm, so it stopped trading for 10 business days—the maximum suspension allowed by federal law.  Everybody, including <I>The New York Times</I> in a front-page story, predicted OMGD shares would collapse first-thing Thursday morning<BR>
<BR>
Instead, not a single OMGD share changed hands during the day.  Turns out that the SEC isn't through with Omnigene Diagnostics yet.  In its <A HREF = "http://www.sec.gov/news/extra/omnigaol.htm">stop-trading order</A>, the SEC warned brokers nationwide that it is illegal to trade a stock if you have reason to doubt the veracity of information publicly released by the company.  The above statement was evidently enough to create that doubt.  "You draw your own conclusions," an agency spokesman said Thursday.  <BR>
<BR>
Until early October, OMGD was a virtual unknown, thinly traded in the over-the-counter market.  About two months ago, though, nearly identical messages praising the company popped up on several online investment bulletin boards.  According to the messages, which were sent from various e-mail addresses, OMGD had already made $400,000 in sales this year and was in line to earn revenues in excess of $2 million in 1997.  Further, the messages said the company's patented diagnostic and testing products enjoyed monopolies in various markets.<BR>
<BR>
A few people voiced suspicions about the information on those bulletin boards, but the stock's proponents accused them of selling the stock short and trying to profit from its downfall.  Writing lines such as "I'm going to ride this train to the gold mine, toooot TOOOOT," the stock's promoters told investors this was the "buy of the year."  Within a month, eager buyers pushed the stock's price from $4 per share to $6.50.<BR>
<BR>
The buyers may have been a little too eager, as it turns out.  After OMGD's Web-site manager posted information in November that seemed to contradict earlier company statements, the SEC stepped in.  But SEC investigator Richard Jacobson says the case shouldn't be viewed as a condemnation of online investor information in general.  It's just important to keep it in perspective—exactly like you would if somebody gave you a hot stock tip at the barber shop down the street. <BR>
<BR>
"If something doesn't make sense, you should be careful," Jacobson says.  "A lot of the scams we've seen promise unreasonably high rates of return with little or no risk—the kind of offering that's literally too good to be true." <BR>
<BR>
In other words, approach all stock tips—online or not—with a healthy dose of skepticism. For more information about investment tips on the Internet, read the <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I> article, <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/magazine/nov96/wildbox.html">"Safe Surfing: Don't Trust, Verify."</A><BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The Washington, DC-based Social Investment Forum urged institutional investors to divest their tobacco holdings in a press conference Wednesday,</B> coinciding with the release of a study forecasting tough times ahead for tobacco stocks.  "Legal, regulatory and economic forces will converge in such a way in 1997 that prudent institutional investors will have no choice as fiduciaries but to consider kicking their tobacco habit," said SIF's Alisa Gravitz.  The study, <A HREF = "http://www.socialinvest.org/tob-main.htm">Tobacco's Changing Context</A>, is available online.  For information about similar calls for divestiture in individual portfolios, read the <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/dailynews/dn1119.html">November 19 News of the Day</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Americans' productivity in the workplace fell in the third quarter for the first time this year,</B> the Labor Department said Thursday.  Nonfarm productivity fell an annualized 0.3% in July, August and September, far weaker than the 0.2% gain Labor estimated last month.  That follows 1.9% and 0.6% annualized gains during the first two quarters of the year, respectively.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The FBI started calling scam targets Thursday to warn them about fraudulent telemarketers,</B> calling the two-day plan Operation Unload.  Thursday and Friday, the FBI, offices of various state attorneys general and volunteers from the American Association of Retired Persons will call more than 5,000 people found on "target lists" of arrested scamsters.  An FBI spokesman said scamsters often buy, sell or trade target lists, thereby victimizing the same people repeatedly.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of people filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell last week,</B> possibly because of the holiday-shortened work week.  The Labor Department announced Thursday that 336,000 people filed for jobless benefits during the week, down from 344,000 the week before.  It was also the lowest total since 329,000 people submitted applications during the week of November 9.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Seven U.S. companies announced plans Thursday to back the Mondex smart-card system,</B> including AT&T, Chase Manhattan Bank, Dean Witter Discover, MasterCard and Wells Fargo.  For information about smart cards and the Mondex system, read the <A HREF = "http://kiplinger.com/dailynews/dn1118.html">November 18 News of the Day</A>.  Mondex's primary "e-cash" competitor is Visa Cash, which is working on a pilot project with Chase Manhattan and Citibank in New York City.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Cable television giant Tele-Communications Inc. announced plans Thursday to lay off 6.5% of its workforce,</B> totaling 2,500 employees.  TCI said the bulk of the layoffs would be at its Englewood, Colo. headquarters, but some would take place at regional offices, as well.<BR>

<BR>
<I>Last Updated: Friday,  December 6, 4:42 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Greenspan comments fray investors' nerves worldwide</H3>
Alan Greenspan is famous (or infamous, depending upon who you ask) for being more slippery than even the best politicians when it comes to his public comments.  Over more than a decade as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, which governs the most powerful central banking system in the world, Greenspan has made an art out of carefully-worded statements that leave Wall Street and the financial press collectively scratching their heads.<BR>
<BR>
Not this time.  Stock and bond markets throughout Asia, Europe and, of course, the U.S. reacted strongly Friday after Greespan suggested Thursday night that "irrational exuberance" might be fueling American stock prices.  The Dow Jones industrial average fell 125 points in the first half hour of trading Friday, and the damage was just as bad elsewhere: the Japanese market experienced its largest drop of the year, and stocks in London, Paris and Frankfurt all lost more than 4% of their value before lunch time.<BR>
<BR>
The mini-crash was relatively short-lived, as bottom feeders waded into most markets to prop prices up late in the day.  Still, some analysts worried that the volatility might dampen the optimism that has kept investors buying in recent months.<BR>
<BR>
"Whether the world changes that much is a question mark, but the psychology has changed," says Oppenheimer's Michael Mertz.  "We had a buying panic in the market at times recently; today we had a selling panic."<BR>
<BR>
Speaking to the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, DC Thursday, Greenspan stopped short of direct criticism of the markets.  "How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values?" he asked the crowd.  Since the Fed sets U.S. interest-rate policy, though, even that hint was enough to send world markets into a frenzy.<BR>
<BR>
Manny Schiffres, author of the "Smart Investing" column in <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>, says investors shouldn't read too much into Greenspan's statement or the day's volatility.  "We shouldn't lose sight of the fact that things still look pretty good out there," he says.  "Inflation indicators are benign and indications are that corporate profits will continue to rise next year.  You may not make 20% in 1997 like you did this year, but the floor's not about to fall completely out from under this market."<BR>
<BR>
The trick to successful investing, Schiffres says, is to allocate your money among stocks and bonds on the basis of when you'll need the money—the sooner you'll need it, the more conservative you should be—and then stick to your guns regardless of what the markets do on a day-to-day basis.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Overnight electronic trading in the futures and options markets set a record for volume,</B> the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced Friday.  Following Alan Greenspan's comments Thursday night, CME's computer trading system saw 37,452 futures or options contracts exchanged before the trading pits opened Friday morning—eclipsing the previous high-volume mark by 27%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Supreme Court agreed Friday to hear its first case involving Internet pornography,</B> agreeing to review the Communications Decency Act passed by Congress.  Federal judges in Philadelphia blocked the law from taking effect earlier this year, ruling that it would infringe on adults' legal ability to see sexual material.  A Supreme Court ruling on the matter is expected by next summer.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Orders to U.S. manufacturers rose 0.9% in October,</B> the Commerce Department said Friday.  Led by sharp increases in demand for computers and other electronic equipment, orders increased to $321.3 billion during the month, up from $318.5 billion in September.  The Labor Department also reported Friday that employment at the nation's factories increased by 9,000 positions in November.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Iraq will export oil Tuesday for the first time in more than six years,</B> Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed said Friday in Baghdad.  The limited exports, the first since Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait in 1990, will be supervised by the United Nations.  Iraq recently agreed to a U.N. plan that allows it to export $2 billion worth of oil each six months, as long as it spends the proceeds on food and medicine for its citizens.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Unemployment increased and job growth slowed in November,</B> according to Labor Department reports released Friday.  Labor said the overall jobless rate hit a four-month high of 5.4%, up 0.2% from October's figures.  The number of new non-farm jobs created during the month only totaled 118,000, down from 224,000 a month earlier.<BR>

<H3>Winning year-end tax tips </H3>
It may not be as romantic as dancing the night—and the year—away at a posh New Year's Eve party, but the right tax moves now could pay for your celebrating and a whole lot more. The dwindling days of 1996 hold a wealth of opportunities for the nimble of foot to scoop up extra tax deductions or make portfolio changes that will shave what you owe—or boost your refund—next spring. The year-end tax two-step must end the moment the ball drops on Times Square . . . or five hours later if you live in Hawaii.<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI><B>Tax swap Tango:</B> This year has been a painful one for bond investors. But at least you can turn that bad luck into a valuable tax deduction. Anyone with a significant loss on a bond, bond fund or even a stock fund can offset any capital gains you have for the year, plus up to $3,000 of other income, such as wages. But you do have to mind the "wash sale" rule, which denies the tax-saving power of the loss if you repurchase the same or a substantially identical security within a 30-day period.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Spinning off losers:</B>  If you've been holding on to a loser out of sentimentality or inertia, find a better place for that money before December 31 and write off the loss for 1996. Even if you haven't sold any investments for a profit this year, you may have capital-gains distributions on mutual fund shares. That income can be offset dollar for dollar with the loss.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Dancing around dividends:</B>  Most stock mutual funds will be distributing capital gains and dividends to shareholders sometime in December.  If you're a shareholder the day the distribution is announced, you get the income.  But it can be a costly mistake to buy just before dividends are paid.  The dividend payment basically amounts to a refund on part of your purchase price (the share value falls by the amount of the payout), but you have to pay tax on that amount.  Before you invest in a fund, then, call and ask for the expected ex-dividend date.  If you wait until after that date to buy your shares, you'll get the lower price and avoid the premature tax bill.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Charitable Cha Cha:</B>  Whether it's because of holiday-season generosity or the quest for under-the-wire tax deductions, charities receive a burst of donations at year-end. Assuming you itemize deductions, that last-minute check is tax-deductible as long as you drop it in the mail by December 31. Donations charged to a credit card by the 31st are deductible on this year's tax return, too, even if you don't get the bill until weeks into 1997.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Stepping up the value of gifts:</B>  Investors who make substantial cash gifts to charity have an opportunity to supercharge the tax breaks they receive. If you donate stock or mutual fund shares that have appreciated in value, you can deduct the current market value of the gift and avoid paying taxes on the profit.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Iraq will be allowed to resume selling oil,</B> after the United Nations today allowed the start of the "oil-for-food" arrangement.  The U.N. approval will allow Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil during the next six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian needs. Iraqi oil has been banned from the world market since the country's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.  The "oil for food" arrangement was concluded in May, but has been delayed until now.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Gasoline prices at the pump have leveled off </B> remaining almost the same for the past two weeks, according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations across the country.  For the most recent week, the average price for all grades of gasoline was $1.30 per gallon. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B> Orders for U.S. machine tools showed continued strength in October, </B>according to monthly reports released Monday by the Association for Manufacturing Technology and American Machine Tool Distributors' Association.  "Other than September, which reflected orders for the nation's largest industrial trade show, October was the best month of the year," said AMT president Albert Moore.<BR>

<H3>Netscape joins regional Bells in search for 'Net users</H3>
According to research firm PC-Meter, about 11 million households poked around the World Wide Web in October, up from 4.3 million during the same month a year ago.  Hot growth statistics by most standards, but for Netscape Communications, maker of the world's leading Web browser, the increase still isn't explosive enough.<BR>
<BR>
Feeling the heat from competitor Microsoft Corp., Netscape Tuesday unveiled an aggressive plan to jointly market its service with five of the eight regional Bell phone companies.  The deal with Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Pacific Telesis and SBC Communications (formerly Southwestern Bell) gives Netscape immediate access to 72 million Bell customers in 26 states and the District of Columbia.<BR>
<BR>
The long and the short of it is that Netscape now becomes the browser of choice for the Internet-access divisions of all five Bells.  Possibly as soon as next month, phone users in the affected areas will find advertisements touting Netscape's Navigator 3.0 browser in their phone bills.  Netscape will, in turn, allow users to sign up for the Bells' online services through <A HREF = "http://www.netscape.com/">its Web site</A>.  <BR>
<BR>
Netscape estimates that about 75% of the people who go online do so through one of its browsers, but Microsoft's Internet Explorer is coming on strong.  In an effort to boost its percentage, Microsoft is providing IE free of charge to most users.  <BR>
<BR>
Netcape shareholders applauded the announcement today.  Netscape stock moved from $60 to $65 on the day, before closing at $63.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Eight out of 10 of executives at manufacturing companies think 1997 will be better for business than 1996 has been,</B> according to the National Association of Purchasing Management's semiannual economic forecast, released Tuesday.  Executives polled for the NAPM survey predicted an average of 5.4% revenue growth next year, up from 4.9% this year.  NAPM's Ralph Kauffman says members are more optimistic than they were at this time a year ago, "with 80% of them expecting business in the first half of 1997 to be better than or the same as the second half of 1996."<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The U.S. racked up its worst quarterly trade deficit in history between July 1 and September 30,</B> the Commerce Department said Tuesday.  The current accounts deficit, which includes products, services, investments and government grants, grew 19% during the third quarter to $47.96 billion.  The previous quarterly record of $43.2 billion was set during the final three months of 1987.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A survey of top economists forecasts continued slow growth,</B> according to the Tuesday issue of <I>Blue Chip Economic Indicators</I> newsletter.  The poll of 52 economists from around the country settled on a predicted 2.2% growth rate for the nation's economy in 1997, down slightly from this year's 2.3% rate.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Little Rock, Arkansas brokerage house Stephens Inc. agreed Tuesday to pay a $225,000 fine,</B> settling allegations by the National Association of Securities Dealers.  NASD accused Stephens of "failing to adequately supervise its employees in connection with the public sale and distribution of mutual funds."  While the brokerage neither admitted nor denied the charges, it also agreed to hire an independent auditor to review its management policies.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>U.S. negotiators threatened to nix a World Trade Organization agreement unless language about "labor exploitation" is added,</B> diplomats emerging from sessions in Singapore said Tuesday.  The WTO is reportedly hammering out an agreement designed to break down various trade barriers, but the U.S. has said it won't sign unless a clause criticizing ultra-cheap labor is added.  Developing nations oppose the clause.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Orders for computer chips jumped 6.4% in November,</B> the Semiconductor Industry Association announced this week.  SIA said its book-to-bill ratio rose to 1.15 during the month, up from 1.11 in October.  That means manufacturers received $115 in new orders during November for ever $100 in computer chips they sent out—an indicator of strong demand for personal computers and other high-tech products.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Iraq's reentry into the world oil market sent prices sharply lower Tuesday,</B> as crude oil fell more than 3% on the New York Mercantile Exchange.  Iraq hasn't officially sold oil since it invaded neighboring Kuwait in 1990.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>Saving an hour a day—a little at a time </H3>
Okay, fess up: You have a messy desk, right?  Most of us do.  Chicago-based business consultant Jeffrey Mayer says that pile of paperwork costs you an average of an hour a day in lost productivity.<BR>
<BR>
"It's amazing how much time you can save by having the information you need organized and at your fingertips when you're looking for it," says Mayer.  "Rifling through stacks of papers or searching through poorly organized filing cabinets costs you 30 seconds here, five minutes there—and it all adds up."<BR>
<BR>
With your annual performance review right around the corner, cleaning up your desk and improving your productivity might not be a bad idea this time of year.  Mayer, who says he normally gets paid $1,000 for each desk he overhauls, has a few suggestions for improving your workplace productivity:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI>Start by taking all the paper on your desk and going through it immediately.  Most of it can probably be thrown away, Mayer says, and the rest should be filed away with a jacket that makes it easy to find again.  Take time at least once a week to repeat the process.  "Most papers on peoples' desks aren't really needed," Mayer says.  "If they were, they probably wouldn't have been sitting under a stack of other papers for six months."<BR>
<BR>
<LI>"Projects without a deadline don't get done," Mayer says.  He suggests making a master list of projects that need your attention, putting the most urgent at the top.  This also keeps you from wasting time on minor projects when more-important ones need your attention.  Update it daily or weekly.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Figure out when you do your best work and take advantage of that time.  "Some people are at their peak first thing in the morning, others in the middle of the afternoon," Mayer says.  Figure out what that time is for you, he suggests, and use it to work on projects near the top of your master list.  Use the time when you're not as sharp to take care of things farther down the scale of importance.<BR>

<LI><B>The Product Price Index for November registered its second straight month of a 0.4 percent increase,</B> according to Labor Department statistics released today.  Designed to show costs at the wholesale level, the PPI increase for this month was fueled by the largest increase in energy costs since April.  Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, wholesale prices for November increased only 0.1 percent after a 0.3 percent decrease in October.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Almost 20 percent of the Fortune 500 companies do not have a woman on their board,</B> according to a Catalyst group report. Of the 6,123 board seats available at Fortune 500 companies, women currently hold only 626 of them.  Furthermore, the pace at which women are becoming board members has slowed, from 9 percent in 1993 to  7 percent in 1994.<BR>

<H3>Despite high hopes, holiday shopping off to a slow start</H3>
The government threw cold water Thursday on early reports that the holiday shopping season is off to a rousing start.  The Commerce Department said retail sales totaled $206.1 billion in November, down from $206.8 billion a month earlier.  And those figures were "seasonally adjusted" to reflect the fact that Thanksgiving came later in the month than normal, which means the raw figures were even lower.<BR>
<BR>
Sales reports attract plenty of attention this time of year, since retail outlets bring in between one-quarter and one-half of their revenue between late November and early January.  Product makers and stores are hoping for a rebound from the weak 1995 holiday shopping season.<BR>
<BR>
Total retail sales fell 0.4% during the month, dragged down by a 2.6% downturn in new-car sales.  Disregarding the fall in car sales, overall sales figures gained 0.3%.  Still, though, the news isn't likely to be warmly embraced by the retail industry—popular gift categories "general merchandise" and "apparel," for example, both posted declines during the month.<BR>
<BR>
But Tracy Mullin, president of the National Retail Federation, says it's way too early to write off the 1996 holiday shopping season altogether.  "You never know how the season is going to pan out until it is over," she says.  The bulk of holiday sales take place in December, she points out.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>Consumer prices moved 0.3% higher in November,</B> the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Thursday.  Analysts said the gain was primarily fueled by surging energy prices, including the largest one-month rise in natural-gas prices since 1982.  Through the first 11 months of the year, BLS's Consumer Price Index has gained an annualized 3.3%—up from 2.5% in 1995.  The increase isn't widespread, though.  Excluding food and energy prices, inflation has risen this year at an annualized 2.7%, down from 3% a year ago.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The number of applicants for unemployment benefits fell for the third week in a row last week,</B> the Labor Department said Thursday.  New applications for jobless insurance fell to 317,000, down from 330,000 the week before and the lowest number recorded since August.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Mortgage rates went up this week for the first time in two months,</B> according to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation statistics released Thursday.  Thirty-year mortgages averaged 7.57% nationwide during the week, 15-year mortgages averaged 7.06% and the introductory rate on one-year adjustable rate home loans averaged 5.52%.  All three were higher this week than last.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The New York Stock Exchange began providing real-time market information to television networks Thursday,</B> scrapping the old policy of giving prices out on a 15-minute delayed basis.  A NYSE spokesman says the Cable News Network's CNNfn was the first to use the new information in an on-screen ticker, but other networks are expected to do the same before long.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The shortfall in the nation's employer-sponsored pension funds more than doubled in 1995,</B> the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation said Thursday.  The difference between pension obligations and assets in pension plans totaled $64 billion at the end of 1995, PBGC said, up from $31 billion at the beginning of the year.<BR>

<H3>The delicate art of holiday gift giving at the office</H3>
You may have planned ahead this year.  It's possible that you picked out the perfect gifts for clients and co-workers.  And you may have mailed the gifts out early to make sure everybody receives them before the calendar rolls over into 1997.<BR>
<BR>
More than likely, though, you didn't.<BR>
<BR>
"For many people, picking out gifts for work situations is a confusing process," says Boston-based marketing consultant Elizabeth Ferrarini.  "I think a lot of people keep putting it off until they have to deal with it at the last minute."<BR>
<BR>
Well, the last minute has arrived.  With little more than a week before the holiday season swings into full gear, there isn't much time left to pick out gifts, let along mail them to big-spending clients.  But be careful not to rush into any hasty gift-giving decisions, warns Jeffrey Nicholas, an organizational psychologist at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, Penn.  He says the decision about whether—or what—to give can be an important one for your career.<BR>
<BR>
"Negotiating the holiday season at work can be a slippery slope," says Nicholas, who studies workplace behavior.  "That image you develop through office parties and gift-giving may come back to haunt you, so it's important to deal with the season gracefully."<BR>
<BR>
In general, Nicholas says he would discourage people from giving gifts to co-workers unless the office holds an organized gift swap.  "It can turn into a popularity contest and interfere with business," he says.  Still, he admits that there are times when it's appropriate and important to make people feel appreciated—especially if raises and bonuses haven't been especially large in a given year.  The exception is secretaries, who should always get holiday gifts from their supervisors, Nicholas says.  <BR>
<BR>
Regardless of who is receiving it, though, a gift should be something modest.  "No employee should receive a lavish gift," he says.  "It will make them feel uncomfortable or obligated, and might lead to resentment and ill-feelings."<BR>
<BR>
Gift baskets of food are appropriate, Nicholas says.  Other gifts on his "appropriate" list include gift certificates for two-person dinners, pairs of theater tickets, scarves, gloves, stationery or books.  The bottom line, he says, is to "use good judgment and don't give people a feeling of obligation."  <BR>
<BR>
Buying gifts for customers or clients is a similar process, Ferrarini says.  Gold watches and crystal brandy snifters are out, she says, and "tasteful gifts" are in.  Food baskets are at the top of her list, also, because people can take them home or allow their co-workers to pick out what they like.  "Food is always a safe, neutral gift," Ferrarini says.  Nice pens or fancy desk accessories are also nice, as long as they don't have some company's logo splashed all over them.  "That's tacky," she says.<BR>
<BR>
Another option is to donate the money you would normally spend on such gifts to charity, then send a note to clients, customers and co-workers expressing your appreciation of them and telling them about the donation.  "It may not mean an end to fruit baskets and popcorn tins," explains Vanderbilt University management professor David Rados, "but a contribution to a worthy nonprofit lasts longer, affects a greater number of people and gives the benefactor a sense of personal satisfaction."<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>

President Clinton named most of the starters on his second-term economic team Friday, leaving only the head of the Council of Economic Advisors to be filled after Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Alan Blinder withdrew from consideration for that job.  Clinton said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin would remain on, calling him "the captain of our economic team."  He also named Chicago attorney Bill Daley—brother of Chicago mayor Richard Daley—as Commerce Secretary, Franklin Raines as budget director, Charlene Barshefsky as U.S. trade representative and Dan Tarullo as deputy director of the Council of Economic Advisors.<BR>
<BR>
The World Trade Organization reached agreements Friday on tariff reductions and child labor, working toward "a world where trade flows freely," according to the meeting's final proclamation.  Meeting in Singapore, representatives of 128 countries passed the Information Technology Agreement to eliminate tariffs on world trade in computer-related products.  The WTO also decided that the Switzerland-based International Labor Organization is the appropriate place to debate a brewing controversy over child labor in developing countries.<BR>
<BR>
The Securities and Exchange Commission amended its stock-manipulation complaint against the former chairman of Systems of Excellence on Friday, six weeks after first bringing charges against Charles Huttoe.  The SEC maintains that Huttoe used the Internet to distribute misleading company forecasts to boost the stock price, then sold his shares before the truth came out.  For more information on the case, read the November 8 News of the Day column, "If it sounds too good to be true..."  The amended charges maintain that Huttoe distributed $12 million in company stock to family members, $2.4 million more than the original complaint listed.<BR>
<BR>
The Congressional Budget Office is forecasting moderate economic growth and inflation for 1997, the non-partisan agency announced this week.  CBO's 2.3% economic-growth and 2.9% inflation-growth estimates for next year will be used to figure the government's budget deficit in upcoming fiscal negotiations between Congress and the White House.<BR>
<BR>
Business inventories posted their largest growth in three months during October, the Commerce Department said Friday.  Inventories totaled $1.011 trillion during the month, 0.5% higher than in September.  <BR>

<BR>
<H3>Rush is on for Boeing, McDonnell Douglas shares</H3>
Sunday, Boeing shook the business world by announcing it plans to absorb rival McDonnell Douglas, reducing the number of commercial airline makers from three to two.  "This, I believe, is a historic moment in aviation and aerospace," Boeing chief executive Phil Condit said of the merger, one of <A HREF = "dn12162.html">the 10 largest in history</A>.<BR>
<BR>
Wall Street certainly seemed to agree, rewarding Boeing and McDonnell Douglas on Monday with 4.4% and 20.2% price jumps, respectively.  If you didn't buy any shares in the firms today, though, analysts warned that the run-up may already be over.  <BR>
<BR>
For a little perspective, consider Bell Atlantic, MFS Communications and Pacific Telesis.  All three were part of blockbuster mergers this year (all appear on the Top 10 list, above) and the stock prices of all three jumped on the news.  Any shareholder who bought shares on the second day after the merger announcements, though, has been soundly disappointed in the months since.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE="SQUARE"> On April 22, Bell Atlantic announced a merger with Nynex Corp., the first union between two Baby Bell telephone companies.  The day of the announcement, shares jumped from $65 apiece to $67.25, a tidy 3.5% gain.  They headed south the very next day, though, hitting a low of $55.13 on September 6 and closing at $60.88 Monday.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE="SQUARE"> The case of MFS Communications is even more dramatic.  On August 26, WorldCom Inc. announced it was acquiring MFS for more than $14 billion.  MFS shares exploded on the news, gaining nearly 30% on the day and attracting everybody's attention.  In the three and a half months since, though, shares haven't even kept pace with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE="SQUARE"> Another acquisition target (like McDonnell Douglas and MFS), Pacific Telesis shares jumped 21.6% on April 1, when SBC Communications announced it was buying PacTel in a $17 billion deal.  In the eight and a half months since, PacTel has been a dog, gaining 3.6% to the S&P 500's 12.9%.<BR>
<BR>
In other words, remember the old investing adage: Buy on the rumor, sell on the news.  Or better yet, don't try to time the market at all.  Stick to your long-term investing plans regardless of who's merging with who. <BR>

<LI><B>Among companies that hire new college graduates, 70% prefer to "test drive" student-candidates before hiring them,</B> according to a new survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.  It's not surprising that employers prefer to select applicants from internship programs or cooperative education programs, says Patricia Coale, human resources director at Chesapeake Paper Products.  "We get the opportunity to evaluate a student's work habits and productivity, and the student gets a chance to determine whether our company is a good fit," she says.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Intel Corporation raised the bar for the computer speed record again Monday,</B> unveiling a machine that can perform more than 1 trillion calculations per second.  The previous record was roughly a billion calculations a second, held by Japan's Hitachi Corporation.  "It's an astonishing achievement," Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said of the Intel computer.  The computer will be used by the Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico to simulate nuclear explosions for government testing.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The nation's industrial output increased 0.9% in November to post its largest gain in nine months,</B> the Federal Reserve Board said Monday.  U.S. factories operated at 83.3% of their capacity during the month, up from 82.9% in October.  The Fed said half of the overall gain was attributable to General Motors assembly lines returning to action following an October strike.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Coca-Cola Company is taking aim at rival PepsiCo's Mountain Dew soft drink,</B> according to reports published Monday.  Reportedly, Coke plans to unveil its competing product, named Surge, in television ads during the Super Bowl football game in January.  A high-caffeine and high-sugar carbonated citrus drink, Mountain Dew is one of PepsiCo's biggest money makers.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Union boss Ron Carey declared victory over the weekend in his hard-fought re-election bid against James Hoffa,</B> retaining his post atop the 1.4 million-member Teamsters Union.  Saturday, Carey said the year-long battle with the son of legendary Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa is over, as he managed 52% of the rank-and-file vote.  <BR>

<B>Our selection of consumer, business and financial news<BR>
that matters to you, your money and your career.</B><BR>
<BR>
by <A HREF="mailto:snelson@kiplinger.com">Scott Bernard Nelson</A><BR>
<BR>
<I>Last Updated: Tuesday,  December 17, 4:29 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Check your (futures) broker's history online</H3>
The futures and derivatives industry has a reputation—deserved or not—for being a jargon-laden universe that's all but impossible for small investors to understand.  But it was the National Futures Association, not the Securities and Exchange Commission or the National Association of Securities Dealers, which Tuesday became the first regulator to allow investors to run broker background checks online.<BR>
<BR>
"Our goal is to make it as simple as possible for investors to access the information we have," says NFA president Robert Wilmouth.  "The obvious way to do that is to make effective use of the latest technology."<BR>
<BR>
NFA's Disciplinary Information Access Line, which has long been available over the phone (800-676-4632), is a clearinghouse of disciplinary information about the 10,000 brokerage houses and 150,000 brokers involved in buying or selling futures or derivative products.  Investors who check the database will find listed any disciplinary actions taken by the NFA since 1982, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission since 1975 and any of the 13 American futures exchanges since 1990.<BR>
<BR>
Starting Tuesday, investors can also submit queries—or send in complaints—to the DIAL system through the <A HREF = "http://www.nfa.futures.org/tellmore.html">NFA Web site</A> or via <A HREF = "mailto:public_affairs@nfa.futures.org">e-mail</A>.  For the time being, Wilmouth says, online requests will be responded to in the same way as phone calls: Through next-day mail courtesy of the U.S. Postal Service.  Eventually, though, information may be immediately available to curious investors.<BR>
<BR>
It won't be long before you can also run online background checks on stock and bond salespeople and firms, says NASD spokesman Reid Walker.  You can already file complaints about brokers or companies at the <A HREF = "http://www.nasdr.com/2100.htm">NASD Web site</A>, but you can only get background information by calling the association's toll-free phone number (800-289-9999).  <BR>
<BR>
"At some point, we hope to have a database available online for investors to get instant background information," Walker says.  "But there's no date set on that yet."<BR>
<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The Federal Reserve Board decided to leave short-term interest rates unchanged Tuesday,</B> leaving borrowing costs for millions of consumers and businesses unchanged for the time being.  The Fed meets eight times a year to discuss interest-rate strategy, but hasn't made any changes since January 31, when it lowered the federal funds rate to 5.25%.  The federal funds rate is technically just the interest rate that banks charge each other, but it also serves as a baseline interest rate for other consumer and business loans.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Ringing in the new year in style will cost you 2.5% more this year than last,</B> according to champagne producer Dom Perignon.  The Dom Perignon Celebration Index, which measures such items as rental of an Armani tuxedo, rental of a limousine and, of course, a bottle of Dom Perignon, went up 2.5% this year—0.3% less than the Consumer Price Index's rise over the first nine months of the year, the index's authors note.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Bankers Tuesday urged a Congressionally-appointed panel to change the federal bankruptcy code,</B> saying many consumers are allowed to escape their debts even though they have money to pay some of the obligations.  Speaking before the National Bankruptcy Review Commission in Washington, DC, representatives of banker groups said Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code—used in 70% of individual filings—should be altered to allow consumers to establish a repayment plan instead of simply erasing the debts.  Consumer groups argue that banks should tighten credit card lending requirements if they want to cut down on personal bankruptcies.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>New construction projects on homes and apartment buildings broke ground in November at the fastest clip in 16 months,</B> the Commerce Department announced Tuesday.  Monthly housing starts totaled 1.51 million, reversing two months of decline to top October's tally of 1.39 million.  The 9.2% gain is the best since July 1995.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Federal Trade Commission signed off Tuesday on a merger that would create the world's second-largest pharmaceutical company,</B> tentatively giving its stamp of approval to a union between Swiss firms Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz.  The combined entity, renamed Novartis, would be second in size only to Britain's Glaxo-Wellcome among drug firms.  The FTC said the decision is now open for 60 days of public comment before a final decision is made.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The 20 highest-paid women executives all earned more than $1 million this year for the first time,</B> according to the new issue of <I>Working Woman</I> magazine.  In the publication's 1995 survey, only 13 female execs earned that much.  Still, the top-ranked woman, Linda Wachner of Warnaco Group, made only about 18% as much as the highest-paid male executive, Lawrence Coss of Green Tree Financial.<BR>

<B>Our selection of consumer, business and financial news<BR>
that matters to you, your money and your career.</B><BR>
<BR>
by <A HREF="mailto:snelson@kiplinger.com">Scott Bernard Nelson</A><BR>
<BR>
<I>Last Updated: Wednesday,  December 18, 4:37 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Americans are handling credit cards better...or are they?</H3>
Americans' love affair with the credit card is starting to wear thin.  After banks tripped over each other trying to stuff multiple cards in every wallet over the past decade, consumer bankruptcies are expected to top one million this year for the first time.  <BR>
<BR>
Banks blame lax bankruptcy laws and poor individual money-management skills for the quandary, but consumer groups point the finger at banks' relatively loose lending rules.  Regardless, Congress is so concerned with the rise in personal bankruptcies that it recently appointed a bipartisan commission to study the issue and come up with legislative Band-Aids.  <BR>
<BR>
Against that backdrop, the American Bankers Association actually released some <I>good </I>news on the credit-card front Wednesday: The percentage of cardholders who pay their bills late went down for the first time in two years during the third quarter.  Late payments fell from 3.66% of all bills during the April-through-June quarter to 3.48% in the July-through-September one.<BR>
<BR>
"The drop indicates that banks and consumers have taken steps to control late payments," says ABA chief economist James Chessen.  "Slowed consumer spending in the quarter along with banks' efforts to tighten credit standards and write off problem loans combined to bring late payments down."<BR>
<BR>
As you might expect, though, the news from the third-quarter study wasn't all rosy.  The delinquency rate, which measures the percentage of cardholders more than 30 days overdue on a bill, is "still high by historical standards," Chessen admits.  He also worries that consumers who are already having trouble paying their bills may worsen the situation buying holiday gifts.<BR>
<BR>
"It's very easy to overspend in December and then be surprised in January when the bills arrive," Chessen says.  "We hope that the third-quarter drop is a sign that consumers are taking control of their finances, rather than just taking a break before hitting the next holiday sale."<BR>
<BR>
To avoid the "holiday credit hangover," he suggests the following:<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"> Talk with creditors to arrange alternate payment plans.  "Trying to hide makes the problem worse," he says.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"> Don't charge anything new on your cards until you can afford to pay your existing bills each month.<BR>
<BR>
<LI TYPE = "SQUARE"> Contact the Consumer Credit Counseling Service (800-388-2227) for help working through credit problems.<BR>

<LI><B>Government accountants forecast that a plan to privatize Social Security would boost most retirement incomes,</B> <I>The Dallas Morning News</I> reported Wednesday.  Privatization is the most controversial option among the three under consideration by the Social Security Advisory Council, which is trying to find a way to keep the program solvent.  Other options include maintaining most of the current system, and cutting benefits while raising taxes.  The newspaper obtained the government estimates through the Freedom of Information Act.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Romania announced the creation of its first stock market Wednesday,</B> offering shares in 1,342 formerly state-run firms.  The market will be patterned after the Nasdaq over-the-counter market in the U.S., and Nasdaq will help with its development.  "The proof of Romania's transition to a free-market economy is evident here today," Romanian diplomat Napoleon Pop said at a kick-off ceremony at Nasdaq headquarters in Washington, DC.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Losses to software firms because of pirated business programs rose 9% last year to $13.1 billion,</B> according to a study released Wednesday by International Planning and Research in Redmond, Wash.  Jointly funded by the Software Publishers Association and the Business Software Alliance, the study found piracy increasing overseas in 1995 while it dropped in the U.S.  The report said the worst offenders were Vietnam, where 99% of office software is stolen, El Salvador (97%), China and Oman (96%) and Russia (94%).  The U.S. piracy rate is about 26%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The European Commission told Boeing and McDonnell Douglas on Wednesday that their planned merger may violate fair-trade standards in Europe,</B> saying it will have to review the proposal "with a fine-tooth comb."  The commission can block foreign mergers if the companies do significant business in Europe.  For more information about the merger, read <A HREF = "dn1216.html">Monday's News of the Day column</A>.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Workers disgruntled over year-end bonuses set fire to a Sanyo production plant in Thailand on Wednesday,</B> forcing an evacuation of the Bangkok facility.  Sanyo said last year's bonus equaled 5.75 months worth of pay for employees, but this year's will only equal three months' pay because of a slowdown in sales.  Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh said police are searching for suspects.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The tight labor market has boosted salaries this year for college graduates in traditional low-paying majors,</B> according to a survey released this week by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.  The biggest starting-salary gains between 1995 and 1996 were posted by journalism and political science students, NACE said, with 14.9% and 9.2% increases, respectively.  Starting salaries also increased by more than 5% for 1996 graduates in foreign languages, psychology, advertising and public relations.<BR>

<BR>
<I>Last Updated: Thursday,  December 19, 5:06 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Three years later, free-trade debate begins anew</H3>
Three years after the North American Free-Trade Agreement was approved over the impassioned objections of Ross Perot and the nation's labor unions, an academic study released Thursday found that the gloom-and-doom predictions of hundreds of thousands of job losses were off base.  Just as wrong, though, were claims by NAFTA's backers that the pact would create huge job gains.  In fact, the study found, the number of jobs gained and lost as a result of the trade agreement are pretty much a wash so far.<BR>
<BR>
"The impact on trade-related employment during the first three years after NAFTA is estimated to be, at the very least, a near zero net impact, and more likely, a moderately positive number," the government-funded study by researchers at the University of California at Los Angeles concludes.<BR>
<BR>
Moderate is the key word.  The study estimates that the net gain to the U.S. since the agreement took effect at the beginning of 1994 is fewer than 3,000 jobs—nowhere near the huge numbers both sides threw around during the Congressional hearings on NAFTA.  That's also a relatively insignificant percentage of the 125 million total jobs in the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
But the net numbers don't tell the whole story, admits UCLA professor and study co-author Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda.  Increased imports to the U.S. because of NAFTA cost Americans an estimated 28,168 jobs over the past three years, Ojeda says, while increased exports created 31,158 positions in their place.  So there was an impact on U.S. jobs, just not the strong trend in either direction that combatants predicted ahead of time.<BR>
<BR>
But labor unions, which fear the loss of high-paying union jobs to cheaper Mexican workers, weren't pacified by the UCLA study.  In a statement, AFL-CIO economist Mark Anderson said the jobs being created might not pay as well as those lost.<BR>
<BR>
"Clearly the benefits [of NAFTA] went to corporate elites in the U.S. and Mexico," Anderson said.  "From our perspective, the job situation has been negative in the U.S. [as a result]."<BR>
<BR>
You'll probably hear more from both sides of the debate in the near future, since the Clinton administration is scheduled to report to Congress in 1997 about NAFTA's impact on jobs.  More information and (for $20) a copy of the report are available on UCLA's <A HREF = "http://naid.sppsr.ucla.edu/">North American Integration & Development Center Web site</A>.  <BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The U.S. trade deficit fell more than 30% in October to hit a seven-month low,</B> the Commerce Department announced Thursday.  The overall trade imbalance totaled $7.99 billion during the month, down from September's $11.44 billion—the second-worst month on record.  Exports rose 4.2% in October to a record $71.74 billion, while imports moved 0.7% lower to $79.72 billion.  Year-to-date through October 31, the deficit is running at an annualized clip of $113.4 billion, 7.9% higher than 1995's trade shortfall.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Television shows may start carrying voluntary movie-like ratings as soon as January,</B> the Motion Picture Association of America announced Thursday.  Bowing to federal government pressure, the TV industry will display a show's rating in the upper left hand corner for the first 15 seconds.  The ratings will also be available in newspaper listings.  The six-tier age-based system ranges from "TV-G," for shows suitable for all ages, to "TV-M," for mature audiences.  Eventually, consumers will be able to program their television sets to block out shows with ratings they find objectionable.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Former investment adviser Mark Ferber was sentenced to 33 months in prison and fined $1.65 million Thursday,</B> after federal prosecutors argued that he violated his obligation to give unbiased financial advice to government agencies.  Ferber, the ex-Boston chief of Lazard Freres, was allegedly paid $800,000 by Merrill Lynch to direct business its way, but didn't tell that to various government agencies he sold bonds to.  Neither Merrill Lynch nor Lazard Freres admitted wrongdoing, but the firms paid a combined $24 million in government fines and restitution to resolve the federal complaint.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Travelers with ValuJet plane tickets may find themselves stranded over the holidays,</B> the Federal Aviation Administration said this week.  FAA officials said ValuJet sold tickets to West Palm Beach and Fort Myers, Fla., and Dallas-Forth Worth, Texas, earlier this month assuming they would receive regulatory approval for those routes before the holiday travel season.  That hasn't happened yet, though, so ValuJet is trying to arrange charter flights for passengers flying to those cities between now and January 6.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Japanese stocks fell Thursday to their lowest level since December 21 of last year,</B> dragged down by investor concerns about the languishing Japanese economy.  The Nikkei index fell 522.36 points—or 2.6%—its third-largest drop of the year.  Analysts said Tokyo traders were shaken by the government's Wednesday forecast that the economy will grow by 1.9% in fiscal year 1997, the lowest official estimate since the 1950s.<BR>

<I>Last Updated: Friday,  December 20, 5:53 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Don't chase last-year's winners, newsletter editor warns</H3>
Throughout the 1980s, the fortunes of the Boston Celtics basketball team were closely tied to one man: Larry Bird.  When he had a good night, the Celtics usually won.  If he missed a few clutch shots down the stretch, on the other hand, the Beantown squad more than likely lost.  <BR>
<BR>
At some point toward the end of Bird's career, a researcher at a Boston university decided to see if there was any mathematic evidence behind the star player's much-heralded "hot streaks."  Fans, teammates, coaches and even opponents swore that when Bird was feeling good, he could make baskets almost at will.  When he wasn't feeling as well, everyone agreed, he was more likely to miss shots until he worked his way into another hot streak.<BR>
<BR>
Despite the near universal belief in Bird's—and other athletes'— hot streaks, it turned out that there was no statistical correlation between whether Bird made his last basket and whether he made his next one.  Throughout his career, he managed almost exactly the same shooting percentage after missed shots as he did after ones he made—each shot turned out to be an independent act unrelated to the one before.<BR>
<BR>
Mark Hulbert, editor of <I>The Hulbert Financial Digest</I> newsletter, sees the same psychological effect at work in investors' annual rush to find out which mutual funds top the performance rankings.  "I think most investors are convinced that whichever fund is at the top of the heap at year-end will, for whatever reason, continue to outperform the pack," Hulbert says.  "But that just doesn't hold up when you look at the numbers."<BR>
<BR>
According to Morningstar, publisher of the <I>Morningstar Mutual Funds</I> directory, the top 20 stock funds in the U.S. each year outperformed the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index by an average of 34% since 1980.  The one-year performances didn't translate into hot returns the next, though.  If an investor were to shift her investments into those 20 top performers at the end of each year, she would have lagged the market by 1% annually over the past 16 years.  "You'd have been better off in an index fund than chasing the winners every year," says Morningstar spokesman Jim Raker.<BR>
<BR>
If you insist on using past performance as a gauge for fund quality, Hulbert suggests finding a fund that has topped the market over at least a 10-year period.  Less than that and, like Larry Bird's hot streaks, there is no statistical correlation.  "Performance over short periods is nothing but noise," Hulbert says.  "People love to read about it and it's exciting—but it's not helpful to investors."<BR>
<BR>
So where does that leave investors?  For one thing, it should leave them wary of the inevitable rash of year-end media reports touting lists of top funds.  In Monday's special holiday edition of <I>News of the Day</I>, we'll discuss what you should pay attention to when creating a solid portfolio.<BR>

<LI><B>The U.S. economy slowed down considerably during the third quarter,</B> the Commerce Department announced Friday.  The nation's gross domestic product grew at an annualized rate of 2.1% during the July-through-August quarter, down from 4.7% during the prior three months.  The news buoyed the stock markets in early trading Friday, as traders interpreted it to mean the Federal Reserve Board won't need to raise interest rates any time soon.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Eight hundred negotiators from 160 countries reached agreement Friday on the first global agreement on Internet piracy,</B> following three weeks of sometimes tense debate.  If approved by the national governments, the pact will protect digitally-transmitted audio recordings and the rights of their performers in cyberspace.  As with software or other copyrights, though, the measure's effectiveness will depend upon how strictly it is enforced in each country.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Federal Reserve Board agreed Friday to let banks get more involved in the investment business,</B> raising the ceiling on what banks can earn from securities underwriting.  Under current law, banks can only earn 10% of their revenues from investment sales, but the new regulation would raise that ceiling to 25%.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is not planning to change its methodology any time soon,</B> Commissioner Katharine Abraham said this week.  Abraham was responding to the recent <A HREF = "dn1204.html">Boskin Report</A>, which asserts that BLS's consumer price index overstates inflation by 1.1 percentage points.  She thinks the overstatement is much smaller, and that it will take two years of study or more to pin it down more precisely.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Holiday travelers may have to press travel agents before they'll get the lowest rates available,</B> the U.S. Public Interest Research Group said this week.  On November 19, the group made calls to 325 travel agents asking for the cheapest fares given a made-up set of circumstances.  PIRG said the 325 agents responded with 180 different options.  You have to let them know you really want the lowest fare," says PIRG's Janice Shields.  "When they give you a fare, ask them whether that's really the lowest, and they will look again."<BR>

<I>Editor's Note:  In recognition of the holidays, the main News of the Day item won't be updated again until Monday, December 30.  The In Brief section, on the other hand, will be updated on Thursday and Friday, December 26 and 27.</I><BR>

<I>Last Updated: Monday,  December 23, 5:01 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>A 12-step program for mutual fund investors</H3>
In <A HREF = "dn1220.html">Friday's News of the Day</A> column, newsletter editor Mark Hulbert argued that short-term total-return figures (of the type touted in countless year-end fund lists) should not be a deciding factor when you're in the market for mutual funds.  That, of course, begs the question: How <I>should </I>investors go about constructing a fund portfolio?  To answer that, we turned to "Kiplinger Evergreen"—solid advice that is oft repeated in Kiplinger newsletters, television reports, newspaper columns, videotapes, magazine articles and online news.<BR>
<BR>
The following list is adapted primarily from Mark Solheim's "10 Steps to Picking a Fund" from <I>Kiplinger's Mutual Funds '95</I> and Manuel Schiffres' "Picking Funds: How to Get in Gear" from the 1996 edition of the same publication.  This is only a starting point, but we hope you find it useful.  Happy holidays!<BR>
<BR>
1. Before pouring money into investments, set aside an emergency fund equal to about three months of your after-tax income.  Put it in a safe place like an interest-bearing bank account or money market mutual fund.  It may be less exciting than picking out investments, but an emergency fund will keep you from derailing your investment plans if unexpected expenses pop up.<BR>
<BR>
2. Avoid the pitfall of trying to find the best fund.  There is no best fund—except, of course, in hindsight.  Instead, focus on building a good portfolio of funds that work well together.  It may help to think of the pieces of your investment puzzle like the instruments in an orchestra.  Different funds are right for different purposes, and they only make music—and money—when they are held together in the right proportion.<BR>
<BR>
3. You can ignore 50% of all mutual funds—and make the selection process 50% easier—by deciding to buy only through a broker or only from the funds. There are advantages to both, and which you choose is in large part a measure of your personality.  A sales fee is a broker's commission; it doesn't go to the portfolio manager to buy you better asset management or pay for more analysts.  What it should buy you is sage advice from a broker.  So if you want professional hand-holding in the fund-selection process, go through a broker and pay the sales charge.  If, on the other hand, you do all the work selecting an appropriate fund, you should keep the commission for yourself—by choosing a no-load fund.<BR>
<BR>
4. Decide when you'll need the money.  In broad terms, the longer your time horizon, the more aggressively you can afford to invest.  The shorter your anticipated investing period, the less risk you should take.  That's because funds that deliver the biggest returns over time are also the most volatile and are likely to suffer the most in bear markets.  A rule of thumb: For investing periods of less than three years, take minimal risks and don't put more than one-third of your portfolio into stocks.<BR>
<BR>
5. Using your time frame (see above) and tolerance for risk, pick your fund universe.  Stock funds are usually appropriate for long-term goals, such as your kids' college tuition or your retirement.  You add bond funds to the mix when you want to reduce risk or need a steady stream of income.  Municipal bond funds are attractive to people in high tax brackets because the interest they pay is exempt from federal taxes (sometimes state taxes, too).<BR>
<BR>
6. Do a little homework and decide which categories within each of the universes appeal to you.  There are almost an infinite number of ways to cut the pie, but a general breakdown could be made along large-, medium- and small-company stocks, international stocks, bonds and cash-like securities.  A well-diversified portfolio will include funds from several different categories, as well as from distinct sub-categories such as growth-stock and value-stock funds.<BR>
<BR>
7. Compare long-term results of funds for each category you're interested in.  Look for funds that have outperformed the average fund in their categories or the appropriate benchmark index (i.e. Standard and Poor's 500-stock index for large-cap stocks, Russell 2000 index for small caps) over at least a five-year period.  One great year can make a mediocre fund's long-term numbers look good, though, so check for consistency, too.  You can find year-to-year returns listed in the periodic mutual fund rankings in financial magazines or in the library resources discussed below.  <BR>
<BR>
8. Once you've examined a fund's track record, check to see if those responsible for the record are still at the helm.  After all, you're investing in the talent of the fund managers.  In most cases, a new manager means you should probably disregard the fund's previous performance altogether and look elsewhere.  There are some exceptions, though.  At some of the biggest fund families, such as Fidelity and T. Rowe Price, funds may change hands often, but the managers tend to be well-qualified.  Also, some of the best buys in mutual funds come when an experienced manager with a proven track record decides to start a new fund.<BR>
<BR>
9. By this point, you should have winnowed your list to about a dozen good funds in each category, at most.  Narrow things down further by comparing expense ratios—the percentage of assets shareholders pay management each year for running the fund.  Eliminate any fund with expenses that seem much higher than those of its peers.  And, all other things being equal, drop any fund from consideration that includes a 12b-1 fee, which covers "marketing expenses."  In most cases, that's just another way to pay brokers for pushing the fund.<BR>
<BR>
10. Cross off any fund that has a higher minimum investment than you're willing to pay.  Some funds also accept minimum initial investments as low as $25 per month if you sign up for regular direct-deposit investments.<BR>
<BR>
11. Go to any well-stocked library and look up the funds you have left on your list in <I>Morningstar Mutual Funds</I>.  Morningstar provides relatively detailed information about funds in a plain-English format which makes it easier to distinguish between funds.<BR>
<BR>
12. Once you've made an investment decision, call the fund's toll-free number and ask for a prospectus to be sent out.  Prospectuses tend to be heavy on legalese and jargon, so don't hang on every word.  Scan the sections on investment objectives and policies, as well as the special risks the fund takes.  If you have questions, call the fund's number again to talk to a representative.  A polite, well-informed phone rep can be the final deciding factor between a otherwise equal investments, since that's yet another indication of a first-class fund.<BR>

<H3>In brief</H3>
<UL> 
<LI><B>The Dow Jones industrial average set a new high-water mark Friday,</B> gaining 14.23 points to close at 6,560.91.  Analysts attributed the Dow's late-week rally to investors moving out of high-tech stocks into the larger names they recognize—many of which make up the Dow.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods fell 1.6% in November,</B> the first monthly decline since August.  The Commerce Department said Friday that orders totaled $171.8 billion in November, down from a revised $174.6 billion a month earlier.  Durable goods include products designed to last more than three years, such as vehicles and TK.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Struggling comic book company Marvel Entertainment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy Friday,</B> in a reorganization plan that gives majority stockholder Ron Perelman even greater control.  Under the plan, Perelman—who already owns more than 80% of Marvel—will buy additional shares worth $365 million.  Eight lawsuits were immediately filed by bondholder groups angered that Perelman's investment company would get the new shares at a discount from Marvel's market price.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A New Orleans judge approved a settlement Friday on General Motors' allegedly dangerous side-mounted gas tanks,</B> giving $1,000 certificates to 5.8 million GM truck owners.  But GM said it may appeal the decision not over the $1,000 certificates, but over the $28 million in plaintiffs' legal fees it was ordered to pay.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Southwest Airlines took steps Friday to incite the first fare war of the new year,</B> announcing "Flying Start" fares as low as $29 round-trip.  Low-price tickets under the plan will be available through January 23 for travel between January 1 and June 2.  A Southwest spokesman said some holiday periods may be excluded from the sale prices.<BR>

<I>Editor's Note:  In celebration of the holidays, News of the Day won't be updated again until next year—Thursday, January 2 to be exact.</I><BR>
<BR>
by <A HREF="mailto:snelson@kiplinger.com">Scott Bernard Nelson</A><BR>
<BR>
<I>Last Updated: Monday,  December 30, 5:56 p.m. EST</I><BR>
<BR>
<H3>Sizing up the mags' fund-picking prowess</H3>
How about a little year-end investing quiz?  Question one: True or false, fewer than one in three U.S. stock mutual funds beats the overall market in a given year?  True.  Question two: True or false, the major personal-finance magazines are good at steering investors toward that top 30% of the fund universe?  Um . . .  ah . . . well . . .<BR>
<BR>
As it turns out, the four major players in the personal-finance magazine world—in order of circulation, <I>Money</I>, <I>Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine</I>, <I>Smart Money</I> and <I>Worth</I>—are about as talented at selecting mutual funds as fund managers are at picking stocks.  In other words, some are better than others, but the group's historical performance overall is not as good as most editors would like it to be.  <BR>
<BR>
Although <I>Kiplinger's </I>is celebrating its 50th anniversary and <I>Money </I>was founded in 1972, the competition in selecting specific funds didn't heat up until the mid- to late-1980s.  <I>Smart Money</I> and <I>Worth</I> both appeared on the scene in 1992, well into the current personal investing boom, so fund selection has been a staple at both throughout their short lives.  <BR>
<BR>
To evaluate the magazines' fund-picking prowess, <I>Kiplinger Online</I> calculated the annual returns of stock mutual-fund portfolios suggested by cover stories over the past 25 years.  "Twenty great funds to buy now," "The 10 funds for the '90s," and "Good funds for all time" are a few examples of the headlines that appeared on such covers.<BR>
<BR>
We assumed that an equal amount of money was invested in each recommended fund on the 15th of the month before the magazines' cover dates—approximately when subscribers receive their copies.  Using data provided by Micropal, Inc. of Des Moines, Iowa, we then compared each portfolio's total return over one, three, five and ten years to that of the U.S. market, using the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index as a proxy.  <BR>
<BR>
Overall, fewer than one-third of the fund portfolios lauded in cover stories beat the S&P 500 in the 12 months following publication.  Even more striking, only 12.5% of the model portfolios topped the market on a longer-term basis.  <BR>
<BR>
To be fair, not all the cover-story portfolios were intended to top the S&P 500—some suggested safe places to stash your money instead.  In February 1995, for example, <I>Money </I>highlighted the "Eight most dependable mutual funds" on its cover.  The funds were selected for their long-term durability rather than whether they would beat the U.S. market over the next two years.<BR>
<BR>
Regardless, on an individual basis, none of the publications would make Warren Buffet proud—all four had more lagging portfolios than outperforming ones.  But there has been a range in performance levels.  <I>Smart Money</I>, for example, is the jack-rabbit of the bunch.  Four of the five <I>Smart Money</I> cover-story portfolios beat the market in the first year after publication, doubling it in one case.  But the returns dropped off fast.  Only one portfolio, from "The Smart Money Seven" in June 1993, topped the S&P 500 over a longer time horizon (three years) and none beat the market between publication and Monday's close.<BR>
<BR>
Of the 10 <I>Kiplinger's </I>cover-story portfolios in the survey, three topped the market over one, three, five and, in one case, 10 years.  Three others beat the S&P 500 over the first 12 months before dropping off.  As with <I>Smart Money's</I> picks, though, none of the portfolios topped the market between publication and now.<BR>
<BR>
The other two magazines fared even worse.  <I>Worth </I>had only three covers touting specific funds, and managed only one portfolio that beat the market over the first year.  And despite the largest number of cover stories included in the survey with 14, <I>Money </I>bettered the S&P 500 over the first year only once in a head-to-head dual.<BR>
<BR>
Clearly, the experts—whether portfolio managers or financial journalists—can't be sure at any given time where the markets are heading and which funds will be carried along for the ride.  With that in mind, you may want to forget trying to pick the <I>best </I>investment and concentrate on picking a portfolio of <I>good </I>ones.  The important thing is simply to be in the market with a well-diversified portfolio when good things happen, not whether you have the single-best mutual fund.<BR>
<BR>
And that's where the personal-finance magazines come in.  They offer plenty of information on understanding your time frame and risk profile and picking good long-term investments—even if they don't pinpoint which specific investment is best today.  Read them for the former reasons and not the latter, and you'll profit in the long run.  <BR>

<H2>Questions & Answers</H2> 
 
Subscribers to Kiplinger publications often ask for amplification of  
stories, or want to know more about issues that are important to them or 
their businesses.   <BR>
<BR> 
<B>Q.  Are you assuming no solution to the Federal budget deficit problem - 
that is, the Federal budget will not be balanced within seven years?</B>
<P>
<B>A.</B>  Our view is that assuming there IS a budget deal, there still 
will be a deficit after 
seven years.  This may occur because of a deep recession, of weaker growth than is 
embedded in the forecasts behind the budget numbers, or simply the fact that in both the 
GOP and Clinton plans, tough decisions on exactly where to cut spending are deferred 
until the later years of the seven-year deal, calling into question whether they will occur. 
<P> 
Or, you could look at the proposed tax cuts, whose cost in revenue would begin to 
accelerate around the eighth year, which happens to lie outside the budget debate. 
<P> 
For all or any of the above reasons, we foresee a deficit.  Of course, it would be higher 
without any budget deal. 
<P> 
<B>Q.  Given all the commotion about the Federal budget impasse, I would 
appreciate your re-educating me about how we got to where we are now.</B>
<P>
<B>A.</B>  President Clinton's budget proposal didn't carry through 
Congress.  But the House and 
Senate did pass their own budget plan, which the President vetoed in November.  At that 
point neither party wanted to start over.  So each set out to modify what they began with. 
<P> 
As a practical matter, both the House and Senate missed the dates by which they were 
supposed to respond after they rejected President Clinton's proposed budget.  But, as has 
often been said by members of both parties, no one has ever gone to jail for violating the 
federal budget law. 
<P>
<B>Q.  When should I consider refinancing my mortgage?</B>
<P>
<B>A.</B>  The rule of thumb used to be that the mortgage rate you pay 
in refinancing should be 2 percentage points below the rate in your old 
loan.  That assumes you haven't held the loan very long or that you 
never plan to pay it off completely.  The rule is now closer to one 
percentage point because more lenders are now waiving fees or folding 
the closing costs into the mortgage itself.

<P>
<B>Account executive.</B> The title given by some brokerage firms to their stockbrokers. Other variations on the title include registered representative, financial counselor and financial consultant.
<P>
<B>Accrued interest.</B> Interest that is due but hasn't yet been paid. It most often comes into play when you buy bonds in the secondary market. Bonds usually pay interest every six months, but it is earned (accrued) by bondholders every month. If you bu


y a bond halfway between interest payment dates, you must pay the seller for the three months' interest accrued but not yet received. You get the money back three months later when you receive the interest payment for the entire six-month period.
<P>
<B>Alpha.</B> A mathematical measure of price volatility that attempts to isolate the price movements of a stock from those of the market. A stock with a high alpha is expected to perform well regardless of what happens to the market as a whole. (See also


 beta.)
<P>
<B>American depositary receipt.</B> Certificates traded on U.S. stock exchanges or over the counter, representing ownership of a specific number of shares of a foreign stock.
<P>
<B>Annuity.</B> A series of regular payments, usually from an insurance company, guaranteed to continue for a specific time, usually the annuitant's lifetime, in exchange for a single payment or a series of payments to the company. With a deferred annuity


, payments begin sometime in the future. With an immediate annuity, payments begin right away. A fixed annuity pays a fixed income stream for the life of the contract. With a variable annuity, the payments may change according to the relative investment s


uccess of the insurance company.
<P>
<B>Arbitrage.</B> An attempt to profit from momentary price differences that can develop when a security or commodity is traded on two different exchanges. To take advantage of such differences, an arbitrageur would buy in the market where the price is lo


wer and simultaneously sell in the market where the price is higher.
<P>
<B>At-the-market.</B> When you buy or sell a security "at-the-market," the broker will execute your trade at the next available price.
<P>
<A NAME="B">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Back-end load.</B> A fee charged by mutual funds to investors who sell their shares before owning them for a specified time.
<P>
<B>Back office.</B> The support operations of a brokerage firm that don't deal directly with customers. "Back office problems" usually refers to slow paperwork or other bottlenecks in the execution of customers' orders.
<P>
<B>Bearer bond.</B> Also called a coupon bond, it is not registered in anyone's name. Rather, whoever holds the bond (the "bearer") is entitled to collect interest payments merely by cutting off and mailing in the attached coupons at the proper time. Bear


er bonds are no longer being issued.
<P>
<B>Bearish.</B> A bear thinks the market is going to go down. This makes bearish the opposite of bullish.
<P>
<B>Beta.</B> A measure of price volatility that relates the stock or mutual fund to the market as a whole. A stock or fund with a beta higher than 1 is expected to move up or down more than the market. A beta below 1 indicates a stock or fund that usually


 jumps up and down less than the market.
<P>
<B>Bid/asked.</B> Bid is the price a buyer is willing to pay; asked is the price the seller will take. The difference, known as the spread, is the broker's share of the transaction.
<P>
<B>Blue chips.</B> There is no set definition of a blue-chip stock, but most would agree it has at least three characteristics: It is issued by a well-known, respected company, has a good record of earnings and dividend payments, and is widely held by inv


estors.
<P>
<B>Boiler room.</B> A blanket term used to describe the place of origin of high-pressure telephone sales techniques, usually involving cold calls to unsuspecting customers who would be better off without whatever is being offered to them.
<P>
<B>Bond.</B> An interest-bearing security that obligates the issuer to pay a specified amount of interest for a specified time, usually several years, and then repay the bondholder the face amount of the bond. Bonds issued by corporations are backed by co


rporate assets; in case of default, the bondholders have a legal claim on those assets. Bonds issued by government agencies may or may not be collateralized. Interest from corporate bonds is taxable; interest from municipal bonds, which are issued by stat


e and local governments, is free of federal income taxes and, usually, income taxes of the issuing jurisdiction. Interest from Treasury bonds, issued by the federal government, is free of state and local income taxes but subject to federal taxes.
<P>
<B>Bond rating.</B> A judgment about the ability of the bond issuer to fulfill its obligation to pay interest and repay the principal when due. The best-known bond-rating companies are Standard & Poor's and Moody's. Their rating systems, although slightly


 different, both use a letter-grade system, with triple-A the highest rating and C or D the lowest.
<P>
<B>Book value.</B> For investing purposes, this is the net-asset value of a company, determined by subtracting its liabilities from its assets. Dividing the result by the number of shares of common stock issued by the company yields the book value per share,
 which can be used as a relative gauge of the stock's value.
<P>
<B>Brokered CD.</B> A large-denomination certificate of deposit sold by a bank to a brokerage, which slices it up into smaller pieces and sells the pieces to its customers.
<P>
<B>Bullish.</B> A bull is someone who thinks the market is going to go up, which makes bullish the opposite of bearish.
<P>
<A NAME="C">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<A NAME="call">
<B>Call.</B> <A HREF="#options">See Options.</A>
<P>
<B>Capital gain or loss.</B> The difference between the price at which you buy an investment and the price at which you sell it. Adding the capital gain or loss to the income received from the investment yields the total return.
<P>
<B>Certificate of deposit.</B> Usually called a CD, a certificate of deposit is a short- to medium-term instrument (one month to five years) that is issued by a bank or savings and loan association to pay interest at a rate higher than that paid by a pass


book account. CD rates move up and down with general market interest rates. There is usually a penalty for early withdrawal.
<P>
<B>Charting.</B> Another name for technical analysis.
<P>
<B>Churning.</B> Excessive buying and selling in a customer's account undertaken to generate commissions for the broker.
<P>
<B>Closed-end investment company.</B> Also called a closed-end fund, it is a pooled investment fund that issues a set number of shares and then no more. When the initial offering of shares is sold out, the closed-end fund trades on the secondary market at


 a price determined by investor supply and demand. For contrast, see the definition of mutual fund.
<P>
<B>Cold calling.</B> The practice of brokers making unsolicited calls to people they don't know in an attempt to drum up business.
<P>
<B>Commercial paper.</B> Short-term IOUs issued by corporations without collateral. They are bought in large quantities by money-market funds.
<P>
<B>Common stock.</B> A share of ownership in a corporation, which entitles its owner to all the risks and rewards that go with it. In case of bankruptcy, common stockholders' claims on company assets are inferior to those of bondholders. For contrast, see


 preferred stock.
<P>
<B>Contrarian.</B> An investor who thinks and acts in opposition to the conventional wisdom. When the majority of investors are bearish, a contrarian is bullish, and vice versa.
<P>
<B>Convertible bond.</B> A bond that is exchangeable for a predetermined number of shares of common stock in the same company. The appeal of a convertible is that it gives you a chance to cash in if the stock price of the company soars. Some preferred sto


ck is also convertible to common stock.
<P>
<A NAME="D">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Debenture.</B> A corporate IOU that is not backed by the company's assets and is therefore somewhat riskier than a bond.
<P>
<B>Discount broker. </B>A cut-rate firm that executes orders but provides little if anything in the way of research or other investment aids.
<P>
<B>Discretionary account.</B> A brokerage account in which the customer has given the broker the authority to buy and sell securities at his or her discretion—that is, without checking with the customer first.
<P>
<B>Dividend.</B> A share of company earnings paid out to stockholders. Dividends are declared by the board of directors and paid quarterly. Most are paid as cash, but they are sometimes paid in the form of additional shares of stock.
<P>
<B>Dividend reinvestment plan.</B> Also called a DRIP, this is a program under which the company automatically reinvests a shareholder's cash dividends in additional shares of common stock, often with no brokerage charge to the shareholder.
<P>
<B>Dollar-cost averaging.</B> A program of investing a set amount on a regular schedule regardless of the price of the shares at the time. In the long run, dollar-cost averaging results in your buying more shares at low prices than you do at high prices.
<P>
<B>Dow Theory.</B> A belief that a major trend in the stock market isn't signaled by one index alone but must be confirmed by two—specifically, a new high or low must be recorded by both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Dow Jones transportation av


erage before it can safely be declared that the market is headed in one direction or the other.
<P>
<B>Due diligence.</B> The work performed by a broker or other representative in order to investigate and understand an investment thoroughly before recommending it to a customer.
<P>
<A NAME="E">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Earnings per share.</B> A company's profits after taxes, bond interest and preferred stock payments have been subtracted, divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding.
<P>
<B>Ex-dividend. </B>The period between the declaration of a dividend by a company or a mutual fund and the actual payment of the dividend. On the ex-dividend date, the price of the stock or fund will fall by the amount of the dividend, so new investors do


n't get the benefit of it. Companies and funds that have "gone ex-dividend" are marked by an X in the newspaper listings.
<P>
<A NAME="F">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Fannie Mae.</B> The acronym for the Federal National Mortgage Association, which buys mortgages on the secondary market, repackages them and sells off pieces to investors. The effect is to infuse the mortgage markets with fresh money.
<P>
<B>Fixed-income investment.</B> A catch-all description for investments in bonds, certificates of deposit and other debt-based instruments that pay a fixed amount of interest.
<P>
<B>401(k) plan.</B> An employer-sponsored retirement plan that permits employees to divert part of their pay into the plan and avoid current taxes on that income. Money directed to the plan may be partially matched by the employer, and investment earnings


 within the plan accumulate tax-free until they are withdrawn. The 401(k) is named for the section of the federal tax code that authorizes it.
<P>
<B>403(b) plan.</B> Similar to 401(k) plans, but set up for public employees and employees of nonprofit organizations.
<P>
<B>Freddie Mac.</B> The acronym for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation; it operates similarly to Fannie Mae.
<P>
<B>Front-end load.</B> The sales commission charged at the time of purchase of a mutual fund, insurance policy or other product.
<P>
<B>Full-service broker.</B> A brokerage firm that maintains a research department and other services designed to supply its individual and institutional customers with investment advice.
<P>
<B>Fundamental analysis.</B> Study of the balance sheet, earnings history, management, product lines and other elements of a company in an attempt to discern reasonable expectations for the price of its stock. For contrast, see technical analysis.
<P>
<B>Futures contract.</B> An agreement to buy or sell a certain amount of a commodity (such as wheat, soybeans or gold) or a financial instrument (such as Treasury bills or deutsche marks) at a stipulated price in a specified future month, which may be as 


much as nine months away. As the actual price moves closer to or further away from the contract price, the price of the contract fluctuates up and down, thus creating profits and losses for its holders, who may never actually take or make delivery of the 


underlying commodity.
<P>
<A NAME="G">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Ginnie Mae.</B> The acronym for the Government National Mortgage Association, which buys up mortgages in the secondary market and sells them to investors via securities known as pass-through certificates.
<P>
<B>Good-till-canceled order.</B> An order to buy or sell a security at a specified price, which stays in effect until it is executed by the broker because that price was reached, or until it is canceled by the customer.
<P>
<A NAME="I">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Individual retirement account.</B> A tax-sheltered account ideal for retirement investing because it permits investment earnings to accumulate untaxed until they are withdrawn. The contribution limit is $2,000 per year, and penalties usually apply for 


withdrawals before age 59 1¼2. Taxpayers whose income is below certain levels can deduct all or part of their IRA contributions, making the IRA a double tax shelter for them.
<P>
<B>Initial public offering.</B> A corporation's first public offering of an issue of stock. Also called an IPO.
<P>
<B>Institutional investors.</B> Mutual funds, banks, insurance companies, pension plans and others that buy and sell stocks and bonds in large volumes. Institutional investors account for 70% or more of market volume on an average day.
<P>
<A NAME="J">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Junk bond.</B> A high-risk, high-yield bond rated BB or lower by Standard & Poor's or Ba or lower by Moody's. Junk bonds are issued by relatively unknown or financially weak companies, or they have only limited backing from reasonably solvent companies


.
<P>
<A NAME="K">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Keogh plan.</B> A tax-sheltered retirement plan into which self-employed individuals can deposit up to 20% of earnings and deduct the contributions from current income. Investments within the Keogh grow untaxed until they are withdrawn. Withdrawals fro


m the plan are restricted before age 59 1¼2.
<P>
<A NAME="L">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Leveraging.</B> Investing with borrowed money in the hope of multiplying gains. If you buy $100,000 worth of stock and its price rises to $110,000, you've earned 10% on your investment. But if you leveraged the deal by putting up only $50,000 of your o


wn money and borrowing the rest, the same $10,000 increase would represent a 20% return on your money, not counting interest on the loan. The flip side of leverage is that it also multiplies losses. If the price of the stock goes down by $5,000 on the all


-cash deal, your loss would be 5% of your $100,000 investment. On the leveraged deal, your loss would be 10% of the money you put up and you'd still have to pay back the $50,000 you borrowed.
<P>
<B>Leveraged buyout.</B> The use of borrowed money to finance the purchase of a firm. Often, an LBO is financed by raising money through the issuance and sale of junk bonds.
<P>
<B>Limited partnership.</B> A business arrangement put together and managed by a general partner (which may be a company or an individual) and financed by the investments of limited partners, so called because their liability is limited to the amount of m


oney they invest in the venture. Limited partnerships can invest in virtually anything, but real estate is the most common choice. They have often been characterized by high fees for the general partners, complicated tax reporting requirements and elusive


 payouts for the limited partners.
<P>
<B>Limit order.</B> An order to buy or sell a security if it reaches a specified price. A stop-loss order is a common variation.
<P>
<B>Liquidity.</B> The ability to quickly convert an investment portfolio to cash without suffering a noticeable loss in value. Stocks and bonds of widely traded companies are considered highly liquid. Real estate and limited partnerships are illiquid.
<P>
<B>Load.</B> See back-end load and front-end load.
<P>
<A NAME="M">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Margin buying.</B> The act of financing the purchase of securities partly with money borrowed from the brokerage firm. Regulations permit buying up to 50% "on margin," meaning an investor can borrow up to half the purchase price of an investment. See l


everaging.
<P>
<B>Money-market fund.</B> A mutual fund that invests in short-term 
corporate and government debt and passes the interest payments on to shareholders. A key feature of money-market funds is that their market value doesn't change, making them an ideal place to

 earn current market interest with a high degree of liquidity.
<P>
<B>Mutual fund.</B> A professionally managed portfolio of stocks and bonds or other investments divided up into shares. Minimum purchase is often $500 or less, and mutual funds stand ready to buy back their shares at any time. The market price of the fund


's shares, called the net-asset value, fluctuates daily with the market price of the securities in its portfolio.
<P>
<A NAME="N">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Nasdaq.</B> Pronounced Naz-dak, it is the acronym for the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System, a computerized price-reporting system used by brokers to track over the counter securities as well as some exchange-listed


 issues.
<P>
<A NAME="O">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Odd lot.</B> A stock trade involving fewer than 100 shares. For contrast, see round lot.
<P>
<B>Opportunity cost.</B> The cost of passing up one investment in favor of another. For instance, if you pull money out of a money-market fund, where it is earning 7% interest, to invest it in a stock that has promise but yields just 4%, your opportunity 


cost while you're waiting is 3%.
<P>
<A NAME="options">
<A HREF="#call">Return to Call.</A><BR>
<B>Option.</B> The right to buy or sell a security at a given price within a given time. The right to buy the security is called a "call." Calls are bought by investors who expect the price of the stock to rise. The right to sell a stock is called a "put.


" Puts are purchased by investors who expect the price of the stock to fall. Investors use puts and calls to bet on the direction of price movements without actually having to buy or sell the stock. One option represents 100 shares and sells for a fractio


n of the price of the shares themselves. As the time approaches for the option to expire, its price will move up or down depending on the movement of the stock price.
<P>
Options can also be used to wring a little income out of stock you own without selling it. By writing (selling) a "covered call," you collect the premium and, assuming the stock price stays under the call price, get to keep the stock. The risk, of course,


 is that the stock will get called away and you will miss out on the price rise.
<P>
<B>Over the counter.</B> The place where stocks and bonds that aren't listed on any exchange (such as the New York or American stock exchange) are bought and sold. Despite the small-stock, small-town image conjured up by its name, in reality the over-the-


counter market (OTC) is a high-speed computerized network called Nasdaq, which is run by the National Association of Securities Dealers.
<P>
<A NAME="P">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Par.</B> The face value of a stock or bond. Also called par value.
<P>
<B>Penny stock.</B> Generally thought of as a recently issued stock selling for less than $5 a share and traded over the counter. Penny stocks are usually issued by small, relatively unknown companies and lightly traded, making them more prone to price ma


nipulation than larger, better-established issues. They are, in short, a gamble.
<P>
<B>Preferred stock.</B> A class of stock that pays a specified dividend set when it is issued. Preferreds generally pay less income than bonds of the same company and don't have the price appreciation potential of common stock. They appeal mainly to corpo


rations, which get a tax break on their dividend income.
<P>
<B>Price-earnings ratio.</B> Usually called the P/E, it is the price of a stock divided by either its latest annual earnings per share (a "trailing" P/E) or its predicted earnings (an "anticipated" P/E). Either way, the P/E is considered an important indi


cator of investor sentiment about a stock because it indicates how much investors are willing to pay for a dollar of earnings.
<P>
<B>Price-sales ratio.</B> The PSR is the stock's price divided by its company's latest annual sales per share. It is favored by some investors as a measure of a stock's relative value. The lower the PSR, according to this school of thought, the better the


 value.
<P>
<B>Program trading.</B> A complex computerized system designed to take advantage of temporary differences between the actual value of the stocks composing a popular index and the value represented by futures contracts on those stocks. To simplify, if the 


stocks' prices are higher than the futures contracts reflect, computer programs issue orders to sell stocks and buy futures contracts. If the stocks are lower than the futures contracts reflect, program traders buy stocks and sell the futures. The result 


is virtually risk-free profits for the program traders and more volatility for the market because of the vast numbers of shares needed to make the system work.
<P>
<B>Prospectus.</B> The document that describes a securities offering or the operations of a mutual fund, a limited partnership or other investment. The prospectus divulges financial data about the company, background of its officers and other information 


needed by investors to make an informed decision.
<P>
<B>Proxy.</B> The formal authorization by a stockholder that permits someone else (usually company management) to vote in his or her place at shareholder meetings or on matters put to the shareholders for a vote at other times.
<P>
<B>Real estate investment trust.</B> A closed-end investment company that buys real estate properties or mortgages and passes virtually all the profits on to its shareholders.
<P>
<B>Registered representative.</B> The formal name for a stockbroker, so called because he or she must be registered with the National Association of Securities Dealers as qualified to handle securities trades.
<P>
<B>Return on equity.</B> An important measure of investment results that is obtained by dividing the total value of shareholders' equity—that is, the market value of common and preferred stock—into the company's net income after taxes.
<P>
<A NAME="R">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Return on investment.</B> Often abbreviated ROI, this is a company's net profit after taxes divided by its total assets, which include common stock, preferred stock and bonds.
<P>
<B>Round lot.</B> A hundred shares of stock, the preferred number for buying and selling and the most economical unit when commissions are calculated.
<P>
<A NAME="S">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Sallie Mae.</B> Acronym for the Student Loan Marketing Association, which buys student loans from colleges, universities and other lenders and packages them into units to be sold to investors. Sallie Mae thus infuses the student-loan market with new mo


ney in much the same way that Ginnie Mae infuses the mortgage market with new money.
<P>
<B>Secondary market.</B> The general name given to stock exchanges, the over-the-counter market and other marketplaces in which stocks, bonds, mortgages and other investments are sold after they have been issued and sold initially. Original issues are sol


d in the primary market; subsequent sales take place in the secondary market. For example, the primary market for a new issue of stock is the team of underwriters; the secondary market is one of the stock exchanges or the over-the-counter market. The prim


ary market for a mortgage is the lender, which may then sell it to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac in the secondary mortgage market.
<P>
<B>Short selling.</B> A technique used to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a stock or other security by reversing the usual order of buying and selling. In a short sale, the investor (1) borrows stock from the broker and (2) immedi


ately sells it. Then, if the investor guessed right and the price of the stock does indeed decline, he can replace the borrowed shares by (3) buying them at the cheaper price. The profit is the difference between the price at which he sells the shares and


 the price at which he buys them later on. Of course, if the price of the shares rises, the investor will suffer a loss.
<P>
<B>Sinking fund.</B> Financial reserves set aside to be used exclusively to redeem a bond or preferred stock issue and thus reassure investors that the company will be able to meet that obligation.
<P>
<B>Specialist.</B> A member of the stock exchange who serves as a market maker for a number of different stock issues. A specialist maintains an inventory of certain stocks and buys and sells shares as necessary to maintain an orderly market for those sto


cks.
<P>
<B>Spread.</B> The difference between the bid and asked prices of a security, which may also be called the broker's markup. In options and futures trading, a spread is the practice of simultaneously buying a contract for the delivery of a commodity in one


 month and selling a contract for delivery of the same commodity in another month. The aim is to offset possible losses in one contract with possible gains in the other.
<P>
<B>Stop-loss order.</B> Instructions to a broker to sell a particular stock if its price ever dips to a specified level.
<P>
<B>Street name.</B> The description given to securities held in the name of a brokerage firm but belonging to the firm's customers. Holding stocks in street name facilitates trading because there is no need for the customer to pick up or deliver the certi


ficates.
<P>
<A NAME="T">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Technical analysis.</B> An approach to market analysis that attempts to forecast price movements by examining and charting the patterns formed by past movements in prices, trading volume, the ratio of advancing to declining stocks and other statistics.


 For contrast, see fundamental analysis.
<P>
<B>Tender offer.</B> An offer to shareholders to buy their shares of stock in a company. Tender offers are usually a key element of a strategy to take over, or buy out, a company and thus are usually made at a higher-than-market price to encourage shareho


lders to accept them.
<P>
<B>10-K.</B> A detailed financial report that must be filed by a firm each year with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is much more detailed than a typical annual report published and sent to shareholders.
<P>
<B>Total return.</B> A measure of investment performance that starts with price changes, then adds in the results of reinvesting all earnings, such as interest or dividends, generated by the investment during the period being measured.
<P>
<B>Triple witching hour.</B> A phrase made popular by program trading, it is the last hour of stock market trading on the third Friday of March, June, September and December. That's when options and futures contracts expire on market indexes used by progr


am traders to hedge their positions in stocks. The simultaneous expirations often set off heavy buying and selling of options, futures and the underlying stocks themselves, thus creating the "triple" witching hour.
<P>
<B>12b-1 fees.</B> An extra fee charged by some mutual funds to cover the costs of promotion and marketing. In practice, 12b-1 fees are often used to compensate brokers for selling low-load and no-load funds. The effect of the fee is reflected in the perf


ormance figures reported by the funds.
<P>
<A NAME="Y">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Yield.</B> In general, the return earned by an investment. In discussing bonds, yield can be any of several kinds. "Coupon yield" is the interest rate paid on the face value of the bond, which is usually $1,000. "Current yield" is the interest rate bas


ed on the actual purchase price of the bond, which may be higher or lower than the face amount. "Yield to maturity" is the rate that takes into account the current yield and the difference between the purchase price and the face value, with the difference


 assumed to be paid in equal installments over the remaining life of the bond.
<P>
<A NAME="Z">
<A HREF="#toc">Top of Page</A><BR>
<B>Zero-coupon bond.</B> A bond that pays all its interest at maturity but none prior to maturity. These "zeros" sell at a deep discount to face value and are especially suitable for long-term investment goals with a definite time horizon, such as college tuition or retirement.<BR>

<font size=2>November 28, 1996</font><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I> After my daughter handed me a 14-item Christmas wish list from Service Merchandise, I asked her to add up all the prices and see how much it was going to cost me. Seven items—and a total of $159.95 later—she decided to stop and restart her selection in preference order.<BR>
	<BR>
This exercise helped her practice her math by adding currency. It also helped her to set realistic expectations about holiday wishing in terms of U.S. dollars. </I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Let's see. If  seven items cost roughly $160, then each item on your daughter's list cost an average of about $23. At that rate, the whole list would have set you back $320.<BR>
	<BR>
That's not exactly peanuts, but things could have been a lot worse. You're fortunate in having a daughter who didn't go overboard in the first place, and got even thriftier as a result of your exercise.<BR>
	<BR>
While wish lists often strike terror into the hearts of parents, Dr. T thinks they're a useful tool that can help the holidays run more smoothly.  Kids learn how to set priorities within a limited budget, and parents learn where to head first when they hit the stores. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>

<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I>You recently answered a question from a reader who wanted to know whether to sell or hold several thousand dollars worth of U.S. savings bonds. My preschool-age child also has received bonds as gifts, but they have a smaller face value—about $1,000. So far that's our entire college fund. Should we sell the bonds and put the money into a mutual fund? </I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> In your case, go ahead and sell the bonds.<BR>
<BR>
Because your son owns a relatively small amount, he won't owe a great deal in taxes. In fact, as long as his total unearned income from interest and dividends isn't more than $650 for the year, he won't owe any tax at all.<BR>
<BR>
And if that's all the money you have set aside, it should be working harder for you in something like a growth-oriented mutual fund.     <BR>
	<BR>
A savings bond advisory to readers: Congress recently raised the top income levels at which parents can receive tax-free income if the bonds are used to pay for a child's college tuition. For 1996, interest on qualifying bonds is completely tax-free if your adjusted gross income is less than $49,450 on an individual return or $74,200 on a joint return. If your income is above those levels, part of the interest may be tax-free.<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, Congress made the increases retroactive, so some parents  who paid tax on all or part of the earnings on bonds purchased after 1989 and redeemed after 1992 may be eligible for refunds. Dr. T will let you know when the IRS announces how you can file to get money back.<BR>

<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I> Recently you wrote about how to handle finances and spending money when your child goes off to college. We thought we had worked all that out with our son, the freshman, but he just hit us with a  bombshell. He's failing a course that he needs for his major, which means he'll have to take it again—costing us an extra $1,000. <BR>
<BR>
What's more, he'll have to keep taking the class until he gets at least a "C." Who should pay for this unanticipated expense, our son or us? </I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Making your son foot the bill won't guarantee that he'll make the grade.<BR>
	<BR>
If he's doing poorly in other subjects as well, he may be in over his head. If that's the case, there's no point in throwing good money after bad, no matter whose money it is. Consider having him withdraw for a semester, or transfer to a junior college, until he's better able to handle the challenge.<BR>
<BR>
If your son is otherwise doing well and seems to be struggling with just one course, there's no need to turn up the pressure even more by making him pay. You might even try to cut your future losses by paying for a tutor who will get him through the class on this go-round or the next. If he fails the class twice, it may be time to switch majors. <BR>
<BR>
Even if you don't make your son pay for the course, make sure he knows how much it's going to cost. In a situation similar to yours, one student felt so guilty about flunking a course that she actually volunteered to pay part of the tuition for the make-up. Her parents rejected the offer but appreciated the gesture. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR><font size=5 color=red>Dear Readers,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<font size=4>A couple of weeks ago, Dr. T published her annual holiday list of fun financial gifts for children. Since then my children have been riffling through catalogs and have come up with a few picks of their own:</font>  <BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI>My oldest child, who's fascinated with gadgets, liked the <B><font color=red>Spinning Coin Bank:</font></B>  Drop a coin through the slot and a "secret internal mechanism"  spins it on a center platform before dropping it into the bank at the bottom. No batteries required. From Bits & Pieces, $10.95 (800-544-7297).<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B><Font color=red>The Mechanical Bowler Bank</font></B> caught the eye of my younger son, who loves to bowl. It's a die-cast metal copy of an antique bank in which a bowler rolls a strike to deposit your coin (another mechanical bank features hockey players). From Hammacher Schlemmer, $49.95 (800-543-3366).<BR>
<BR>
<LI>And my daughter with the sweet tooth added <B><FONT COLOR=red>Money Pops</font></B> to her gift list--bubble gum lollipops wrapped in fake $100 bills. From Brainstorms, $5.95 for a set of 12 (800-231-6000). <BR>

<font size=2>November 14, 1996</font><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I>Our kids are great believers in Santa, but every year their questions get tougher. I don't have any trouble explaining how reindeer can fly (everyone knows it's magic). But what do I say when they ask why Santa doesn't bring as many presents to poor people as he does to them?</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Tell them the truth–that you supplement Santa's largess with gifts of your own, something that poor parents can't always afford to do. Turn their concern into a positive by getting them to help you choose a toy to donate to a holiday collection drive. <BR>
<BR>
In Dr. T's experience, children find such pleasure in Santa that they're happy to engage in what the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge called "the willing suspension of disbelief." That gives you lots of room to maneuver when your kids raise the subject of gift-giving:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI><font color=navy><B>"If you won't buy it for me, I'll ask Santa for it."</B></font> Tell them that you and Santa are a team. He's not about to go against a parent's wishes—and jeopardize his job—by bringing a child a gift that is too dangerous, too expensive or otherwise not in the cards. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><font color=navy><B>"It can't be sold out; Santa's elves make it."</B></font> If a toy is a blockbuster hit, even the elves can't always keep up with demand. Sometimes Santa has to supplement the elves' output with toys from toy companies (they're more than willing to help out because of all the great publicity), so when they're sold out, Santa is, too. <BR>
<BR>
<LI><font color=navy><B>"Why can't I put just one more thing on my list?"</B></font> Santa has to read so many lists that you're doing him a favor by keeping it short—and there's a better chance he'll remember what you asked for. <BR>
<BR></UL>
<BR>
Don't back yourself into a corner by telling your children, "We can't get it for you, but maybe Santa will." If Santa is that generous, the kids will think that no request is too outlandish. <BR>
<BR>
And some remarks strain even a child's credibility, as in, "If you don't behave, you'll get coal in your stocking." Was there ever a kid, no matter how mischievous, who actually suffered this dire fate?<BR>
<BR>
Plausible answers forthrightly given will keep Santa alive in your household. By the time your children are no longer willing to suspend their disbelief, they'll be old enough to grow quietly out of the Santa myth. But for their sake, and yours, don't rush them into reality.  <BR>
<BR>

<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>

<BR><font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I> My 13-year-old daughter hangs around with a group of about a dozen girls, and her popularity is hard on our pocketbook. It seems like we're always buying a birthday gift for someone, and CDs for 12 kids start to add up. With the holidays coming up, she'll want to buy a present for everyone. Am I the only one who thinks this has gotten out of hand?<BR>
</I><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Dr. T thinks that if this is the worst problem you have with your 13-year-old daughter, you're a lucky parent. <BR>
<BR>
The holidays may be the most expensive time of year gift-wise, but they also present the cheapest solution. Instead of buying presents for everyone,  your daughter and her friends could each pick a name and play 	"secret Santa" for that person, giving small tokens and doing favors as the recipient tries to guess who her benefactor is. It's less expensive—and more fun—than buying everyone gifts.<BR>
<BR>
There's no getting around birthdays, however. In a group like this, if you buy for one member you have to buy for them all. You could set a price limit per gift—but why are you doing the buying in the first place? At 13, your daughter is old enough to take on this responsibility and use her own money. If she's in charge, she'll be inclined to be less extravagant and more creative, and outlays will tend to regulate themselves. <BR>

<font size=2>November 7, 1996</font><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I>I can't resist sharing this story about my eight-year-old son's buyer's remorse. He had been bugging me to take him to the toy store so that he could use his birthday money to buy a remote-control car on sale for $30. When we got to the store, he discovered that the battery pack was extra—and it cost more than the car.<BR>
<BR>
He bought it, but it just about wiped out his money and he was in tears when we got out to the car. "Are you mad at me?" he asked. I assured him I wasn't.  "Then don't tell me I learned a lesson," he replied.<BR>
</I><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Congratulations on your restraint. Your son did learn a lesson, but he didn't need you to rub it in. <BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>

<BR><font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I>I thought it was enterprising and educational when my son and his friend, both in second grade, decided to have a yard sale of old toys and split the proceeds. As it turned out, my son contributed all the toys, and his friend ended up buying them. That would have been okay--but then the friend showed up and asked for his share of the proceeds! I felt that wasn't fair to my son, but I didn't want to interfere because a deal is a deal. <BR>
</I><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> It's a raw deal if the parties involved are confused about the terms. Don't be afraid to help straighten things out.     <BR>
<BR>
You could have volunteered to go over all the transactions and count out the money. If your son's friend was unhappy about being long on toys and short on cash, you could have asked your son if it would be all right for his friend to return some of his purchases. Or you might even have paid him a small "salary" for helping out at the sale. If kids are going to learn a lesson about money, it might as well be how not to cheat—or be cheated.   <BR>

<font size=2>December 5, 1996</font><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I> Since I can remain anonymous, I'd like to tell you an embarrassing story from my youth that usually gets a laugh at my expense.<BR>
<BR>
Before I went to college, my father took me to the bank and opened a checking account with me. I went off to school and began writing checks.<BR>
<BR>
Soon I starting getting overdraft notices. Upset, I called home and asked my father if he was having financial difficulties. No, he replied, and whatever made me ask? When I told him about the overdrafts, he asked me when I had written my last check and for how much. I told him I couldn't remember. Look at the check register, he said. I stared blankly at the phone and asked, "What check register?" </I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> You're a good sport for taking the heat on this one, but your father should be in the hot seat, too.    <BR>
<BR>
Children don't learn the art of balancing a checkbook—or any other financial skill—by osmosis; they have to be taught. <BR>
<BR>
And it's the little lessons that have the biggest impact. Forget about making your child the next Bill Gates or Peter Lynch. Don't rely on fancy allowance kits or formal classes at school. Talking to your kids about the basics of managing money is the single most important thing you can do to help them grow into financially secure adults.     <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I> I am looking for a mutual fund to give as a gift for my cousin's "sweet 16" birthday. Do you know of any that require an initial investment of $250?</I><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I> I've been purchasing Twentieth Century Giftrust  accounts at $250 for many children in my family and just recently I was told the minimum is now $500. It's not only more than I would like to give, but it also forces me to give more to one relative than I gave previously to another. Do you know of an alternative that I could purchase?</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> With many funds raising their minimum initial investments, the pickings are slim indeed. For $250, one alternative among no-load funds that has a respectable record is <B>Strong Total Return</B> (800-368-1030). <BR>
	<BR>
If you are willing and able to ante up $500, you have a number of choices in addition to Giftrust (800-345-2021): <B>AARP Growth & Income</B> (800-253-2277); <B>Berger One Hundred</B> and <B>Berger Small Company Growth</B> (800-333-1001); and <B>Nicholas</B> (414-272-6133).<BR>
<BR>
If you can't come up with more cash on your own, talk to the child's parent or another relative about joining in your gift, or offer to match money that the child invests.    <BR>

<font size=2>December 12, 1996</font><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I> Recently you've been advising parents on how to sell candy bars and other fundraising stuff for their kids without bugging their co-workers. But why should parents be doing their kids' work for them in the first place? I thought fundraising campaigns were supposed to help kids take on personal responsibility, gain self-confidence and learn about business.</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Actually, fundraising campaigns are supposed to make money. Cute kids are just a convenient sales tool.     <BR>
<BR>
Don't get Dr. T wrong. Schools, athletic groups and other organizations that sponsor fundraisers really need the cash, and some kids are born salespeople who thrive on the challenge. In California, I once met a Girl Scout who was so good at selling cookies that she could sweet-talk Ron Popeil into buying a Veg-O-Matic.  <BR>
<BR>
But if children (or their parents) are uncomfortable about asking people to buy things, it's best to handle any money-raising obligation as painlessly as possible—even if it means that Mom and Dad simply write a check.<BR>
<BR>
Kids can learn about personal responsibility or gain self-confidence in other ways—by taking on extra jobs at home, participating in extracurricular activities, or even starting a business of their own.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I> I am in college, therefore I have virtually no extra cash. But I do have amounts that range into the hundreds from time to time. I see many published articles about how people in their twenties should be saving and investing. How do I go about getting started? Is it really possible to invest only $50 to $100 a month? Please advise!</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Dr. T advises you to relax. Any college student with the foresight to invest his or her spare cash has a bright financial future ahead. <BR>
<BR>
Yes, many mutual fund companies will let you avoid making a large initial investment if you agree to invest $50 or $100 a month. The catch is that you have to invest every month.<BR>
<BR>
Since your flow of spare cash is irregular, you'd be better off putting it into a bank account until you have enough to meet the fund's regular account minimum. Then you can add money whenever you choose.  <BR>
	<BR>
In last week's column, I listed a number of mutual funds with minimum investments of $250 or $500. But you could also wait until you accumulated $1,000 and open an account with Seven Seas S&P 500 Index fund (800-647-7327). The fund invests in companies that make up the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. So for $1,000 you'd get an interest in all of America's bluest-chip firms. Not bad for a beginner. <BR>

<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR> 
<I> We have a cabin along the Oregon coast to which we often invite friends of our daughter, who is 11. It never ceases to amaze us that when we issue an invitation, the guest's parents rarely bring up the subject of money—and often don't send any with their child. We are willing to pay for most of the child's activities—movies, a visit to the aquarium, and the kids' favorite, bingo at the local firehall. But we don't think we should have to pay for a birthday gift for the child's mother.  <BR>
<BR>
We have also noticed that children whose parents are well off are less likely to bring money of their own than, say, the child of a single, working mother. Also, when the issue of money does come up, it's usually the mom who handles it.<BR>
<BR>
P.S. Kids who do arrive with cash tend to bring around $25. </I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Thanks for your fascinating observations from a host's perspective.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. T is puzzled by the reluctance of parents to discuss who's going to pay for what when their child is invited as a guest. Perhaps they think it isn't polite—or perhaps they take for granted that the whole excursion will be a freebie. Both assumptions are misguided, and parents who make them can put the host, and their child, in an awkward position.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. T's rules for invitation etiquette:<BR>
<BR>
<UL><LI>If your child is invited to accompany another child on a trip, assume that the invitation includes the cost of transportation (and accommodations, if it's an overnight stay). Ask the host parents how much your child will need for admissions tickets or other costs.  Far from causing embarrassment, raising the subject will clear the air.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>If the host parents offer to pay for meals, tickets, or other expenses, accept graciously. But your kids should still have their own pocket money for incidental expenses. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>If the guest's parents ignore the subject, it's perfectly proper for the hosts to bring it up, as in, "We'll be paying for Joanie's activities here at the beach, but there's a nice souvenir shop so she might want to bring some money just in case she sees something she likes."<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Even if your child is lucky enough to be invited out by someone who's footing all or most of the bill, send your child with enough money to treat the host family to ice cream cones or breakfast out.  Children need to learn the art of reciprocation.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Remind children to abide by the host family's rules, to be helpful while they're houseguests, and to keep an eye out for something appropriate that they can send as a thank-you gift later.<BR>
</UL>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR><font size=4>This column hit home with a number of parents who have found themselves unwillingly shelling out of pocket at one time or another:</font><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I> We too have a beach house to which we often invite friends of our children. Some of the kids come with their own money, some do not. On a number of occasions children have brought money with them and lost it, then expected us to replace it.<BR>
<BR>
We have always refused, on the grounds that this goes beyond our responsibility as hosts. Are we being inhospitable? </I><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> You are being sensible. If your own children lost money you shouldn't feel any obligation to replace it, and there's no reason to treat someone else's children any differently, guests or no guests.<BR>
<BR>
What you could do is ask your guests, or their parents, if they're bringing money of their own. If so, you could offer to hold onto it for them for safekeeping during their visit.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I>I have a different gripe about paying for other people's children. My kids are involved in lots of sports activities, and after games we often end up taking the kids out for pizza. There's always a lot of confusion about who owes how much, and when we split the tab I always feel like I'm paying more than my fair share.</I><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> As a parent, Dr. T can assure you that all the other parents feel exactly the same way. You have several options:  <BR>
<BR><UL>
<LI>Skip the after-game lunch (which will work some of the time but probably not always);<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Suggest that you all go to a restaurant where everyone orders and pays separately (this is Dr. T's personal favorite);<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Swallow the cost along with your pizza, on the theory that over time it will all even out. <BR>
</UL><BR>
<B>Note:</B> If this isn't a group affair and you are inviting one or two of your child's friends out to lunch after a game or activity, you should be prepared to pay. If the other parents offer to give you money for their children you can accept it if you wish, but don't expect them to make the offer (not expecting an invitation, they may not have brought enough cash). If you're not willing to pay, don't issue the invitation.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR><font size=4>A couple of readers who've been in the same situation added their two cents:</font><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I>You should have told the parent that if he feels he's paying more than his fair share, he should volunteer to divvy up the bill and collect what everyone owes. That's a pain-in-the-neck job that nobody wants, but if you do it you can stick somebody else —er, make sure no one tries to beat the check.</I><BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I>After a swim meet one Saturday evening during the summer, our team went to a Mexican sit-down restaurant for dinner. The kids were scattered at tables all over the place, and we parents were wondering how we were going to avoid being overcharged when it came time to total up the bill. My 11-year-old daughter, who was listening to our conversation, piped up, "I know what I'd do. I'd hide in the bathroom."</I><BR>

<font size=2>December 19, 1996</font><BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I>Ever since I took my kids to see</I> 101 Dalmatians,<I> they have been begging for a cute little puppy like the ones in the movie. I don't know if this is the kind of question you answer, but do you know anything about the economics of having one of these dogs for a pet?</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Dr. T is pleased to respond—if only to warn you off the scent. Prices for well-bred Dalmatian puppies range from $300 to $400, including all the proper shots and a hearing test (Dalmatians are prone to deafness). <BR>
<BR>
And that's only the beginning. Once you get them home, you can expect to spend an additional $800 to $900 during their first year for such things as food (they have a delicate constitution) and obedience school (they're high-spirited animals who have been known to knock over small children and eat furniture).<BR>
<BR>
They're also high-maintenance pets who need to be walked a couple of times a day.<BR>
<BR>
If your kids really must feast their eyes on one of those cute little puppies, make it the stuffed variety. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=100% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<font size=5 color=red>Dear Dr. Tightwad,</font><font size=3><BR>
<BR>
<I> In your <A HREF = "drt1205.html">December 5 column</A>, you included a couple of the Berger mutual funds on a list of funds that will let you start investing with as little as $500. But I think I read recently that the Berger funds require a minimum of $2,000 to get started. Can you set me straight on this?</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<font size=5 color=red>A:</font><font size=3> Since the time Dr. T wrote that column, Berger has increased its minimum initial investment from $500 to $2,000. Berger had long been a mainstay among low-minimum fund families, so for small investors the already slim pickings have gotten even thinner. <BR>
<BR>
In addition to the other no-load funds cited here, Muhlenkamp (800-860-3863), a growth-and-income fund, has compiled a good record and lets investors in for as little as $200. For the most part, however, to get a deal as sweet as that one you have to commit yourself to making regular monthly investments of around $50 to $100. <BR>
<BR>
If you're willing to do that, you can buy into a number of fund families for $500 or less. Among them: Founders, Gabelli, Invesco, Janus and T. Rowe Price. Minimums can vary among different funds in the same family.  <BR>
<BR>
Funds will often lower their required minimum investment if you're setting up a custodial account for a child. Even in that case, however, you still might have to come up with $1,000.  <BR>

<H2>The Cost of Staying Warm This Winter </H2>

Homeowners who heat with oil should count on spending $100 to $150 more to stay warm this winter, an increase of about 10% over last year. After a scary spurt in crude-oil prices heading into December, that may sound like good news. But if we have an unusually frigid winter, prices could climb even higher.<BR>
<BR>
Heating-oil supplies are at their lowest since the early 1970s. These days that isn't as significant as it used to be because far fewer homes heat with oil. Natural-gas inventories are also low, but the impact on monthly bills will be less dramatic (up 3%) because it's easier to bring new supplies on line if demand rises sharply. Electricity costs should run about the same as last year.<BR>
<BR>
Higher oil prices will have a ripple effect. Gasoline prices will stay fairly flat instead of declining, as they usually do at this time of year. But with jet fuel representing a large chunk of airlines' operating costs, airfares are headed up. As America settles in for the winter, prices of petroleum-related products are one of the few inflation hot spots among consumer goods and services.<BR>
<BR>
<U><B>To save a buck, eat at home.</B></U> The first frost was late--good news for fall harvests--and food prices will be only about 2.5% higher in 1997. The cost of restaurant meals will head up faster (3.5% or more), mainly because of the increase in the minimum wage. Nearly half of every dollar that Americans spend on food goes to restaurants, hotels, fast-food outlets and takeout places.<BR>
<BR>
<U><B>Buy your down comforters early. </B></U>"Everyone remembers vividly how last winter tortured them, so cold-weather products started selling very early this season," says Christine Jobes of the National Retail Federation. Brisk sales of luxury bedding and toasty down jackets mean you'll find fewer late-season bargains.  <BR>
<BR>
<B><U>Head out to sea to bask in the sun.</U></B> Flying and driving may cost noticeably more this year than last, but with 20 brand-new cruise ships about to set sail, finding discounts on Caribbean cruises will be a snap.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Lending home buyers a helping hand</H3>

You fed and clothed your kids, put them through college, opened your door when they "boomeranged" back and, if you were feeling generous, lent them money to buy a place of their own.<BR>
<BR>
    That is, unless they were applying for an FHA mortgage. Until recently, you couldn't technically lend money to a child or other family member for the down payment on an FHA loan. You were required to certify in writing that your financial help wasn't a loan, after all, but was being extended with no strings attached.<BR>
<BR>
Shortly before Congress adjourned in October, however, it voted to change that policy and allow parents to give their children an unsecured personal loan, with or without interest, or a loan secured by the new home. <BR>
<BR>
That means more parents can extend a helping hand without being tempted to lie about it. "As a practical matter, a lot of things that were called gifts actually involved some financial responsibility somewhere down the road," says Rick McGuire, president of Inland Mortgage, which is headquartered in Indianapolis. "Now everything is aboveboard."<BR>
<BR>
As a result, more buyers should be able to take advantage of today's favorable mortgage interest rates. The number-one stumbling block to homeownership is coming up with the down payment and closing costs, according to Fannie Mae. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Hot combo: Bagels, beer</H3>

If you're game to sample something new, put your money where your mouth is--invest in some small (and speculative) up-and-comers in the food-and-beverage sector. <BR>
<BR>
Rainforest Cafe (symbol RAIN, Nasdaq, recent price $32) is cooking up business overseas and will open its second cafe at Walt Disney World. "Disney knows what they're doing," says Robert Evans, an analyst with John G. Kinnard & Co. "They've sought Rainforest, and that says a lot about the company's appeal."<BR>
<BR>
Also on a roll: Einstein/Noah Bagel Corp. (ENBX, Nasdaq, $30) and New York Bagel Enterprises Inc. (NYBS, Nasdaq, $7) are scrambling to fill any holes in that market. Owned in part by Boston Chicken, Einstein/Noah has the connections to expand rapidly. New York Bagel, meanwhile, is moving into uncharted territory in the South and Midwest.<BR>
<BR>
Redhook Ale (HOOK, Nasdaq, $14) has sidestepped microbreweries' biggest hurdle by signing a distribution agreement with Anheuser-Busch. Specialty beers "aren't the pet rock of the beer industry," says analyst William Smith of Renaissance Capital Corp. Growing at an intoxicating rate of 30% a year, they could guzzle up to 10% of total beer sales by 2000. <BR>

<H3>A buyer's guide to indexed bonds</H3>

The Treasury is about to introduce its much-heralded inflation-indexed bonds, which will protect investors by guaranteeing that their real rate of return can never be eroded by inflation. Officially known as TIPS (Treasury inflation-protection securities), the ten-year bonds will be available in minimum denominations of $1,000. Last month Kiplinger's addressed who should own the bonds (see "Smart Investing," Dec.). Here's how to buy them: <BR>
<BR>
<I><B>Treasury Direct.</B></I> With no fees or service charges for small investors, there's no cheaper way to buy Treasury securities than to go straight to the source. Call the Federal Reserve branch nearest you or 202-874-4000 for information on opening an account. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, you can't use your own Treasury Direct account to buy bonds you want to hold in an IRA--and IRAs and other tax-deferred retirement accounts are the best repositories for the new bonds. As part of the inflation adjustment, the principal value of the bonds will go up year by year and you'll owe taxes on the gains, even though you don't see them until you cash in the bonds. Holding the bonds in a tax-deferred account eliminates the early tax bill on the phantom gains. <BR>
<BR>
<I><B>Brokerage firms.</B></I> To put inflation-indexed bonds in an IRA, buy them through a broker. The transaction cost is roughly the same at most full-service and discount brokerages: either a $50 commission or a $50 annual account fee. <BR>
<BR>
<I><B>Bond funds.</B></I> American Century--formerly Twentieth Century/Benham (800-345-2021)--will be the first mutual fund family to introduce an inflation-indexed bond fund. The fund will likely be launched in the first quarter of 1997 and have a $2,500 minimum investment. You can choose to reinvest interest payments or take them in cash each month, so your income stream will rise with inflation. At least two other fund companies--MFS and PIMCO--are also considering inflation-indexed bond funds. <BR>
<BR>
<I><B>401(k) and other retirement plans.</B></I> The new bonds won't show up on 401(k) menus right away. Many employers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and some plans require a three-year track record for new investment options. <BR>
<BR>
One notable exception is TIAA-CREF, which is planning to offer its 1.8 million members in educational and research institutions an inflation-linked bond account starting this spring. Principal Financial Group hopes to have an inflation-indexed bond option for its clients by 1998. Dan Fitzgerrell, director of pension services, thinks it will be most popular among people nearing retirement or already there who have a comfortable amount of assets but want an automatic guarantee that their savings will keep up with inflation. "Stocks aren't a good hedge for cost-of-living changes in the short run," says Fitzgerrell.<BR>
<BR>
<I><B>Payroll deduction.</B></I> In a year or so, you'll be able to buy inflation-indexed savings bonds through payroll deduction for as little as $50 a month. Because savings bonds have built-in tax deferral, you won't have to worry about taxes on phantom income. In the meantime, savings bonds have other drawbacks that you might want to consider (see "A Good Deal Gone Bad," on page 69).<BR>

<H3>Cell phones for the masses</H3>

Once a status symbol of the rich and roaming, and their wannabes, cellular phones are so commonplace that the affluent no longer have the market to themselves. <BR>
<BR>
A new way to control costs promises to make cell phones even more affordable. A "debit phone" is a cell phone that allows you to prepay your calling time in blocks of $20 to $100. This option, now being sold nationwide by at least two companies--American Cellular Rental (800-381-0888) and Mitsubishi (800-726-2777)--is aimed at parents who want to give their kids a cell phone but don't want the bills to get out of hand.  <BR>
<BR>
With ACR, for example, you can buy 25 minutes of phone use in the Atlanta area for $20. When that runs out you can buy more calling time with a credit card. In some areas, you can request a debit feature for your current cell phone.<BR>
<BR>
Businesses whose employees travel a lot might be inclined to let them use cell phones if costs could be controlled. And because they're prepaid, these phones are an alternative for the one-third of prospective cellular customers who are turned down for bad credit. Both phones have a suggested retail price of $199. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>Fasten your seat belts and log off</H3>

Laptop computers, pagers, CD players and other portable electronic devices (PEDs) may be a convenience on the ground, but there's growing evidence that they may pose a hazard, however slight, in the air. <BR>
<BR>
It's possible that electromagnetic emissions from PEDs can interfere with a plane's aviation systems, according to a recent study by an advisory group to the Federal Aviation Administration. The study suggests that FAArules don't go far enough to prevent potential disasters.<BR>
<BR>
Right now, the FAA leaves it up to airlines to restrict voluntarily the use of PEDs during critical phases of flight, such as takeoff and landing. Airlines prohibit altogether the use of devices that transmit a signal, such as cellular phones. <BR>
<BR>
But the rules aren't uniform. For instance, Southwest Airlines and USAir both allow use of the lowly AM/FM radio--one of the worst offenders--at altitudes above 10,000 feet, but other carriers ban it. And with new devices coming out all the time, airlines say someone needs to set standards. "The airlines don't have the resources to make sure everyone's gadget is safe," says Michael Rioux of the Air Transport Association, an industry group. Nor do they want to antagonize laptop-toting travelers.<BR>
<BR>
The FAA is assessing the study, but so far doesn't plan any rule changes. Meanwhile, says Murray Slovick, editor of <I>IEEE Spectrum</I>, the magazine of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, "if somebody next to me were using a laptop during takeoff or landing, I would ask them to turn it off."<BR>

<H3>e-mail@thisaddress.forfree</H3>

Envious of friends who included Internet addresses with their holiday greetings? You too can enjoy the cachet of e-mail without paying an online service $10 to $20 a month.<BR>
<BR>
Instead, you can get software from one of two firms--Freemark (888-693-6245) and Juno (800-654-5866)--that lets you communicate electronically for free. No Internet connection is needed on your end, and e-mail can be delivered to recipients with any type of e-mail capability.<BR>
<BR>
You do pay a price of sorts, however. With Freemark, an advertising banner runs along the bottom of your e-mail screen as you read or write messages. With Juno, you fill out an extensive demographic survey that the firm will provide to advertisers who want to target you online. <BR>
<BR>
Internet providers and other online services usually include one free home page in their monthly fee. But if you need several pages to accommodate wired family members, you can get them free from <A HREF = "http://www.geocities.com">GeoCities</A>, an eclectic site organized around "neighborhoods" with different themes, such as finance, gardening, politics and sports; or <A HREF = "http://www.tripod.com">Tripod</A>, which targets 18-to-34-year-olds with news and personal-finance information. <BR>
<BR>
     "We now have well over 60,000 member home pages," says Bo Peabody, one of Tripod's founders. <BR>

<H3>Getting a head start on retirement</H3>

All those dire warnings about baby-boomers not saving enough for retirement are finally getting through--to their kids, anyway.<BR>
<BR>
In a survey of 1,200 young people ages 12 to 21 by Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co., 80% of college students and two-thirds of junior high schoolers said they're already concerned about having enough money to retire. <BR>
<BR>
By far their biggest financial worry is how to pay for college. Surprisingly, buying a car ranks as a financial concern for only one-fifth of them. Nine out of ten consider it very important to "be happy" and to "have kids who love you." Much farther down the list were "own an expensive car" and "have nice clothes."<BR>
<BR>
Nearly 90% of the kids put money they've earned into a savings account, and a striking 94% say they shop around for bargains. In the households surveyed, at least one parent made $40,000 a year or more (the target market for Phoenix's products). But the kids still have a lot to learn: Most don't understand what mutual funds are or how interest compounds.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>A new tax break for medical costs</H3>

After all the political <I>Sturm und Drang</I> over tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs), a limited number of self-employed people and small businesses with 50 or fewer employees will get to set up such accounts this year. But the experiment could turn out to be more than Congress bargained for.  <BR>
<BR>
An MSA works like this: You (or your employer) buy a catastrophic-care health insurance policy with a high deductible (between $1,500 and $2,250 for an individual and $3,000 to $4,500 for a family). Then you put 65% to 75% of the insurance deductible into the MSA, where it earns interest tax-free and is excluded from your taxable income.<BR>
<BR>
You tap the account as needed to pay out-of-pocket medical costs with tax-free dollars. Whatever you don't spend grows over time, tax-deferred, into a kind of IRA. <BR>
<BR>
If you're self-employed, you should jump at the chance to open an MSA because you probably already have a high-deductible policy. MSAs will also be attractive to small firms with employees who are mostly young, healthy and willing to gamble on a high-deductible policy. Another incentive to act quickly: In order to contribute the full tax-deductible amount for 1997, the policy has to be effective by January 1, 1997; if you open an account after that, the tax break is prorated.<BR>
<BR>
By law, the number of MSAs is capped at 750,000 accounts. But in practice, the IRS won't close the window until September 1--by which time far more than 750,000 accounts may have been set up. Proponents of MSAs are hoping that the cap will be exceeded so that Congress will remove it altogether. But once you've established an MSA, you can keep it for life. <BR>
<BR>
     Check with your current insurer to see if it will be offering MSAs. If not, contact a trade or professional organization you belong to, or call one of the companies listed here.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Golden Rule Insurance Co.</B> (888-672-0829). Account balances earn 5% interest, guaranteed for one year; $3 monthly account fee<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Time Insurance Co.</B> (888-846-3672). 4.5% interest rate on balances over $750; no account or transaction fees<BR>

<I>By Joan Goldwasser
  </I>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2> Insure your money-market fund?</H2>


Money-market mutual funds are handy places to put emergency-fund cash or to park money in between investments, and they pay savers a whole lot more than bank money-market deposit accounts--a recent average of 4.8%, versus 2.7% for MMDAs. But bank MMDAs have one advantage over money funds: They're insured by the FDIC for up to $100,000. <BR>
<BR>
Now Fidelity and Putnam are planning to insure their money-market funds. Unlike FDIC coverage, the funds' insurance isn't designed to reimburse you for all your losses, even up to a limited amount. Rather, it's designed to help prevent losses due to credit default by a security that would pull money-fund shares below a net asset value of $1. In the past, fund companies have had to dip into their own pockets when investments have gone bad to keep their money funds from "breaking the buck." <BR>
<BR>
Fidelity's insurance would cover only $100 million of the $80 billion in its 23 money funds. Putnam's would cover only $30 million in its five money funds, which have a total of $2.3 billion in assets. But that's not enough insurance to guarantee that fund shares would never drop below a net asset value of $1. Neither company would cover losses that result from fraud or fluctuations in interest rates that are due to stock-market forces.<BR>
<BR>
The funds plan to include the cost of the insurance as an expense. Fidelity and Putnam estimate the cost at about one basis point, or 0.01 of a percentage point, which would shave only $1 a year in interest off a $10,000 investment. <BR>
<BR>
<I><B>But do you need it?</B></I> Some experts, such as John Rekenthaler, publisher of <I>Morningstar Mutual Funds</I>, are skeptical of the proposals. They think the insurance is a way to limit the fund companies' potential liability and transfer the cost of bailing out funds to shareholders. Moreover, no retail investor has ever lost money from a fund's breaking the buck: Mutual fund companies have always stepped in and reimbursed the funds or purchased securities with declining credit ratings to keep net asset value at $1. Russell Long, director of Standard & Poor's managed-funds division, says that any company that wants to stay in business will continue to support its funds' NAV. <BR>
<BR>
Still worried? Peter Crane, editor of <I>Money Fund Report</I>, recommends that skittish investors check out U.S. Treasury money funds. They yield only slightly less than the average taxable money fund, interest is exempt from state and local taxes, and securities in them are backed by the U.S. Treasury. One good choice is <B>Vanguard Money Market Reserves U.S. Treasury</B> (30-day yield, 5%; minimum initial investment, $3,000; 800-662-7447).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=97% ALIGN=LEFT NOSHADE>
<H3>Now there are car-equity loans</H3>

Tapped out on sources of credit? At NationsBank, after you have owned your car for at least a year, you can refinance it and borrow up to 90% of its resale value. <BR>
<BR>
Loans that use cars as collateral aren't new. Here's the kicker: The interest is tax-deductible if you let the bank attach a lien on your house. The interest rate for a one-year-old car is currently 9.9%, about half a percentage point higher than NationsBank's new-car rate; you won't get the lower home-equity loan rate (currently 9.25%) and, of course, you could lose your home if you were to default on the payments.<BR>
<BR>
People applying for such loans often have borrowed up to the limit on their home-equity lines of credit or have  paid-off autos against which they would like to borrow $3,000 or $4,000, says a NationsBank spokeswoman.  <BR>

<H2>The Way We Were</H2>

<I>By Fred W. Frailey</I>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> In this 50th-anniversary interview, Austin Kiplinger recalls the America into which the magazine was born and considers the challenges ahead.
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As World War II drew to a close, W.M. Kiplinger began writing to his son Austin, then a Navy combat pilot, about a new publication that was taking shape in his mind. Since 1923 the <I>Kiplinger Washington Letter</I> had given owners and managers of small businesses advice and forecasts useful in running their enterprises. Now the elder Kiplinger wanted to help ordinary American families manage their financial affairs. Two years passed from germination to publication, but in January 1947 came<I> Kiplinger Magazine</I>--<I>The Changing Times</I>. And today, half a century later, only one staff member from the masthead of Vol. 1, No. 1, remains on it: Austin H. Kiplinger, then executive editor and now, at age 78, chairman of the parent company.<BR>
<BR>
Today we are bombarded by advice on such issues as where to invest our money, how to find the cheapest mortgage and when to appeal a property-tax assessment. It wasn't that way in 1947. <I>Kiplinger Magazine</I> and its small, young staff pioneered personal-finance journalism. For a firsthand look at those times and how they relate to concerns that people have today about their financial affairs, we spoke with the man who has lived through it all.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>What was going through your father's mind when he wrote about this new magazine he envisioned?</I></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><I><B>Kiplinger:</B></I></FONT> All through the war, the staff of the<I> Kiplinger Washington Letter</I> worked six- and seven-day weeks focusing on big questions and world-shaking matters of the economy and government. I think W.M. Kiplinger hankered for something that was more personal and more directly aimed at individuals.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>His timing couldn't have been better, could it, what with the war ending, changes in the wind . . .</B></I><BR>
<BR>
The theme in everyone's mind was "getting back to normal." But what was normal? I remember the day the war ended. I was acting commander of a squadron, and we all got together at a picnic on the banks of the Snake River, right where it joins the Columbia, in Washington State. The women were ecstatic--everything was going to get back to normal, the men would return, no one else would be killed. And all the men looked at each other with blank stares, wondering, "What the hell do we do now?" We'd focused years of our lives on the war. So there was great bewilderment and uncertainty. Which way would we go?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Did people fear that, with the war over, we'd have another Great Depression?</B></I><BR>
<BR>
In our minds, we were still trying to get over the Depression. Of course, by the end of the war, the problems of the 1930s were history and there was work for everyone. But because of the war, our standard of living actually <I>contracted </I>between 1941 and 1945. That goes back to what I said: Nobody could remember what "normal" had been. The national mood was one of great uncertainty, but tremendous dedication and determination. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Determination?</B></I><BR>
<BR>
Yes. People were getting involved in the essentials of life: buying a home, making a career and seeing to the future of their children. In my young family, the first thing we wanted was a toaster. Yes, we were going to have an electric toaster! Next on our list would be a washing machine and then a diaper service.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>It's difficult to remember a time when you couldn't just put those things on your Visa card.</B></I><BR>
<BR>
If you wanted to buy something, you had to save for it. In effect, you had to make the decision to buy something long before you bought it. There was much less impulse buying, because nobody had credit or ready cash. Installment credit really didn't exist.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>That's a far cry from how it's done today.</B></I><BR>
<BR>
Definitely. What has happened is that the availability of purchasing power allows us to buy now and work out the rationale for it later. But then you worried about how to budget and plan your monthly income and outgo. And what do you do about insurance? Topics such as these were the magazine's bread and butter. Ours was the first to espouse term insurance for young families who couldn't afford to start their retirement savings at age 27 with two kids and all the other responsibilities.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>How did people feel about investing?</B></I><BR>
<BR>
Suspicious. The stock market was suspect. Remember, the public had not only been treated to the Crash of 1929 but also to a decade of condemnation of Wall Street by political figures--condemnation of the morals and the greed and the low standards. And a lot of it was true. But we wrote about saving and investing, and it became our stock in trade. The piece that appeared in October 1947--"Living on $5,500 a Year"--was a seminal piece on money management.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>A lot of readers didn't think the person we profiled was doing a very good job of it.</B></I><BR>
<BR>
That's right. Because that was considered a pretty extravagant salary by most people in the late 1940s.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Were readers very sophisticated then?</B></I><BR>
<BR>
We didn't think so at the time, but in fact they were. By the very act of subscribing to the magazine, they were saying that they wanted to manage their own affairs. We were trying to help people make decisions in their own self-interest. A lot of readers owned small businesses, and they'd write us to say, "Why in the world are you telling consumers how to deal with us business people? You're making it harder for us." I'd write back and say that the person's business had a purchasing agent, whose job it was to buy materials at the lowest price, and we wanted consumers to do the same thing. In other words, the best markets are made by well-informed buyers and well-informed sellers. When you put it to people that way, they understood.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>You can't pick up a newspaper these days, or talk to a young person, without sensing a widespread belief that somehow things are worse economically than they used to be. Would you agree?</B></I><BR>
<BR>
No. It's another example of our short memories. What has happened is that people's expectations are so much higher. Take myself: After the war I had one son and another on the way, and was in the upper-middle level of income, doing quite well in my profession. But we didn't have a toaster. We didn't have any new furniture. We didn't have rugs for our house--we had to borrow those--and we had one car, used. <I>That</I> was the norm. Try to impose such a living standard on your children today, and they will think they're entering the Great Depression of the next century.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>In the field of this magazine--personal finance--what will be the big challenge of the next 50 years?</B></I><BR>
<BR>
Our range of possibilities and opportunities will be greatly multiplied. This will force us to rely more upon our fundamental values. Anything may be possible, but you can't have it all--you must make choices. But this is hard to tell people. The politics of the 19th century was to sell the American Dream. The specifics of that dream may have been vague, but you knew that through your personal participation you could bring it about.<BR>
<BR>
Then in this century, the American Dream became a government responsibility. <I>We</I> are going to guarantee you this and that. Now the idea of government as guarantor of the good life is beginning to dissolve. In its place comes the return of personal responsibility. You'll see more of that in the new century. Combine that with the range of opportunity we now have and can see on the horizon, and boy, the monkey is put on everyone's back to individually and personally make the right decisions. And that's where this magazine comes in.  <BR>

<BR><H2> Kiplinger's Seven Keys to Financial Security</H2>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR=RED>KEY #1:</FONT> <FONT COLOR=BLACK>Invest in Yourself</FONT><BR>
</B><BR>
Your own earning power is the greatest asset you'll ever have. Keep it strong through continuous education, training and personal growth. Pay close attention to your physical and spiritual health. And as you accumulate financial assets, study techniques of sound money management as carefully as you learned your career skills.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR=RED>KEY #2: </FONT>  <FONT COLOR=BLACK>Protect Your Loved Ones and Your Assets</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
Before you acquire any financial assets, make sure you have enough insurance against life's big risks: illness, disability, liability and early death. How much coverage is enough? Ask the professionals, and don't be surprised if the figures are much more than you have now or think you need. When an emergency arises, you--or your beneficiaries--won't regret having too much insurance.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR=RED>KEY #3: </FONT>  <FONT COLOR=BLACK>Borrow Sparingly</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
Use credit only to purchase things of lasting value: a home, education and job training, maybe a car. Pay cash for everything else: clothing, travel, entertainment, general living expenses. (Know anyone who got into big financial trouble because they didn't borrow money? I don't.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR=RED>KEY #4: </FONT>  <FONT COLOR=BLACK>Pay Yourself First</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
This old adage-which means saving a fixed portion of your earnings each month, rain or shine, along with paying your other bills--really works, and the opposite doesn't. It entails budgeting regular deposits to your mutual fund, CDs, brokerage account, payroll savings plan--whatever--just as you do your monthly rent, mortgage, auto loan or tuition repayment. If you don't, your discretionary expenses will have a magical way of expanding to consume all available funds--before you get around to saving or investing.<BR>
<BR>
What's the difference between "saving" and "investing"? Simply put, time frame and liquidity. Savings are funds kept handy for short-run needs, typically stored in liquid, low-volatility forms, such as money-market funds and CDs. Investments are funds you shouldn't need to tap for years to come, and they are best stored in equities that will, over time, outperform other classes of assets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR=RED>KEY #5: </FONT>  <FONT COLOR=BLACK>Don't Go for the Home Runs</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
In investing, as in baseball, those who swing for the fences get some home runs, but they also strike out a lot, and their batting averages--average annual total returns--reflect it. Most successful investors aim for lots of singles and doubles, and like most journeyman hitters, they get the occasional homer, too.<BR>
<BR>
They don't engage in market timing because most people can't catch market peaks and valleys accurately. They use dollar-cost averaging to make sure they're in the market for the major moves, even if that means suffering through the occasional bear market.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR=RED>KEY #6: </FONT>  <FONT COLOR=BLACK>Invest in Quality Assets of Diverse Types</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
When it comes time to get liquid--that is, sell what you own--it will be a lot easier if you own assets perceived by markets to be things of quality. This applies to any kind of asset: U.S. stocks, bonds, real estate, foreign securities, even collectibles (which aren't investments but sometimes act like them).<BR>
<BR>
This doesn't mean you should invest only in blue-chip stocks. The quality emblem can be affixed equally well to small, newer companies that have the best products and management in their fields, and therefore the best prospects of strong future earnings.<BR>
<BR>
The reason to balance your wealth among different classes of assets is quite simple: At any particular time, some will enjoy the high prices of market favor, while others will be shunned by buyers, wisely or not. With diversity you hedge your bets, and when you need to sell, you won't have to dump temporarily depressed assets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=+1 COLOR=RED>KEY #7: </FONT>  <FONT COLOR=BLACK>Fund a Comfortable Future With Simpler Living Today</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
If you're not funding your tax-deferred IRA, Keogh, 401(k) or other retirement plans to the maximum, it might be because everything you earn is going into big mortgage payments, auto lease payments and credit card bills. Don't fret about the future. Take steps now to make it comfortable for you and your heirs. Take a look at how you're living and try to decide what's important and what's dispensable.<BR>

<H1> Getting the Most From Your Health Insurance </H1> 
<P>
<P>
<I> By Kristin Davis</I>
<P>
<P>For many infertility patients, examining the fine print in your insurance policy and doing battle with your insurer can spell the difference between being successful and never getting a chance to try. <P>
<P>
<LI><B>Know your state law.</B> Twelve states have laws that require insurance companies to provide some coverage for medical treatment of infertility. But only six of them  (Arkansas, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island) require insurers to cover in vitro fertilization and other high-tech treatments. The Wisconsin legislature is considering a similar law. (Call your insurance commissioner's office to find out about the law in your state.)<P>
<P>
     Even in states that require insurers to pick up the tab, there are restrictions and loopholes. Arkansas, for instance, exempts HMOs from its law. And self-insured employers don't have to follow the state mandates.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Know your insurer.</B> The larger your employer, the more likely it self-insures. According to Foster Higgins, a benefits consulting firm, 15% of companies with ten to 499 employees self-insure, but 91% of companies with 20,000 or more employees act as their own insurers. Many self-insured employers use an insurance company to administer claims, so the kind of coverage you have may not be self-evident.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Negotiate with your employer.</B> Having an employer that self-insures isn't necessarily bad. Some cover infertility treatment even though they're not required to. And unlike members of an HMO or a group insurance plan, patients can sometimes persuade their self-insured employers to make exceptions. Because the employer, not the insurance company, is footing the bill, it can decide what to pay for. <P>
<P>
     One woman in Santa Maria, Cal., persuaded her employer to cover a GIFT procedure (see <A HREF = "inguide.html">A Guide to Procedures & Costs</A>) after initially being denied. Her employer, a Catholic hospital, did not cover any high-tech infertility treatments because the Catholic Church does not condone in vitro fertilization. But after researching the issue herself, the employee discovered that the church does not object to GIFT because fertilization does not occur outside the body. She asked her employer to reconsider, and the hospital agreed to pay for her GIFT procedure.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Read your policy. </B>Most companies distribute a summary of insurance benefits to employees, but to find out exactly what's covered you'll probably need to get a copy of the actual insurance contract from the insurer or your company's personnel office. Pay particular attention to the section labeled "exclusions." An exclusion for "all attempted pregnancies" means no infertility services are covered. But an exclusion for "assisted reproductive technology procedures" might leave the door open for coverage of artificial inseminations or for the tests, ultrasounds and other expenses associated with a high-tech procedure.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Don't rely on a phone call.</B> Brian Allen, a financial counselor at the infertility clinic at the University of Iowa, made that mistake only once. The insurance company representative told him a patient's in vitro fertilization would be covered, but "when she got the bill they stiffed her." A letter (officially, a "predetermination of benefits") from the insurance company stating specifically what it will pay for is legally binding.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Fight rejected claims.</B> Many insurance policies have a blanket exclusion for procedures that are "experimental" or "not medically necessary" and reject claims for infertility treatment on those grounds. Allen says about 15% of the patients he's counseled have been able to get such denials reversed by sending the insurer a letter from their doctor explaining why the procedure is medically necessary or is no longer considered experimental.<P>

<H2> Well, I Think . . . </H2>

<B> We asked notables in a number of fields what they think the future holds. They didn't always share our vision.

<BR><H3><FONT COLOR=RED>Technology</H3></FONT>

<B>Bye-bye channel surfing</B><BR>
You'll be able to program your entire TV viewing day. Instead of going home to watch CBS or NBC, you'll say, "I'm going to watch <I>Cosby</I>," and you'll get it at 9:00 or 9:01 or 12:00 or whenever. You might pay by buying a <I>Cosby</I> package, or you might decide to watch it with GM advertising and pay nothing. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Robert Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer, Black Entertainment Television<BR>
</I><BR>

<B>Glued to a tube</B><BR>
Financial journalism is going to be more and more dominated by broadcast media--television or online or both. When people read Kiplinger's in 2047, will they be holding a magazine in their hands? I suspect not.<BR>
<BR><I>Mark Hulbert, editor, The Hulbert Financial Digest</I> <BR>
<BR>
<B>Cars: Think headroom</B><BR>
Car interiors are going to be bigger because people are getting bigger. The typical car today is designed for drivers up to 6 feet 2 inches in height. That will probably rise to 6 feet 6 inches by 2047. <BR>
<BR><I>John Herlitz, chief auto designer, Chrysler</I><BR>
<BR>
<B>Cars: Think combustion</B><BR>
Cars will be stronger and lighter, and there will be computer-aided conveniences--smart cars and smart roads. But basically we will be perfuming the pig. At this point there are no viable alternative power sources in sight. What you see now is what you'll be driving in 50 years.<BR>
<BR><I>Brock Yates, editor-at-large, Car & Driver</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR><H3><FONT COLOR=RED>Investing</H3></FONT>

<B>Kinder, gentler bears</B><BR>
Will there still be bear markets and crashes? Yes, probably two every ten years. But future cycles will not be so drastic because there is so much more information and expertise now.<BR>
<BR><I>John Templeton, mutual fund pioneer</I><BR>
<BR>
<B>Cut-rate funds</B> <BR>
The future will bring cost competitiveness to mutual funds. Funds will be managed by more quantitative methods, which will neither outperform nor underperform the average, but will be much less expensive. Some of the witchcraft is going to be driven out of this crazy business. The market is the market, and over 50 years it is impossible to beat.<BR>
<BR><I>John Bogle, chairman, Vanguard Group</I><BR>
<BR>
<B>Put down your arms</B><BR>
The New York Stock Exchange will eventually become electronic. I don't think you're going to see people waving their arms in the air 50 years from now.<BR>
<BR><I>Lester Thurow, author, The Future of Capitalism</I><BR>
<BR>
<B>The east will rise</B><BR>
Well over half of the world's growth will be in Asia. The larger direction is the globalization of almost everything. But within that, Asia will be the dominant region.<BR>
<BR><I>John Naisbitt, author, Global Paradox</I> <BR>
<BR>
<BR><H3><FONT COLOR=RED>Jobs</H3></FONT>

<B>Help wanted</B><BR>
The way people choose where they want to work basically hasn't changed throughout the entire Industrial Revolution. The computer, the Internet and the World Wide Web will become dominant, but they will be an electronic version of resumes and ads.<BR>
<BR><I>Richard Bolles, author, The 1996 What Color Is Your Parachute</I><BR>
<BR>
<B>The plugged-in office</B><BR>
I think we'll see corporate hotels, where they'll assign you an office and you'll plug in your computer and go to work. These could house people from dozens or even hundreds of companies. So, if you change jobs, the workplace may not require that you move. <BR>
<BR><I>John Challenger, outplacement consultant</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR><H3><FONT COLOR=RED>Health and Fitness</H3></FONT>

<B>As young as you feel</B><BR>
Today's young people can be vibrant and active into their eighties and beyond by the year 2047. They not only can slow down the aging process but also can actually reverse it through regular, moderate exercise, good diet and nutritional supplements.<BR>
<BR><I>Dr. Kenneth Cooper, founder of the aerobics movement</I><BR>
<BR>
<B>Smart moves</B><BR>
The smartest people of tomorrow will be in medicine or finance. The desire for good health and more money will never go out of style.<BR>
<BR><I>Marilyn vos Savant, Parade columnist</I> <BR>
<BR>
<BR><H3><FONT COLOR=RED>Money</H3></FONT>

<B>The paper trail</B><BR>
Cash will still be widely used 50 years from now. There will be more electronic transfers of funds, but I am struck by the advantages people attach to paper. <BR>
<BR><I>Lawrence Lindsey, governor, Federal Reserve Board</I><BR>
<BR>
<B>A secure retirement</B><BR>
I tend to be optimistic about the future of social security. We will cut benefits a little, raise taxes a little and raise the retirement age to 70 in gradual steps. But the system will be there indefinitely. <BR>
<BR><I>Robert Myers, former chief actuary, Social Security Administration</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR><H3><FONT COLOR=RED>Society</H3></FONT>

<B>Extending the family</B><BR>
This is the most totally adolescent country in the history of the world, with pop culture and advertising being used as substitutes for parents. By 2047, men will be working very hard to reestablish the extended family.<BR>
<BR><I>Robert Bly, author, Iron John: A Book About Men</I><BR>
<BR>
<B>Yes, ma'am</B><BR>
People will behave perfectly because I'm whipping them into shape. Seriously, I really think we are making progress. The long-term romance with rudeness is finally over. Everyone wants to talk about civility.<BR>
<BR><I>Judith Martin, "Miss Manners"</I><BR>
<BR>
<B>Funny business</B><BR>
The same things that used to tickle me still tickle me, and I'm sure people will be laughing at the same things in 50 years, too. <BR>
<BR><I>Fred Lasswell, creator (in 1934) of the Snuffy Smith comic strip</I><BR>
<BR>
<B>More funny business</B><BR>
Will kids laugh at my stuff in 2047? I'm pretty sure that, 50 years from now, young people will find my humor to be lame and pathetic. That is why I don't mind running up the federal budget deficit and using up the world's oil supply. <BR>

<H1> Getting the Most From Your Health Insurance </H1> 
<P>
<P>
<I> By Kristin Davis</I>
<P>
<P>For many infertility patients, examining the fine print in your insurance policy and doing battle with your insurer can spell the difference between being successful and never getting a chance to try. <P>
<P>
<LI><B>Know your state law.</B> Twelve states have laws that require insurance companies to provide some coverage for medical treatment of infertility. But only six of them  (Arkansas, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts and Rhode Island) require insurers to cover in vitro fertilization and other high-tech treatments. The Wisconsin legislature is considering a similar law. (Call your insurance commissioner's office to find out about the law in your state.)<P>
<P>
     Even in states that require insurers to pick up the tab, there are restrictions and loopholes. Arkansas, for instance, exempts HMOs from its law. And self-insured employers don't have to follow the state mandates.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Know your insurer.</B> The larger your employer, the more likely it self-insures. According to Foster Higgins, a benefits consulting firm, 15% of companies with ten to 499 employees self-insure, but 91% of companies with 20,000 or more employees act as their own insurers. Many self-insured employers use an insurance company to administer claims, so the kind of coverage you have may not be self-evident.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Negotiate with your employer.</B> Having an employer that self-insures isn't necessarily bad. Some cover infertility treatment even though they're not required to. And unlike members of an HMO or a group insurance plan, patients can sometimes persuade their self-insured employers to make exceptions. Because the employer, not the insurance company, is footing the bill, it can decide what to pay for. <P>
<P>
     One woman in Santa Maria, Cal., persuaded her employer to cover a GIFT procedure (see <A HREF = "inguide2.html">A Guide to Procedures & Costs</A>) after initially being denied. Her employer, a Catholic hospital, did not cover any high-tech infertility treatments because the Catholic Church does not condone in vitro fertilization. But after researching the issue herself, the employee discovered that the church does not object to GIFT because fertilization does not occur outside the body. She asked her employer to reconsider, and the hospital agreed to pay for her GIFT procedure.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Read your policy. </B>Most companies distribute a summary of insurance benefits to employees, but to find out exactly what's covered you'll probably need to get a copy of the actual insurance contract from the insurer or your company's personnel office. Pay particular attention to the section labeled "exclusions." An exclusion for "all attempted pregnancies" means no infertility services are covered. But an exclusion for "assisted reproductive technology procedures" might leave the door open for coverage of artificial inseminations or for the tests, ultrasounds and other expenses associated with a high-tech procedure.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Don't rely on a phone call.</B> Brian Allen, a financial counselor at the infertility clinic at the University of Iowa, made that mistake only once. The insurance company representative told him a patient's in vitro fertilization would be covered, but "when she got the bill they stiffed her." A letter (officially, a "predetermination of benefits") from the insurance company stating specifically what it will pay for is legally binding.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Fight rejected claims.</B> Many insurance policies have a blanket exclusion for procedures that are "experimental" or "not medically necessary" and reject claims for infertility treatment on those grounds. Allen says about 15% of the patients he's counseled have been able to get such denials reversed by sending the insurer a letter from their doctor explaining why the procedure is medically necessary or is no longer considered experimental.<P>

<BR><H2> Fifty Years from Now </H2>

<I>By Kristin Davis </I>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> By 2047, digital cash will be king and it will buy the most amazing things--some real, some virtual. Would you believe Dow 700,000? </B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fifty years from now the nation's children will pester their grandparents for stories of what the world was like when we carried paper money in leather wallets, commuted each day to work in office buildings and factories, steered our own cars and did most of our shopping in real stores, not virtual ones. All these familiar activities will seem as curious to children in 2047 as washers with wringers and rotary-dial phones seem to kids today.<BR>
<BR>
But what will life be like? How will Americans work and play? Manage and spend their money? What will our homes be like? Our cars? The answers to these and other questions about the next half century lie in powerful trends that will surely shape its history.<BR>
<BR>
Although the aging of America gets most of the attention when forecasters look ahead, a growing population will also put its stamp on the first half of the 21st century. Imagine an America with 119 million more citizens. They'll have to live somewhere, work somewhere, buy food, shelter, clothes and cars. Some 40 million will be immigrants, whose diversity will enrich the culture and whose ambition will help drive the economy.<BR>
<BR>
     Meanwhile, baby-boomers are destined to be the new century's trend-setting elders, just as they've been the 20th century's trend-setting youngsters and middle-agers. Most boomers will be gone by 2047, but not long gone. Average life expectancy, now about 79 years for females and 73 for males, will climb to 84 and 80. The number of elderly over age 85 will quadruple by then, from roughly four million today to more than 18 million, according to the Bureau of the Census.<BR>
<BR>
As America ages, the proportion of married couples in households with no children at home will soar, stoking the fires of political conflict over taxes for schools, playgrounds and other services for kids, and making today's intergenerational squabbles look like patty-cake.<BR>
<BR>
Technology is another great trend. A maxim known as Moore's Law holds that computing power roughly doubles every 18 months. If that works for just the next 15 years, standard-issue desktop computers will be 1,000% more powerful than they are today, and capable of being hundreds of times smaller. They'll be carried around in our pockets or on our wrists or even in our wrists. <BR>
<BR>
This growth in our capacity to store and manipulate information has already created sweeping changes in practically every phase of our lives, but the greatest changes still lie ahead. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Future Finances</H3>

Today the money you keep in a bank, brokerage account or mutual fund isn't really "money" at all, not in the way we generally think of it. It exists only as a series of digital bits in a computer, recording your monetary claim. Within a couple of decades, all money could be digital, eliminating the need to carry around a pocketful of dirty paper and coins in case you want to buy a cup of coffee or a newspaper.<BR>
<BR>
Digital cash exists already, of course, used mainly but not exclusively on the Internet and branded with names like CyberCash, DigiCash and others. But it's likely to be at least a decade before your corner deli or dry cleaner will also routinely accept payment from your "smart" card, freshly recharged with digital dough at your computer or at a nearby ATM or telephone.<BR>
<BR>
But by the 2030s and 2040s you'll be able to use a smart card to pay everyone, even street vendors and ticket scalpers. Maybe you'll each insert your card into a palm-size reader that will allow you to debit your card for $10 and credit the vendor's for the same. Maybe you won't even need a card reader. Coates & Jarratt Inc., a futurist consulting firm engaged by <I>Kiplinger's</I> to provide research for this story, suggests that soda machines, for instance, could work on a voice or palm print or some other form of "biometric" identification that would automatically debit your card's account. You'll be able to replenish your card (or the biochip embedded in, say, your wrist or your thumb) at any phone or computer by dialing up your bank or broker and having digital money zapped to you.<BR>
<BR>
By 2047, says Coates & Jarratt, it's entirely possible that paper money and coins will be exchanged mainly as collectibles. Edward Cornish, president of the World Future Society, suggests that cash may be shunned by everyone but thieves, tax dodgers and paranoiacs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Money won't be the only thing you'll carry on your smart card. Eventually, a single card will be your electronic wallet, jampacked with the equivalent of all the plastic cards, cash, receipts and miscellaneous slips of paper you now carry around in a wallet or pocketbook. Perhaps it will even display your medical history and photos of your kids. <BR>
<BR>
This sort of multifunction card won't spring up right away, not until banks, credit card associations, phone companies, computer firms and others agree on who will own the cards and who will charge fees for which services. "Business relationships are what will prevent a single card, not technology," says Michael Smith, general manager of Schlumberger Danyl, a major supplier of smart cards. But eventually the various players should figure out a way to share the rent from that pocket-size chunk of real estate. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So now you've got your driver's license, your employee identification, your medical history, and your bank-account and credit card information all conveniently stored on a single smart card. Suppose you leave it in a cab. Couldn't the next passenger use it? And how would you reconstruct all the data on that lost card?<BR>
<BR>
Built-in security mechanisms will make it virtually impossible for someone else to use your card. Sensitive information will be encrypted, and a fingerprint, palm print, voice print or iris scan will be the key that unlocks it. So the smart cards of the future should be safer than the credit cards of today. <BR>
<BR>
Still, you'd hate to lose a lifetime's worth of data to a moment of carelessness. Well, everything you carry on a chip embedded in a plastic card could also be carried on a chip implanted just under the skin, perhaps in your arm or hand. You could add data or retrieve it by wireless transmission. Sensitive information would be encrypted, but some would be readable by anyone--an alert that you're, say, allergic to penicillin would be available to an emergency medical technician who scanned the chip.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now let's pay homage to the lowly penny, the Rodney Dangerfield of coins. Few people even bother to pick one up off the street anymore. But the penny will be king when money goes digital.<BR>
<BR>
Here's a 21st-century version of the kid's lemonade stand: Ten-year-old Emily sets up her own World Wide Web page with three dozen tips for mastering the latest virtual-reality game. She charges a penny to access each tip, easily debiting another kid's allowance through his smart card or biochip. If 100 kids visit Emily's site every day and read an average of five tips each, Emily earns $5 a day, or $1,825 in a year.<BR>
<BR>
Digital money will make micropayments like this possible, even payments in tenths of a cent, because transaction costs will be almost nil. CyberCoin, an early pioneer of micropayment technology, has driven transaction costs down to about 8 cents per payment, and those costs are expected to fall to a fraction of a penny.<BR>
<BR>
The downside for consumers is that a lot of information on the Internet that is free today will probably come with a microfee tomorrow. Instead of free stock quotes, you might pay a tenth of a penny per quote, for instance. Reading a recipe or restaurant review might cost a nickel or a dime. And all that virtual pocket change will quickly add up to real money, digital or not.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Consider careers in the 21st century: Like many others in 2047, John Q. Future works at home--in Maine, in his case. An artificial-intelligence systems engineer, he's engaged in a yearlong project with a software developer in Belgium; he has a two-year consulting contract with a home-building company in Japan; and he picks up shorter-term projects from a temporary agency in Chicago. Through the agency, he buys group health insurance and participates in a 401(k) retirement plan.<BR>
<BR>
On a typical day, John might have a teleconference with his Belgian clients at 6 a.m. his time and another with his Japanese employer at 11 p.m. His home office is equipped with six large, flat-screen monitors that hang on the wall. Each participant in a conference call can appear on a separate screen, in real time. When monitors aren't in use, they display whatever images John chooses.<BR>
<BR>
Most days John works mornings and spends afternoons with his kids. Some days in winter he skis at a nearby resort and resumes work after dinner. Other days he works through the afternoon and takes the evening off. John's pay is as erratic as his work schedule. He gets a monthly check from the Japanese company. He was paid in a lump sum on the Belgian project. He's paid by the hour for projects he gets through his temp agency.<BR>
<BR>
It's a work pattern that is already familiar to the self-employed. Coates & Jarratt projects that 40% of Americans will belong to this "contingent" work force by 2020--from executives and engineers to clerical and secretarial workers. Contingent workers aren't on any company's regular payroll but may be on call for particular projects.<BR>
<BR>
As the proportion of contingent workers in the work force grows, more and more Americans will have to get used to managing a variable income, which takes far more attention and discipline than living on a regular paycheck. Workers will need a fatter emergency fund to cover fixed expenses in lean months. And because automatic investment plans are impractical with a fluctuating income, they will need the discipline to save, invest, and pay taxes when large payments come in. Undoubtedly, software will be developed to manage variable income, automatically directing the first dollars to fixed expenses such as rent and groceries, then allocating the rest to accounts for retirement savings and spending money.<BR>
<BR>
The contingent work force will also have to be skilled at continually finding new work. Temp agencies will expand to fill that role. We'll also rely on electronic clearinghouses in various fields to match available talent with jobs. <BR>
<BR>
The ability of technology to replace bank tellers, insurance agents, and clerical and other service workers creates perhaps the most troubling vision of the future, one that will challenge political leaders, educators and business innovators alike. Coates & Jarratt foresees unemployment rates as high as 30% by 2020 or thereabouts. Other futurists agree that many jobs will be eliminated but argue that there will be plenty of new information-based jobs for those who get adequate retraining.<BR>
<BR>
What kind of education will prepare future workers for such a shifting job market? The pedagogical debate between education for its own sake--learning literature, art, math, science, music (the liberal-arts approach)--and learning specific job skills (the vocational approach) may have to be resolved in favor of a modified liberal-arts approach, with a strong emphasis on thinking and team-building skills. Most learning about future jobs will take place on the job, and workers who know how to learn will have the edge.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Despite our growing ability to work later into life, the retirement age of Americans has been falling for most of the past 50 years. Over the next 50, that trend may reverse, or at least coexist with a tendency to work longer. Social security will probably survive in some form, but it will almost certainly be means-tested, be available eventually only at age 70 or even later, and provide an even smaller portion of retirement income than it does today.<BR>
<BR>
     There will be fewer company-provided pensions, which have already long since begun to give way to employee-funded plans such as 401(k)s. Future retirement will in all likelihood be funded with savings and part-time or sporadic work--and less so with inheritances, as many of today's children will reach retirement age before their parents die. What's clear is that in the future, workers will have to rely more on themselves and less on employers and the government to provide for income and health care in their old age. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dow 700,000. It will be in that neighborhood in 2047 if it grows at an average rate of 10% per year, a little less than its rate over the past several years.<BR>
<BR>
But what kind of investment return can we expect when baby-boomers or their employers stop feeding their retirement plans and start drawing income from them? Will the market stagger, as it did through most of the 1970s, when more money was withdrawn from the stock market than was invested in it?<BR>
<BR>
In a study for the National Bureau of Economic Research, economists Sylvester Schieber and John Shoven project that by 2024, pension plans will be drawing more money out of the market to pay current pension benefits than they will be putting in for future retirees. In other words, pensions will stop being an engine of savings that buoys the market and become a spender of savings, which could sink the market. <BR>
<BR>
Who will take up the slack? Perhaps foreign investors will supply the cash inflows to offset retiring boomers' withdrawals, for the economy will truly be a global one and money will move even more freely across national boundaries than it does today. The imbalance of young and old is even greater, for instance, in Japan, where there is very little immigration to offset a low birthrate, and investors there will be looking to U.S. markets for opportunity. The growing affluence of developing nations such as China, Mexico, Thailand and Turkey will create a whole new investor class that should be attracted to the huge U.S. economy.<BR>
<BR>
Optimists also point out that the echo boom, the 72 million Americans born between 1977 and the mid 1990s, will be reaching their fifties in the 2020s and 2030s. That will put them in their peak earning and saving years just as the youngest of the baby-boomers hit 65. <BR>
<BR>
If you're among the pessimists, the Coates & Jarratt study suggests that the best time for cashing out of the market will be in the 2020s--when those born in the peak years of the baby boom will be between 65 and 70.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Future Spending</H3>

The typical 1997 home contains dozens of tiny computer-chip brains--each doing its own thing--in the VCR, the home computer, the exercise bike, and in newer-model appliances. Homes will "get smart" when all those stand-alone electronic brains plug in to a "central nervous system" that connects all the systems in the home and that communicates with the outside world.<BR>
<BR>
Smart houses, of course, already exist. For $10,000 or so, you can equip a new home with a system that allows you to control lighting, heating and cooling, appliances, and security from anywhere in the home--and from your car or office by phone. Eventually such systems will allow you to program the entertainment center, set the alarm clock, start cooking dinner, start a bath, and turn on lights from any location by voice command. Within a decade, as the price drops, most new homes will be wired for intelligence, if not equipped. But it will take much longer for older homes to be retrofitted for smart-house technology.<BR>
<BR>
Further down the road are self-diagnostic home-building materials, according to Burton Goldberg, program manager of the advanced housing technology program at the National Association of Home Builders Research Center. Instead of traditional lumber, homes will be framed with steel and built with materials that have chemical and electronic sensors that can transmit an alert to a central home-monitoring station when there's a leak or other hidden problem. Eventually, home builders say, new homes will also have modular walls that will let you reconfigure interior space easily as family needs change--creating a large entertainment area out of two or more bedrooms after the kids grow up and leave, for instance.<BR>
<BR>
Even while deregulation brings down the cost of electricity and natural gas, more household energy will be generated at home, using such technology as photovoltaic panels that tap solar power. Photoelectric windows will react to light conditions outside, letting more light in in the winter and less in the summer.<BR>
<BR>
And here's the really good news. In the next five decades, some of these labor-saving devices are real possibilities, according to futurist Joseph Coates:<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Furniture and carpets made of dust-rejecting materials.</B> A constant air-cleaning system would simply suck the dust and dirt out of the air. Or we may have small, dirt-scavenging robots that clean continuously.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Closets-cum-laundry centers.</B> Close the closet door and flip a switch to activate automatic dry-cleaning, via an electrostatic charge or a chemical gas.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Smart pantries.</B> They will track your inventory of food, order more as needed, and suggest meals that can be prepared from what is on hand. A smart refrigerator will tell you when the milk is spoiled.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Smart cooking equipment.</B> Sensors will detect when food is done to your taste and turn down the burner temperature when the water is about to boil over.<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Electronic pet sitters.</B> They could keep an eye on your pets, sounding an alert if they're in danger (or are about to destroy your brand-new sofa).<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>Autonomous lawn mowers.</B> They'll cut the lawn as needed (or perhaps we'll develop grass that never needs to be cut because it grows to only two and a half inches).<BR>
<BR>
<LI><B>A bathroom that scrubs itself.</B> This may be the innovation we're all waiting for: With the door sealed shut, an automatic cleaning system will rinse and disinfect all surfaces. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Years from now, instead of a telephone, a large flat screen will hang on the wall of every room in your house. When you get a call, you'll see the caller in real time, and he'll be able to see you. You could even speak in sign language. Foreign languages will be instantly translated.<BR>
<BR>
     AT&T first marketed the Picturephone in three U.S. cities more than 30 years ago, but at a cost of up to $27 for a three-minute call, the technology had few takers. "Videoconferencing" should become ubiquitous in the next 20 years, making it possible to bring far-flung families together for gatherings. The cost of each conference will probably be negligible because you'll use the Internet rather than a long-distance telephone service. Intel already gives away phone software that lets you call a similarly equipped friend on the other side of the globe via the World Wide Web; you pay your Internet provider as you do for e-mail. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the 21st century, the world will get a lot smaller thanks to advancements in the technology responsible for virtual reality. Now available in crude form at some video arcades, virtual reality allows you to immerse yourself in a computer-simulated environment. Whatever your favorite escape, your first encounter with virtual reality is likely to be some form of entertainment.<BR>
<BR>
Feel like a trip to Venice? Grab your virtual-reality visor and gloves, say ciao, and you'll find yourself in St. Mark's Square. Gaze straight ahead and you'll pass through the huge arched doors of the cathedral, through the nave and to the altar, for a three-dimensional view of the golden altar screen. You can walk around it, even touch it. Or play a virtual tennis match, in which you and your opponent each have an avatar (an image that represents you) on the simulated court you see in your visor. Your avatar will mimic your actual hand and arm movements, measured by sensors, which will determine the speed and placement of your serve or volley. Most likely, you'll pay a small rental fee for using the software.<BR>
<BR>
Virtual reality has practical applications, too. You could learn to ski or rock climb without risk. Out-of-town househunters could walk through dozens of homes in a couple of hours, instead of making a weekend trip. History teachers could take their students to the Battle of Gettysburg or the signing of the Magna Carta (and kids at home with a cold could pop into the classroom). And because you'd hardly have to leave home anymore, you might have a virtual-reality exercise machine that monitors your heart rate as you bike on the Tour de France route.<BR>
<BR>
In a virtual-reality environment, distant friends and family may be "seated" around a table in 3-D hologram for a game of bridge. Spouses enduring long separations may even be able to experience "cybersex." In one version described by futurist Edward Cornish, each remote lover dons a snugly fitting bodysuit containing tiny electronic units woven into its fabric. As the couple move, the bodysuits convey appropriate tactile sensations.<BR>
<BR>
Ain't nothing like the real thing, of course, and flexible work schedules, more leisure time and an increase in affluence should be good news for the travel industry. Expect an increase in niche tourist markets, such as ecotourism, which combines physical activity, explorations of nature and sometimes work in environmental projects. And virtual reality isn't likely to replace live soccer leagues for the kids and fitness activities for the adults.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Secure digital dollars and a lot more competition among online merchants--giving consumers the means to comparison shop--will help change the way we buy. And when, thanks to virtual reality, the shopping experience in the home rivals the sensory experience of shopping in a store (without the hassle of driving and parking), there won't be much reason to hit the mall.<BR>
<BR>
Need a new suit? Your computer will show you only blue or gray suits from Armani or Hickey-Freeman or Haggar, as you've specified. You can try one on your virtual-reality self-image without leaving home, but first you'll need to alter it to reflect that you've lost ten pounds. Enter your new measurements, call up the Virtual Mall, and "model" as many suits as you like.<BR>
<BR>
Once you make a choice, your order will be transmitted to a factory, where your suit will be custom cut to fit and shipped to you the next day. Click on your online e-cash account, or insert your smart card into your computer for payment and specify cash or credit.<BR>
<BR>
Stores will post their inventories and prices on the Internet, so you'll be able to comparison shop for just about anything--coffee from Colombia, textiles from the Middle East--from providers around the world. For expensive items, such as cars, sellers might bid in real time for your business, in a sort of live reverse auction. More high-end items will be leased instead of purchased, says Coates & Jarratt--not just cars but also large appliances.<BR>
<BR>
Stores won't vanish altogether. Some shoppers may still prefer to touch and feel and smell the real thing, especially when shopping for high-ticket items and things that have emotional importance, such as gifts and clothing.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pull out of your garage and head to the automated highway, where the technology packed into your car and a simple painted magnetic stripe on the road will allow you to turn on automatic pilot and drive a lot faster, a lot more safely. Merge into the special automated highway lane, where a computer will note the destination you indicate and validate that your car has the right equipment for hands-free travel. A collision-avoidance system will automatically decelerate when it senses you're too close to the car ahead (a safe following distance may be measured in a few feet) and will indicate that the coast is clear for a lane change. An on-board computer will combine global-positioning technology and real-time information about traffic congestion to select and program your route. Instrument panels will be voice-activated. You'll be free to turn on your laptop computer or watch a movie. And a "driver-performance monitor" will make sure you're not in dreamland when it's time to exit the highway and resume driving.<BR>
<BR>
Sound like a long way off? Not really. This August the National Automated Highway System Consortium, a collaboration of industry, government and academia, will demonstrate at least some of the technology in San Diego, and Disney will unveil a new attraction at Epcot in May in which you ride in a fully automated car. Much of the technology that will make high-speed, hands-free driving possible is already showing up in new cars, though you may have to wait 15 or 20 years before you can drive on autopilot on America's superhighways."It's conceivable that in 50 years you could have a car that will take you from your driveway to wherever you want to go automatically," says Dick Bishop, program manager for research and development of the automated highway system at the Federal Highway Administration.<BR>
<BR>
In a decade, the environmentally friendly Supercar may be on the road. For one thing, it will be far lighter than today's ton-and-a-half hunk of steel--made of lightweight materials that are equally strong. That will allow it to get up to 80 miles to the gallon of gas.<BR>
<BR>
For a longer trip, you may opt for a bullet train (average speed: 150 to 200 miles per hour), which could be operating among some major American cities within a few years. Within 20 years, there could be a new generation of supersonic transport that could cut the flight time from Los Angeles to Tokyo from 11 1/2 hours to four. Or you can trim the flying time to 30 minutes if you hop a suborbital spacecraft.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Advancements in gene therapy will help prevent and cure thousands of diseases. To treat some forms of cancer, for example, doctors may inject a gene that tricks the tumor into committing cellular suicide. Researchers will come up with a vaccine, if not a cure, for AIDS and some cancers, and should conquer such chronic diseases as diabetes, osteoporosis and arthritis.<BR>
<BR>
High-tech treatments and care-giving options will be commonplace: Telemedicine will allow doctors and other health care workers to monitor and diagnose patients by video in the home. Many homes will be equipped with health-monitoring equipment--such as a toilet that analyzes urine for sugar, protein, and red and white blood cells, or equipment that measures cholesterol, blood pressure and body temperature and can relay the information to a doctor. "Robodocs" will be used to perform more precise surgery, or to go where surgeons' hands cannot reach.<BR>
<BR>
New technologies and treatments, plus an aging population, will raise the cost of health care. That could lead to health care rationing, especially for the very elderly, and a shift to home-based care leading up to death, with hospices as the model. Health insurance will probably take a larger share of family income because more people will be self-employed and will have to buy their own coverage.<BR>
<BR>
As we gain the ability to detect, and perhaps correct, genetic defects--even in a two-day-old embryo--the moral and ethical questions will be staggering. Should parents have the right to alter a child's genetic makeup to correct for a predisposition to heart disease or obesity? For personality disorders, such as a predisposition to violence, if we find out they are genetic? For hair and eye color?<BR>
<BR>
Alongside the moral dilemmas are equally agonizing privacy issues, including those that affect the pocketbook. Once genetic tests are routine, insurers are likely to argue that if the information is kept private, those who know they're likely to get sick or die young will load up on insurance, while those whose genes foretell a long, healthy life may buy less. Premiums would rise to cover the higher costs, more healthy people would drop out, premiums would rise further to cover the ill, and eventually the system would collapse.<BR>
<BR>
     The flip side isn't too pretty, either. Say a 45-year-old learns from a genetic test that he is likely to die within ten years. A life insurance company with that knowledge would no longer charge him premiums based on the life expectancy of all people that age but rather based on the amount of money it needs to set aside to pay his death benefits in ten years. Health insurers would levy premiums to ensure that their anticipated expenses were fully funded. Taken to the extreme, policyholders could come close to paying their actual costs in installments, rather than pooling the risk with others.<BR>
<BR>
Society will have to address these tough issues. Eventually--perhaps through government-provided or government-guaranteed health insurance--the system should catch up with modern realities and find an equitable way to insure everyone.  <BR>

<H2> What We Said</H2>

<B> Some excerpts from the early years.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><H3><FONT COLOR=RED> Government Was More Efficient Then </H3></FONT>

<I>From "Notes on This and That," October 1947</I><BR>
<BR>
Now that sugar is more plentiful, moonshining is more plentiful, moving up rapidly toward the prewar volume. So the Revenue Bureau is steaming up all of its revenooers to go after the moonshiners, and this shows how alert a government can be.<BR>
<BR>
Also alert on another front is the government agency that disposes of surplus war supplies. This agency has put on the market a large number of stills that were used during the war to distill drinking water, but which are said to be admirably suitable for distilling corn mash. The advertisement of these stills makes it clear that they are very efficient, and even smokeless.<BR>
<BR>
This is a truly great example of how one government agency can create business for another government agency, and show a profit all around.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><H3><FONT COLOR=RED> Getting Started </H3></FONT>

<I> From "What a Young Man Should Do With His Money--If Any," July 1948</I><BR>
<BR>
The young man should start by buying at least $20,000 of life insurance, half in convertible term and half in ordinary life. Twenty thousand dollars may sound like a lot, but it won't provide much of an income. <BR>
<BR>
This insurance will cost $300 of the young man's yearly savings if he is 25, or $340 if he is 30. The rest of his savings should go toward a home. He should plan on a cash down payment of at least 25% of its value. If he buys today, he should buy an $8,000 house. Or he could wait until he has more cash or until real estate prices come down, or both. Home prices today are about double prewar. They will probably settle down to between 50% and 75% above prewar.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3><FONT COLOR=RED> It's Been a Long Campaign </H3></FONT>

<I> From "Corporations: Speak English, Please," August 1948</I><BR>
<BR>
You corporation officers are familiar with the language of the accountant, with its grosses and nets and balance sheet figures. To you, it is not a strange tongue. <BR>
<BR>
     But to the average person, even to the average stockholder, the corporation reports might as well be in Latin. Average people who want to know a little something about your business must get the reports translated. You complain that the public does not understand the intricacies of corporation management. It's no wonder. <BR>
<BR>
Your stockholders are important people, and they think in English. So do you, but you don't always talk it. Try it on your people. It will be good for your business.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3><FONT COLOR=RED> When Mutual Funds Were Young </H3></FONT>

<I> From "Buy Stocks If . . . ," May 1949</I><BR>
<BR>
Stocks look cheap today when weighed against recent earnings. . . . But so far these attractive figures haven't impressed the average person. <BR>
<BR>
Why buy stocks? There are two reasons: one, if you buy wisely you can probably make more money in common stocks than you can in something "safe." Two, the country needs your surplus money for risk capital.<BR>
<BR>
One way to get diversification is to buy stock in an investment trust. The investment trust takes your money and invests it, along with the funds of other investors, in stock of from 30 to 150 companies. You get the profits, minus expenses for operation of the trust. There are over a hundred investment trusts, some specializing in safer investments, some in speculative stocks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><H3><FONT COLOR=RED> When Joe Camel Was a Calf </H3></FONT>

<I> From "Cigarette Ads Are Phony," November 1950</I><BR>
<BR>
Most of the cigarette makers . . . do not agree [with the FTC] that their advertising claims are "inaccurate," "deceptive," "false" and "misleading." The average cigarette smoker knows pretty well for himself, without the aid of any government agency, that the advertising claims of the manufacturers are a good deal like the spiel of the barker at a sideshow. The customer knows, and the barker knows, that the spiel is better than the show, but anyway, the patrons flock in.  <BR>

<H2> Two Generations and Their Money
</H2>

<I>By Stephanie Gallagher
</I>
<BR>
<BR>
<B> Sidney and Maje were married in 1947, about the year that Garry and Barb were born. When it comes to their finances, the generation gap is conspicuous.
</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Born in 1947, you were an early boomer, part of the Woodstock generation and a veteran of the Vietnam experience. You rejected authority and couldn't wait to move out of your parents' house in the suburbs. <BR>
<BR>
Married in 1947, you grew up during the Depression and lived through rationing (or lived on rations) during World War II. You moved in with your parents until you could scrape together enough money to buy a house of your own in the suburbs. <BR>
<BR>
Influenced by such radically different cultural backgrounds, how have members of both generations adapted to the revolutionary changes in personal finance over the past 50 years? Credit cards in every wallet. Mutual funds for the masses. Home-equity loans that let you borrow against the value of your house in the suburbs.<BR>
<BR>
Barbara Boswell will celebrate her 50th birthday on September 14, a milestone that her husband, Garry, reached in November. Barb is secretary to the director of finance for the village of Libertyville, Ill., about 45 miles north of Chicago. Garry, a pharmacist, works in research and development for Fujisawa USA, a subsidiary of a large Japanese pharmaceutical firm. Barb and Garry live in Grayslake, Ill., a suburb of Chicago. <BR>
<BR>
Sidney and Mary Jane "Maje" Wasch will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary in 1997. The Wasches have been retired since 1978, when Sid stepped down as chief executive officer of Bucilla Corp., a needlecraft business in New York City. Sid, 75, and Maje, 71, moved to Sarasota, Fla., about six years ago. <BR>
<BR>
The Boswells hope they're on the road to the comfortable retirement the Wasches now enjoy. But in almost every aspect of their finances--careers, housing, credit, investing--their paths have diverged, as each couple was drawn inevitably along the trail blazed by fellow members of their generation.  <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Common bonds</H3>

<I>March 30, 1947. Sid Wasch and Maje Ansorge have a small but elegant wedding at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in Manhattan. About 65 guests attend the sit-down dinner ($2.65 a plate), and Maje is radiant in a white gown ($25 from Henri Bendel).</I> <BR>
<BR>
Sid and Maje met in 1946, when Sid returned home to Brooklyn after serving four years with the Signal Corps at an Army Air Corps base in China. Their courtship was brief, but they had a lot in common. Both were born during the 1920s. Both of their fathers had owned businesses that failed during the Depression. In 1935 Maje Ansorge had moved with her parents and two sisters from a 14-room mansion on Long Island to a five-room apartment in Brooklyn. They took in a boarder to help pay the rent. <BR>
<BR>
     After graduating from high school in 1942, Maje won a scholarship to Hofstra University. But her father didn't believe in girls' going to college, so she went to work instead and took night classes at New York University. Her job with the Veterans Administration paid a princely $27 a week. With her first paycheck, she took her father to the opera.<BR>
<BR>
     Like the Ansorges, the Wasches moved from a house on Long Island to an apartment in Brooklyn when the family business failed in 1931. Sidney Sr. worked odd jobs, sold liquor after Prohibition ended, and even tried (and failed) to start a new company. Then he had a heart attack and couldn't work at all.<BR>
<BR>
     Young Sidney graduated from high school in three and a half years and did well enough to get into any college he wanted. But in 1938 he went to work instead as a stock clerk for Bernhard Ulmann, the company that later became Bucilla. His salary: $13 a week, $7 of which he gave to his mother to support the family, which included a younger sister. He began taking night courses at Brooklyn College (it would take him 12 years to get his degree). <BR>
<BR>
After nine months on the job Sid got a raise, to $14 a week. But his rise through the company was interrupted by the war. Now the sole support of his family (his father died in 1939), Sid sent home part of his monthly paycheck to his mother, and the government sent her a little extra--which she tucked away. <BR>
<BR>
When Maje and Sid were married, Maje's parents gave them $500 to start their life together. Sid's mothersurprised them with $1,500--the money she had put aside while Sid was in the service. It was enough to pay for a ten-day honeymoon in Bermuda, with a little left over. <BR>
<BR>
The Wasches set up housekeeping in a $40-a-month, two-room apartment with a kitchen, a living room and a Murphy bed. Sid was back on the job at Bernhard Ulmann. By 1949 his earnings hit $90 a week, and the Wasches were ready to start a family.<BR>
<BR>
When Richard, the first of their three children, was born that year, they set up a crib in the kitchen, then headed out to Long Island, where a fellow named Levitt was building homes in a potato field. But even the affordable houses in Levittown were selling for $8,000, so Maje and Sid decided to rent a house instead. Two years later they bought their first home, a three-bedroom house in East Meadow for $13,750. They put down $750 in cash, more than half of their entire life savings of $1,200. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Sentimental journey</H3>

<I>June 28, 1969. About 200 guests attend the wedding of Barb Jonte and Garry Boswell at the Methodist church across the street from the University of the Pacific, in Stockton, Cal. Barb's mother made the wedding dress, and Garry got the flowers wholesale through his job with a florist. They serve punch and finger food, and split the expenses among both sets of parents and the newlyweds. </I><BR>
<BR>
Barb and Garry had met while both were students at the University of the Pacific. Whereas Maje and Sid Wasch had to forgo a full-time college education, it was a foregone conclusion for Barb and Garry that they would continue their schooling. Neither of Garry's parents had gone to college, and they viewed education as the ticket out of the uncertain life of migrant farming they had experienced as children in Oklahoma.<BR>
<BR>
The Boswells had lived in and around Stockton for most of Garry's childhood. His father did painting and carpentry, and his mother went to work when they needed money. Eventually they both became real estate brokers and opened their own business in 1963. For Garry, the University of the Pacific seemed a natural choice. It was one of only three colleges in California with a school of pharmacy, the field he wanted to pursue, and it was nearby, so he could save money by commuting. <BR>
<BR>
Barb had her own connections to the university. Her grandfather had taught there, and it was her father's undergraduate alma mater. She was born while her father was a graduate student at Iowa State; her mother worked evenings to bring in extra money. It was a typical graduate-school lifestyle. The family lived in married-student housing, and "for entertainment, we went to Dad's lab or to the football stadium to watch the team practice," Barb recalls. <BR>
<BR>
Her father eventually earned a PhD and took a job as a geochemist for Texaco in Houston. When Barb was ready for college, sentiment drew her to the University of the Pacific, where she majored in education. Quiet Barb met gregarious Garry at a party for incoming pharmacy students, and four years later they were married. <BR>
<BR>
After the wedding, Garry was drafted and served in Vietnam as a pharmacist at a base hospital. Barb moved to San Jose, rented an apartment and took a job as a secretary and office manager for a doctor.<BR>

<H3>Generation gaps</H3>

Sid Wasch would go on to build a 40-year career with the same company, with no regrets. "I looked at myself in comparison to my peers and I had confidence that I was going to move up," he says. Garry Boswell moved around, by choice, alternating between jobs in the pharmaceuticals industry and three stints of active duty with the Army. He also went back to graduate school.<BR>
<BR>
      Maje Wasch quit her job when her first child was born. "I didn't want a career," she says. "I wanted a baby." Barb Boswell took a year off when each of her children was born, but "working was a necessity," she says.<BR>
<BR>
In 1958 the Wasches moved up to a bigger house, in Roslyn, N.Y., and stayed there for 31 years. The Boswells have lived in a succession of apartments and houses, always buying with an eye to selling at a profit. In 1976 they paid $48,000 for their first home, a three-bedroom ranch in North Hollywood; they sold it in 1980 for $100,000. "Never would we own the same house for 30 years," says Garry. "We want to see different things." <BR>
<BR>
After their wedding, Barb and Garry acquired credit cards by the fistful. At one point they had at least ten to 15--and carried a balance on each. By contrast, Maje and Sid never bought anything "on time," as they put it. "In our entire lives, the only loans we ever took out were for the mortgages," says Sid. They even paid cash for all of their cars, starting with a 1949 Ford that didn't have a heater. "After we bought a car, we would put money aside as if we were paying someone else, so we always had the money when we needed a new car," says Maje.<BR>
<BR>
Saving was always a priority for the Wasches. While Maje worked those first two years, they banked her salary and used that money to buy their first car and make part of the down payment on their house. <BR>
<BR>
Although they didn't have health insurance, they could have handled the $200 cost of a normal childbirth when their daughter, Ellen, was born in 1957. But Ellen was born prematurely, and the expense of months in an incubator threatened to overwhelm them. "Finally, I spoke to my physician and asked if Ellen could be moved to a county hospital," recalls Maje. "The doctor talked the hospital into waiving its fee." It wasn't until Sid's company was taken over by a bigger firm in 1960 that the family got health coverage.<BR>
<BR>
The Boswells never had to worry about unmanageable medical bills. Both of their children were born when Garry was on active military duty, so they were covered under the HMO-style military health care plan. <BR>
<BR>
But in the early years Barb and Garry weren't as diligent about saving money as the Wasches. "We always had a savings account," says Barb. "We just weren't always good about paying ourselves first."<BR>
<BR>
They mended their ways after Garry got his PhD in 1980 and was working at an Army medical center. With a comfortable income, the Boswells could afford to take up golf and go on big vacations. "We decided this was the lifestyle we wanted to maintain in retirement and figured out what kind of dollars we'd need," says Garry. "Then we set some specific goals to reach those numbers." They started by paying off their credit card balances (it took them six months) and canceled most of the cards. Now they carry one Visa, one MasterCard and a Sears card, and pay off their balances every month.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>Behind the curve</H3>

With something to shoot for, the Boswells began making regular contributions to tax-deferred retirement accounts. Garry has 12% of his pay automatically transferred to his 401(k) plan, which his company matches by 3%. Barb contributes 4.5% of her salary to her retirement plan. At that rate, they figure, they'll be able to retire at age 60. <BR>
<BR>
Overall, most of their portfolio is in equities--40% in stocks and 60% in mutual funds, and high-risk funds at that, including Fidelity Select Computers and Fidelity Select Electronics. Despite once losing money in silver futures, "I tend to be aggressive," says Garry, "because I'm slightly behind the curve of where I should be."<BR>
<BR>
The Wasches have always been conservative investors. "When I was growing up, I heard nothing but 'The stock market shoulda, woulda, coulda,' and it turned me off," says Maje. Sid's company never had a formal pension plan, but it did offer profit-sharing and a 401(k). Sid also set up a Keogh account with outside income he earned as a consultant. "Throughout my life I have contributed the maximum to every sheltered program for which I became eligible," he says.<BR>
<BR>
When he retired, he rolled all of that money over to an IRA that is now "a significant part of our net worth." The Wasches' retirement assets are mostly in fixed-income investments, such as bank CDs and bonds, but Sid is willing to risk about 20% of his money in stocks, using a complex market-timing system of his own creation that he says has yielded consistently good results.<BR>
<BR>
The Wasches never put money aside specifically for  college. When their children were ready to go, Sid was moving up in the company, so they were able to cover the bulk of tuition, room and board at private schools out of their current income (books and spending money were the kids' responsibility). "College didn't look nearly as expensive in those days as it does today," recalls Sid. "When I sent my daughter to the University of Pennsylvania, my out-of-pocket expense was a maximum of $6,000."<BR>
<BR>
The Boswells used to live in Texas, where their son, Glenn, 23, is paying his own way through Southwest Texas State University. He still lives there on his own to qualify for in-state tuition. Garry has a partial disability from an injury he suffered on active duty with the Army in California. Because he's a disabled veteran, their daughter, Linnea, 16, is eligible for free tuition at any state university in California.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H3>The comfort zone</H3>

Although they've arrived by different routes, both the Wasches and the Boswells have achieved a measure of financial satisfaction. For example, they can both afford to indulge their love of travel: Maje and Sid are gone about three months of the year, and Barb and Garry plan at least one major trip annually. <BR>
<BR>
What advice would each couple give to the generations that will marry or be born in 1997? "Start early, because the biggest thing you've got going for you is time," says Garry. Maje believes that "one reason we were successful in life was because we were always looking ahead." <BR>
<BR>
For Sid's 75th birthday, his children presented him with a book of lessons they had learned from him over the years: "A confident approach works wonders. Lead by example. Go to the best school you can get into. Be disciplined in your savings. If you have to do something, you might as well do it with a smile."  <BR>

<H2>Food for Thought: Grocery Rebates </H2>


<B>  Supermarkets are ringing up cash-back bonuses. </B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For credit card users who are hooked on rebate cards, it's been a tough couple of months. First, GE Capital, which issues the GE Rewards MasterCard, announced it would begin charging a $25 annual fee to cardholders who pay less than $25 a year in finance charges. Then General Motors cut in half the maximum benefit on its gold card, from $7,000 to $3,500.<BR>
<BR>
Now some rebate programs are being eliminated altogether. Chase Manhattan Bank recently suspended opening new accounts with its Cash Builder Visa, which offered cardholders a 1% cash rebate, and Old Kent Bank just eliminated its CardMiles program, which let cardholders earn airline miles that could be traded in for free tickets on any airline.<BR>
<BR>
But rebate addicts needn't worry about being cut off cold turkey. Even as some issuers are scaling back their programs, others are introducing new ones. Some of the most generous newcomers are supermarkets, which typically offer credit cards with no annual fee and a rebate of 1% to 3%, depending on where you make your purchases. You may have to redeem your rewards for store merchandise, but the caps are higher than on other credit cards--and what household doesn't need groceries.<BR>
<BR>
     Bi-Lo, one of the largest food retailers in the Southeast, offers a Visa that gives cardholders a 3% rebate on in-store purchases and 2% on purchases made elsewhere. The rebate cap is $500 a year, redeemable in certificates good at any of 269 Bi-Lo stores (for a listing of supermarket cards, see the table at left).<BR>
<BR>
     Why are supermarkets stepping in when other retailers are pulling back? Because people who buy with credit cards tend to spend more, says Glenn Gibson, of Retail Online Information Systems, a consulting firm that works with the supermarket industry. "The supermarkets are always looking for another way to entice customers," says Gibson. "They've tried gift certificates and frequent-shopper rewards, and there's not a whole lot left."<BR>
<BR>
Not all rebate-card issuers are pulling the plug. You can still get a good deal if you find a card that fits your spending habits. Rewards on some cards--the Blockbuster Visa,  Charles Schwab Visa and just about all gasoline cards--can be redeemed only for merchandise or services from the issuing retailer or its affiliates, so consider whether that's a restrictionyou want to live with.<BR>
<BR>
Gasoline purchases, for instance, can easily amount to several thousand dollars a year if you're a frequent driver. So if you don't mind sticking with one brand, the Sunoco MasterCard (800-786-3003), with its 4% rebate on Sunoco purchases, can be worth your while. Spend $2,000 a year at Sunoco and you'll get a rebate on your statement for $80 worth of gas.<BR>
<BR>
The Blockbuster Visa (800-341-7596) offers a tempting 5% rebate on Blockbuster purchases, but you'd have to rent more than 500 movies to get the same $80 rebate you'd get with the Sunoco card (both cards give you a 1% rebate on purchases made at other stores).<BR>
<BR>
It also makes a difference if the rebate is capped. GE Rewards offers tiered cash rebates of 0.5% to 2%, but there's a cap of $10,000 a year on qualifying purchases. Your maximum annual rebate is $140--minus the $25 annual fee if you pay your bill in full. For heavy-duty card users who charge more than $10,000, the Discover card (800-347-2683) would be worth considering because it doesn't cap its 1% cash rebate.<BR>
<BR>
  An even better deal is the US West Visa or MasterCard (800-353-5409), which gives rebates ranging from 0.5% to 2% with no annual caps. And its tiered rate is more generous than either GE's or Discover's, so you'd get $175 cash back for your first $10,000 in charges. There's no annual fee, and if you use US West for your calling-card calls, you get rebates on those, too. <BR>
<BR>
Among airline and travel cards, a good choice is American Express Membership Rewards ($25 program fee, plus the regular annual fee for the card, but the program fee is waived for Gold Plus and Platinum cards; 800-297-3276). You earn one point for every dollar you spend, redeemable for frequent-flier miles, hotel points, car-rental rewards and vacation packages. Points can be combined with other frequent-flier or hotel programs, so you can earn double credit if you use the card to charge airline tickets or hotel bills. There's no annual limit on points and no credit limit, which makes Membership Rewards particularly attractive to business owners, who may charge thousands of dollars a month in expenses.<BR>
<BR>
One rebate card to avoid is the Mellon Cornerstone MasterCard. It rebates 100% of the interest you've paid--but only after 20 years. You can choose to get 10% of the interest back after two years and 5% each year thereafter. But you'd have to pay $1,000 in interest over two years to get $100 back--and you'd still be out $900 in interest charges.<BR>
<BR>
To get the most from a rebate card, you have to pay off your balance in full each month. Most rebate cards charge interest rates that are eight to ten percentage points above the prime rate, says Robert McKinley of RAM Research, a card-tracking firm, so if you carry a balance, your rebate is hardly significant once you've paid interest costs. --Stephanie Gallagher<BR>

<H3>Keep an eye on price scanners</H3>

When grocery stores became the first retailers to introduce electronic price scanners, customers were reluctant to give up the security of having the price stamped on the can or package. With nothing but a universal price code on the package, how could they be sure they weren't being cheated? <BR>
<BR>
A new study shows that price scanners do make mistakes, but by and large they're small ones--and more often than not they're in the consumer's favor. Conducted by the Federal Trade Commission, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and a number of state attorneys general, the study inspected more than 17,000 items at 294 stores, including automotive, department-store, discount, drug, food, home-improvement and toy retailers in a total of seven states. Of the items scanned, 2.6% registered prices that were lower than those posted or advertised, while 2.2% registered higher prices. Total undercharges of $1,320 in the sample exceeded total overcharges of $1,173, for a net gain to consumers of $147. <BR>
<BR>
Scanner errors are more likely to result from "inattentiveness or carelessness, rather than willfulness," the study concludes. So it pays to compare your receipt with posted prices, especially in department stores, which had the highest overall scanner error rate, 9.2%.<BR>
<BR>
Just ask Priscilla Jackman of Ross Township, Pa. She bought a $200 raincoat that had been marked down 40%, but the cash register rang up a price of $129.95 instead of $120. When Jackman pointed out the mistake, the flustered salesclerk told her, "We've been selling those coats at that price for days, and you're the first one to point it out." Jackman got the lower price.        <BR>
<BR>

<HR WIDTH=100% NOSHADE>
<H3>Does your CD rate stack up?</H3>

Abe Shliferstein wanted to teach his sons, ages 9 and 12, about prudent investing. When the boys' savings accounts grew large enough, he moved the money into higher-paying certificates of deposit. But when it came time to roll over the CDs last September, it was Abe who learned a lesson.<BR>
<BR>
Summit Bank, in New Jersey, which held the CDs, was offering an interest rate of 4.43% on one-year certificates--lower than the 5.5% rate the boys were earning on their maturing CDs and well below the one-year national average of 5.06% quoted in <I>Kiplinger's </I>at the time. When Shliferstein checked out rates for CDs of different terms, he found that rates for odd-term CDs--with maturities of, say, five months or seven months--were sometimes substantially higher than rates for the nearest standard-term certificate. For example, while Summit was paying only 2.5% on its six-month CD, it was offering 4.35% on five-month CDs and 4.4% on seven-month certificates.<BR>
<BR>
A sneaky way to lowball unwitting depositors who automatically roll over standard-term CDs? Banks say no. To keep all their certificates from coming due at the same time--and thereby running the risk of losing deposits to institutions that may be offering higher rates--banks can either raise their rates on standard-term CDs or try to stagger maturities by giving customers an incentive to buy CDs that come due at odd intervals, such as 13 months. <BR>
<BR>
Many banks have chosen the latter, even going a step further by lowering their standard-term rates. In fact, dramatic differences between standard- and odd-term CD rates are common, according to Rick Barham, of Market Rates Insight, which monitors CD rates.<BR>
<BR>
But you can miss promotional interest rates if you roll over a certificate automatically. Instead, shop around--and shop far afield. "You can typically earn between one and two percentage points more by going to an out-of-state institution," says Robert Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor. <BR>
<BR>

<H3>Online advice from your bank</H3>

Brokerage firms such as Fidelity and Charles Schwab will work up personalized financial worksheets online, and you can get online stock and mutual fund quotes from<I> Microsoft Money </I>and <I>Quicken Deluxe</I>. Soon you'll be able to get all this financial advice and more from a single online source--your bank.<BR>
<BR>
<I>One on One Banking</I>, a product of Vertigo Development Group, will let banks provide free personalized financial advice to their customers on the Internet 24 hours a day. Vertigo plans to have the program up and running at the top 20 banks nationwide--including Bank of America and Crestar--in the next few months. Check with your bank for more details, or see <A HREF = "http://www.vertigodev.com">Vertigo's World Wide Web site</A> for information about the program.<BR>
<BR>
If you're a customer of a participating bank, you're eligible for the service. To take advantage of it, you fill out a confidential worksheet online that details your financial history, including information on your net worth, goals and investment portfolio. The software chews on your answers and spits out individualized advice on such things as how much insurance you need and whether your portfolio is balanced. If you have questions, a bank representative will e-mail you. <BR>
<BR>
<I>One on One Banking</I> will also give you personalized stock and mutual fund tips--but it will recommend only products and services sold through your bank, so it's a subtle sales pitch. If you're satisfied with the range of choices your bank offers, fine. If not, the program is still a good (and free) starting point for advice on home buying, college saving and retirement planning.<BR>

<H2> Encyclopedias on CD-ROM  </H2>


<B> All that data on a disk is a natural. Which is best?</B>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

You can add encyclopedia salesmen to the list of occupations that technology has rendered obsolete. CD-ROM encyclopedias have more information and are easier and more enjoyable to use than their tree-impairing ancestors, so the choice between electronic and conventional versions is a no-brainer. And that's not counting the fact that the CD-ROMs are far cheaper than their paper-and-ink counterparts. <BR>
<BR>
The encyclopedias we reviewed not only have as much information as the bound volumes--including maps, photographs and illustrations--but also (with one exception) contain sound recordings and video clips.<BR>
<BR>
That makes multimedia research fun as well as accessible. Looking up "zither" in the <I>Grolier</I> encyclopedia presents you with a picture of the stringed instrument and lets you hear its twang. A narrated animation in <I>Compton's</I> makes it crystal clear how a lunar eclipse happens. Enter "Beethoven" in Microsoft's Encarta and you'll hear snippets of the composer's greatest works. <BR>
<BR>
Electronic encyclopedias can search entire data bases, not just index headings, for words, parts of words or combinations of words describing your topic of interest. Then with a mouse click they take you to related entries. They also present novel ways of organizing knowledge along broad themes, such as historical timelines.<BR>
<BR>
The new CD-ROM encyclopedias are far more than data-stuffed disks. Each features direct links to its publisher's home page or to other World Wide Web sites that let you obtain more timely information than the CD-ROMs themselves contain. (Britannica's home page even offers a free seven-day trial.) The online services may also have versions of the encyclopedias, but they tend to be more text-oriented than the CD-ROMs.<BR>
<BR>
We gave each encyclopedia we reviewed from one to four stars for completeness of information; multimedia content, including video clips, animations and sound bites; kid-friendliness (mainly, entertainment value to those with limited attention spans); and ease of use (how the information is organized, how well the text is integrated with the multimedia features and how quickly you can retrieve data). All except <I>Compton's</I> sell a version for Macintosh users.<BR>

<BR>
If you demand complete, authoritative information above all, <A HREF = "http://www.vertigodev.com">Encyclopedia Britannica</A>'s <I>Britannica</I> CD 97 (list price, $299; 800-554-9862; http://www.eb.com) is a good choice. Among its 67,000 articles--it boasts nearly twice as many as any other CD-ROM reference tool reviewed here--are 2,000 not in the printed version (which, by the way, costs $995). <I>Britannica</I>'s entries also tend to be longer than the other electronic encyclopedias.<BR>
<BR>
In test searches, <I>Britannica</I> routinely turned up more written information than the other encyclopedias we reviewed. A typical example: Looking up the Second Law of Thermodynamics produced a lengthy article on that precise subject in <I>Britannica</I>, while the other references had briefer descriptions in entries on broader topics. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Britannica</I>'s biggest downfall compared with the others is its limited number of photos and illustrations (only 4,200, including maps) and lack of multimedia content--it has no video clips, animations or sound bites. And as anyone who has ever consulted the bound volumes of <I>Britannica</I> might anticipate, the entries suffer from a rather dry, academic (though indisputably authoritative) tone. This is for serious information seekers only, and children under the age of 12 or 13 won't be drawn in. If you want to be entertained, look elsewhere.<BR>
<BR>
But it is easy to use. <I>Britannica</I> runs the popular <I>Netscape Navigator 2.0</I> Web browser as the interface for its program. The opening screen is clean and uncluttered. A handful of options, represented by clickable buttons, let you select the information you want to see. Most of the time, you'll "flip through" <I>Britannica</I> using a keyword search tool to scan articles for mentions of your desired information, just like a search of the Web. Click on your choices; related entries are marked with an "index" button, which leads to a clearly presented outline of the subject made up of hypertext. Speed is not the <I>Britannica</I> program's forte. In fact, you may think it has gone to sleep while you await the results of each search.<BR>
<BR>
Clicking the "online" button on the encyclopedia's main screen connects you directly to the<I> Britannica Online</I> home page. Here you'll find basically the same material as on the CD-ROM but more frequently updated.<BR>

<H3>Compton's Interactive Encyclopedia 1997</H3>

<BR>
<A HREF = "http://www.learningco.com"><I>Compton's 1997</I></A> ($50; 800-227-5609) has an impressive-sounding 37,000 articles, but entries tend to be brief. And there are surprising gaps. For instance, forget looking up Shaquille O'Neal--the basketball giant doesn't appear here. The program also has only 8,000 photos and illustrations, 100 full-motion videos and slide shows, 16 hours of sound recordings and 705 maps--fewer multimedia offerings than all but <I>Britannica</I>.<BR>
<BR>
That said, <I>Compton's</I> uses the multimedia format more adeptly than its competitors. Its graphics are clever and compelling. Small icons next to lists of topics tell you whether an entry includes text, photos, video, sound, a map or an online connection. With the split-screen format you can, for instance, read an article, watch a video and view a map all at once.<BR>
<BR>
Different ways of presenting information, such as the Explore feature, are intended more for children than adults. (In "Madcap Music," for example, clicking on the piano sheet music calls up an explanation of key signatures and counting notes and chords.) One new feature in 1997 is the Planetarium. This astronomy tool lets you see how the stars, comets, planets and other features of the night sky would look from nearly any vantage point on the globe, at any time of year, and will take you on a "Star Quest"--a game designed to introduce you to space exploration and astronomy. <I>Compton's</I> is the only CD-ROM encyclopedia whose "guided tour" is given by a human in full-motion video--in this case, by Patrick Stewart of <I>Star Trek</I> fame.<BR>
<BR>
All of the above makes <I>Compton's</I> a very good choice for younger students. It's an easy read, well suited for simple curiosity or for the light research demanded by grade-school papers. In fact, <I>Compton's ShowMaker</I> lets you paste together photos, maps, sounds--even your own narration--to create custom multimedia shows on any topic. <BR>
<BR>
<I>Compton's</I> is available online to America Online and Prodigy subscribers; the CD-ROM comes with a 30-day trial subscription to AOL. Hundreds of its entries include links to related Web sites. Updated information can be downloaded, stored on your hard drive and incorporated seamlessly into the encyclopedia.<BR>

<BR>
<A HREF = "http://www.grolier.com"><I>Grolier</I></A> ($55; 800-285-4534) is a solid, all-around offering for the entire family. It has 35,000 articles, 10,000 photos and illustrations, 200 videos and animation clips, 15 hours of audio and 1,200 maps. Unfortunately, <I>Grolier</I> hasn't mastered multimedia as well as <I>Compton's</I> or Microsoft's <I>Encarta</I>. Information and features aren't as well integrated; there are separate indexes for articles and multimedia, and you have to click back and forth to get from one to the other.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Grolier</I>'s Gallery contains the multimedia elements, the Atlas has maps and the Yearbook covers events of the past year. "Interactivities," a series of illustrated entries on anatomy, habitats and space exploration, among other topics, is an attempt to grab kids' attention but is limited in both its content and presentation. And <I>Grolier</I> is the only CD-ROM encyclopedia that doesn't include a dictionary.<BR>
<BR>
Online versions of <I>Grolier</I> are offered on AOL and CompuServe. The new edition of <I>Grolier</I> comes with an Internet index connecting thousands of highlighted terms in its articles to Internet sites selected by its researchers.<BR>

<BR>
If multimedia is your main goal, your best bet is <I>Encarta Deluxe</I> ($80; 800-426-9400). The good news is that it comes on two CDs, so there's enough room for a total of 14,000 photos and illustrations, 970 maps, 150 videos and animations and 2,300 sound clips (about 16 hours' worth)--far more than the others. The bad news is: It comes on two CDs. The message that tells you to insert the other CD-ROM to finish a search is annoying. (To avoid it, you can choose the $55 standard version, which has only 7,700 images, 35 videos and nine and a half hours of sound clips.)<BR>
<BR>
Both editions have a not-too-shabby 30,000 articles. Elaborate visual displays in <I>Deluxe</I>, called Collages, cover broad topics such as astronomy and the history of photography. As you scroll through, you can click on an illustration to take you to a specific article, image or clip. The 360-degree feature lets you (virtually) stand still while the camera pans the landscape. And for study breaks, Microsoft includes a "MindMaze" game to test your knowledge. <BR>
<BR>
Guided Tours combine tidbits of information under umbrella rubrics such as "Overcoming Adversity." There are also Interactivities consisting of collections of sights, sounds and simulations on topics such as world music and natural wonders.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Encarta</I> has a mature, no-nonsense feel. If that's not enough to turn kids off, its search tool is also overly complex. Instead of simply clicking on highlighted words inside an entry to go to a link, as the others do, <I>Encarta</I> makes you choose a "more information" menu item. This leads to a plenitude of choices: related encyclopedia articles, Web sites, monthly updates, even the <I>Encarta Online Library</I>, a dial-up collection of news articles available for a fee. But it may be too much. Similarly, <I>Encarta</I>'s word-search feature makes you choose among three options when one would be enough.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Encarta</I>'s online resources are meaty. In addition to preset Web links, there is Yearbook, a monthly update you can download by calling the <I><A HREF = "http://www.microsoft.com">Encarta Online</A></I> Web site. It is free to deluxe-edition users but costs $20 for 18 months for regular <I>Encarta</I> buyers. The <I>Encarta Online Library </I>is a service that, for a $6.95 monthly fee, connects to a Web site containing downloadable magazine and newspaper articles and other research resources. The standard version of <I>Encarta</I> (with no multimedia features) is available on the Microsoft Network online service.  <BR>

<BR>
<H2> What to Do If Retirement Is Near</H2>

Take it from someone who knows. "Retirement is wonderful," says Ken Stone, 65, who joined the ranks of the retired last August and now spends a lot more time playing golf and puttering around his yard and his son-in-law's pumpkin patch in Stanton, Iowa. With the daily calling of a job behind him, he's dodging a nasty midwestern winter in sunny south Texas.<BR>
<BR>
But Stone, who retired as manager of two rural electric cooperatives, will be the first to tell you that a smooth shift to retirement doesn't just happen overnight. It takes decades of saving and careful planning in the final months on the job. Maureen Tsu, a financial planner in San Juan Capistrano, Cal., puts it this way: "You not only have to plan for the immediate psychological and financial transition from work to retirement, but you also have to plan ahead for 20 or 30 years."<BR>
<BR>If 1997 is the year you'll be following Stone into retirement, use this countdown checklist as a guide and adapt it to fit your own timetable.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><H3>12 Months to Go</H3>
Decide on a target retirement date. Notify your company benefits manager so necessary paperwork can begin. Ask that your pension benefits be calculated based on different retirement dates. Retiring in July rather than on your 65th birthday in March might give a healthy boost to the checks you'll be getting for the rest of your life. Also, check with any former employers about retirement benefits you've left behind.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><H3>11 Months to Go</H3>
If you're planning to relocate, pick your spot and take an extended vacation there. Talk with retirees about living conditions, taxes and problems that might not be mentioned in chamber-of-commerce materials. Stone and his wife, Ruth, 61, a retired schoolteacher, don't plan to move permanently but might buy a second home in the south Texas retirement haven of Edinburg. They're checking it out by living there this winter.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><H3>Ten Months</H3>
Draw a bead on what you'll get from social security. If you haven't received a benefits estimate recently, call the Social Security Administration (SSA) at 800-772-1213 and ask for the form you need to get one. Within weeks you'll see what your monthly checks will be.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><H3>Nine Months</H3>
Plan a retirement budget. Early in 1996, Stone hired David Strege, a financial planner in West Des Moines, to analyze his financial resources. Until then, the Stones were uneasy about whether they could afford to retire comfortably. They felt more secure after drawing up a budget covering day-to-day expenses and the fun things in life, and matching it against income from various retirement plans and personal savings. Strege recommends that retirees base their budget on 75% of salary before retirement.<BR>
<BR>You also have to crank in inflation, of course. Although it has recently run about 3% a year, be on the safe side and figure that prices will rise at a 4% annual clip. At that rate, the cost of living will double in 18 years. If you need $40,000 a year to live comfortably now, you will need $80,000 in the year 2015. Will your assets produce enough income to bridge the gap between pension and social security checks and your financial needs?<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><H3>Eight Months</H3>
Analyze your investment strategy. You should have the bulk of your 401(k) tax-deferred retirement plan and personal savings invested in stocks, which have historically produced a 10% annual return, about twice as much long term as bonds. Don't make the mistake of suddenly switching all your investments into bonds. Remember that your retirement may last 30 years or more. Not only will you need the higher returns likely from stocks, but also you're still a long-term investor who can ride out the ups and downs of the market.<BR>
<BR>Even for a conservative investor, financial planner Tsu recommends a retirement portfolio of 55% bonds, 25% stocks and 20% cash. <BR>
<BR>You may need to make other portfolio changes for tax reasons. "Do municipal bonds make sense if you are going from a 40% to a 15% tax bracket?" asks Greg Sullivan, a financial planner in McLean, Va.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><H3>Seven Months</H3>
If you still face a gap between income and expenses, consider tapping into other sources of cash. Your home may be one of your most valuable assets. If you plan to move into a smaller house or to another part of the country, you can take advantage of the tax rule that lets those 55 and older take up to $125,000 of home- sale profit tax-free.<BR>
<BR>If you are like the Stones and want to stay put, ask your bank about a reverse mortgage, where you borrow a fixed amount of your equity every month. The debt is repaid when you ultimately sell the house or after your death. The Stones may consider this option after Ken turns 70.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><H3>Six Months</H3>
Start thinking about health insurance. If you take early retirement, you'll need coverage until medicare kicks in at age 65. Employers must let you stay in the company plan for 18 months after you retire if you pick up the full cost of the premium. Retirees can often get a better deal by shopping around. Even so, monthly premiums for a healthy couple in their early sixties can be $500 or more.<BR>
<BR>If you'll be covered by medicare, shop for medigap coverage. There are ten basic medigap plans--identified by the letters A through J. Although benefits for each plan are standardized, prices vary from company to company. Some premiums are set at the age you buy the policy; others charge less during the early years and more as you get older. Some carriers charge the same regardless of age. The Stones are paying $59 per month for a Blue Cross and Blue Shield policy. <BR>
<BR>Another option is to join a medicare health maintenance organization, which may cost less and offer more benefits (see <A HREF = "/magazine/archives/1996/August/hfaug96.html">Choosing a Medicare HMO</A>, Aug. 1996).<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><H3>Five Months</H3>
Decide how you will take money from your company retirement programs. A pension plan may allow you take a lump-sum distribution or to choose one of several annuity options--guaranteeing monthly payments during your life only, for example, or during your life and your spouse's if he or she lives longer.<BR>
<BR>If you choose the lump sum--and many retirees do these days--you face another set of decisions. Stone, for example, took his pension and rolled it over into a self-directed IRA, where 40% of the money is invested in U.S. and international stock mutual funds, 20% in U.S. and international bonds, and 40% in cash. Besides the pension, Stone also had money in a 401(k) plan. But rather than withdraw the money and add it to his IRA, Stone decided to leave it in the plan, where it is invested in the Homestead Value fund. If you are satisfied with your company's 401(k) plan, see if you can leave your money there, too.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><H3>Four Months</H3>
Review your estate plan. If you are moving to another state, make sure your will conforms to the new state's laws--and check to see if the terms of your living will need changing. This is also a good time to take a hard look at your life insurance coverage. Do you need as much coverage in retirement as you're paying for now? If you have cash-value policies, investigate how to tap them.<BR>
<BR>Time the sale of assets. If you're moving to a state with lower income- tax rates, wait until you establish residency to sell stocks or other assets that will produce capital gains. Sullivan points out that a Maryland resident moving to Florida can save up to $8,000 in state taxes on a $100,000 profit if he or she waits until after the move. Maryland's top income-tax rate is 8%; Florida has no income tax.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><H3>Three Months</H3>
Apply for social security three months before you want payments to begin. Benefits will go straight to your checking or savings account. Stone is getting $1,247 a month in social security, which he receives on the first of each month. Later this year, SSA will stop sending out benefits all at once. New retirees will get their payments at a set time each month, but it might be the 15th or the 25th, for example, rather than the first.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><H3>Two Months</H3>
If you need optional surgery or dental work, have it done before you retire so your company insurance will pay the bill.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><H3>One Month</H3>
Pay off any loans from your 401(k) plan. When you cash out of the plan, an outstanding loan will be considered a cash distribution. That means you'll owe tax on the amount.<BR>
<BR><BR>
<BR><H3>Month Zero </H3>
Enjoy. Besides golf and gardening, when in Iowa, Stone works as a part-time volunteer courier for the Montgomery County Memorial Hospital in nearby Red Oak. "If someone needs blood, we'll drive over to Omaha and bring it back," he says.  <BR>

<H3>The '97 Models Take Center Stage</H3>

Cars in the spotlight among the new models for 1997 include the Ford Expedition sport utility vehicle, the Euro-style Cadillac Catera, and snazzy little convertibles from Mercedes and Porsche. Sticker prices for the entire lineup of '97s will average 3% higher, but don't be deceived: The automakers' pricing strategies will be all over the lot. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Buyers of sport utility vehicles will be hit hardest, </B>as automakers take advantage of strong demand to raise prices by 5% to 6%. Meanwhile, mainstream passenger cars will cost a barely perceptible 1% to 2% more. And some Japanese automakers, such as Infiniti and Mitsubishi, are expected to cut prices on their new models. Toyota will slash the price of its base-model Camry by $1,000 to $1,500, which will put pressure on Ford and Honda to keep prices in line on the Taurus and Accord. Prices on some models may stay flat while automakers roll back incentives--the equivalent of a 5% price increase, says Kurt Brown of DRI/McGraw-Hill, the forecasting firm. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Used-car prices are firming up.</B> With so many nearly new cars coming off lease and being released from rental-car fleets, "preowned" cars are of higher quality and don't carry the used-car stigma. As a result, they aren't discounted as much as they used to be, says George Peterson of AutoPacific, an automotive-consulting firm. And with robust sales and leaner inventories than in past summers, it will be more difficult to cut a deal on a leftover '96 model.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Higher insurance premiums are likely on sport utility vehicles.</B> Because they flunk crash bumper tests and have high collision losses, insurers are looking at how they price coverage. But higher speed limits and increased use of cellular phones by drivers won't drive up overall rates anytime soon. <BR>

<H3>A bull market in no-load stocks</H3>

More than 100 publicly traded companies--twice as many as a year ago--are offering investors the chance to buy their stock directly, bypassing brokers and commissions.<BR>
<BR>
These so-called no-load stock plans are especially popular with consumer-products companies, which have found that shareholders are also loyal customers. Ameritech, Amoco, Energen, McDonald's and Wal-Mart are recent additions to the list; Conrail, Home Depot and Sears expect to have plans in place this summer.<BR>
<BR>
Ameritech charges $12 to open an account with a $1,000 investment, which might cost as much as $50 at a brokerage. "Direct investment is a new way to deliver value to shareowners because lower fees translate into higher returns," says Ameritech chief executive officer Richard Notebaert. Ameritech's plan allows you not only to purchase shares automatically each month and reinvest the dividends, but also to borrow up to half of your account balance without selling shares or forgoing dividends and capital gains.<BR>
<BR>
For investors interested in current income, some plans will reinvest a portion of your dividends and send you the rest in cash. The Direct Stock Purchase Plan Clearinghouse (800-774-4117) provides prospectuses for 26 companies that offer no-load stock programs. <BR>

<H3>Surfing in a shopping cart</H3>t

Online grocery shopping is finally starting to click, as time-pressed dual-income households discover the virtues of having someone else stand in checkout lines. <BR>
<BR>
Three major shopping services have hooked up with supermarket chains, including Jewel-Osco, Kroger and Safeway, in more than 20 cities. With Peapod, a service with 17,000 customers in Chicago and San Francisco, you can pull up a product's picture and nutritional label from its <A HREF = "http://www.peapod.com">Web site</A>, specify substitutions and customize your produce order ("three green and three ripe bananas, please").<BR>
<BR>
Peapod employees do your shopping, deliver the groceries to your home and guarantee that if you're not satisfied they'll make a return trip. Monthly membership costs $5 to $7, and the delivery charge is roughly $12 for a $100 order. But shoppers say they save money by eliminating impulse buying.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF = "http://www.shopat.com">Shopping Alternatives</A> and <A HREF = "http://www.shoppinglink.com">Shoppers Express</A> are similar to Peapod but are less service-oriented (supermarket employees do your shopping). They also cost less--there's no monthly fee and the delivery charge is about $10 an order.<BR>

<H3>Indexed bonds: Two thumbs up</H3>

Bond traders, who make their money on interest-rate moves that are often precipitated by changes in the rate of inflation, aren't too thrilled about the prospect of the Treasury's new inflation-indexed bonds. But these securities--which protect purchasers from inflation by guaranteeing a fixed real rate of return--should be a hit with investors and taxpayers.<BR>
<BR>
<B>How will the bonds work?</B> With one type of indexed bond under consideration, both the principal and the interest payment would increase over the life of the bond. Say that on January 1 you invest $1,000 in a ten-year bond yielding 4%, and at the end of the first year inflation turns out to have been 3%. The principal will be marked up to $1,030, and the following year the bond will pay 4% on the larger principal amount, so your interest payment will increase as well. At the end of ten years, with inflation averaging 3%, your bond would be worth $1,350, and interest payments would have been increasing for a decade.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Will I earn a lower return than I would with regular Treasuries?</B> That depends on what happens with inflation. If inflation stays at its current level, you may earn a slightly lower return than you would with conventional bonds, but you will have bought insurance against the risk of higher inflation eroding the value of your savings.<BR>
<BR>
"Indexed bonds will be the first asset to let people hold their purchasing power constant," says deputy Treasury secretary Lawrence Summers. "It will make the 'safe' part of a portfolio even safer." That security, says Summers, may make investors more comfortable with seeking higher returns on other, riskier investments.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Who should buy indexed bonds?</B> They are best suited for older, more conservative investors, who would otherwise invest in conventional Treasuries and certificates of deposit, and people nearing retirement who are heavily invested in guaranteed investment contracts and money-market funds inside their 401(k) plans.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Are there any tax angles I should know about?</B> Bondholders will be taxed not only on their interest income but also on "phantom" income from increases in principal that you don't realize until you cash in the bond. You can get around this problem by holding indexed bonds in a tax-deferred account. Even in a taxable account, however, your interest payments will almost certainly cover the tax bill.<BR>
<BR>
<B>How will the bonds benefit taxpayers?</B> They could potentially save the federal government money on its borrowing costs. With conventional bonds, the government has to pay bondholders an interest-rate premium--estimated by some studies to be half a percentage point or more--for bearing the risk of inflation. Of course, the government would be on the hook or higher interest payments if inflation took off. But that should stiffen its resolve to keep inflation under control.<BR>
<BR>
<B>How can I invest in indexed bonds?</B> Starting late this year or early next year, you'll be able to buy the bonds in denominations of $1,000, with a maturity of either ten or 30 years, through Treasury Direct (202-874-4000). Eventually they will be available in smaller denominations through the savings-bond program. <BR>
<BR>
Indexed bonds will likely spawn a variety of new investments--constant-purchasing-power annuities, inflation-indexed CDs and indexed-bond funds. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<b>Indexed bonds in action</b><BR>
<BR>
Here's an example of how an indexed bond might work, based on an initial investment of $1,000, an average annual inflation rate of 3% and an interest rate of 4%. The value of the bond increases by 3% a year, so the interest payment goes up as well even though the rate remains constant.<BR>

<H3>An upside to downsizing</H3>

Laid-off executives and managers are finding new positions more quickly, and often end up earning more money to boot.<BR>
<BR>
More than 90% of high-level workers who found new jobs in the first quarter of 1996 are earning salaries that are equal to or higher than the pay at their old jobs, according to the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. What's more, they needed only 2.8 months to find their jobs, down for the fourth straight quarter. Only 19% were forced to move to another city. <BR>
<BR>
The flurry of initial public offerings is enhancing job prospects for executives, says John Challenger, the outplacement firm's executive vice-president. Since 1990 about 3,000 private firms have gone public, and many of them lack managers with experience running a public company. <BR>
<BR>
Another factor, says Challenger, is the upside of downsizing: Companies such as AT&T and Boeing, which cut staff to increase productivity, have become more profitable and are ready to expand operations again. <BR>
<BR>
The outlook is upbeat for midlevel job seekers as well. In its latest <I>Employment Outlook Survey</I>, Manpower, the temporary-help firm, found that 27% of companies questioned plan to add permanent employees in the third quarter, up slightly from the second quarter. <BR>

<H3>Disability insurers are tightening up</H3>

Stunned by an explosion in the number and cost of claims, disability insurers are redesigning their policies, limiting the amount of benefits they'll pay on individual policies and requiring longer waiting periods before they'll pay anything at all.<BR>
<BR>
A few years ago, agents routinely recommended "own-occupation" coverage that would pay off as long as you were unable to work at your own job--regardless of whether you were capable of holding another one. What's more, your premium was guaranteed never to go up. Now a growing number of policies limit own-occupation coverage to two years, and premiums could increase over the life of the policy. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the changes are a result of abuses by workers with a "Lotto mentality," says John Ryan, a Denver insurance broker who specializes in disability coverage. Facing a layoff, for example, a worker with a bad back could claim that he couldn't do his job anymore and cash in on a generous own-occupation policy. Last year, for the second year in a row, disability insurers paid out half a billion dollars more in benefits than they collected in premiums.<BR>
<BR>
On the plus side, premiums for the revamped policies are 15% to 30% lower than the old policies. "Companies are becoming more realistic in the policy design, and at the very least they're more affordable for consumers," says Larry Schneider, a disability insurance specialist in Falls Church, Va.<BR>
<BR>
Individual policies are also starting to incorporate some of the back-to-work benefits that are characteristic of group policies, such as coverage for physical therapy, job training and job-search assistance.<BR>

<H3>Rebate cards: Less rewarding</H3>

Rebate cards initially promised big bonuses to consumers who used them faithfully--free airline flights, free gasoline and cash back on purchases. Now, with everyone from Nordstrom to the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus pitching a card, issuers are finding they can't afford such rich payoffs and are scaling them back. <BR>
<BR>
To earn a free ticket on USAir, for example, holders of the USAir Visa now need to accumulate more miles--and use them more quickly before they expire. The General Motors MasterCard, which allows cardholders to rack up discounts of as much as $7,000 toward the purchase or lease of a new car, has been so popular that the company is reportedly planning changes that will make it less lucrative for consumers (GM has 9.3 million accounts and has already honored 850,000 redemptions). <BR>
<BR>
Rebate cards are probably a temporary phenomenon anyway, as merchants turn to technology to help them identify their best customers and lock in brand loyalty. According to Frank Carvana of the Danielian Consulting Group, one group of credit card issuers is testing a computer system that will track individual charge habits. Retailers will be able to buy a list of their--or their competitors'--customers and offer customized discounts on a separate page of each cardholder's monthly statement.<BR>

<H3>Clinton vs. Dole: A pocketbook guide</H3>

Whether you tune in the convention hoopla or tune it out, you'll probably hear few new specifics from either party about matters that go straight to your wallet. Here's a quick take on where the two candidates stand on six issues that affect your finances:<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tax cuts</B><BR>
<BR>
<I>Clinton:</I> Unlikely to propose any major cuts, given that he raised taxes on the wealthy early in his administration, unless a bidding war breaks out for middle-class votes. Proposes a $10,000 deduction for tuition costs and a two-year, $1,500-per-year tax credit for higher education (paid for in part by higher departure fees for international airline flights). Also proposes a $500 tax credit for each child under 13 for families earning $75,000 or less. Is considering broadening the tax break on capital gains from the sale of a home, and is probably willing to cut a deal to lower capital-gains taxes across the board in exchange for a pet project.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Dole:</I> Details of a possible tax-cut plan are still under wraps, but any major tax breaks would likely take effect in a few years to avoid appearing to increase the deficit. Supports lower capital-gains taxes, a $500-per-child tax credit, a $500 charitable-contributions tax credit and adoption tax credits. Would ease estate taxes for family businesses.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR><B>Tax reform</B><BR>
<BR>
<I>Clinton:</I> Would like to simplify the tax code but thinks the progressive nature of the current system is fair.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Dole:</I> Weighing proposals to overhaul the system. Would "take a serious look" at a flat tax but wouldn't get rid of the deductions for mortgage interest or charitable contributions, although he might phase them out even faster for high earners. Supports doing away with the marriage penalty and scaling back the IRS. Also supports requiring a three-fifths majority in Congress to raise income-tax rates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Social security privatization</B><BR>
<BR>
<I>Clinton:</I> Silent so far on this topic.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Dole:</I> Open to the idea of using the private sector to reform social security, and thinks investing social security tax receipts in equities is "an idea worth considering."<BR>
<BR>
Both candidates are likely to sidestep this issue during the campaign.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Retirement plans</B><BR>
<BR>
Both candidates support streamlined 401(k) plans; "back-loaded" IRAs that have no up-front deduction but allow penalty-free withdrawals after five years; higher income limits for deductible IRAs; and no penalties for money withdrawn from IRAs to pay for college, a first home or medical care, or to ease a period of unemployment. Dole would allow homemakers to contribute more to an IRA.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Health insurance</B><BR>
<BR>
<I>Clinton:</I> Supports greater portability of coverage when employees switch jobs. Would increase the deduction for health insurance premiums paid by self-employeds.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Dole:</I> In favor of portability, but also wants medical savings accounts--tax-advantaged accounts that can be used to pay medical expenses not covered by insurance.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Medicare reform</B><BR>
<BR>
Both candidates would give seniors incentives to join managed-care plans, and both would look for savings by squeezing the incomes of doctors and hospitals. Dole would generate additional savings by requiring beneficiaries to pay slightly higher monthly premiums.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<BR>
<U><B>Calendar</B></U>
<H3>August</H3>

<UL><LI>A booming economy will be the likely conclusion when second-quarter gross domestic product estimates are reported on August 1. An expected growth rate of about 3.5%, compared with 2.3% in the first quarter, may compel the Fed to raise short-term interest rates a notch when it meets on August 20.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>College students scrambling to complete applications for federal loans this month, take heart: The interest rate on Stafford loans while students are still in school is 7.66% this academic year, down from 8.25% last year.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Hotels are sold out in San Diego--the site of the Republican convention--from August 12 through 15, and in Chicago--where Democratic conventioneers have dibs on up to 20,000 rooms--from August 26 through 29. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Procrastinators, take note: If you got an extension on filing your 1995 tax return, you have until August 15 to send it in--and to fork over any difference between what you estimated your tax liability to be last spring and the actual amount that you owe. Provided you have a good excuse, you can buy yourself another two months by filing Form 2688.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The treasury will auction off three- and ten-year notes, plus 30-year bonds, in the second week of the month, for issue on August 15. This particular congregation of maturities is available in the same week only twice a year (the other time is in February).<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Hang on to your stocks this month. Historically, the three trading days before Labor Day are good for the market. Since 1961 the Dow has been up 26 times and down only nine during that period.<BR>

<H1>How to Choose a Clinic </H1> 
<P>
<P>
<I> By Stacy Stover </I>
<P>
<P>With no regulator or third party to rate or approve facilities that perform high-tech treatments such as in vitro fertilization, it's up to patients to check out clinics for themselves.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Select a qualified specialist.</B> Although many people start by consulting an obstetrician-gynecologist, if you continue to have trouble conceiving you're better off going to a trained infertility specialist. The infertility clinic director should be a board-certified or board-eligible reproductive endocrinologist (RE) who has completed a fellowship, passed written examinations, and practiced reproductive endocrinology for two years. Also ask the clinic to give you, in writing, the credentials and experience of staff members. If possible, make appointments with more than one clinic to find one you're comfortable with.<P>
<P>
     Resolve, a national advocacy and support group for infertility patients, makes referrals to more than 700 doctors across the U.S. You can also attend a support-group meeting in your area to discuss what doctors and clinics are really like. For more information, send a self-addressed, stamped business-size envelope to Resolve, 1310 Broadway, Somerville, MA 02144, or call 617-623-0744.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Check the clinic's certification.</B> Although federal regulations are scant in the infertility field, the clinic's lab should be certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of 1988 (CLIA). This law requires laboratories to follow specific rules when performing the highly complex procedures associated with assisted reproduction. If a clinic does not meet CLIA requirements, you may have trouble getting reimbursed by your insurer. Additional certification by the Commission on Laboratory Accreditation or the American College of Pathologists is even better.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Find a clinic that is open every day.</B> Timing is critical when you're undergoing an insemination or in vitro fertilization, and an infertility specialist must be on call 24 hours a day during treatment cycles.<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Examine a clinic's success rate.</B> The Federal Trade Commission has ordered six U.S. infertility clinics to cease making unsubstantiated claims in their advertising materials. One clinic brochure, for instance, promised that "80% to 90% of infertile couples can be helped." Other clinics advertised inflated birth rates by counting multiple births, such as twins, as separate deliveries.<P>
<P>
     The most important statistic is the success rate for your age group and your specific infertility problem. Be wary of combined statistics, such as a number that lumps together the success rates of patients undergoing a number of different procedures. "You need to have separate statistics for each procedure," says Michael Katz, a health care fraud investigator for the FTC.<P>
<P>
     When comparing success rates, keep in mind that some clinics might report fewer successes than others because they specialize in more difficult infertility cases. Or a clinic might have an impressive record overall, but may not be the best one to treat your particular problem.<P>
<P>
     The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART), in Birmingham, Ala., compiles success-rate data it receives from member clinics. (The data is standardized, but it is self-reported and unaudited, so you're still relying on the clinic's word.) Reports with 1994 data will be available from SART within the next couple of months. Call 205-978-5000 for information about ordering a report on clinics in your region or in all of the U.S. and Canada.<P>
