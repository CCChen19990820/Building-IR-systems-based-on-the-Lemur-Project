<!--INFOLINE--><b>Flight TWA 800 blown up </b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Terror or accident?</h2><h3>  Reports claim Arab group warned of attack on US target before 230 killed</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jonathan Freedland</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The sudden catastrophe which overtook TWA Flight 800 off Long Island, New York, on wednesday night  killing all 230 people on board has cast a long, fearful shadow over today's formal opening of the  Olympic Games in Atlanta. As investigators, backed by local fishermen, scoured the crash site about 10  miles south of Moriches Bay for bodies and wreckage of the Boeing 747 jumbo jet, speculation that it  had been destroyed deliberately intensified late last night amid reports that before the blast an  Arabic newspaper had been warned of an attack by the same group that claimed responsibility for an  earlier bombing in Saudi Arabia.  <p>  <p>According to ABC News, the Movement for Islamic Change - which claimed it was behind the killing of  five Americans in Riyadh last November - warned the al-Hayat Arabic paper on Wednesday that a US  target would be hit at the exact time Flight 800 went down.  <p>  <p>The warning used "chilling specifics", ABC said, but was not passed on to authorities.  <p>  <p>"All will be surprised by the size of the attack, the place and the time," the group warned.  <p>  <p>Citing sources close to the investigation, ABC said the leading theory was that the airliner was  destroyed by extremists using a shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile.  <p>  <p>Earlier, before news of the reports, President Clinton in a nationally televised press conference  emphatically warned against making any assumptions about the cause of the crash.  <p>  <p>"We do not know what caused this tragedy," Mr Clinton said. "We will determine what happened [but]  I caution you all against jumping to conclusions."  <p>  <p>The United States navy moved swiftly to the scene, with spokesmen expressing confidence that  crucial evidence contained in the 'black box' flight recorders could be recovered. The National  Transportation Safety Board last night denied a report that one had been found.  <p>  <p>Conflicting pieces of evidence surfaced yesterday - some suggesting terror, some indicating an  accident.  <p>  <p>TWA officials said the crew included two veteran pilots, flying a plane with a near-flawless safety  record. No passenger Boeing 747 has ever crashed due to a mechanical fault.  <p>  <p>They also noted that there had been no radio alert from the cockpit, and that no inflated  life-rafts or life-jackets had been found - suggesting an instant blast rather than a lingering  technical problem.  <p>  <p>Terrorism experts also noted that the flight had taken off from Athens, which until mid-May was  deemed by US authorities to have lax airport security. Pentagon officials also acknowledged that US  fears of terrorist attacks have been rising since last month's blast at an American barracks outside  Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, which killed 19 military personnel. Speculation was also fuelled by claims the  plane was delayed because of a fault in a key instrument, the engine pressure-ratio gauge. While in  itself not a potential cause of an accident, such a fault could have indicated a problem with engine  power.  <p>  <p>The TWA flight left John F Kennedy airport on Long Island bound for Charles de Gaulle, Paris, at  about 8.19pm local time on Wednesday. It apparently exploded 29 minutes later at an altitude of  13,000ft, plunging swiftly into the sea. Some witnesses spoke of a brilliant spiral, like a fireworks  display.  <p>  <p>After many hours of searching in the darkness, all hopes of survivors faded. More than half the  bodies had been recovered yesterday, and officials conceded it was near-impossible that anyone had  survived.  <p>  <p>Details of who was aboard and where they came from were not released by TWA as it notified next of  kin. Early today the airline revised to 230 the number of passengers and crew on board.  <p>  <p>Some information emerged elsewhere. One of the victims was named by the Italian foreign ministry as  Christine Baily, a Briton who had emigrated to Italy. It was reported she was married to an Italian,  Pietro D'Iorio, and that the pair worked as waiters in Prato, near Florence.  <p>  <p>Two newly-wed Italian couples returning from a honeymoon in the US were among those killed.  <p>  <p>At his press conference, Mr Clinton singled out 16 teenagers from Montoursville High School,  Pennsylvania, who were on board Flight 800 on their way to a language course in Paris.  <p>  <p>"The whole town is in mourning," said John Doring, Montoursville's mayor. "These kids were the best  of the best."  <p>  <p>Distraught relatives gathered in holding rooms set aside at John F Kennedy airport and at Charles  de Gaulle as they waited for news. TWA yesterday released the names of Flight 800's crew.  <p>  <p>Despite Mr Clinton's caution, the FBI and the New York Police Department launched a joint  anti-terrorist task force and declared the 200-mile area a crime scene. Pentagon and state department  counter-terrorism experts joined the investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board team was  conducting a parallel inquiry.  <p>  <p>Officials in Atlanta ordered security, already tight for today's start of the Olympics, to be  stepped up. A 25,000-strong security force is in the city, the largest-ever assembled in the US in  peacetime.  <p>  <p>Details of the plane's last hours - after 25 years in service - began to emerge last night. After  arriving in New York from Athens, and being cleared of passengers and cargo, it took off after being  delayed for an hour by a late-arriving passenger and a fault on the baggage-loading belt. Less than  half an hour later, witnesses saw a flame shoot from the plane like a flare, the aircraft dropped for  a few seconds and then blew up. "There was a huge fireball," said Maureen Cassidy, a waitress who was  serving dinner. "It was just flames and black smoke and it was just pouring out of the sky."  <p>  <p>A TWA spokesman said the plane disappeared from radar at 8.48pm. A flotilla of boats gathered at  the scene, where burning wreckage and fuel lit up the night sky. In daylight, coastguard cutters  recovered a 30ft piece of fuselage, wing tips and a large piece of the plane's tail. Rescue workers  found dozens of bodies, some still strapped into their seats, as well as rucksacks, suitcases and  wallets. One letter was recovered, still legible: it was from a mother, writing to her daughter at  summer camp.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Flight TWA 800 blown up </b><br><br><br><b><h2>22 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Silence whets appetite  for conspiracy</h2><h3>Angry relatives of TWA 800 victims blame politics for delay</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jonathan Freedland</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Although the enigma of TWA Flight 800 is only five days old, the lack of hard evidence, the  American news machine's hunger for fresh material and a national penchant for paranoia have made a  veritable industry of suspicion and conspiracy theory.  <p>  <p>Protests from grieving relatives and angry political leaders have led to allegations that the  government is hiding something and lent credibility to a growing range of explanations - some of them  outlandish - for the incident, in which 230 people died.  <p>  <p>Ron Dwyer, who lost his 11-year-old daughter Larkyn in Wednesday's crash off Long Island, told  reporters yesterday: "I believe there is enough information to know what happened.  <p>  <p>"In my opinion, information is being withheld or suppressed until the [Olympic] games are up and  running so that the terrorists can't claim victory."  <p>  <p>Sceptical relatives and others believe that President Clinton's plea for caution - he urged  Americans not to jump to any conclusions about the origins of the tragedy - was motivated less by lack  of information than political expediency. They note that administration officials have uniformly  dismissed or played down suggestions of terrorist involvement. The attorney-general, Janet Reno, said  the claims of responsibility received so far were not credible.  <p>  <p>The White House press secretary, Mike McCurry, described as "hyperventilation" the media's interest in a communique faxed to Al-Hayat, a London-based Arabic  newspaper, hours before the disaster.  <p>  <p>The letter, from the militant Movement for Islamic Change - the group which claimed responsibility  for the November 1995 killing of five Americans in Riyadh - seemed to threaten an imminent act of  violence against the United States. But Mr McCurry said the message was no different from the constant  drumbeat of threats from militant Islamic groups which appeared almost daily in the region, and could  also be read on the internet.  <p>  <p>Critics hint that the administration is playing down the possibility of terror, not only because of  the political cost but also because officials may have something to hide. Some speculate that TWA  Flight 800 will come to be seen as a repeat of Pan Am Flight 103's crash at Lockerbie in 1988, which  provoked accusations that warnings were not heeded.  <p>  <p>They cite mysterious reports of an Arab man linked to the fundamentalist Hizbullah group  apprehended on Wednesday at Athens airport - where the flight that became TWA 800 originated.  <p>  <p>State department officials insist that the man arrived after the TWA jet had taken off, and that he  was heading for Beirut. In that case, why did the Greek authorities alert US officials? Conspiracy  theorists suggest that the faxed letter and the Greek episode were signs of trouble which were  ignored. Speculation about a cover-up has been further increased by TWA's now notorious 16-hour delay  in confirming who was on the flight. Most blame the airline, but others were intrigued by its claim  that the passenger list was withheld because the National Transportation Safety Board insisted on  hearing the names first.  <p>  <p>"That is an outright lie," said the NTSB's spokesman, Peter Goelz. But TWA's claim has fed  suspicion that the government is deliberately putting the brakes on the inquiry - even leaving local  pathologists to handle the huge task of body identification without federal back-up.  <p>  <p>The wildest speculation centres on a Washington rumour that New York Air National Guard training  exercises were taking place over Moriches Bay, Long Island, at the exact time of the crash.  <p>  <p>An aviation expert told the Guardian yesterday that federal investigators should examine whether  TWA Flight 800 was accidentally struck by a flare or weapon from an Air Guard plane. Such an  occurrence would certainly explain a cover-up, he said.  <p>  <p>Another theory gained some ground yesterday when federal investigators said they were leaving open  the possibility that the Boeing 747-100 was hit by a ground-launched anti-aircraft missile. At least  two witnesses said they saw an upward streak of light just before the plane burst into flames. The  investigation continues.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nick Varley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A school outing ended in horror last night when a double-decker bus carrying 73 pupils home  ploughed into a low bridge in Runcorn, Cheshire. Fifty-one children, mostly aged 10 and 11, and three  adults - one a man believed to be the driver - were taken to hospital after the upper floor of the  vehicle was ripped off in the accident.  <p>  <p>None was seriously hurt. Thirty-three of the children suffered minor injuries and the 18 more  seriously hurt escaped without broken bones or major organ injuries. None of the adults was seriously  hurt. Eight casualties were expected to be operated on last night but Warrington general hospital  accident and emergency consultant director, Arfan Saleh, stressed none of the patients was in a  critical condition.  <p>  <p>"Some of the children have serious scalp lacerations with loss of skin and some just have ordinary  cuts," he said. "There are two minor eye injuries." The accident happened as pupils and staff from  Palace Fields primary school, Runcorn, were returning from the Waterworld theme park in  Stoke-on-Trent. The bus struck a concrete and iron pedestrian bridge, coming to rest, roofless, 30  yards away.  <p>  <p>Richard Oswick, of Mersey regional ambulance, said: "The first 20 paramedics arrived to find the  entire top deck of the double-decker bus had been ripped off.  <p>  <p>"It was appalling. Everyone had got off the bus, and the injured children were lying on the grass  verge being looked after by those who weren't hurt. The remains of the bus are a crumpled mess below  the bridge." Pupil Lisa Brigden, aged 11, who was on the top deck, said: "The bus wasn't travelling  fast but there was no warning. Suddenly there was a big bang and the roof just ripped off over our  heads. There was glass everywhere and the roof was missing. Everyone was screaming and there was blood on  our hands and clothes."  <p>  <p>Barbara Lewis, aged 38, who made the trip with her daughter Donna, aged 11, as a parent helper,  said: "It could have been much worse.  <p>  <p>"If it had been a bus full of adults rather than children there would have been fatalities but  because they are small the bridge skimmed over their heads."  <p>  <p>Twenty-two pupils were unharmed in the accident and were taken back to school to be met by anxious  parents.  <p>  <p>Police inquiries into the accident were centred on why the bus was travelling in a lane designed  for only single-decker vehicles. Cheshire county councillor Bill Foster said: "There are several  unanswered questions here, but the main one is what made this bus turn on to this busway. It was only  ever designed for single-decker buses and I have never heard of an accident like this before."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Hannah Pool</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The driver of the bus which ploughed into a bridge and injured 51 children and one adult will be  interviewed by police today after it emerged that he ignored road signs banning double-decker buses.  <p>  <p>An investigation into the accident by Cheshire county council officials found that the bus, which  was carrying children from Palace Fields primary school, Runcorn, did not have a permit to be on the  road.  <p>  <p>Three children and the adult were still in hospital last night. Injuries on the bus would have been  worse were it not for the quick thinking of Ryan McGibbon, aged 10.  <p>  <p>Ryan, who was sitting at the front of the top deck of the bus, shouted at his friends when he saw  the bridge approaching. The youngster, who escaped with minor cuts and bruises, said: "I saw the  bridge coming and I just shouted to everyone to duck. The roof just caved in on everybody." He added:  "Everyone shouted at the driver that it was the wrong way but he said it was a short cut."  <p>  <p>The bus was travelling along a route restricted for the past 20 years to single-decker buses. Peter  Cocker, council engineer, said: "We have very strict, very clear and very well known rules about who  can and who can't use Runcorn Busway.  <p>  <p>"Only registered bus services are able to use the busway. To register, an operator must be  providing a regular bus service with single-decker buses. One-off operators, tour companies and  occasional users cannot register and are therefore banned from the route."  <p>  <p>Yesterday, the headteacher at Palace Fields, Joe Moyston, said it was common knowledge that double  deckers are banned from that route.  <p>  <p>Dobson's bus company was on a recommendation list given to schools, Mr Moyston said. "Cheshire  education authority have used Dobson's for some time, in fact since the Eighties, and they are an  established company. Anyone would expect contracted drivers to know the way, but we can't comment on  the cause of the accident as we must wait for the results from the police investigation."  <p>  <p>A spokesman for Dobson's Buses, of Cheshire, said: "We extend our heartfelt sympathy to all those  injured and to their families.  <p>  <p>"The company will co-operate fully with the offical inquiry into the circumstances leading up to  this terribly sad incident."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alan Travis</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Scotland Yard's &#163;13m Operation Eagle Eye campaign against  street robbers has had only a limited impact in its first year, according to the Metropolitan police annual report published yesterday.  <p>  <p>The official London crime figures show there were 4,000 more street robberies, a rise of 14 per cent, in the year to the end of March 1996. The campaign, launched in August last year, drew strong criticism because it appeared to be targeted mainly at young black men.  <p>  <p>But the commissioner, Sir Paul Condon, yesterday defended it, saying it had capped the increase in snatch thefts and robberies of personal property which had been increasing by 20 to 30 per cent a year. He cited figures showing street muggings had fallen between November 1995 and June 1996 by some five per cent. Detections also doubled, to 19 per cent of street robberies being cleared up.  <p>  <p>"Not only have we capped street robbery, but we are bringing it down dramatically," he said. Police figures show that 69 per cent of those arrested for street robberies as a result of Operation Eagle Eye have been young black men. After the launch of the operation, Sir Paul said that in some parts of London most muggers were black.  <p>  <p>He also gave a fillip to those seeking to reform the law on prostitution, when he advocated relaxing the definition of a brothel to allow two women to work together from private premises so they could offer each other mutual protection. At present it is only legal for one woman to work as a prostitute from private premises. He is the most senior police officer to advocate reform of prostitution laws.  <p>  <p>He also said he wanted to see kerb crawling made an arrestable offence to reduce nuisance to local residents. "I am not convinced licensed brothels would help, they would probably create no-go areas. But I favour a more pragmatic approach."  <p>  <p>The overall crime figures for London show only a slight drop of 1,000, to 822,596 recorded offences. Burglaries were up by 9,000, to 170,000, but that was attributed more to a change in recording methods than an increase in break-ins. Sir Paul said the last three years had seen a 20 per cent fall in burglary in London and further reductions would be harder to come by. The figures also show that there are still proportionately more street searches of black people (79 per 1,000 population) than white people (31 per 1,000 population).  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Actress Claudette Colbert dies at 92</b><br><br><br><b><h2>  19 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2> Actress Claudette Colbert dies at 92  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nick Varley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Actress Claudette Colbert, star of such classic 1930s films as It Happened One Night and Cleopatra, died in Barbados yesterday aged 92. The Oscar winner, well-known for her trademark hair bangs and radiant smile, appeared in more than 60 films.  <p>  <p>Comedy was considered her forte - and her comic performance with Clark Gable in It Happened One Night crowned her career. Both stars, as well as director Frank Capra, won Oscars in a then-unprecedented sweep.  <p>  <p>Film critic Pauline Kael said the film "made audiences happy in a way that only a few films in each era do".  <p>  <p>"In the mid-thirties, the Colbert and Gable of this film became Americans' idealized view of themselves - breezy, likeable, sexy, gallant, and maybe just a little harebrained. It was the 'Annie Hall' of its day - before the invention of anxiety."  <p>  <p>Colbert, who had an ocean-front home in Barbados, was born in Paris in 1903. Three years later her father took the family to New York.  <p>  <p>After she graduated from high school, Lily Cauchoin, as she was christened, got a bit part on Broadway and two years later she began her ascent under her new name.  <p>  <p>At the peak of her popularity in the 1930s, Colbert earned $150,000 a picture - a huge sum at the time. But she claimed she was not over ambitious. "I never thought of my career as the primary thing in my life. I looked upon acting as a job, and now, frankly, I regret it," she said at age 77. "I think of all the things I could have done. I just let parts come to me. I never went after them."  <p>  <p>She considered comedy her greatest strength: "I love to play comedy and I can say immodestly that I'm a very good comedienne. But I was always fighting that image, too. I just never had the luck to play bitches." Her chance to act against type came when she was cast to play Margo Channing, the ageing Broadway star in All About Eve, but she injured her back and had to withdraw. The part went to Bette Davis.  <p>  <p>She married twice - the second time for 33 years, until his death, to surgeon Joel Pressman - but had no children.  <p>  <p>In 1991 she told an interviewer she had turned down a number of offers to write a tell-all memoir: "What am I going to say? I married a wonderful doctor, and I was very happy. Period."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Kettle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>John Birt's World Service plans and management style were condemned as dictatorial yesterday as the  BBC's director-general faced a torrid session of questioning by angry MPs at Westminster.  <p>  <p>Members of the all-party Commons foreign affairs committee accused Mr Birt of acting like "a sort  of tsar" in giving less than 24 hours notice to senior BBC colleagues and government ministers of his  plan to merge the World Service into the corporation's domestic broadcasting operation. During an hour  of hostile questioning from backbench MPs, Mr Birt fought off suggestions that his plans should be  suspended for further consultation. "The management of the BBC is a matter for the BBC," he told the  committee. Flanked by deputy director-general Bob Phillis and World Service managing director Sam  Younger, Mr Birt claimed that there was "quite wide acceptance" among World Service and BBC staff of  his management changes, which were designed "to enable the service to respond more effectively to the  challenges of the future." However, he admitted that his management team were divided over the plans.  <p>  <p>He said that it would not have been "sensible or possible" to have told his colleagues of his plans  any earlier. He had "no idea" why the Foreign Secretary had summoned him to explain his proposals in a  meeting now set for Wednesday next week.  <p>  <p>Committee members queued up to challenge Mr Birt's version of events. Sir John Stanley,  Conservative MP for Tonbridge and Malling, said there was now "a vast rift" between the management of  the BBC and "the overwhelming majority of staff".  <p>  <p>Bob Wareing, Labour MP for Liverpool West Derby, accused him of acting "not like a director general  but like a sort of tsar".  <p>  <p>The gruelling session finished on a note of enforced harmony, with Mr Birt assuring the MPs that  his proposals would be "beneficial and dynamic".   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rebecca Smithers</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The future of the BBC World Service dominated parliamentary proceedings yesterday, as MPs and peers  vented their fury over the radical changes planned by the BBC.  <p>  <p>In the Lords, the Government narrowly averted defeat by a majority of just 10, after peers voted by  81 to 71 against a call by the Commons to reconsider the privatisation of transmission services under  the Broadcasting Bill.  <p>  <p>A division was forced on an amendment to the legislation as a device to put pressure on ministers  to intervene to stop the wide-ranging changes planned for the station.  <p>  <p>In the Commons committee corridor, MPs had two separate inquisitions of ministers and BBC managers.  Foreign Office minister Jeremy Hanley admitted that his department was "disappointed" that it was  given just 24 hours notice by the BBC of its plans to merge the World Service English language news  with mainstream BBC news and current affairs coverage.  <p>  <p>But he insisted that Labour was wrong in its claims that no consultation was taking place, and that  such an exercise was well under way.  <p>  <p>The meeting next Wednesday between BBC chiefs Sir Christopher Bland and John Birt and the Foreign  Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, is part of that process, when the proposals will be discussed in detail.  <p>  <p>Yesterday, questioned by MPs on the cross-party foreign affairs select committee, Mr Hanley  admitted that his department had the "ultimate sanction" if it was not happy with the plans, by  withdrawing the &#163;175m a year funding which supports the scheme.  <p>  <p>Mr Hanley said that, although there had been no room for ministerial comment or discussion when the  BBC alerted the Foreign Office to its proposals just a day before they were published, it had been  agreed that there would be "full consultation" on the plans before they came into force. "The Foreign  Office will not allow the standard to fall," Mr Hanley told MPs on the committee.  <p>  <p>"It is absolutely vital that the distinctive nature and quality of the World Service continues and  that is our pledge."  <p>  <p>Later, at business questions in the afternoon, the shadow leader of the House, Ann Taylor, urged  the Government to consider delaying a final decision on the future of the World Service until  Parliament had had a chance to debate the issue - probably not until after the summer recess. But the  Leader of the House, Tony Newton, said he accepted that the future of the World Service was "not  simply an operational matter" and pointed out that Mr Rifkind was intending to have discussions with  the BBC next week. Mr Hanley had earlier sought to calm MPs angry at the lack of notice about the  changes given to his department by the BBC's management.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Murder of 13-year-old Caroline Dickinson on school trip to France </b><br><br><br><b><h2>20 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>School trip girl killed in hostel  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Geoffrey Gibbs</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A 13-year-old British girl on a school trip to France has been found raped and murdered in her bed  in the youth hostel dormitory she shared with four other pupils.  <p>  <p>The body of Caroline Dickinson, a second year pupil at Launceston College, in Cornwall, was found  by one of the four girls, aged 13 and 14, when they woke up. It was not clear last night whether she  had been murdered while the others slept.  <p>  <p>Ronald Frankel, the British consul for Brittany, described the moment her body was discovered. "One  of the girls touched her in her bed and she was cold. There was also some discoloration."  <p>  <p>The girl immediately told the other pupils in the dormitory and then got a teacher from a  neighbouring room. A post mortem examimation revealed Caroline had been raped and then suffocated.  <p>  <p>Mr Frankel said the other pupils in the group had only been told the girl was ill. "We, the  teachers and the gendarmes in the incident room took the initial decision not to tell the pupils the  girl had died. We thought it would be too much."  <p>  <p>Caroline was staying at the hostel in Pleine-Fougeres, which is about 30 miles from St Malo in  Brittany, north-west France. She was among a party of 40 children and five adults who arrived on  Sunday for an activity week to sample French food and visit nearby Mont St Michel and Bayeux. They  were due back today.  <p>  <p>French police are carrying out the murder investigation and liaising with Devon and Cornwall  officers. The French examining magistrate, Gerard Zaug, yesterday said Caroline was found dead at 8am  on Thursday.  <p>  <p>Alan Wroath, the head teacher of Launceston College, a comprehensive school with 1,200 pupils,  described Caroline as a lovely girl who had worked hard, had lots of friends, and "always had a ready  smile".  <p>  <p>The youth hostel had been a base for the school's activities week for three years, chosen because  of its quiet but central position. Mr Wroath said activities week, an established part of the school  since 1975, was a time when children in years seven, eight and nine took part in a range of activities  in Britain and abroad.  <p>  <p>Many of the other children from Launceston College are also on activities week trips and teachers  are informing them of the tragedy.  <p>  <p>Term does not end until next Thursday and Cornwall county council's chief education officer,  Jonathan Harris, said there were no plans to end it early. Nor was he going to suspend school trips.  <p>  <p>Staff on the trip were "experienced and dedicated professionals" who had his total support. They  included two male and two female members of staff, and a teacher's wife, who is a qualified nurse.  <p>  <p>Mr Wroath said the school had arranged for Caroline's parents, John and Sue, to travel to France  with three more senior teachers, including a French national.  <p>  <p>Counselling has been set up for the children in the party, their parents, other children in the  college, and staff.  <p>  <p>Parents collecting children from the school yesterday were reluctant to talk. Many of the children  were in tears.  <p>  <p>One mother collecting her daughter from a school trip to South Devon said she did not know whether  the girl had been told of Caroline's death. "I just want to get her home. She was a good friend of the  child and I am not looking forward to telling her."  <p>  <p>Former pupil Suzannah West, aged 21, who laid a small floral tribute to the dead teenager, said: "This is the only secondary school in Launceston so everyone has a connection with it in the town  and the surrounding catchment area. Every child and parent will know someone at the school or will  have been to the school. The whole town will be affected by this tragedy."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Murder of 13-year-old Caroline Dickinson on school trip to France </b><br><br><br><b><h2>22 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Cornish town mourns girl's murder in France  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Geoffrey Gibbs</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Loss and grief pervaded Launceston yesterday, as residents of the Cornish town tried to come to  terms with the murder of Caroline Dickinson, the 13-year-old raped and smothered in a youth hostel  dormitory while on a school trip to France.  <p>  <p>As people gathered in the town's churches to say special prayers for Caroline and her family,  messages left with the bouquets beneath a tree on Launceston College lawns provided a poignant  reminder of the quiet and gentle child who set off for Pleine Fougeres in Brittany only a week ago.  "Caroline, an angel lent to us, now returned to Heaven," read one. A friend called Beth wrote of  Caroline's kindness and said she had left a soft toy because she knew Caroline loved cats. "I will  always miss you for we have really been best friends," she wrote.  <p>  <p>Sombre worshippers spoke of a feeling of devastation over what had happened to the child her  headteacher described as lovely, hardworking and a credit to the college.  <p>  <p>"I know other people who were on the school trip," said one woman visibly shaking with emotion. "It  is heinous."  <p>  <p>The congregation inside St Mary Magadelene's in the town centre had heard the Reverend Tim Newcombe  speak of the "fathomless grief" of Caroline's family after news of her death was broken on Thursday.  <p>  <p>The priest, who has spent much of the intervening time comforting those affected by the tragedy,  told parishioners it was not a time for offering cheap solutions. Instead, he said, they should open  themselves in prayer to God.  <p>  <p>It was a mood repeated at church services elsewhere in Launceston and across Cornwall, where  congregations observed a moment of silence for Caroline and said prayers for her and her family, while  flags on Launceston's Norman Castle and other buildings flew at half mast.  <p>  <p>Speaking earlier, Mr Newcombe said the tightly-knit community had been devastated by the tragedy.  "We will all give all the support and help we can to everyone who is directly affected," he said.  <p>  <p>Caroline's classmates arrived back in Launceston shortly after midnight on Saturday, having been  delayed by French police investigations, and were reunited with their parents in private. They had  been escorted to Cherbourg by French police and were kept away from other passengers on the Brittany  Ferries trip to Poole, Dorset.  <p>  <p>Caroline was raped and murdered as she slept on a mattress on the floor of the hostel room she was  sharing with four other pupils.  <p>  <p>The party of 40 children and five adults had set out from Launceston last Sunday on a week-long  educational visit arranged to give the 13- and 14-year-olds the chance to practise their French,  sample French food and visit Bayeux and Mont St Michel.  <p>  <p>The hostel, chosen because of its quiet but central location, had been used by the 1,200-strong  secondary school for its annual activity week trips for the past three years.  <p>  <p>Under local fire safety regulations it was kept unlocked and it is thought the murderer may have  entered the building in the early hours of Thursday morning. The nightwatchwoman on duty that night  heard nothing. French police, who are reported to have taken DNA samples from the male pupils and  staff in the party as part of their investigation, have drawn up a photo-fit image of a bearded man  which they have shown in local door-to-door inquiries.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Businessmen paying up to £100,000 to dine with Major</b><br><br><br><b><h2>23 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Mawhinney defends PM dining club donations</h2><h3> Businessmen pay  thousands for dinners "in the nation's interest"</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hencke</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Brian Mawhinney, the Conservative Party chairman, yesterday claimed businessmen paying up to  &#163;100,000 to dine with John Major were donating to the Tories in the "nation's interest".  <p>  <p>His defence came as Labour and Liberal Democrats baited ministers in the Commons and Lords over the  Observer newspaper's disclosure of the existence of the Premier Club - a dining club with a minimum  &#163;10,000 a year subscription guaranteeing dinners with cabinet ministers.  <p>  <p>Mr Mawhinney was replying to Robin Cook, who accused the Conservatives of "corruption" after it was  disclosed that property developer John Beckwith, chairman of the Premier Club, has a leading role in a  consortium shortlisted to buy Ministry of Defence homes.  <p>  <p>Mr Mawhinney told Mr Cook: "Those who choose to give money to the Conservative Party do so not  because they receive influence in return, but because they believe that a Conservative government  would be in the nation's interest.  <p>  <p>"There is no question of anyone buying or selling access to the Prime Minister or indeed any other  minister, for any sum."  <p>  <p>Ministers compared the Premier Club to Labour's &#163;1000 club, pointing out that both parties had  private lists of donors, which in Labour's case would not be declared until after the election.  <p>  <p>The Deputy Prime Minister, Michael Heseltine, drew Tory laughter in the Commons yesterday as he  told MPs that people had to pay &#163;430 to dine with Tony Blair at London's Savoy Hotel. He said  that the higher figure suggested in media reports for eating with Mr Major reflected "the quality of  the two individuals".   <p>  <p>Lord Mackay of Ardbrecknish in the Lords took a similar tack when challenged by  Lord Avebury, the Liberal Democrat peer. Labour's Derek Foster protested to Roger Freeman, the public  service minister, that plans to privatise Her Majesty's Stationery Office had become "a car boot sale  of Civil Service jobs, a handout of public sector assets and contacts - and some to your fat-cat  friends payrolling the Tory Party through the Premier Club".  <p>  <p>The issue resurfaced during exchanges on Government plans to suspend the Post Office monopoly.  Labour pressed the President of the Board of Trade, Ian Lang, for assurances that no one would benefit  from the lifting of the monopoly "through any company whose members have paid large amounts of money"  to dine with him or the Prime Minister. Mr Lang avoided giving a direct reply.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>4,000 frozen human embryos to be destroyed</b><br><br><br><b><h2>23 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Frozen human embryos to be destroyed</h2><h3>Parents cannot be found as 4,000 fertilised  eggs face deadline</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chris Mihill</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Up to 4,000 frozen embryos from about 900 couples are to be destroyed at the end of the month  because the parents cannot be contacted, have shown no interest in the fate of their potential  children or do not want them any more.  <p>  <p>The destruction has to take place because Parliament said in 1990 that, from August 1991, embryos  could be frozen only for five years, meaning the deadline is up on 31 July. In May the regulations  were changed so that embryos could be stored for 10 years, but only if the parents were contacted and  gave their permission.  <p>  <p>Ruth Deech, chairwoman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which regulates clinics  holding the embryos, said yesterday: "The regulations allow many patients to extend their consent to  10 years or more in some exceptional cases. But if that consent cannot be obtained the storage has to  cease, which means, sadly, allowing a number of embryos to perish.  <p>  <p>"But if you think through the other options - of using them without the consent of the individuals,  or of keeping them stored indefinitely - those options are far less acceptable.  Some have suggested that these embryos should be donated or 'adopted'. This would be wrong both  legally and ethically."  <p>  <p>Dr Peter Brinsden, the medical director of Bourn Hall, Cambridge, which pioneered in vitro  fertilisation treatment, said the centre had 265 couples it could not contact covering 904 embryos,  out of 10,000 in storage. "It would be completely unethical to use the embryos for purposes other than  originally intended by the couples."  <p>  <p>A spokeman for Issue, the infertility pressure group, said: "It would be ideal if these embryos  could be used for other infertile couples, but the ownership remains with the parents. We find it sad  they must be destroyed, but the law is the law."  <p>  <p>The embryology authority said about 9,000 embryos faced the five-year deadline. Of these, 2,100  embryos from 650 couples would perish because it had not been possible to contact the parents; another  1,200 embryos from 260 couples would be destroyed because the parents had been contacted but did not  reply.  <p>  <p>About 10 per cent of the parents that have been contacted by clinics have said they no longer want  their embryos stored, meaning the final number to be destroyed is likely to be around 4,000.  <p>  <p>Most frozen embryos are just four cells. They will be brought out of storage, allowed to reach room  temperature and then destroyed with a drop of water or alcohol.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stuart Millar</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Police were last night investigating the cause of a car crash in which the keyboard player of the  Britpop group the Charlatans was killed. Robert Collins, aged 32, died on Monday night on his way to  hospital after losing control of his red BMW in Monmouth, Gwent.  <p>  <p>A Gwent police spokeswoman said the BMW hit several parked cars before ending up in a field. No  other vehicle was involved, and the cause of the crash is not yet known. A male passenger, aged 31,  who is not being named, escaped unhurt but was in shock, police said.  <p>  <p>A spokesman for the band's record company, Beggar's Banquet, said yesterday: "We are very upset,  not just for Rob's family and his fans, but for the rest of the band."  <p>  <p>The Charlatans were in Monmouth recording their fifth album and were due to go on tour later this  month as special guests of Oasis.  <p>  <p>Collins, from Walsall, West Midlands, supplied the band's trademark swirling Hammond organ sound  which helped the Charlatans to two number one albums. Born out of the Madchester scene in 1990, their  debut album, 'Some Friendly', then went straight to number one for 17 weeks.  <p>  <p>Collins was equally famous for his exploits off-stage. He was jailed in 1993 for driving a getaway  car after a bungled armed robbery.  <p>  <p>His mother, Maureen, said yesterday: "I'm still far too upset to talk."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nick Varley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Princess of Wales was left bereft of senior advisers last night after her key media aide  resigned, six months before the end of her contract. Jane Atkinson, who runs her own public relations  consultancy, took up the post in January after Geoff Crawford resigned as the princess's press officer  over her controversial 'Panorama' interview two months earlier. The job will be left vacant. A statement  from Kensington Palace said the princess "has decided there is no longer a requirement for an external  media adviser".  <p>  <p>It means she has lost her two closest advisers. Her private secretary, Patrick Jephson, quit in  January, reportedly furious he was not consulted about the 'Panorama' interview.  <p>  <p>The announcement said the princess had accepted Ms Atkinson's resignation "due to the reduction in  her work commitment" with immediate effect. Ms Atkinson was unavailable for comment.  <p>  <p>Diana quit as patron of almost 100 charities last week, in an episode said to have resulted in the  latest clash between the two. The princess reportedly blamed Ms Atkinson, aged 48, for the negative  reaction to the resignations.  <p>  <p>A critical response to the princess watching heart surgeon Sir Magdi Yacoub at work was also pinned  on Ms Atkinson. She was not consulted about it beforehand.  <p>  <p>Media inquiries will now be dealt with by the remaining three secretaries who run the princess's  office.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Beckwith, chairman of Premier Club to buy up social security offices </b><br><br><br><b><h2>24  July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Major's tycoon covets welfare offices</h2><h3>Billion dollar man in takeover bid   </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hencke</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>John Beckwith, chairman of the Premier Club, where wealthy business people pay up to &#163;100,000  to dine with John Major, has secured backing worth $1bn from a United States insurance company to buy  up Britain's social security offices.  <p>  <p>Confidential minutes of a meeting held with management advisers to the Social Security Secretary,  Peter Lilley, reveal that Mr Beckwith wants to buy all the social security property in England and  Wales on top of purchasing 58,000 Ministry of Defence homes in deals worth around &#163;2.5bn.  According to the minutes, the 49-year-old property tycoon - whose role in the Premier Club was  disclosed by the Observer this week - says that it is a "good time to be planning a transaction of  this nature and size, because of the large amount of capital available globally for major deals." The  sale of the social security offices, including the headquarters at Quarry House, Leeds, and management  centres in Newcastle upon Tyne, will offer huge opportunities for property developers.  <p>  <p>Some of the more lucrative high street locations could be resold and converted into up-market shops  on condition the developer provides alternative accommodation on council estates, where more people  are on benefit.  <p>  <p>Ministers have denied that any bid for the social security offices had been made, and have defended  the short-listing of a consortium headed by Beckwith Capital Partners for the MoD estate in May.  <p>  <p>Yesterday, after being challenged in the House of Commons over the Observer story by the Labour MP  Peter Hain, John Major said: "No one can buy access to ministers, no one is promised favours."  <p>  <p>The minutes of the meeting between Mr Beckwith and two fellow directors and three directors of  Deloitte and Touche, management consultants, reveal that Mr Beckwith is running two consortiums to buy  large swathes of the Whitehall estate. Deloitte and Touche confirmed the meeting had taken place. The  planned bid for the social security offices, which will be put up for sale next year to raise at least  &#163;750m for the Government, is under Beckwith Property Fund Management with chartered surveyors  Richard Ellis and the United States insurance company AIG. The minutes say: "AIG is one of the largest  insurance companies in the world with gross assets over one billion dollars."  <p>  <p>They show that Mr Beckwith has already told the Department of Social Security that are "more  interested in the DSS opportunity. The option of doing a deal in a single one-off transaction is more attractive than phasing it over  time or splitting it into packages. A partnership arrangement, probably including an FM (facilities  management) company, is favoured."  <p>  <p>The minutes also disclose that Mr Beckwith was highly critical of Defence Secretary Michael  Portillo's handling of its approach to buy the MoD estate with another consortium involving Hodge plc  and Lehman Brothers (BHL), an American investment bank.  <p>  <p>The MoD was said to be running the sale badly, with several bidding consortiums breaking apart and  a poorly thought out shortlisting process.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Queen shares Christmas Day broadcast between BBC and ITV </b><br><br><br><b><h2>25 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Queen changes channels</h2><h3>Snub to BBC as  traditional Christmas broadcast to be produced every two years by ITV</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Andrew Culf</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Buckingham Palace yesterday delivered an apparent snub to the BBC for its 'Panorama' interview with  the Princess of Wales by ending its exclusive responsibility for making the Queen's Christmas  broadcast.  <p>  <p>The move to share production of the broadcast between the BBC and ITV ended a 39-year tradition and  was being interpreted by broadcasters as retaliation for 'Panorama's' portrayal of a royal family beset  by in-fighting. Under the new arrangement, announced by the Queen's press secretary Charles Anson, ITV  will produce the broadcast, transmitted throughout the Commonwealth on Christmas Day, in 1997 and  1998. Production reverts to the BBC in 1999 and 2000. The alternating two-year cycle will be reviewed  periodically, he added. Both channels will screen the broadcast each year as usual.  <p>  <p>The palace insisted there was no rift with the BBC and denied it had been taken in the wake of last  November's interview by Martin Bashir. A spokesman said: "We were considering a change to the current  arrangements in early 1995, before the 'Panorama' programme was broadcast." However, ITV was approached  by the palace, which hinted darkly at the time of the interview that it might take action against the  BBC. It said in November: "No institution can take for granted its relationship with the media, just  as the media - in this case the BBC - cannot take for granted its relationship with us."  <p>  <p>The BBC said it did not believe 'Panorama' was the reason for the decision. A spokeswoman added: "In  the contemporary broadcasting environment it makes sense for the leading public service broadcasters  to share the responsibilities and costs of broadcasts of this kind." The cost of producing and  distributing the broadcast around the world is about &#163;100,000 a year. Audiences for the broadcast  have fallen steadily. The 1995 address was watched by 13.7 million viewers, most of them tuned to the  BBC, a drop of 10 million in five years.  <p>  <p>The 1996 broadcast will be made by the BBC's head of events programmes, Philip Gilbert, for the  sixth year running. Next year, ITN will produce the broadcast, with radio distribution to 190 stations  around the world being handled by its partners Independent Radio News.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>The Queen's TV times</b>  <p>  <p>ITV ran into controversy in 1994 when it contemplated moving the broadcast from its traditional 3pm  slot.  <p>  <p>The Sun published extracts from the 1992 broadcast in advance; it was forced to apologise to the  Queen and pay &#163;200,000 in damages to charity. The BBC was also forced to apologise in 1987 when  the contents leaked to six tabloid newspapers. Royal correspondent Michael Cole had discussed the  broadcast with reporters at a private lunch.  <p>  <p>The first broadcast was on radio in 1932, made by George V, from Sandringham. The first television  broadcast was in 1957.  <p>  <p>It has spawned the tradition of an alternative Christmas Day broadcast on Channel 4. Presenters  have included Jesse Jackson, Quentin Crisp and Brigitte Bardot.  <p>  <p>The Queen headed into cyberspace for the first time in 1994 as the broadcast was transmitted on the  internet.  <p>  <p>Informality was introduced to the broadcast in 1986 by producer Sir David Attenborough when the  Queen dispensed with her desk and was filmed at a children's Christmas party.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Burundi's president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya flees to US embassy </b><br><br><br><b><h2>26 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Creeping coup that caught up with Burundi  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chris McGreal</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Until yesterday, they called it the creeping coup. It began three years ago with the army's  assassination of Burundi's first freely elected and Hutu president. Melchior Ndadaye had been in  office just a few months when Tutsi soldiers decided they had had enough of majority rule. So they  murdered him. The 1993 putsch failed when the overwhelmingly Tutsi army and its political allies  realised what the assassination had unleashed. Burundi's long oppressed Hutus had tolerated a  succession of coups over the years because one Tutsi soldier was usually replacing another. Ndadaye's  murder was different.  <p>  <p>Burundi's majority unleashed their anger about brutally dashed hopes on their Tutsi neighbours. The  army exacted its revenge on Hutus. Tens of thousands died. In the past three years, the killing has  not stopped. Hutu rebels and Tutsi soldiers roam the country murdering at will. The atrocious level of  killing might suggest a civil war, but it is not a conflict fought between the army and rebels.  Instead, each side appears to avoid combat in favour of slaughtering the defenceless: women, children,  old men.  <p>  <p>The 1993 coup had failed but Burundi's Tutsi and other elites were not discouraged. Over the next  three years they wielded the weapons of fear - chaos and brute force - to achieve what had been  planned the day Ndadaye was assassinated.  <p>  <p>Yesterday they could claim success. Civilian government was overthrown. Burundi's latest Hutu  president, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, was hiding in the United States embassy. The Hutu half of the  cabinet fled to other Western embassies. And majority rule was finally emasculated.  <p>  <p>The instruments of the creeping coup were the trappings of democracy and a well-founded fear among  the Tutsi population for their safety. After Ndadaye's assassination, the army and the mainly Tutsi  Uprona party - which had ruled Burundi unchallenged until the 1993 election - forced power-sharing on  to Frodebu, the party which had won the vote with the support of most Hutus.  <p>  <p>The deal recognised Frodebu's right to control of the presidency and parliament, but it shifted a  significant amount of power to the cabinet and the Uprona-appointed prime minister.  <p>  <p>In the following months, Uprona and its coalition allies manufactured a series of political crises  to stall reform and perpetuate the central role of the army.  <p>  <p>When it looked as if the government might start to function normally, a new crisis was thrown up.  Uprona campaigned to bring down the Hutu speaker of parliament. He fell. Then the party decided its  own prime minister had not been enthusiastic enough in the campaign against the speaker. He, too, was  brought down.  <p>  <p>The extremists tightened their grip still further. Hit squads began assassinating Hutu politicians  and intellectuals, and ethnically cleansing the capital, Bujumbura, of tens of thousands of Hutus.  <p>  <p>Antoine Nduwayo, Burundi's last Tutsi prime minister who resigned yesterday during the coup, was  installed last year with the support of the army and one of the country's most notorious extremists,  the former military dictator Jean-Baptiste Bagaza.  <p>  <p>As Hutu resentments fuelled the rebel groups which said they were fighting for the restoration of  democracy, Mr Nduwayo drew on a deep well of fear among Burundi's Tutsis. After the genocide in  Rwanda, Burundi's hardliners pointed north of the border and warned the Tutsi community it would meet  the same fate if it relaxed its grip on the military, economy, civil service and media.  <p>  <p>To reinforce the government's message, pictures of rebel massacres of Tutsi women and children  appear almost nightly on television. The government announced a week of mourning after the slaughter  of more than 300 people on Saturday.  <p>  <p>But the military ensures that no such pictures reach the Hutus slaughtered by the army, militias  and aggrieved Tutsi civilians.  <p>  <p>Even President Ntibantunganya was accused of backing genocide, a particularly galling charge for  him given that the army murdered his wife during the putsch against Ndadaye.  <p>  <p>Ironically, it was concern for the lives of the innocent that mobilised Tutsi extremists for their  final push against Mr Ntibantunganya and the coalition government.  <p>  <p>The president and Mr Nduwayo bent to pressure from Burundi's neighbours, afraid civil war could  spill across their borders. The plan sent shock waves through the Tutsi political and military elite.  They saw clearly that foreign troops would mean pressure to negotiate with the rebels and Frodebu, and  that could only lead to one thing. Any effective political settlement would have to recognise the  legitimacy of majority rule, albeit with strong security and democratic guarantees for the Tutsi  minority. And that would be at the expense of the Tutsi elite's dominance.  <p>  <p>Two weeks ago, Uprona's president, Charles Mukasi, was quite clear about the extremists' intent.  "We'll begin by removing the president. Mr Ntibantunganya is the designer of the whole business so we  need to handle the problem at the roots. We need another president and another government," he said.  <p>  <p>Yesterday Burundi got it.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>54 Hebridean islanders fight to buy their island, Eigg</b><br><br><br><b><h2>26 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Eigg seeks to throw off 'feudal' yoke  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nick Varley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The estate agent, a self-styled 'dealer in mother nature's artwork', described his latest property  as 'one of her masterpieces'.  <p>  <p>But to inhabitants of the tiny Hebridean island of Eigg, such romance has worn off as their home is  put up for sale for the second time in 15 months. The move is the latest twist in a saga almost as  surreal as the paintings of its owner, Marlin Eckhard, an amateur artist with the brush-name Maruma  who promised &#163;15m investment on a new ferry, housing, hotel and pier. In fact, nothing has changed since his second and last visit over a year ago.  <p>  <p>Now Eigg's 54 inhabitants are hoping to buy the 15 square mile island, lying between Rhum and Muck  12 miles off the Scottish coast, for less than the 'simply unrealistic' &#163;2m asking price.  <p>  <p>Maggie Fyffe, the islanders' spokeswoman, said: "This is the turning point. Something has to happen  now. We will be pulling out all the stops to get a package together to make an offer for the island.  We will make it quite clear we do not want another private owner and that we want to take control  of our own futures."  <p>  <p>Such a move would mean the end of private ownership dating back to 1308, and owners ranging from a  former Times journalist to ex-Olympic bobsleigher Keith Schellenberg.  Mr Schellenberg, who residents thought as feudal a laird as any in the centuries before, sold to  Maruma after 20 years' rule which ended in open hostility with them. Hopes that the new owner would be  more agreeable were swiftly dashed.  <p>  <p>Mrs Fyffe said: "He was not reliable in any way, shape or form. We have had a very bad experience  here."  <p>  <p>The islanders' bid for ownership is being backed by the Scottish Wildlife Trust, whose director,  Alasdair Sutherland, said: "Our prime consideration is the conservation of the unique range of  habitats on the island and the welfare of the species there.  <p>  <p>"But I am confident we will be able to mount a successful bid for Eigg and finally decide its  future. It would take a very stupid or thick-skinned individual to follow Maruma there now."  <p>  <p>Farhad Vladi, a Hamburg-based Austrian dealer in islands who handled the sale to Maruma last year,  has been called in again to assist local estate agents.  He wished the islanders every success in their campaign but dashed any hopes the laird might sell  to them at a knockdown price, saying they only had themselves, and the press, to blame.  <p>  <p>He said: "The reason Herr Maruma is selling is because he is very disappointed at the treatment he  received from them and the British press. Why should he give them preferential treatment?"  <p>  <p>Maruma was unavailable for comment last night.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Six die in hunger strikes in Turkish jails</b><br><br><br><b><h2>27 July  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Ankara gives ultimatum to hunger strikers in jails</h2><h3>Minister threatens bloody  intervention as first woman protester dies  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chris Nuttall</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A woman, aged 22, became the eighth hunger striker to die in a Turkish prison last night, and the  country's justice minister warned inmates to abandon their protest or risk a bloody operation to  retake the jails. Sevket Kazan told journalists: "This is the last call. From this time onwards, if  they don't stop their death-fasting, we will be forced to intervene."  <p>  <p>Ayse Idil Ekmen, the first woman to die in the countrywide hunger strike, had been refusing all  food and even sugared water at Canakkale prison, near Istanbul. She was on trial for being a member of  an illegal leftwing organisation.  <p>  <p>A few hours earlier, Tahsin Yilmaz, of the Turkish Revolutionary Communist Union, died in  Bayrampasa prison, one of two Istanbul jails the government admits are no longer under its control.  The justice minister said the hunger strikers in Bayrampasa were in 19 dormitories, containing 40  to 80 inmates, which prison officers could no longer enter.  <p>  <p>Sympathetic guards had helped them to obtain guns, cellular phones and even faxes which they were  using to organise the hunger strike around the country.  Mr Kazan said there were five ringleaders, who were preventing those fasting from receiving medical  treatment.  <p>  <p>The hardline minister dismissed mounting international criticism of the Turkish government's  failure to prevent the deaths.  "I don't give a damn about foreign press reports and letters from Amnesty International," he said.  "I only care about what happens in the jails. Turkey is an independent country."  <p>  <p>The European commissioner Hans van den Broek wrote to Turkey's foreign minister, Tansu Ciller,  urging her to try to prevent further deaths. Diplomats saw the letter as a thinly veiled reminder to  Ankara of its promise to improve human rights in exchange for a customs deal with the European Union.  <p>  <p>In Brussels, socialist members of the European Parliament threatened to block EU funds for Turkey  in budget talks later this year. France has counselled Ankara to compromise.  <p>  <p>Italy has made a 'pressing appeal' to Turkey's government to improve prison conditions. The Italian  foreign ministry said the hunger strike could damage Ankara's relations with the EU.  <p>  <p>Germany called on Turkey to push through promised improvements in jail conditions as quickly as  possible.  Bonn's plea came after a fourth successive night of firebomb attacks on Turkish properties in  Germany which police believe were the work of supporters of the hunger strike.  <p>  <p>Meanwhile, in southern Austria five Turks started a hunger strike in solidarity with the fasting  prisoners.  <p>  <p>The pro-Kurdish Dem news agency reported that leaders of 10,000 jailed Kurdish militants had  announced they would join the hunger strike. Pictures on Turkish television showed flags of the PKK  Kurdish separatist party on the roof of Bayrampasa jail.  <p>  <p>Turkey's health ministry said 314 inmates were involved in the 'death-fast', and 60 were in a  serious condition.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Damon Hill wins German Grand Prix</b><br><br><br><b><h2>29 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Hill makes the most of Berger's blow-up  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alan Henry</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Damon Hill took an important step towards the world title with a hard-fought victory in the German Grand Prix here to extend his advantage to 21 points with a maximum of 50 available over the remaining five races of the season. It was the 20th grand prix victory of his career, matching Michael Schumacher's tally on a day when the German driver had to settle for a disappointing fourth place in front of his home crowd.  <p>  <p>Hill crossed the finishing line 11.4sec ahead of Jean Alesi's Benetton. The Briton's Williams-Renault team-mate Jacques Villeneuve, his only remaining title challenger, was third.  <p>  <p>Yet that apparently comfortable margin belied the frenzied battle between Hill and the other Benetton of Gerhard Berger, who was a few yards ahead of him when, three laps from the chequered flag, the Austrian suffered a massive engine failure.  <p>  <p>Asked whether he regarded it as a lucky win, Hill replied: "Absolutely no way. Now listen, I have had my fair share of bad luck here at Hockenheim. Unfortunately these things happen in motor racing. And the last few laps would have been exciting if Gerhard had kept going.  <p>  <p>"I came out of the Clark chicane and suddenly heard one of our engines make a strange noise. I thought it might be mine, but Gerhard moved slightly to the left and I dodged right just before it erupted.  I won't deny that Gerhard's failure to finish was fortuitous, but these things happen. If it had not been for the fact that I lost a couple of seconds passing yellow warning flags before my second pit stop I would have got out of the pits ahead of him for the last time and the race would have been in the bag.  It looks a little easier in the championship and I was really glad to grab this win, as the races are starting to run out now."  <p>  <p>Hill's success broke a three-year run of misfortune in the German race. In 1993 he had been heading for victory ahead of his Williams team-mate Alain Prost when a rear tyre punctured two laps from the finish. In 1994 he bent a steering arm in a first-lap collision, and last year he spun into a gravel trap while leading at the start of the second lap.  <p>  <p>After he qualified on pole position, it looked as though Hill might again be in trouble as he made a slow start and completed the opening lap third behind the Benettons of Berger and Alesi.  <p>  <p>This trio quickly pulled away from the pack, which was initially headed by Schumacher's Ferrari, the champion also having lost ground when he tried to squeeze out Mika Hakkinen's McLaren as they accelerated away from the grid. Hill was scheduled to make two refuelling stops, but had sufficient fuel in his Williams from the start to have maximum tactical flexibility as to when he entered the pits for the first time.  <p>  <p>Having satisfied himself that both the Benettons ahead were likely to be stopping once, he came in at the end of lap 20 and was thus able to emerge in the lead after Alesi and Berger made their sole stops shortly afterwards. Now it was down to Hill to give himself a big enough cushion to allow himself to emerge from his second refuelling stop without losing the lead. Between laps 26 and 34, when he finally came in, he stretched his advantage over Berger from 6.2 to 15.9sec before coming back in for his second stop. Unfortunately for him that short spell under the yellow flag just tipped the advantage back in Berger's favour and Hill emerged a couple of seconds behind the Benetton for the sprint to the finish.  <p>  <p>"I was pushing him hard and hoping he would make a mistake," said Hill. "It was always going to be a big risk to try and pass him, and I had to bear that in mind. I meant to score points but I wanted to win."  <p>  <p>Behind Alesi and Villeneuve, Schumacher was fortunate to scramble home fourth after a strong challenge from David Coulthard's McLaren-Mercedes. For Schumacher, who had won in front of his home crowd 12 months earlier, watching Hill take another stride towards relieving him of his world championship was a bitter pill to swallow.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael Walker</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Alan Shearer, the England centre forward, yesterday became the most expensive footballer in the  world when he joined Newcastle United from Blackburn Rovers for &#163;15m.  <p>  <p>This is &#163;6.5m more than the British record Liverpool paid Nottingham Forest for Stan Collymore last summer, and &#163;2m more than the previous world record  fee, paid by A C Milan to Torino for Gianluigi Lentini in 1992.  It confirms that England has replaced Italy as the world's richest footballing nation.  <p>  <p>Manchester United, who won the double last season, had offered &#163;12m for the top scorer in this  summer's Euro 96 tournament, but they were outbid by Newcastle and Shearer was happy to return to the  club he once watched from the terraces. Reported wages of &#163;25,000 for each week of his five-year  contract will have also helped his decision. Kevin Keegan, the Newcastle manager, has spent &#163;60m  on players over the past four and a half years and could not contain his excitement at his latest capture. "I just love  signing big players and there is none bigger than this one. It is a signing for the people of  Newcastle," he said.  <p>  <p>The signing is proof of the prosperity that English football has suddenly discovered since the  creation of the Premier League in 1992. Then a partnership of BSkyB and the BBC paid &#163;302m to  televise matches, a contract that was replaced this summer by a deal worth &#163;670m over five years.  Much of the money has manifested itself in inflated transfer fees and vastly increased salaries for  players.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>How to spend it</b>  <p>  <p>Buy 3.5 million Manchester United shares, a 6 per cent stake, at &#163;4.28 each.  <p>  <p>Retune 25 per cent of the nation's video recorders before the Channel 5 launch.  <p>  <p>Buy the Scottish island of Eigg, and spend the remaining &#163;13m on a new ferry, housing and  pier.  <p>  <p>Buy 348,918 Newcastle United replica shirts with Shearer's name on from the club shop at  &#163;42.99 each, or 35,714 season tickets to St James' Park to watch him play at &#163;420 each, or  78,174 Sky Sports subscriptions.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Pension ruling blow to divorced women</b><br><br><br><b><h2>30 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Pension  blow to 600,000 women  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jill Papworth</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>More than half a million women who get divorced between now and 2000 will miss out on new rights to  a share of their ex-husband's pension fund, it was revealed yesterday.  <p>  <p>Opposition parties sparked a furious political row as they accused the Government of a  'half-hearted' commitment to fair pension rights for women, and said it had been 'dragged kicking and  screaming' into agreeing the plan. Launching the Government's proposals for 'clean-break' splitting of  pension rights on divorce, the Social Security Minister, Lord MacKay of Ardbrecknish, said the changes  could be made law by 1998. But he said the actual implementation of pension splitting, which will give  divorcees an outright share of their ex-spouse's pension as part of the divorce settlement, could not  go ahead until 2000.  <p>  <p>Labour cautiously welcomed the green paper, but claimed that every move the Government had made on  pension splitting had been in response to its own campaign for pension justice in divorce. "The delays  will have deprived thousands of women who have contributed over the years to the sustenance of the  home and family," said shadow pensions spokesman John Denham. "The Government has had to be dragged  kicking and screaming towards pension justice. Thousands of women will suffer poverty in retirement  because of the needless delays that we have had from the Government."  <p>  <p>Ministers had strongly resisted the concept of pension splitting, claiming it was too complicated  to implement and would drain Treasury coffers of millions of pounds of income tax on split pensions.  <p>  <p>But during the recent passage of the Family Law Bill it was forced to agree to the idea.  <p>  <p>Peers and MPs were unhappy about the growing number of cases where a middle-aged wife was deserted  by her husband only to discover she may not be entitled to a share of his pension when he retired.  <p>  <p>A powerful cross-party alliance initially forced through changes in the Lords. Ministers had hoped  these would be reversed in the Commons, but had to agree to them at the 11th hour in order to save the  bill. Labour wrenched the crucial concession on pensions splitting as the price for its support,  allowing the legislation to receive its third reading.  <p>  <p>As the Government does not propose to apply the new rights retrospectively, pension splitting will  not be an option for the estimated 600,000 couples who get divorced in the late 1990s.  <p>  <p>Instead, they will be left with 'offsetting' pension rights against other non-pension assets or  taking advantage of the new 'pensions earmarking' provisions, introduced earlier this month, which  allow pension schemes to earmark a slice of money which will then be paid to a wife when her  ex-husband retires, or vice versa.  <p>  <p>Lord MacKay claimed the delay in being able to implement pension splitting is because of the  three-year modernisation of the DSS computer system in Newcastle upon Tyne, which stores National  Insurance contribution records. "We really could not at the same time make the changes that would be  needed to calculate Serps [the state earnings related pension scheme paid on top of the basic state  pension] and split them for the considerable number of people who get divorced each year," he said.  <p>  <p>But Sally Quin of the divorcees campaign group, Fairshares, said: "If the only thing holding back  the commencement of pensions splitting is a computer system, I don't think it's beyond the capability  of the Government to find a way around it."  <p>  <p>Yesterday the Liberal Democrats' social security spokeswoman, Liz Lynne, warned that the  technicalities should "not be used as an excuse for any back-tracking by this Government".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Owen Bowcott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The former Prime Minister, Sir Edward Heath, will fulfil a fee-paying speaking engagement at a conference in Washington today organised by the Unification Church, whose leader, the Reverend Sun Myung Moon, is banned from entering Britain.  <p>  <p>The three-day meeting, held under the banner of the Family Federation for World Peace, has attracted a galaxy of world leaders, including former US presidents George Bush and Gerald Ford.  <p>  <p>It is the third time that Sir Edward has spoken at international conferences promoted by the Unification Church, otherwise known as the 'Moonie' cult founded by the 76-year-old self-proclaimed Messiah from Korea. At least one other senior British politician has been a guest speaker at one of the church's conferences this year. The former Labour Foreign Secretary, Lord Healey, flew to Japan in June, it was disclosed yesterday, to address the Federation of Island Commonwealths for World Peace. George Robertson, a Unification Church spokesman in London, yesterday confirmed the federation was part of its movement. He declined to discuss the speaking fees involved, which in the past have been described as 'substantial'.  <p>  <p>In October last year the Home Secretary, Michael Howard, banned the Rev Moon from entering Britain on the grounds that his presence was not 'conducive to the public good'.  <p>  <p>The Rev Moon's organisation lost a libel case in 1981 against the Daily Mail which alleged it 'broke up families'. Since being jailed for tax fraud in the United States the following year, he has built a multi-billion pound empire.  <p>  <p>Larry Moffat, an organiser of the Washington conference, yesterday said Sir Edward would talk about the family. "When we are talking about family issues, like poverty, famine, he's one of the most experienced men in the neighbourhood."  <p>  <p>Both Sir Edward and Lord Healey's office said the speaking engagements had been arranged through a speaking 'agency'. Lord Healey was not available for comment but his office in the Lords said they were not sure whether he was aware of the Unification Church connection. Sir Edward, on the way to catch a flight to Washington last night, declined to comment on his fee. "We all know why Michael Howard imposed the ban," he said. "He wanted to get some votes. It was wrong to ban (the Rev Moon). This is an international conference. What we are discussing is the influence that families can have on world affairs after the millennium. This is the same as John Major's Back to Basics."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Four women peace campaigners cleared of attack to military jet in Liverpool  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>31 July 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Peace women cleared over jet attack  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Wainwright</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Four women peace campaigners left Liverpool crown court in triumph last night after a jury cleared them of charges relating to &#163;1.5m worth of damage to a military jet which they attacked with hammers. The women had freely admitted the attack on the Hawk fighter at British Aerospace's huge plant at Warton, near Preston, where it was one of 24 similar aircraft due for export to the military government in Indonesia. The majority verdict vindicated the protesters' largely home-made defence: that the jet's export would flout repeated United Nations condemnations of Indonesian repression of the population of East Timor. Indonesia's military invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975, since when 200,000 people - more than a third of the province's population - have died.  <p>  <p>The court's decision was greeted with passionate approval by civil rights and church groups as a rare example of the 'higher cause' outweighing the ordinary considerations of criminal law.  <p>  <p>The women argued that they 'had lawful excuse to disarm Hawk ZH955 because they were using reasonable force to prevent a crime'. They cited international and British legislation against genocide.  <p>  <p>Joanna Wilson, aged 33, and Andrea Needham, 29, of Liverpool, Lotta Kronlid, 28, of Oxford and Angie Zelter, 44, of Cromer, Norfolk, were cleared of plotting to damage the aircraft and causing actual damage by wrecking its equipment. The verdict was greeted with sobs of disbelief in the courtroom and cheers outside, where supporters had demonstrated throughout the five-day trial.  <p>  <p>The women told a jubilant throng of supporters, dancing in the city centre street, that they were "delighted and grateful" at the verdict. The Catholic group Pax Christi said: "We are overjoyed that the jury has recognised the righteousness of the wonderful witness of Anrdea, Jo, Lotta and Angie." Justice and Peace, another campaigning church group, said: "We are delighted that the jury has seen through to the real issues." George Monbiot, the environmental campaigner, said of the verdict: "Its psychological and moral implications are enormous. There has been so much outrage about knives and handguns being used for violence, but here we have a deadly machine being made ready to kill thousands."  <p>  <p>British Aerospace - which immediately served civil injunctions on the women, who publicly tore them up outside the court - admitted surprise at the verdict. The company said: "We operate in accordance with export licences granted by the Government. In addition we have no evidence that Hawk aircraft are used in a manner contrary to assurances provided by the Indonesian government to the British government."  <p>  <p>The court earlier heard how the women cut through Warton's seven-mile perimeter fence, entered a secure hangar and damaged the jet in 25 places, including weapons systems. They also left a 15-minute video in the cockpit, which was shown to the jury, explaining their motives, and rang a news agency immediately afterwards to say what they had done.  <p>  <p>The court heard a detailed defence from three of the women and barrister Vera Baird, acting for Joanna Wilson, which prompted agreement in court from Mr Justice Wickham and the prosecution that the aims behind the protest were genuine.  <p>  <p>Expert witnesses for the defence included the journalist John Pilger, whose television documentary, Death of a Nation, helped to inspire the East Timor Ploughshares campaign, and Paul Rogers, professor of peace studies at Bradford University and an expert on the arms trade.  <p>  <p>Jose Ramos Horta, exiled special representative of the East Timor rebels, also described the situation in the former Portuguese colony and detailed UN resolutions and calls for arms embargoes to the court.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Botham loses his libel case against Imran Khan</b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 August  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Botham libel case "an exercise in futility"</h2><h3>Imran says losing would have left  him bankrupt  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Vivek Chaudhary</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Imran Khan yesterday described the libel case brought against him by Ian Botham and Allan Lamb as a  "complete exercise in futility", adding that the whole thing had been a nightmare.  <p>  <p>Imran, speaking on CNN television a few minutes after his High Court victory, said: "It's a  complete exercise in futility, it's a ridiculous situation to be involved in a case like this when I  have something more important in Pakistan."  <p>  <p>He also said he would have been bankrupt had he lost the case. "I had no money left, it's so  expensive this libel, because most of the money I made from cricket I gave to the cancer hospital. The  rest would have gone today." The former Pakistan captain said the end of the case would allow him to  concentrate on his Justice Movement, the political group he founded in Pakistan.  <p>  <p>Imran again reiterated his claim that he never called anyone a cheat and that he was trying to  defend the Pakistan cricket team.  "I found there was no one defending the team so I jumped into the fray, trying to defend my team,  saying ball tampering is a huge issue and no one understands it and the Pakistanis are not cheating.  <p>  <p>"Don't ask me how I have ended up in this, but it's been a nightmare." Imran said he wrote to both  Botham and Lamb saying there was a misunderstanding when the India Today article appeared in which he  was quoted as calling them racist and lower class. "What I could not do was apologise for something I  had not done."  <p>  <p>Imran's solicitor, Howard Cohen, said his client would only have to pay a small proportion of the  costs.  <p>  <p>With Imran being whisked away by friends and family for a private celebration, Ian Botham was left  counting the cost of the two-week trial, insisting he had no regrets.  <p>  <p>The former England all-rounder said: "How can one regret it? I fought for my dignity and honesty  and one thing no one can ever accuse me of is being a racist. To call me a cheat. I find it amazing."  Botham said he was confused and astonished at the verdict. His former England colleague, Allan  Lamb, said: "The jury has got to make their decision and you have got to accept that."  <p>  <p>The dispute which resulted in the costly High Court action can be traced back to the summer of  1992, when the Pakistan cricket team arrived in England and allegations of cheating were being made  against them. The trial also saw the darker side of cricket being publicly exposed, with successive  players, including England captain Mike Atherton, admitting that ball tampering was part and parcel of  the game.  <p>  <p>The 1992 series, which Pakistan won 2-1, was described in court as savage and ugly, with  accusations of cheating being made by the tabloid press against Pakistan's two fast bowlers - the  current captain Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis.  <p>  <p>There were headlines like 'Paki cheats' and claims that the two, and previous Pakistan bowlers, had  regularly been tampering with the ball, by either picking the seam or scratching it on one side, to  make it swing more than it should. Some even suggested that this contributed to their world cup win  against England months earlier.  <p>  <p>The controversy resurfaced in 1994 when Imran admitted in a biography that he had scratched a ball  with a bottle top while playing for Sussex in a county match.  <p>  <p>Imran claimed in court that he was merely trying to highlight the unacceptable face of ball  tampering which he claimed had gone on in English cricket for years. Picking the seam with your  fingers or applying a bit of grease to one side of the ball was "tacitly accepted" but using outside  agents like bottle tops was over-stepping the limit.  "That's what I would call cheating," Imran confessed while giving evidence during the trial.  <p>  <p>Lamb and Botham responded swiftly to the Imran biography.  In May 1994, Lamb contributed an article to the Sun newspaper in which Imran was accused of  cheating and teaching Younis and Akram how to tamper with the ball.  This was followed by an article in the Daily Mirror in which Botham called for a full investigation  into Imran's ball tampering, and demanded his resignation from the International Cricket Conference.  <p>  <p>Less than a week later, Imran, who by now had retired from Test cricket and was concentrating on  building a cancer hospital in his native Lahore, responded by giving an interview to the Sun.  <p>  <p>Headlined 'World's greatest bowlers have all doctored the ball' he once again claimed that ball  tampering was an accepted part of English cricket. With England-Pakistan cricket relations at an  all-time low, matters deteriorated when extracts from an interview given by Imran to India Today  magazine appeared in the British press.  <p>  <p>He was quoted as calling Botham and Lamb racists, claiming that their approach to the whole issue  of ball tampering was "irrational" because they were lower class and uneducated.  It was this interview that led Botham and Lamb to bring their libel action against Imran while  Botham alone was suing him for the Sun article, claiming that Imran had called him a cheat.  <p>  <p>At times the trial became bogged down with technical details of what happens to a cricket ball when  it is scratched, has its seam picked or lipsalve is applied. The issue of what constitutes cheating in  cricket became crucial. At the end of the day it was a tussle between two cricket giants with egos to  match who refused to back down once heated words were exchanged over what is cheating in their sport.  <p>  <p>Perhaps the most poignant comment of the costly trial came from Allan Lamb's wife Lindsay.  Giving evidence midway through the trial and referring to an earlier libel action her husband was  involved in, she said: "I had four days of that and this is another seven days I have been listening  to balls."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Botham libel case: the leading players</b>  <p>  <p>Imran Khan, aged 43, made his Test debut for Pakistan against England in 1971 but returned to  Worcester Royal Grammar school after the tour. He went up to Oxford in 1973 and captained the side the  following year. He had an outstanding career as an all-rounder, first for Worcestershire and then  Sussex, as well as leading Pakistan to Test and World Cup success, the last in 1992 when they beat an  England side, which included Ian Botham, in the final by 22 runs.  <p>  <p>Throughout his career he maintained a playboy's lifestyle. He married Jemima Goldsmith last year  and embarked on a political career, challenging the mainstream Pakistani parties on a platform of  anti-corruption. Ian Botham, 40, made his Test debut against Australia in 1977. Nicknamed 'Beefy', his  career as an all-rounder for Somerset and latterly Durham see-sawed as dramatically as his flamboyant  temperament.  <p>  <p>He resigned the England captaincy in July, 1981 with England one down in the Test series against  Australia. England went on to win the series 3-1 with Botham scoring 149 in the third Test at  Headingley, taking five for 11 at Edgbaston, and adding 118 in the fifth Test at Old Trafford to  secure victory in 'Botham's Ashes'.  <p>  <p>He has walked the length of Britain for charity, and admitted that he had smoked cannabis, which  brought him a brief Test ban.  He retired in 1993.  <p>  <p>Allan Lamb, aged 42, was born in South Africa, where he made his first class debut for Western  Province in 1972.  A batsman, he settled in Northamptonshire, the county he played for first in 1978, becoming captain  in 1989. After the qualification period, he made his Test debut for England in 1982.  <p>  <p>A renowned prankster, as is Botham, he was fined &#163;5,000 by the Test and County Cricket Board  after accusing Pakistani bowlers of ball tampering in 1992. The following year he was sued for libel  by former Northants and Pakistani paceman Sarfraz Nawaz. The case was settled out of court, but  effectively ended his England career after 79 Tests, three as captain. He retired from first class  cricket this year.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Guide to ball tampering</b>  <p>  <p>Conventional swing - By applying something like sweat (which is legal) to one side of the ball, the air moves faster  across the shiny side and drags on the dull side, thereby giving extra swing. It is illegal, however,  to apply hair oil or lip salve to one side of the ball to give it extra shine.  <p>  <p>Reverse swing - A method pioneered in the Indian sub-continent. If a bowler applies lots of sweat to one side of  the ball and the other side is left as dry and rough as possible then this makes the ball swing in  reverse to its normal motion. It is illegal to tamper with the rough side using bottle tops, nails or  gouging with finger nails.  <p>  <p>Increased reverse swing - By lifting up the quarter seam and packing it with something like dirt helps make the ball even  heavier on one side, therby increasing the reverse swing. Some bowlers remove the quarter seam, which  also causes extra swing. Both these practices are illegal.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Botham loses his libel case against Imran Khan</b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 August  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Libel jury clean bowls "astonished" Botham  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Matthew Engel</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The cricketing celebrity Ian Botham was last night facing, if not quite ruin, then at least a  severe blow to his lifestyle when he lost his marathon libel case against the former Pakistan captain  Imran Khan.  <p>  <p>After 13 days in Court 13 at the High Court, the jury decided by a majority verdict against claims  by Botham and his former England team-mate Allan Lamb that they had been called racist and lacking  class by Imran in the magazine India Today. They also rejected by a majority Botham's charge that  Imran had, by implication, called him a cheat in the Sun.  <p>  <p>Halfway through the trial Imran agreed that Botham did not cheat at cricket, and he will have to  pay for that part of the case. However, after an exercise estimated to have cost &#163;750,000, Botham  and Lamb will have to bear the brunt.  <p>  <p>Botham said he was "astonished" by the verdict, a view shared by many observers. Speculation during  the jury's four and a half hour deliberation centred only on the damages award. The judge, Mr Justice French,  gave the jurors - seven men, five women - a notably curt thank you and then left, without a word of  apology for obliging them to spend three weeks of high summer cooped up listening to an argument that  was at best abstruse and at times absurd. It was the second sudden defeat for English cricketers in  the past three days: England lost nine wickets to Pakistan's bowlers in the Lord's Test on Monday  afternoon while George Carman QC was making his final speech on Imran's behalf. The implications for  cricket are uncertain, though Pakistani players may now have enhanced respect for English  decision-making, and it may help ensure that the rest of this summer's Test series is harmonious. It  is good news for Imran's presumed career in Pakistani politics. But the verdict has sent out a clear  warning to potential ligitants that the libel casino, once presumed to be a certain source of ready  cash, is now only about as safe as Lloyd's of London.  <p>  <p>Imran gave thanks to the Almighty, rather than to Mr Carman, when he left with his pregnant wife,  Sir James Goldsmith's daughter Jemima. Botham and Lamb, observing the best cricketing traditions,  accepted the umpire's decision with as much grace as they could manage and Botham said he would just  have to go back to his roadshow to raise the cash. He will probably also have to spend more  Christmases doing panto in provincial theatres, though it will be hard to find any script resembling a  pantomime quite as much as the past 13 days.  <p>  <p>More than a dozen England cricketers trooped through the courtroom giving evidence. The most  astonishing performance came when Geoffrey Boycott, subpoenaed by Imran, appeared wearing no jacket, a  shirt with a sponsor's name and carrying a boot whose significance the judge never allowed him to  explain.  <p>  <p>The alleged libels were published in 1994, and in the hours before the case opened there were  intense efforts by Imran's lawyers to reach a settlement. These foundered because the proffered  apology was considered too grudging and because Botham and Lamb wanted damages - even though a third  party had offered to pay both sides' costs up to that point.  <p>  <p>As the case went on, and developed into a bonfire of fivers - about one every 20 seconds, according  to the best guesses - there was a growing sense of the absurd.  <p>  <p>Imran's attempts to prove Botham had cheated by picking the seam or gouging a cricket ball failed  utterly when his videos from 14-year-old Test matches purporting to prove this were adopted by  Botham's own counsel, Charles Gray QC, and clearly showed him manipulating, quite legally, a ball that  had gone out of shape.  <p>  <p>The argument then largely went into semantics about the distinction between cheating and merely  breaking the rules. There was no consensus among the cricketers about whether ball-tampering had ever  been accepted as custom and practice within the game.  <p>  <p>Imran made no attempt to defend the suggestions that Botham and Lamb were racist or lacked class.  He claimed he had been misquoted.  <p>  <p>In the absence of substantive disagreement between the parties, the jury may well have taken the  view that the case should never have come to court. Possibly they decided to punish the plaintiffs, as  the presumed perpetrators of their incarceration. The legal system is such that we shall never know  without breaking the rules, or perhaps cheating.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Botham loses his libel case against Imran Khan</b><br><br><br><b><h2>3 August  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Nose brush with the law</h2><h3> Why did Beefy and Lamby lose that court case?   </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jonathan Margolis</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>We may never know how the jury in the Imran Khan versus Ian Botham and Allan Lamb libel case  reached its verdict; but is it possible that its decision in the Pakistani's favour and against the  home-grown 'Beefy' and 'Lamby' was swayed by a reaction against their moustaches?  <p>  <p>Could this, indeed, be the moment for all moustache wearers to reconsider their facial  arrangements?  <p>  <p>Let me first define what I mean by moustache. I am not referring to the often pleasing ruggedness  of a decent, neither too-shaggy, nor too-trimmed, beard and moustache. Neither, of course, am I even  countenancing the pervert special, that horror movie prop, the moustache-less beard, which acts  usefully for its wearers as a recognised diploma of insanity. The moustache in the dock is the British  bloke's version, the slightly aggressive, carefully trimmed little nose brush, that droops down a  regulation half an inch or so with the curve of the mouth to differentiate it from a Hitler, Stalin or  a Basil Fawlty.  <p>  <p>The Botham/Lamb moustache - they share the identical design - is the secondary sexual  characteristic of choice for plainclothes policemen trying to look cool, for pilots with immaculately  pressed shirts and over-neat tie knots, but lacking the balls to go for the full Dambusters handlebar  job. And, let us not forget, for homosexual men.  <p>  <p>I would not want to accuse the High Court jury of homophobia, and even less to suggest that Beefy,  Lamby (or, by implication sportsmen like David Seaman and Nigel Mansell) are gay, which would go down  very badly in their world and probably land us, following Imran's example, in the High Court. They do,  however, happen to have moustaches of a style not dissimilar from that beloved of gay men, while Imran  does not. And Imran did, a little unexpectedly, win the libel case. It's not quite QED, but you have  to wonder, don't you?  <p>  <p>The curious thing about the bloke's bloke moustache is that as far as I can tell, no woman in  recorded history has ever liked it. They will snog it all right - ask David Niven, or even Mrs Botham  and Mrs Lamb - but among themselves, women regard such a moustache as an unfortunate by-product of  maleness, like competitive burping, or farting in bed, only slightly less attractive.  <p>  <p>Why, then, do the likes of Botham and Lamb wear it, when it makes them look either gay or like  Detective Sergeants in the RUC, and does nothing particular for the opposite sex? Is it perverseness?  Or bravery? With the help of a degree I just awarded myself in the semiotics of personal grooming  (self-assessed module, University of Ilford) I believe I have found an answer.  <p>  <p>The Botham/Lamb moustache is not designed to attract women or men. It is the human equivalent of  those lurid patches of scarlet fur certain male monkeys display on their bottom. Its purpose is not to  impress females, nor to invite fellow males to come on in, but to warn the world in general that the  wearer is one potent and dangerous animal.  <p>  <p>Since Botham and Lamb generally wear trousers and underpants in public, which rules out any  ostentatious show of primary pubic hair, their moustaches parade their maleness in such settings as  pubs and courtrooms. Such is the subtlety of sexual signalling that they are prepared to be mistaken  for homosexual, because they know they could deal briskly with any gay man who mistakenly tried to  proposition them.  <p>  <p>The almost intentional ambiguity is the same as that of the male drivers of large sports cars. We  know instinctively that such men have small penises; yet there must be a proportion of Porsche drivers  who are adequately hung. The sports car driver who has a large penis, knowing this fact, must get some  perverse satisfaction from the sneering hoi polloi believing he does not.  <p>  <p>The irony of the Imran Khan story, of course, is that in rural Pakistan, away from the salons of  Karachi and Lahore, the two principle outward signs of maleness are a big Kalashnikov and a ferocious  moustache. While the High Court jury in London, especially the five women on it, may have judged Imran  more of a chap, or at least less of an oik, because he is clean-shaven, back home, his lack of  moustache could have worked against him.  <p>  <p>Facial hair, like justice, is fickle stuff.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rioch dismissed two weeks after signing contract as Arsenal manager  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Rioch signs for Arsenal after 14-month  delay  </h2>
  <br><br>      <p>The Arsenal manager Bruce Rioch last night announced that he had signed a contract with the club,  almost 14 months after arriving at Highbury from Bolton Wanderers.  <p>  <p>Rioch would not declare for how long he had committed himself but said: "I am now waiting for the  club to counter-sign the document."  <p>  <p>Rioch, speaking in Glasgow after seeing Simon Donnelly and Phil O'Donnell hit late goals to give  Celtic a 2-1 win over Arsenal, for whom John Hartson scored, added that he hoped to sign two players  before the 15 August deadline for the Uefa Cup first round.  <p>  <p>Singapore was disappointed to discover that Alan Shearer would not be making his bow for Newcastle  against a local select XI in tonight's friendly, although the England centre-forward met and trained  with his new team-mates in the city-state yesterday.  <p>  <p>Newcastle's manager Kevin Keegan said he wanted to give Shearer time to settle in. "There's  certainly no chance of him playing... I would say Japan [Sunday's friendly] will come too quick [as  well]. It would be very amateurish of me, even if he wanted to, to let him play.  <p>  <p>"It looks like his first game will be the Charity Shield against Manchester United [on Sunday  week]. We are going to Lincoln before that, but that's what it looks like at this stage."  <p>  <p>Keegan, whose team had come back to beat Thailand 2-1 in Bangkok, Faustino Asprilla and Robert Lee  scoring the goals, was reluctant to elaborate on his &#163;15m signing, saying only that Shearer would  appear at a Tyneside news conference on Tuesday. "He has signed for the people of Newcastle. This is really  something we should do back in Newcastle." West Ham lost 3-2 to Torquay United, the bottom club in  last season's Third Division, and the Londoners' &#163;1.5m signing Florin Raducioiu appeared to take  a punch from Jon Gittens. Raducioiu walked off with a swollen cheekbone and Torquay immediately  substituted Gittens. The West Ham manager Harry Redknapp later said he would be reporting the Torquay  player to the FA.  <p>  <p>The former Torquay captain John Uzzell, whose career was cut short by a horrific facial injury  sustained during a match against Brentford five years ago, is suing the London club and Gary Blissett,  the player allegedly involved in the incident.  <p>  <p>At Molineux a crowd of 23,942 attended a testimonial for the popular Wolves full-back Andy Thompson  but Dennis Wise gave Chelsea a 1-0 victory with a 65th-minute penalty. Wise converted after Mark  Hughes, who had earlier hit the post, was brought down in the box.  <p>  <p>Chelsea were again without the injured Gianluca Vialli as well as the player-manager Ruud Gullit.  <p>  <p>In the San Siro last night Internazionale, fielding four newly signed foreign stars,  strolled through a friendly with the English double winners Manchester United and won 3-0.  <p>  <p>Duncan Ferguson and Andrei Kanchelskis were on target as Everton defeated Tranmere 2-1 at Prenton  Park to lift the Liverpool Senior Cup. Kenny Irons scored a late consolation for Rovers.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rioch dismissed two weeks after signing contract as Arsenal manager  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>13 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Arsenal ditch Rioch and look abroad   </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Thorpe</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Arsenal are poised to join the continental drift by appointing a foreign manager to replace Bruce  Rioch, who departed the club yesterday less than a week before the start of the new season.  <p>  <p>Top of Arsenal's wanted list are Johan Cruyff, the former Dutch international and Barcelona coach  who was in London over the weekend, and the Frenchman Arsene Wenger, who has long had admirers on the  Arsenal board but is also thinking over an offer to become the FA's technical director. A big name is  essential to placate the fans after a pre-season filled with bad results and adverse publicity, and  Arsenal indicated yesterday that they expect to name a successor this week.  <p>  <p>Rioch's departure comes almost 14 months after he was hired by Arsenal to do a clean-up job  following the George Graham bung scandal dented the club's image and contributed to the team flirting  with relegation.  His sudden departure so close to the new season will have left fans and players bewildered. "It is  just unbelievable," said the Arsenal forward Paul Merson. "Four or five days before the start of the  season I don't think it's fair on the fans or the players."  <p>  <p>There has been a growing rift between Rioch and the man who runs Arsenal, the vice-chairman David  Dein, for many months now, leading to what insiders call a poisonous atmosphere between the two camps.  <p>  <p>Ironically the fans had taken Rioch's side, shouting abuse at Dein after a recent friendly in  Florence and planning more protests leading up to the club's annual general meeting on 22 August.  They blamed him rather than the manager for the fact that, despite the Premiership transfer flurry,  Arsenal have signed only the free-transfer goalkeeper John Lukic, this July, since paying &#163;4.75m  for David Platt on 10 July 1995. This is despite Arsenal being linked with players ranging from  Lombardo to Rui Costa.  <p>  <p>Fans put this failure to strengthen an ageing squad down to Dein's insistence on doing the  negotiations himself, a policy adopted to avoid a repeat of the control of transfers enjoyed by  Graham.  But it is understood that Rioch, having told Dein which players he wanted, began to lose faith in  his vice-chairman's ability to persuade players to join the club, privately complaining that, of 28  players submitted to Dein, Rioch had not been allowed to speak to any of them.  <p>  <p>This was one of the central reasons why Rioch refused to sign a contract. Finally Rioch did sign at  the end of last month after being strongly urged to do so by the Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood. It  makes yesterday's news even more puzzling.  <p>  <p>Rioch's track record was encouraging, if not startling. He led Arsenal to a place in Europe this  season with a side boosted by the addition of the club's record signing Dennis Bergkamp. But even here  there has been controversy, with that deal and Platt's transfer reportedly subject to investigation by  the Inland Revenue.  <p>  <p>Team affairs will now temporarily be in the hands of the assistant manager Stewart Houston, who  fulfilled a similar role after Graham's departure, and the coach Pat Rice.  The club has ruled out the new youth coach Liam Brady being appointed manager, though another  former player, David O'Leary, is being touted as a possible candidate.  <p>  <p>Arsenal have also twice tried to woo Terry Venables into the job but the chances of a third attempt  proving successful are thought unlikely, given his new commitment to Portsmouth and his pending court  cases. A bigger surprise still would be the return to Highbury of Graham, still to find a new club  since his one-year ban expired last month.  <p>  <p>The front-runners remain Cruyff, who won the European Cup with Barcelona, and Wenger, though he is  contracted to the Japanese club Nagoya Grampus Eight until November - both respected coaches with a  reputation for playing attacking football.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rioch dismissed two weeks after signing contract as Arsenal manager  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>27 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>City eye Rioch as Ball quits   </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Ross</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>English football's new season claimed another major casualty last night with the resignation of the  Manchester City manager Alan Ball. The First Division club are now expected to make a formal approach  to Bruce Rioch, who was controversially dismissed as the manager of Arsenal a fortnight ago. Ball's  brief and turbulent reign at Maine Road came to an abrupt end after an early evening meeting with his  chairman Francis Lee to discuss his future in the wake of City's disappointing start to the new  season. After being relegated from the Premiership in May with only nine victories, City have won just  one of their opening three fixtures so far. On Saturday, during and after a 2-1 defeat by Stoke City,  Ball was barracked by a large section of the City support.  <p>  <p>Although he insisted after that game that he had no intention of resigning he spent the weekend  discussing his future with his family before meeting Lee for talks.  <p>  <p>The club secretary Bernard Halford last night issued a short statement: "A meeting was held tonight  at which Mr Alan Ball tendered his resignation as manager of Manchester City football club which was  accepted. The chairman and board would like to place on record their appreciation of his endeavours  and efforts whilst in his period of office and wish him well in the future." Ball was appointed in  July of last year in succession to Brian Horton, now the manager of Huddersfield Town.  <p>  <p>Sadly for the 1996 World Cup winner, the management record of 51-year-old Ball has never matched  his progress as a player.  Only one of six clubs under his charge, Southampton, have avoided relegation. He entered League  management with Blackpool, his first club as a player, before moving on to Portsmouth, where he  enjoyed his sole promotion - to the old First Division in 1987 - before moving on to Stoke and Exeter.  Southampton, another of his former clubs, recalled him to the top flight in 1994 and at The Dell he  fought successful battles against relegation for two seasons. But last summer he could not resist a  return to the North-west and the challenge at Maine Road.  <p>  <p>Elsewhere, Neil Ruddock will shortly become Britain's most expensive defender when he leaves  Liverpool. Leeds are expected to be first in the queue to sign the England centre-back who handed in a  written transfer request on Saturday after learning he was not in the team to play Sunderland at  Anfield.  <p>  <p>Roy Evans insisted yesterday he had no great desire to sell Ruddock, but Liverpool have always  acceded to the wishes of players making written requests to leave.  <p>  <p>"I have received Neil's request and it will be considered in due course," said Evans. "He does know  that I want to keep him here but I shall look at all aspects of the situation. I can fully understand  his sense of frustration at being out of the first team at the moment but that is a problem a manager  will always face."  <p>  <p>Leeds are expected to make their move, possibly before the weekend. Liverpool will almost certainly  receive more than &#163;5m for Ruddock, who joined from Tottenham for &#163;2.6m in 1992. Rangers, Arsenal and Newcastle are also  likely to be interested.  <p>  <p>Manchester United's Nicky Butt (thigh) and Chelsea's Jody Morris (ankle) are out of the England  Under-21 squad for Saturday's game in Moldova. Leicester City's Emile Heskey (hamstring) is doubtful  and Everton's 17-year-old striker Michael Branch has been called up as cover.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Keith Harper</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A former British Rail terminal manager, Sandy Anderson, was last night set to reap a bonus of  &#163;39.9m made in only seven months from the sale of his train leasing company, in what was  described by Labour as "the biggest privatisation scandal of them all."  <p>  <p>Mr Anderson, managing director of the Porterbrook leasing company, and three directors, will become  multi-millionaires if Stagecoach, the bus and train operator, gets official clearance for its  &#163;475m bid for the company. They were immediately nicknamed 'fat cat controllers' by Labour's shadow chancellor,  Gordon Brown.  <p>  <p>During the seven-month period, Porterbrook has seen its original stake of &#163;15m increase by  more than 500 per cent to &#163;80m.  <p>  <p>With three colleagues - finance director Ray Cork, engineering director Tim Gilberts, and chairman,  Peter Watson - Mr Anderson holds 15.76 per cent of the company. Their share was valued at  &#163;74.86m, but Mr Anderson had the lion's share at 8.4 per cent.  <p>  <p>Mr Anderson started out as terminal manager for BR's container handling subsidiary, Freightliner.  He is a former director of the leasing company, TIP, for which he worked for 12 years. He was then  managing director of a trailer rental company for six years. He has been at Porterbrook for two years.  <p>  <p>Mr Anderson's other colleagues will receive lesser benefits. Mr Cork's share of the company is 3.88  per cent. He will get &#163;18.43m; Mr Gilbert's share is 2.48 per cent. He will receive &#163;11.78m;  Mr Watson's share is one per cent. His stake is valued at &#163;4.75m. When their company was set up  last November, they and the rest of the 49 staff put up &#163;15m of the &#163;75m initial equity,  with the rest financed by the merchant bank, Charterhouse, and bank debt. Porterbrook is the smallest of  the three companies which own rolling stock run by train operating companies. Its total purchase was  financed by &#163;527m of venture capital. The Government has guaranteed 80 per cent of its revenue  for eight years.  <p>  <p>City sources last night said that the pay-outs were unprecedented. But they pointed out that huge  sums have been made from selling off the public utilities.  <p>  <p>Labour called for an investigation by the Commons public accounts committee and said that further  disclosures would emerge in the aftermath of the break-up of British Rail.  The shadow chancellor said that the scale of Porterhouse's profits showed BR had been "massively  undervalued" by the Government and the managers were now cashing in at the taxpayer's expense.  <p>  <p>BR was originally valued at &#163;6.4bn, but the core of its operation, Railtrack, was eventually sold off for only &#163;1.9bn. The Department of Transport  said last night that the rise in the value of Porterbrook was a mark of the success of privatisation.  <p>  <p>Porterbrook, which leases 3,774 trains to 16 rail companies, has not ordered new rolling stock  since it was set up.  <p>  <p>Stagecoach, which entered the rail business when it took over South West Trains from BR in  February, has made it clear that it will withdraw the offer for Porterbrook if it is referred to the  Monopolies and Mergers Commission.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sandy Anderson set to reap £39.9m from the  sale of his train leasing company </b><br><br><br><b><h2>3 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Greed out of control  </h2>
  <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br><br>      <p>Sadly we have become far too accustomed to watching the gravy train of privatisation gathering  speed, but what is now happening to the railways almost beggars belief. In January, Porterbrook - one  of the three leasing companies which purchased British Rail's 11,000-strong fleet of trains - paid  &#163;527m for its share (3,774 trains) after an international, but hardly high-profile, auction had  taken place. Porterbrook almost certainly got these assets on the cheap because the whole thing was  conducted in great haste for political reasons and also because Porterbrook was sold to a company in  which the existing management and employees had 20 per cent of the shares. In itself, that's fine. We  are all in favour of encouraging employees to take a long-term stake in their companies, aren't we?  <p>  <p>Um, er... This week, seven months later, our sturdy stakeholders have agreed to sell their  company for &#163;825m, making a nice little capital gain of almost &#163;300m. This represents a 500  per cent gain of &#163;80m for the lucky punters of Porterbrook, including a &#163;39.9m bonus for its  managing director, Sandy Anderson (a former BR terminal manager) and multi-millionaire status for two of his fellow directors. Forgive  us if we sound old-fashioned, but wouldn't that unearned &#163;300m gain - more than BR usually makes  in a year - have been better employed on something more useful: like badly-needed investment in the  railways? It is not as if the new owners have performed some management magic on their trains. There  has been no new investment and 80 per cent of the revenues on which they have made such a disgraceful  profit are actually guaranteed by the taxpayer.  <p>  <p>And who are they selling out to? Why, to Stagecoach, which already has 17 per cent of the national  bus market and is hungry for expansion! Stagecoach already operates one of the big rail franchises (ie  operating a service as opposed to leasing the trains) out of Waterloo, and has put in a bid for all of  the remaining 12 unallocated franchises. Privatisation was supposed to be all about breaking the  railways up into smaller, competing units - but now Stagecoach is trying to put Humpty Dumpty together  again.  <p>  <p>A key question is why the Porterbrook franchise is suddenly worth &#163;300m more than it was seven  months ago. Either the expensively paid City bankers got their valuation wrong (in which case has the  taxpayer any redress?) or the assets are worth more to Stagecoach - because it is a brilliant spotter  of opportunities or it is in a position to exploit a growing monopolistic position. It is true that  the leasing companies have suddenly realised they can convert their debts into cheaper financial  instruments by securing them against future revenue streams (guaranteed by the taxpayer, remember), but  surely we didn't privatise in order to get the benefits of nationalisation? Also, Stagecoach told the  Financial Times it could reduce Porterbrook's spending on maintenance by up to 30 per cent. That  should go down well with passengers.  <p>  <p>What should be done now? Stagecoach's bid for Porterbrook should be referred immediately to the  Monopolies Commission to examine the major competition issues it raises. If it isn't referred, it will  be taken as a signal that it is open house for anyone who wants to recreate a cosy monopoly within  the scattered remains of the former British Rail. That is the easy bit, because the dock should really  be occupied by the Government, which rushed an unprecedentedly complicated privatisation through for  totally political motives. There was no reason to privatise BR in the first place, because most of the  improvements to efficiency could have been achieved through the regulatory regime. But once  privatisation had been decided on, BR should have been sold off in dollops, as most of the others  were. This would have maximised the return to the taxpayer, while ensuring that if there were problems  of undervaluation in some areas they wouldn't be repeated in others.  <p>  <p>Instead, the Government chose the worst possible conditions in which to maximise the price - an  enforced sale of all the assets at once against an accelerated political agenda. We will be living  with the consequences for years to come.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sandy Anderson set to reap £39.9m from the  sale of his train leasing company </b><br><br><br><b><h2>3 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Jitters galore for 'fat controllers' at Labour's windfall tax resolve  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Patrick Donovan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The tens of millions of pounds' profit made by the 'fat controllers' who sold off their former  British Rail subsidiary just seven months after privatisation will only strengthen Labour's resolve to  clamp down on the utilities. Already the front-bench Treasury team is well advanced in its plans to  levy a &#163;3bn to &#163;5bn windfall tax on former state-controlled companies. And fund managers who have met the team lately are becoming  uncomfortably aware that the levy may be far more wide-ranging than expected.  <p>  <p>Until now there has been an expectation that this windfall tax will be Labour's retribution for the  excesses of the water and electricity suppliers. It is the shares of these companies which have been  overhung from what is fast developing into pre-election jitters.  <p>  <p>But there are signs that the profit levy is to be extended to all privatised utilities, according  to City sources who have bent the ears of Mr Blair's team. Already the spectre of the tax, which was  first announced in 1993, is thought to have contributed to a 16 per cent underperformance by utilities  over the last year. Now it appears that election fears are by no means fully factored into share  prices. Ironically, the impact of any reassessment could be far less marked on the traditional victims  - the electricity and water companies.  <p>  <p>Instead, it could hit far harder companies such as British Gas and big generators National Power  and PowerGen. Given the controversy over British Rail, Railtrack has also been regarded as a target.  But sources say Labour is also running its slide rule over other transport companies, such as AB Ports  and BAA. British Telecom and even British Airways could feel the taxman's bite.  <p>  <p>Alas for the Fat Cats, it looks as though not even an accountant's sleight of hand will shelter  them from the full brunt of the windfall clampdown. This tax will be retrospective, a levy on the  bumper profits already made by utilities let loose into the private sector. In essence, they will now  have to pay through the nose for all those hundreds of thousands of job losses privatised firms  traditionally shed to drive profit growth.  <p>  <p>One of the biggest questions is how the tax will be levied. Labour has played its cards very close  to its chest. But the City increasingly believes Labour will take the view that share price is the  best measure and will be likely to weight the tax on market capitalisation. Hence the costs are likely  to fall much more heavily on the largest utilities rather than the smaller electricity and  water-distribution companies. The picture is further confused because so many of these have already  been swallowed up in takeovers or have doled back hefty lumps of cash to investors in the form of  special dividends. Other unresolved issues include the debate over whether companies which have given  rebates to customers should be treated more leniently.  <p>  <p>Even using a rough rule of thumb, it would seem that if Labour seriously wishes to raise &#163;5bn  by levying a tax on a market capitalisation basis, BT will be hardest hit, with a potential bill of  more than &#163;1.3bn. Next down the line is British Gas, with a possible &#163;500m bill. National Power comes in at just under &#163;370m and  BAA at nearly &#163;300m. Other companies facing a big knock will be PowerGen, Scottish Power and  National Grid.  <p>  <p>On this basis, a number of the water and electricity companies that have scandalised public opinion  by paying such over-inflated directors' salaries and share options will remain relatively unscathed.  Unfair, perhaps. But it seems the best way forward if Labour actually wants to achieve its goal of  injecting &#163;1bn back into employment and training schemes in its first year of office.  Sandy Anderson, the former British Rail terminal manager who trousered nearly &#163;40m this week  from his rail sale could well be the last of the privatisation 'fat cats'.  Big utilities will undoubtedly be hard hit by the increasingly pre-election jitters.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Johnson becomes the first man to win Olympic gold in both the  200m and 400m </b><br><br><br><b><h2>2 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Olympics: The  world bows to Johnson's double  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stephen Bierley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>They came. They saw. He conquered. Michael Johnson not only won the 200m in Atlanta last night to  complete an historic Olympic double with his 400m title; he also shattered his own world record of  19.66sec with a startling time of 19.32sec.  <p>  <p>Namibia's Frankie Fredericks, silver medallist in the 100m, had been thought of as a threat, having  beaten Johnson at Bislett last month, but he came nowhere near. Fredericks was second again but some  four metres behind in 19.68sec. Trinidad's Ato Bolden was third in 19.80sec.  <p>  <p>Marie-Jose Perec, the darling of the French, pre-empted Johnson's feat, becoming only the second  woman to achieve the double, after the American Valerie Brisco-Hooks 12 years ago. For two-thirds of  the race it seemed that Jamaica's Merlene Ottey might finally win an Olympic gold medal but Perec,  finishing superbly, was ultimately an easy winner.  <p>  <p>The United States maintained its tradition in the men's 400m hurdles with the gold going to the  world champion Derrick Adkins. Zambia's Samuel Matete, the silver medal winner in Gothenburg last  year, again came second. Kelly Holmes may be suffering from a hairline fracture of her left leg but  her chances of winning a 1500m Olympic medal to add to her world championship silver last year appear  to be increasing every time she runs. Yesterday she won her heat in 4min 5.88sec, conserving her  energies in the earlier part of the race and then positioning herself perfectly for the drive to the  line. And her hopes of a medal appeared to be considerably improved when Hassiba Boulmerka of Algeria,  the reigning champion, went out in the opening heat.  <p>  <p>Boulmerka had just gone through the bell when she stumbled and veered out sharply to the right. She  was unable immediately to negotiate the bend and completely lost touch with the other 11 runners. Her  chances of qualifying were gone - there always remained the possibility of a protest, but her coach  did not sound optimistic.  <p>  <p>Holmes's heat was not without its incident either. The British champion managed to stay out of  trouble when Kenya's Naomi Mugo went crashing to the track. Mugo was reinstated and the Romanian  Catalina Gheoghiu disqualified. Previously Ireland's Sonia O'Sullivan had dropped out in the heats  while Maria Mutola of Mozambique did not enter the event because of illness. Both had been among the  favourites for a medal. Immediately after the semi-final Holmes went straight off to have her ankle  put in ice.  <p>  <p>Earlier in the week, after the second round, she revealed she had a hairline crack just above her  left ankle. She now needs pain-killing injections before racing but has stated her absolute  determination to continue, no matter what the damage.  <p>  <p>In the men's 1500m final in Seoul Peter Elliott won the silver medal while suffering from a groin  injury. Elliott had a pain killing injection and after the Olympics had to spend two months in bed and  experienced long-term damage. Noureddine Morceli, the overwhelming favourite to win the men's 1500m  title tomorrow, the same day as the women's final, easily won his semi-final heat, accelerating from  third place just before the final bend and leaving everyone for dead.  <p>  <p>Morceli finished a thoroughly disappointing seventh in Barcelona four years ago but has dominated  the event ever since. His winning time yesterday was 3.32.88. The rising Moroccan Hicham El Garroudj  looked a distinct threat with an impressive victory in the other semi-final. Britain's John Mayock,  seventh in Morceli's heat in 3.34.55, qualified as a fastest loser.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Frank Keating</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A year before I was born there was Jesse-Owens-at-Berlin. For obvious and retold reasons that  hyphenated resonance of man and place will be twined and twinned in the log for ever. In my lifetime,  Blankers-Koen and London go together, and so do Zatopek and Helsinki in 1952. Spitz equals Munich, and  Daley-Coe-Ovett certainly go with Moscow like a horse and carriage. There was LA and Carl Lewis, and  Ben Johnson, notoriously, at Seoul. Another Johnson is garlanded with sport's laurel wreath in 1996.  Ever remembered. The upright, sober-sided Texan has taken Georgia by storm. Victor ludorum, and a  phenomenal one at that.  <p>  <p>A man's gotta do... and he did just that. And that is the word. It is not the over-used one,  'great'; the word is 'phenomenal'. In italics, and underlined to boot.  <p>  <p>Consider first, that Johnson laid to waste in his laid-back manner in this 200m such fancied  dandies as Frankie Fredericks and Ato Boldon in shattering his own world record with an astounding  19.32sec. And that, had Johnson entered the 100m, he would more than likely on Saturday have slapped  the world-record winner Donovan Bailey into second place.  <p>  <p>The first man to win gold medals in both the 200m and 400m at the same Games was to attempt to add  another in the 4x400m relay but yesterday withdrew with a hamstring injury. He had won 54 races on the  trot in the 400m and had never lost an outdoor final at that distance. Before a minor glitch last  month he had reeled off 21 consecutive victories in the 200m and has been ranked No 1 in the world at  both events for four years, unprecedented. He was world champion in each event singly - the 200m at  Tokyo five years ago and the 400m at Stuttgart in 1993 - and won them both in Sweden last year. There  was a nice tribute from Derek Mills, the world's third-ranked 400m runner: "I keep trying to remember  that Michael is just a man." A friend, arriving back from the stadium on Thursday, genuinely elated,  said much the same. "I'm going to frame that night and that performance. I'm going to hang it on a  wall at home, or better still try and sell it to an art gallery or museum."  <p>  <p>Johnson afterwards actually bothered to smile. "The world record is a bonus," he said. "The most  important thing to me was making history. A lot of people hold a world record, and I did too before I  arrived here. But nobody else can say they made history, the first man to win the 200 and 400. I told  myself before I got in the blocks that this was the one I wanted. I didn't make it in Barcelona  because of food poisoning and I have been four years since just looking for this one.  <p>  <p>"I stumbled - did you notice? - around my fourth step from the blocks, but then I got into gear  pretty fast. By a dozen strides or so I was just relaxed. I sat back in the armchair. I was feeling  good and honestly felt I couldn't go any faster than I was already going. After about 80-90 metres, I  felt totally in control and at that point I just went to my endurance and gave it all I had. I knew  the time was faster than 19.66 but I didn't know how fast. To run 19.32 is unbelievable.  <p>  <p>"If you want an analogy of the incredible thrill I felt, well, go out and get a go-kart, find a  hill, a very steep one, and let it go, and you'll know how it feels. Pretty good, eh?  <p>  <p>"After winning the 400 I was under a lot of pressure to do the double but this is how I perform  when I am under that kind of pressure." Boldon won his second bronze medal of the Games. He shook his  head in genuine awe. "I had always thought the man who wins the hundred is the fastest man alive. Not  any more. Michael is the fastest human now with all respect to my friend Bailey. Phenomenon is the  only word for it." Quite so. Before the race Jesse Owens's wife Ruth sent a fax to Johnson simply  saying "Michael - deliver". He did. With knobs on. Just like Jesse Owens had that day when Adolf  Hitler petulantly walked out on him in Berlin a lifetime ago in 1936.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jews fight for the return of funds looted by the Nazis and kept in Swiss bank accounts   </b><br><br><br><b><h2>2 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Jews fight for return of looted Nazi gold taken  in by Swiss  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Walker</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>These days, 100 tons of pure gold is worth more than $1bn, or a cool &#163;650m. It depends on the  price set each day at the Zurich gold market. And the Swiss ought to know.  <p>  <p>They took in 100 tons of gold from Nazi Germany in 1943 alone, knowing perfectly well that it was  stolen. It came mostly from the vaults of conquered banks, and some of it was ripped from the teeth of  the dead in the concentration camps.  <p>  <p>In the course of the second world war, the Swiss banks took in some 360 tons of Nazi gold.  That is one stunning fact from a cascade of documents which has been declassified from the US  National Archives over the past two months. Because of these papers, much of the conventional history  of the second world war and its aftermath will have to be rewritten.  <p>  <p>From the central banks and commercial banks and art galleries and jewellers' shops across Europe,  from the safe deposit boxes and from the estates of the doomed Jews, the Nazis pillaged the wealth of  the continent. They then sent it to the Swiss - for laundering, for converting into foreign  investments and purchases and for safe keeping. Enough of the money stuck to become, for the Swiss, an  extraordinary financial bonanza.  <p>  <p>The total sum of German plunder that went through Switzerland was greater than the country's annual  GDP.  <p>  <p>On 1 April 1945, as Adolf Hitler took to the Berlin bunker that became his grave and the Reich  crumbled around him: "The Swiss agreed with the Germans to accept another 3,000 kilos of gold for use  against 'diplomatic services', according to Aubouin, general manager of BIS."  <p>  <p>BIS was, and still is, the Bank of International Settlements. Three thousand kilos is worth about  $36m. That quote comes from a telegram sent direct to the US secretary of state in Washington from the American legation in Berne. More  than 51 years after it was sent, the telegram was finally declassified by the Americans in April of  this year. The legation, run by Allen Dulles, the legendary future boss of the Central Intelligence  Agency, was the main centre of American espionage in Europe. One of its main jobs was to track the  economic sinews of the Nazi state, which to an extraordinary degree, meant its use of the Swiss  banking system. Immediately after its declassification, a photocopy of that same cable was pushed  across a table at the offices of the Swiss Bankers' Association in Berne by a tall, slim man with  piercing blue eyes, and a rakish fondness for wearing panama hats.  <p>  <p>His name is Israel Singer. As secretary general of the World Jewish Congress (WJC) he proceeded to  tell the assembled Swiss bankers what he intended to do to them, unless they came clean about the way  their predecessors had handled the Nazi loot.  <p>  <p>Beside him sat Edgar Bronfman, the heir to the vast Seagram fortune, new owner of the MCA-Universal  studio, but also chairman of the WJC. Bronfman was determined to get some money to the impoverished  remaining Jews of eastern Europe while they were alive to enjoy it.  <p>  <p>Singer and Bronfman were quietly furious. Ever since 1945, the Swiss had a way of brushing aside  inquiries, and in particular, to fending off the heirs of Jewish customers.  <p>  <p>In 1946, to get their assets in the US and Britain unfrozen, the Swiss paid 250 million Swiss  francs. At roughly $60m, it was a modest enough price to get the victorious allies off their backs.  <p>  <p>In 1962, the Swiss had announced they had found 961 accounts which had belonged to Jewish clients,  containing a total of 7.5 million Swiss francs. This was returned, along with a 2m franc  donation to Swiss Jewish communities.  <p>  <p>In 1988, in response to another wave of pressure, the Union Bank announced a $40m donation to the  International Red Cross, that totem of Swiss neutrality, notable for its failure to speak out against the Holocaust.  <p>  <p>"It was a gift from those who did not own, to those who did not deserve it," said Singer.  <p>  <p>In February, the Swiss came up with another unilateral payment, of $31.9m, to fend off the latest  campaign from Bronfman and Singer. This time, the Swiss underestimated the competition.  <p>  <p>Bronfman went to the White House, and got President Clinton's public show of support. Then he and  Singer went to New York Republican Senator Alfonse d'Amato, chairman of the Senate banking committee,  who promised to hold public hearings into the Swiss loot.  <p>  <p>Then with more political pressure, the comptroller of the city of New York, who influences some  $30bn in pension funds, wrote to the Swiss Bankers' Association to suggest their reputation as a fit  and proper place for international funds was in question.  <p>  <p>Discreetly, the Swiss were told through diplomatic channels that the Clinton administration was  prepared to smile on any private law suits brought against their banks in US courts.  <p>  <p>Then, as Senator d'Amato scheduled his hearings, Elan Steinberg of the World Jewish Congress in New  York reported that his team of researchers had hit gold in the National Archives. They had come across  the files of something called Operation Safehaven, the Allied probe into the fate of the Nazi loot.  "Just when I thought the money and the numbers were too big to believe, we came across something else,  even more incredible, like the name of Adolf Hitler's Swiss estate agent," Elan Steinberg told the  Guardian. "The scope of all this was beyond belief."  <p>  <p>There was so much material, more than 100,000 files, that he called in extra researchers from the  Holocaust museum. It went far beyond the laundered gold, and even beyond the $600m in 1945 dollars  that US intelligence reckoned that the Germans had stashed away in Switzerland. There was evidence that the  Swiss had allowed the Nazis to use the diplomatic pouch of the International Red Cross, and that the  Swiss had helped launder securities stolen from the vaults of the British-owned Westminster bank in  Paris.  <p>  <p>Above all, there was the first real evidence, in a French Deuxieme Bureau intelligence report that  came from the files of General Eisenhower's HQ, that one of the great legends of the war had been  real.  <p>  <p>At the source of countless novels and several films, from 'The Odessa File' to 'The Boys from Brazil',  lies the claim that there had been a secret plot to arrange the funding and secure the rebirth of  Nazism after Hitler's defeat. There it was, including the names of the executives from Krupp,  Rheinmetall, Brown-Boveri, Messerschmitt, Volswagenwerk, and SS Obergruppenfuhrer General Doktor  Scheid. The meeting took place at the Hotel Rotes Haus in Strasbourg on 10 August 1944.  <p>  <p>"From now on, German industry must realise that the war cannot be won and it must take steps in  preparation for a post-war commercial campaign," General Scheid began.  <p>  <p>"Existing financial reserves in foreign countries must be placed at the disposal of the (Nazi)  party so that a strong German Empire can be created after the defeat."  <p>  <p>These were the documents packed into Israel Singer's briefcase as he confronted the Swiss bankers.  Most of them were still stamped 'secret'. One by one, he laid them on the table.  <p>  <p>One of his favourites came from a debriefing by US intelligence agents of Dr Landwehr, who during  the war had been director of the foreign exchange department of the Reich economics ministry. By 1946,  he was living in the Soviet sector of Berlin, working for the Berlin city government. The report says:  "Dr Landwehr estimates that all in all, the sum of German assets which passed into Switzerland  amounted to at least 15bn Reichsmarks. Landwehr dismissed with an ironic smile the Swiss  estimate of 1bn Reichmarks. I could not conceal my astonishment and asked him to explain this amount."  <p>  <p>Dr Landwehr proceeded to spell out the way in which this had been done, from direct sales of gold,  through more complex ways to get around the neutrality rules. His conclusion was clear: "Whereas all  the neutral countries, out of consideration to their laws of neutrality, had refused to accept gold  ('Goldbestanden') from the Reichsbank, Switzerland carried on gold transactions with the Reichsbank  until the beginning of 1945." Then Israel Singer laid down his trump card, a series of cable  intercepts. The cables had been sent from Credit Suisse and the Swiss Banking Corporation to banks in  Madrid, Lisbon, Shanghai, Stockholm, Istanbul and Tokyo.  <p>  <p>The cables had all been sent in the course of 1944. They were proof not only that the Swiss banks  were breaking the rules for neutrals laid down by the US and British authorities. They were also  breaking the Swiss government's own code of conduct for banking in wartime.  <p>  <p>This meant they could expect no legal protection even in Switzerland. Moreover, while every other  piece of evidence from British and US intelligence could be dismissed as hearsay by the lawyers, the  cable intercepts were hard proof.  <p>  <p>The two biggest banks in Switzerland were acting as a gigantic money laundering operation, for  funds from banks in Hungary and Romania and other parts of Europe occupied by the Germans, and acting  as the Nazis' international bankers.  <p>  <p>At that point, the Swiss caved in. For the first time, they agreed to grant outside researchers  "unfettered access" to their account books and files, and to establish a joint commission with the WJC  to track down and restore the Jewish funds.  <p>  <p>But beyond that basic and belated justice, there is a deeper accounting to be made. The evidence  from Operation Safehaven suggests that something of the order of 15bn Reichmarks was banked, invested,  moved and laundered through Swiss banks. That was the equivalent of three per cent of the America's GDP in 1944.  To put this into today's terms, three per cent of America's GDP is $200bn, which is more than the entire  GDP of Switzerland. Allow for interest, compounded over 50 years, and the value of that Nazi loot that  went through Switzerland moves into the region of a trillion dollars.  <p>  <p>The immediate questions concern the whereabouts of the money, and how much of it can the World  Jewish Council legitimately demand on behalf of the heirs of Europe's slaughtered Jews.  <p>  <p>There are two further nagging questions. How did the Swiss manage to keep the scale of their  co-operation quiet for so long? And why did Britain and the US let them get away with it?  <p>  <p>The treasure trove of National Archive documents comes almost wholly from Allied sources, from  intelligence and diplomatic reports, and from the well-informed but little known intelligence arm of  the US Treasury. In June 1941, five months before the US entered the war, Treasury Secretary Henry  Morgenthau had sent a covert team of Treasury agents into the offices of the main Swiss banks in New  York, and obtained a full list of their clients and all their holdings, cash and securities. It is  five inches thick.  <p>  <p>The Allies knew how long, and how closely, and how lucratively, the Swiss had worked with the  Nazis. Even when the British and Americans settled in 1946 for the 250 million Swiss francs in  compensation, they knew the real sums involved were 50 to a 100 times greater.  <p>  <p>"It's just speculation, but there was a vast American slush fund created in Europe at this time to  start waging the cold war, the money to swing the Italian elections, to stop the Communists in Western  Europe," said Mr Steinberg. "Maybe that was the deal, that the Swiss paid out some of the Jews' money  to fight the cold war. Who knows? But that money went somewhere. And a lot of it belongs to Jewish  people. And we are going to get it back."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Ulster's favourite cry of 'No Surrender!' will echo from the walled city of Derry this coming  weekend across centuries of bloody history and Northern Ireland when the apprentice boys celebrate  Ireland's most famous victory of Protestantism over Catholicism.  <p>  <p>It was the apprentice boys who coined the perennial phrase when they slammed shut the gates of the  City of Derry against the approaching forces of James, Catholic pretender to the English throne, in  December 1688.  <p>  <p>After an 11-month siege the apprentice boys were finally relieved by Mountjoy in August the  following year. At Derry, Aughrim and the Boyne, the Jacobites were routed by William of Orange.  <p>  <p>To this day, Ulster Protestants celebrate it as a victory for religious liberty and the defeat of  popery (while ironists prefer to recall that the Pope supported William against James, who was the  ally of Rome's enemy France). 'No Surrender!' drops like a freshly-minted coin from the mouths of  every new generation of Unionist leaders.  <p>  <p>At Drumcree last month, when Orangemen faced riot police and Army troops across barbed wire and  Northern Ireland threatened to topple once more down the dark funnel of violence, it was the  expression most on the lips of militant Protestants intent on upholding their cultural right to parade  down a predominantly Catholic road in the Loyalist citadel of Portadown. But Derry - or Londonderry as  it is officially called - is different these days. The majority Catholic population has held the reins  of power in the Maiden City for a generation and the Protestants have mostly moved out, across the  River Foyle to the east bank of the Waterside.  <p>  <p>In 1969 it was the apprentice boys' annual parade along the walls of the city which precipitated  the arrival of British troops in Northern Ireland's streets as civil law and order began to crumble.  The serious rioting which erupted in Derry's Bogside spread like a bushfire to Belfast. Last year, for  the first time since 1969, the apprentice boys were allowed back on to the walls. There was more  violent opposition, but nothing on the scale of a quarter of a century earlier. And the ceasefires  were holding. In 1996 Northern Ireland looks back with sadness and nostalgia on its year of peace and  forward to the coming weekend with more fear that confrontation between Nationalists and Unionists in  Derry could once again ignite the fuse of sectarian violence.  <p>  <p>In the aftermath of Drumcree there is a vicious spirit set loose, with churches and Orange halls,  Protestant and Catholic businesses and homes the targets of attack from 'The Other Sort'. The kernel  of hope is that, unlike at Drumcree, the two local groups at loggerheads over the route of the march  are at least negotiating with one another. They have set a deadline of Wednesday however, and the  ground between them is still very wide. On one side stands the apprentice boys' Club, the smallest of  three 'loyal orders' (the others being the Orange and the Royal Black Institutions) with an estimated  12,000 members. While independent, many of its members are also Orangemen.  <p>  <p>The main purpose of the organisation is to hold parades to commemorate the two principal events of  the Siege of Derry, as they have done since the late 17th century.  <p>  <p>The heart of the organisation is the eight Parent Clubs, six of which are named after leaders of  the siege: Baker, Browning, Campsie, Mitchelburne, Murray and Walker, the other two being the  apprentice boys of Derry Club and the No Surrender Club. Between them they have a membership of up to  500 men, but there are a further 200 branch clubs across Northern Ireland, Scotland, England, the  Irish republic and Canada.  <p>  <p>While most apprentice boys live outside Derry the organisation's structure means that all decisions  taken on their behalf are made by those members living in the city.  <p>  <p>The other side is represented by the Bogside Residents Group, which does not want the apprentice  boys to parade along that section of the city's walls which overlooks their district lest the  exclusively Protestant organisation gives offence.  <p>  <p>Unless the two sides can resolve their differences and arrive at a reasonable compromise by  Wednesday Northern Ireland will be back at Drumcree, so to speak. The optimists are swearing until  they are blue in the face that, after peering over the brink last month, the divided people of  Northern Ireland have the common sense to pull back.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Owen Bowcott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Protestant apprentice boys planning to parade through a Catholic flashpoint in south Belfast next  weekend were yesterday re-routed by the police in an attempt to forestall violence 70 miles away in  Londonderry.  <p>  <p>The Royal Ulster Constabulary ban was being presented as an attempt to ease sectarian tensions and  help broker a deal between loyalist marchers and nationalist residents across the province.  <p>  <p>But community talks broke up without resolution in Londonderry last night where 10,000 apprentic  boys and 180 bands are planning to walk the length of the fortified walls on Saturday for the  traditional commemoration of the city's 11-month resistance to King James' besieging forces in 1689.  Catholic residents in the Bogside object to the parade which, they claim, is provocative. Mediators  hope there will be a compromise, avoiding the outbreak of widespread rioting which accompanied the  four-day stand-off before the Orange Order parade at Drumcree, near Portadown, last month. Talks are  due to reconvene today.  <p>  <p>But the police decision to re-route the apprentice boys' feeder parade, which passes through the  Lower Ormeau Road in south Belfast before marchers are bussed to Londonderry, infuriated loyalists in  Belfast.  <p>  <p>Sandy Geddis, of the apprentice boys' Walker Club, said: "It's a deplorable decision made in the  face of threats of violence. We've walked that road for over 90 years and there has never been  trouble. We've done everything to make sure it was not triumphalist."  <p>  <p>Ian Paisley junior, of the Democratic Unionist Party, warned that the move could jeopardise the  talks. "This move by the RUC will fail to achieve a peaceful settlement to the dispute," he said.  <p>  <p>The RUC had been under pressure to prevent the Belfast parade passing down the Lower Ormeau Road  following the RUC's decision to impose a virtual curfew on the area on 12 July when local residents  were forced to stay indoors until an Orange Order parade had gone by.  <p>  <p>Assistant Chief Constable Bill Stewart said: "Anything which can be done to remove any possibility  of confrontation should be grasped. We hope the re-routing will be accepted by everyone concerned."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>RUC decision to reroute apprentice boys' parade angers loyalists  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>8 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Coming to the relief of Derry</h2>
<h3>  The Government had a duty to prevent Saturday's march  </h3>  <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br><br>      <p>The Government has acted rightly and bravely by effectively banning Saturday's apprentice boys'  march in Derry. The march organisers and the residents who had opposed their plans have had many  chances to reach a compromise. But they failed yet again yesterday, giving the impression that wider  issues were increasingly being dragged into their discussions. The danger of a drift into possibly the  most serious disorders of the year - and the appalling wider consequences that might follow - was  palpable and unacceptable.  <p>  <p>A lawful state has an overwhelming responsibility to maintain civil order in such circumstances.  Laws exist - in Britain as well as in Northern Ireland - to impose bans on marches, and the British  government would have been wrong not to have acted after the breakdown of the local talks. Its lawful  and necessary actions should now be supported and obeyed by march organisers and their followers. No  one on the nationalist side should engage in triumphalism or any other form of provocation. The  security forces should enforce the ban with absolute scrupulousness. There must be no backing-down, as  there was at Drumcree.  <p>  <p>But the banning of the apprentice boys' march should not create a precedent. The need for this ban  related specifically to these marches at this dangerous time. The North Committee is now investigating  the conduct of future marches and rallies in Northern Ireland and will report early in 1997. That will  be the basis on which future arguments can be settled. But that is then, and this is now. It was in  the paramount interests of all the people of these islands that peace was maintained - if possible by  agreement, if necessary by the civil power - in Derry this weekend. The Government has done its duty.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>RUC decision to reroute apprentice boys' parade angers loyalists  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Ulster rally to go ahead risking new flashpoint   </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A nationalist rally in Londonderry on the eve of a contentious loyalist parade will go ahead  tonight in spite of calls from Catholic community and religious leaders to abandon it.  <p>  <p>The parade decision, taken by the Bogside Residents Group which has failed to reach agreement with  apprentice boys over their desire to walk a circuit of the walls of Londonderry, has raised the  political temperature further in Northern Ireland, which seems poised once more on the brink of  widespread unrest.  <p>  <p>Bogside spokesman Donncha MacNiallais said that tonight's rally was about "equality and respect for  unionist and nationalist rights". Demonstrators would be asked to return on Saturday to Free Derry  Corner in the Bogside, at the height of the apprentice boys rally in the city centre, when more than  10,000 loyalists will be in Londonderry. Troops will seal off a section of the city wall where the  apprentice boys had hoped to march.  <p>  <p>"Our rally will go ahead quite simply because we have a leadership role to play in all of this and  we want people to act responsibly in a peaceful manner," said Mr MacNiallais.  <p>  <p>But he added that he would meet church leaders and listen to their objections and - if need be -  cancel it and the follow-up demonstration. The rally's route will pass by the apprentice boys' hall as  loyalists take part in eve-of-march celebrations.  <p>  <p>A few hours before the residents' announcement, RUC sources said there was no justification for the  nationalist parade. "I think the apprentice boys have an extremely good case. This is open territory  and there is a very good case for a local agreement," said one source.  <p>  <p>"There is every reason to believe that the apprentice boys do not want violence. If there is an  attempt to provoke the marchers then that could lead to serious disorder."  <p>  <p>The source added that residents groups involved in the parades issue had a significant Sinn Fein  influence on them. "There is little doubt that there is paramilitary manipulation of residents groups  and it's a specific ploy. The Provisional IRA will continue to milk the current situation. They have,  in their eyes, the high ground and are therefore unlikely to go back to war in Northern Ireland while  that is going on.  They will undoubtedly attempt to launch more attacks on the British mainland but will continue  here to milk the public order position politically."  <p>  <p>Mr MacNiallais insisted that the residents' groups were not being manipulated.  <p>  <p>As tension mounted last night, the SDLP leader, John Hume, said everybody had a duty to put the  city first and not to engage in the kind of violence seen during the Drumcree crisis.  <p>  <p>Mr Hume agreed that Protestants were feeling marginalised and appealed for the anger to be  channelled in a peaceful, constructive fashion. And he called on nationalists to show tolerance.  <p>  <p>The former SDLP mayor of the city, John Kerr, said there was no great sense of victory,  triumphalism or exhilaration within the Bogside at the troops sealing off a quarter of a mile of the  city wall overlooking their community.  <p>  <p>In the first sign that tomorrow's parade could lead to a repeat of the disorder which brought  Northern Ireland to a standstill last month, a group calling itself the Loyal Women of Ulster blocked  off the centre of Lisburn, Co Antrim, for part of yesterday afternoon.  <p>  <p>The Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, met leaders of the apprentice boys at Stormont.  The meeting lasted for more than an hour and afterwards, Gregory Campbell of the Democratic Unionists,  said that Sir Patrick candidly admitted his decision to seal off the wall was unjust.   <p>  <p><b>Protestant: "I have more thought in my little finger than his whole body"</b>   <p>  <p>Alistair Simpson is, at 57, perhaps a little on the mature side to be described as a boy. But as  Governor of the apprentice boys of Derry, he finds himself at the centre of this weekend's events.  <p>  <p>He was born across the River Foyle in the Waterside but, against the tide of demographic change  which has seen 15,000 Protestants desert the cityside of Londonderry for the east bank, he has lived  in the loyalist Fountain estate for more than 30 years.  <p>  <p>The Fountain is Derry's last Protestant enclave on the west bank, where fewer than 1,000 people  remain in poor housing and with high unemployment. Mr Simpson has impressed senior police officers who  say the apprentice boys is a well-led organisation. His preparedness to meet and negotiate with  convicted IRA members over the parades issue is in contrast to Orange leaders in Portadown who refused  to meet a Garvaghy Road residents' group over their Drumcree route.  <p>  <p>But although he and Donncha MacNiallais live less than a mile apart, divided by the disputed  stretch of wall, there is little love lost between them. "I have more thought in my little finger and  more feeling for the people of this area, for the people of the Bogside, and for the people of the  whole city and for the business of the whole city than MacNiallais has in his whole body," Mr Simpson  said.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Resident: "I am a Sinn Fein member, but the issue is bigger than me"</b>   <p>  <p>Donncha MacNiallais got lost on the city walls of Londonderry when he was three years old, ending  up in the police barracks until his parents retrieved him.  <p>  <p>Today, as the main spokesman of the Bogside Residents' Group, which is locked in conflict with the  apprentice boys over this weekend's parade along the same walls, Mr MacNiallais looks as if he knows  exactly where he is going.  <p>  <p>Born and bred in the Bogside, his family started the first tenant association in 1967. His mother  Mary Nelis is a prominent Sinn Fein councillor on the city council and he, too, is a party member.  Like his Ormeau Garvaghy Road counterparts, he has been accused of hijacking a community issue for  political motives. Like them, he has served time in the IRA wing of the Maze prison. In 1976 he was  found guilty of possession of a Magnum handgun and served 16 years. During the dirty protests of the  late 1970s and early 1980s he lost four years remission for sticking to his republican ideals.  <p>  <p>"I am a republican and a member of Sinn Fein, but the issue is bigger than me," he says.  <p>  <p>He was elected spokesman for the Bogside Residents Group at a public meeting held last year to  establish the organisation. Local sources say the meeting was not advertised and that only 15 people  took part in the election of its eight-member executive.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stuart  Millar</b><br><br>      <p> <p>It was billed as the most generous gift to Oxford University in 50 years.  But a &#163;20m donation by Wafic Said, a Saudi entrepreneur, to build a  management school has caused a bitter row. <p> <p>Employees yesterday presented a  petition signed by more than 1,000 colleagues to university leaders in an attempt  to stop the school being built on a sports ground used by the staff club. <p>  <p>The ground, in the centre of the city, is used mainly by non-academic and  technical staff who do not have access to college facilities. They say the Said  Business School - with outdoor amphitheatre and a landscaped garden - could  damage relations between the university and non-academic staff. <p> <p>At an  emergency meeting, more than 100 club members rejected a proposal from the  co-chairmen - both dons - to back the development plan. <p> <p>Mike Woodin, a  psychology tutor at Balliol College and a local Green party councillor, said  yesterday: "There is a lot more at stake here than a planning application. This  goes to the very heart of what the university is all about." <p> <p>Staff have  questioned the ethical implications of accepting the donation from Mr Said. A  Commons committee of inquiry was told that the Syrian-born businessman was the  agent for British Aerospace responsible for the Al-Yamamah defence deal with  Saudi Arabia, although he denies he is an arms dealer. <p> <p>The sports ground  was sold to the university by Merton College in the 1960s, when the university's  vice chancellor promised there would be no development without the college's  agreement. But Mr Said, who is understood to give to the Tory party, has insisted  on the central site. He rejected plans to use the donation to extend the existing  business school at Templeton College on the outskirts of the city. <p> <p>The  university has rejected alternative sites, including car parks, as impractical or  too low in profile. It maintains the sports ground, near Mansfield College, is  "ideal for such a world class building". The plan has enraged local residents and  has been greeted by strong cross-party opposition on the council, according to Mr  Woodin. A poll of neighbours found around 70 per cent against. He said: "I don't  think the council will back it, but it's what happens when the appeal goes to the  Department of the Environment that worries me. I am afraid there will be  political as well as planning considerations." <p> <p>No formal planning  application will be submitted until the university - which must raise matching  funds - puts the plans to Congregation, its parliament, in November. <p> <p>Stef  Spencer, chairwoman of the council's planning committee, said: "We will judge any  application on it merits. But on our local plan, the sports ground is shown as an  important recreational site." <p> <p>She said councillors had been dismayed by  the way some in the university had presented the development as a fait accompli.  "There is a feeling that some people, because of their own perceptions of their  importance, believe there can be exceptions to the rules." <p> <p>A university  spokesman said yesterday that it respected the views of local residents and of  staff who use the sports facilities, and was keen for full consultation. <p> <p>  <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Doctors reveal a selective  abortion has been carried out on a woman carrying twins </b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>On the  edges of ethics</h2><h3>One tragic case doesn't mean the law is wrong  </h2>
<br><b>Leading article</b>  <br><br><br>      <p>A woman, sixteen weeks pregnant, has decided she cannot afford twins and is to have one aborted, it  was reported at the weekend. Since it is a confidential matter, there are few other details available.  Not that that will stop the passionate lobbies which dominate the abortion debate from pronouncing on  the case. To the pro-choice lobby, this woman has an absolute right over her body and its reproductive  processes until the legal time limit of 24 weeks. To the pro-life lobby, this case illustrates the  barbarity of a culture where potential lives are viewed as little different from commodities to be  disposed of at will.  <p>  <p>But how representative of the mass of opinion are these vocal spokespeople with their clear-cut  certainties? For many in the middle, strongly committed to legal abortion, the case triggers an  emotional response and uncomfortable dilemmas. Freshly sensitive to the debate after the prolonged  publicity over the frozen embryos destroyed last week, people who would be opposed to a change in the  current law find the idea of destroying one feotus while leaving the other to live inexplicably  repugnant.  <p>  <p>Often apologetic for what they describe as irrational, they can find no principle to explain or  legitimise their unease. They accept the arguments of the leading member of the British Medical  Association, Dr Vivienne Nathanson, who told the Guardian yesterday that there was no new ethical  issue in this case.  <p>  <p>Dr Nathanson is right. There is nothing to make this different from any other abortion of a 16  week-old foetus; aborting a twin is no different from aborting a child's sibling, ethically. So why  the unease? This case is believed to be the first time a selective termination will be performed on an  embryo which has not been produced by in-vitro fertilisation where both foetuses are healthy. As Dr  Nathanson acknowledged, the case is on "the edges" of normal practice. A doctor has to make a cruel,  difficult decision as to which foetus dies and which foetus lives. He knows their sexes and may have  told the mother - does the mother then choose?  <p>  <p>It appears that the obstetrician in this case, Professor Phillip Bennett of Queen Charlotte's  Hospital, London, was given a choice by the patient: either abort one foetus or both. He justified his  very difficult decision: "It would be better to terminate one pregnancy as soon as possible and leave  one alive than to lose two babies." Both options are entirely legal. Doctors are faced with  appallingly difficult ethical dilemmas and as Professor Bennett made clear in a lengthy interview at  the weekend, they cannot look to the law for guidance.  <p>  <p>The bare outlines of this case leave a host of haunting, unanswerable questions. Chief of these is  what the surviving twin is to make of this crucial transition point on its way into the world. His/her  life was at the cost of a potential sibling's. There was a crucial period of time in which his/her  mother and a doctor may have hovered over the possibility of aborting him/her and leaving the other to  live.  <p>  <p>The only explanation we have is that the woman is reported as saying she couldn't cope with having  two more children. Abortion is always a difficult and painful act for those concerned: as a single  mother in "socially straitened circumstances" who already has one child, she clearly believes she  cannot call on support, either financial or emotional, in our fragmented, individualistic culture. It  is this dimension of the story that should really concern us, rather than letting one tragic case be  used as an argument for re-examining the existing law.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Doctors reveal a selective abortion has been carried out on a  woman carrying twins </b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>What do you think about the woman carrying twins who wants to abort one of them?</h2><h3>  Here, a birth control expert, a twin expecting twins and a twin whose other half died at birth express their own opinions   </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Lucy Manning</b><br><br><br>      <p>  <p><b>The expert</b>  <p>  <p>Ann Furedi is director of the Birth Control Trust.  <p>  <p>There is a lot of high moral posturing about the rights and wrongs of this issue. It is important  to remember that no woman undertakes an abortion lightly, particularly in these circumstances. The  fact that this woman knows a termination may threaten the entire pregnancy means it is a serious  decision and reflects the strength of feeling she has about how intolerable it would be to have twins.  <p>  <p>This decision can be seen in a positive light; she is giving one foetus the potential of life  rather than ending the pregnancy entirely. If she had done that, it would have been an uncontroversial  issue.  <p>  <p>People talk about the effect on this woman's future mental health if she wonders about the baby who  was not born. However, you have to consider her mental health if she were forced to carry on with the  pregnancy. The twin argument does not really figure. The baby will simply be born, like most, as a  singleton. There is no real difference between this and a mother who has an abortion, denying her  other children a sibling. There is also no difference between this and when a twin miscarries.  <p>  <p>Everything depends on what we choose to class as ethical. It is unethical to force a woman to  continue with a pregnancy she finds intolerable, just because a third party disapproves. The only  justification required is to square it with her own conscience.  <p>  <p>People are offering her money to keep the child, but the reasons for abortion are rarely just  financial. This woman has thought hard about her decision and I'd be surprised if she were swayed by  the offer of money.   <p>  <p><b>The pregnant twin</b>  <p>  <p>Alison Chapman, 34, is a twin and is expecting twins in November.<p>I definitely think there is a  special bond between twins. Although they are people in their own right, they are part of a whole unit  and you can't get away from that. I am 34 years old, but I still feel it. There is no way I would want  to abort one twin.  <p>  <p>It's my first pregnancy, so I don't know what to expect, but being a twin, I am not worried about  the physical side of having to care for two babies. Initially, I am sure it will be more tiring, but  when they're older there are advantages because they can amuse each other. Of course it will be a lot  harder financially. If I were on my own, I'd be more worried, but I have a very supportive partner.  <p>  <p>I am not opposed to abortion and I believe it is not a decision any woman takes lightly. But if  this woman is honest with the remaining child, I think her decision may have a major psychological  impact later on. It will be difficult for her, because if the child has problems, she may think:  should I have chosen the other one? If she carried both and put one up for adoption, the same would  apply.  <p>  <p>I feel very sorry for her, having to cope with all this attention at what must be a very stressful  time anyway. It must be so difficult, choosing one child over the other. Presumably the decision is  down to the doctor, which is better, I suppose, because as a mother, how do you decide? I have seen  the scans of my twins and they are real people, I think of them as part of each other.  <p>  <p>People always ask what it's like to be a twin, but it's hard to say because I have never known  anything else. I couldn't imagine life without my twin.   <p>  <p><b>The surviving twin</b>  <p>  <p>Senga Callum (not her real name), aged 40, was a twin. Her brother was stillborn.  <p>  <p>I have always felt the presence of my twin, but it is only in the past few years that I have really  been affected by it, especially since having children of my own.  <p>  <p>Last November, I read an article about twins and there was a small paragraph about people who had  never known their twin. I got in touch with the Lone Twin Network and it was a big relief to talk to  someone; I bawled for 20 minutes.  <p>  <p>The group gets together once a year and they are people who have never resolved their feelings of  loneliness, who are always thinking there should be another person with them. One facet of them is  wrong and missing. I was fascinated because I had never known that others were feeling the same thing  as me.  <p>  <p>I was born before my brother and I felt I was a very selfish person, fighting to get out. We were  both very heavy and he didn't have enough oxygen. I've always felt very guilty, as if I survived at  his expense. My mother is in her seventies and I was worried she would die before I could ask her  questions about my twin. It was never a secret, but I wanted to know what he looked like, what his  name was, what colour hair he had and whether she saw him. I knew I'd get upset and I wasn't sure  she'd understand that. My mum mentioned the story about this woman wanting an abortion. I didn't  really want to discuss it with her because I knew I'd get upset. I think this woman needs to have a  big think about what she is doing. She needs to talk to people who have lost a twin. She should be  made aware of the anger that will be directed at her by the survivor. That twin will feel really  guilty and that's a huge responsibility to give a child.  <p>  <p>I'm sure it is hellish having twins and I feel for her, but the decision is bigger than she  realises and she'll have to live with it for the rest of her life. Although I have three sisters,  there is still a sense of loss; he was a brother, he was special.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Doctors reveal a selective abortion has been carried out on a  woman carrying twins </b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Woman in abortion row had  operation a month ago  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chris Mihill</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The woman at the centre of the row over aborting one of her twins on financial grounds had the  operation a month ago, it emerged last night. Health officials confirmed that the 28-year-old single  mother had had an abortion but would give no further details. Doctors at London's Queen Charlotte  Hospital agreed to abort one twin after the woman, who already has one child, declared she could not  cope with more than one of the babies. In a statement last night, Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust,  which includes Queen Charlotte's, said: "Professor Bennett [the doctor who first revealed the woman's  dilemma] has spoken to the woman who is happy to confirm that the operation has taken place. She is  adamant that she does not want any more details put out."  <p>  <p>Anti-abortion groups, acting in the belief that the operation was still pending, successfully  sought an injunction yesterday temporarily banning the abortion on the grounds the woman had not been  informed of all the options. Pro-life groups had received pledges of more than &#163;80,000 to help  the woman bring up the twins.  <p>  <p>Fertility expert Lord Robert Winston said the pledges of cash from pro-life campaigners had been  "unethically offered".  <p>  <p>"I think it is immoral to put someone like this under pressure," he said. "They should ask  themselves, if they want to protect life, why don't they give that money to a good cause either in  Ethiopia or perhaps the children in Bosnia."  <p>  <p>He spoke of the pain in coming to a decision about having an abortion saying: "No woman I have ever  met has ever gone through a termination without the most serious consideration.  <p>  <p>"It is something that is extremely difficult for women to do, and is only done after a great deal  of soul-searching."  <p>  <p>Professor Wendy Savage, gynaecologist, said she was horrified at the way pro-life campaigners had  seized on the case - and with the auction that developed. She also expressed "deep concern" over the  possibility of any breach of confidentiality and the ethics raised.  <p>  <p>"I think the whole question of how this got into the public domain is a real ethical problem in  itself," she said.  <p>  <p>The story broke with a two-page interview in the Sunday Express, when Professor Philip Bennett, of  Queen Charlotte's, said he was prepared to abort one healthy twin. Its mother was described as 16-  weeks pregnant and in "socially straitened circumstances".  <p>  <p>The article and accompanying quotes from Prof Bennett made it sound as if operation was pending.  <p>  <p>Sue Douglas, editor of Sunday Express, said last night that the article was based on a taped  interview, with a second visit to confirm the facts, and the text had been faxed to Prof Bennett for  his comments.  <p>  <p>When the paper checked on Saturday it was told the operation had not at that stage taken place.  <p>  <p>"We have no reason to believe the doctor misled us. Whether it has taken place or not it is still  an incredible dilemma," said Ms Douglas.  <p>  <p>Nuala Scarisbrick, of the pro-life group Life, said last night that even if the abortion had taken  place this did not change the ethical concerns, and new questions arose about how the woman was being  cared for now and what counselling she had received.  <p>  <p>"Prof Bennett should be sacked because his revelations about the woman have made people want to  identify her. He has besmirched the name of a great hospital."  <p>  <p>She said Life would continue with its appeal for funds to help women seeking abortions because of  the cost of children.  <p>  <p>Before it emerged that the operation had taken place, Conservative MP Ann Winterton, chairman of  the all-party parliamentary Pro-Life Group, demanded an inquiry into the case.  <p>  <p>She said: "I am writing immediately to the Secretary of State for Health, asking him to make full  inquiries into the whole case and to take any necessary action. Not surprisingly the public has been extremely moved by the case - to know that one twin will be  killed and left in the womb until the birth of the second child. We know that twins bond at a very early stage, probably at 12 weeks or possibly even earlier. It  would have the most devastating effect on that child."  <p>  <p>Prof Bennett last night confirmed the abortion had taken place. He added: "I have been unable to  clear this up sooner because I required the patient's permission to reveal when the operation took  place.  This whole thing has been embarrassing. The information was released accidentally. I have  regretted it ever since."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sarah Boseley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>London's most famous maternity hospital admitted yesterday that it issued misleading information  when it said the woman who had one of her healthy twin foetuses terminated was an impoverished single  mother.  <p>  <p>It emerged yesterday that the woman treated at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in west London was a  well-paid professional, married to a company director. The revelation provoked new calls from an  outraged anti-abortion lobby for changes in the legislation to prevent what Tory MP Ann Winterton  called "selective culling" in the womb.  <p>  <p>The embattled hospital, which said it issued misleading information to protect the identity of the  patient, obtained an injunction to prevent newspapers naming or approaching the woman who had been  traced by a tabloid newspaper. She was quoted as saying: "I am married and we are certainly not  impoverished - far from it."  <p>  <p>Professor Phillip Bennett, a gynaecologist at Queen Charlotte's, inadvertently started the storm a  fortnight ago when he spoke of the operation as one of the most difficult ethical issues he had faced.  At the time, he described his patient as a 28-year-old single mother with one child who could not  afford to look after two more. Anti-abortion groups raised about &#163;80,000 to help her before it  emerged that the termination had taken place.  <p>  <p>Yesterday, the story changed. Mr Bennett had altered details of the case to protect the woman's  identity, said Jonathan Street, a spokesman for the Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust. "I think I can  admit to regret that, for very good reasons as we see it, we had to do that. We felt that our duty to  the patient outweighed any duty of public disclosure."  <p>  <p>The real reason for the termination was the risk to the mother's mental health. "Had he at the time  not carried out the operation, they would have felt the need to abort two foetuses, not one," he said.  <p>  <p>Queen Charlotte's is to hold an inquiry into the way it handled the international outcry. Mrs  Winterton, MP for Congleton, said the hospital had been "lacking in integrity". She had written twice  to the Health Secretary, asking for an inquiry. "The basic point remains the same - that people feel  concern that a healthy twin can be killed in the womb for social reasons. I believe that amongst the  general public there is a mood for change." Elizabeth Peacock, Conservative MP for Batley and Spen,  said: "The 1967 Abortion Act was not meant to allow people to have designer families. That's obviously  what it's being used for. And, also, it appears that the Abortion Act is almost being used as a form  of afterthought contraception."   <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>The government lifts the Post Office's letter monopoly</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 August  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Minister acts to break postal strikes</h2><h3>Firms shun chance to step in  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Seumas Milne</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Government last night confirmed its intention of moving against striking public service workers  with the announcement that it was lifting the Post Office's letter monopoly from midnight, as the  Communication Workers' Union announced four new 24-hour postal strikes on top of today's planned  walkout. In a move calculated to raise the political stakes in the escalating industrial disputes in  Royal Mail and the London Underground, Ian Lang, the Trade and Industry Secretary, said he was  breaking the monopoly on mail costing less than &#163;1 for a month.  <p>  <p>He warned that if strikes continued, he would extend the suspension for a further three months.  <p>  <p>Last week, Mr Lang revealed that the Government was considering new curbs on trade unions in  response to the outbreak of strikes, including the possibility of making unions financially liable for  disruption to public services.  <p>  <p>Yesterday's announcement came shortly after Alan Johnson, CWU general secretary, had declared that  Royal Mail's refusal to reopen negotiations over its plans for American-style 'teamworking' had left  the union's executive "very little alternative" to calling further 24-hour stoppages. These will run  from 3am to 3am on 14 August, 22 August, 30 August and 2 September.  <p>  <p>Mr Johnson dismissed the withdrawal of the 156-year-old monopoly as a "bit of crude politicking by  the Conservatives, who believe it will earn them Brownie points with the public. I think they have  misjudged the public mood completely."  <p>  <p>He said people would see that the Government, which had failed to privatise the Post Office two  years ago, wanted the dispute to continue. Mr Lang countered with a pre-election revival of the  language of the early 1980s. He said it was "wholly unacceptable that a group of extremists within the  CWU are able to hold the country to economic ransom."  He called on "spineless" Labour to condemn the postal strikes, insisting his monopoly withdrawal  was essential to protect consumers.  <p>  <p>Last night, Labour - in contrast with its excoriation of the London Underground strikes - refused  to condemn the postal walkouts. Stephen Byers, Labour's employment spokesman, said: "We are not  playing politics with this dispute".  <p>  <p>The response from private courier companies to the business opportunities beckoning as a result of  Mr Lang's suspension of the letter monopoly were also disappointing from the Government's point of  view.  Andrew Fitzmaurice, business development director for the country's largest parcel carrier, TNT,  said he would be delighted to take over the Post Office's delivery business, but not on a temporary  basis.  UPS, the largest international package distribution outfit, confirmed it would "not step in and  offer a solution to the strike".  <p>  <p>Today's stoppage by the 130,000 delivery and sorting workers, the fourth since the end of June,  will test whether the uncertain leadership from the CWU over the past 10 days has weakened commitment  to the industrial action programme on the ground.  <p>  <p>Post Office managers yesterday renewed their call for the CWU to put the package negotiated at Acas  last month - which includes a procedure to introduce teamworking through local trials - out to a  ballot of the membership.  There were fears among some union sources that indecision by the CWU executive might lead to a  weakening in support.  <p>  <p>The last time the Royal Mail letter monopoly was fully suspended was during an all-out postal  strike from January to March 1971.  <p>  <p>In return for the exclusive state franchise - which dates from the introduction of the Penny Post  in 1840 - the Post Office is obliged to deliver to every address in the United Kingdom at a uniform  price. Post Office managers, the unions and Opposition politicians fear that a permanent suspension  would allow private firms to 'cherry pick' the most profitable routes, which currently subsidise  deliveries to remote areas. Estimates of the real cost of delivering a letter from London to remote  parts of Scotland range from &#163;4 to &#163;16.  <p>  <p>The CWU believes that Post Office managers' 'teamworking' proposals - they envisage dividing local  offices into competing groups, who would have to cover for each other and continously improve  performance - would mean extra work for a new basic of only &#163;211 a week, set postal worker  against postal worker and undermine the local influence of the union. Post Office managers - with the  Government standing behind them - are prepared to delay the introduction of such a 'flexible working'  system, but are determined to secure it in the medium-term as a basis for future productivity growth.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>The government lifts the Post Office's letter monopoly</b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 August  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Redwood call to end monopoly  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Seumas Milne</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Government's efforts to exploit the postal strikes for political advantage were upstaged  yesterday when the rightwing Tory leadership hopeful John Redwood called for the temporary suspension  of the Royal Mail's letter monopoly to be made permanent.  <p>  <p>As the postal workers' national programme of one-day strikes resumed and London Underground drivers  prepared for today's seventh stoppage, Mr Redwood's plea for full deregulation was taken up by the  parcels delivery firm White Arrow.  <p>  <p>Echoing the views of the other main private courier companies - TNT, UPS and DHL - a spokeswoman  for White Arrow said it was "simply not a commercial reality" to take advantage of a temporary letter  monopoly suspension, even if the current one month was extended to three.  <p>  <p>She said if the monopoly was permanently removed, there was a strong possibility that the firm  would "get into letter post in a big way". She refused to comment on what discussions the company had  had with government. Another private delivery service, City Post, yesterday claimed to be the first  company to have taken advantage of the monopoly suspension, offering a same-day service for existing  customers in London during the Communication Workers' Union's fourth 24-hour stoppage in the dispute  over working conditions.  <p>  <p>The intervention by Mr Redwood threatened to undermine ministers' efforts to embarrass the Labour  Party over the post and Underground disputes and drew an irritable response from the President of the  Board of Trade, Ian Lang, who was forced to warn against the potential threat to the universal price  and delivery service from full-scale deregulation. He had earlier dropped broad hints about the  likelihood of new Post Office break-up and privatisation proposals featuring in the forthcoming  Conservative manifesto. Post Office managers yesterday claimed the first significant cracks in their  employees' support for industrial action, with 14,000 working on the morning shift - about 15 per cent  of those eligible - compared with 11,000 on the last strike day in July. The CWU disputed the figures.  Management is sending a copy of last week's rejected agreement to each of the 130,000 delivery and  sorting workers.  <p>  <p>Both the post and Underground disputes appear to be deadlocked, with no prospect of negotiations.  Underground union leaders yesterday revealed a deal they had offered London Transport, which traded  three years of below-inflation pay settlements for a 35-hour week by August 1998. That was rejected as too expensive by managers, who are also refusing to make a one-hour cut in the working week to 37.5 hours that the unions insist was agreed last year. As commuters struggle to work today, the Reclaim  the Streets campaign is to converge on key routes on bicycles in support of the Underground workers  and in protest against the car culture.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>The government lifts the Post Office's letter monopoly</b><br><br><br><b><h2>14 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Royal Mail to woo post strike waverers  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Seumas Milne</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Post Office managers have geared up for a strike-breaking effort to crack support for today's fifth national 24-hour walkout by delivery and sorting office workers, according to confidential Royal Mail memorandums passed to the Guardian.  <p>  <p>Managers have been told to "try everything we can" - including singling out "opinion formers", arranging time off for "positive" workplace meetings and orchestrating local ballots and petitions - to organise teams of "waverers" to cross picket lines.  <p>  <p>Postal workers in the South-east are being offered the chance to change their work patterns today in order to "work without strike-breaking", by beginning their shifts shortly before the 3am deadline set by the Communication Workers' Union (CWU) for the start of the strike. The documents show Post Office management is staking its position on a large-scale return to work, rather than a resumption of negotiation on the hours, pay and working practices deal rejected by the CWU executive. Last night, the Post Office announced nearly four out of five postal workers who had answered a management questionnaire wanted a new ballot. But Alan Johnson, CWU general secretary, accused Royal Mail of "machinations" to create a "charade" of collapsing support for industrial action. "Our members will not be bullied, tricked or coerced into submission. The strike can only end if Royal Mail agree to negotiate with us again."  <p>  <p>The internal Post Office documents confirm managers recognise the problems in undermining support for the stoppages. In a private memo sent to all delivery office managers in South Wales and the South-west last week, Ronnie Henderson, divisional personnel director, wrote the likelihood of significant strike-breaking at large sorting offices was "remote: the strength of the picket lines and the fear of recrimination and intimidation are strong disincentives."  <p>  <p>Warning "there are some very difficult decisions to be taken", Mr Henderson said managers must "try everything we can to persuade and facilitate attendance at work" on 14 August. They should use all their "skill and ingenuity" to "group together those who are wavering so that they can attend together at particular units and rely on each other for team solidarity." Mr Henderson suggested a four-point plan at each workplace for organising opposition to the strikes. He said it had already proved successful in some offices but warned managers must ensure meetings would be "positive about coming into work and not negative about consolidating the strike". The key issues in dispute are Royal Mail's demand for flexible 'teamworking' and to concentrate mail on the first delivery - which the CWU believes will threaten the second delivery and full-time jobs.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Brindle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>More than 1,500 callers yesterday used a new freephone service for people to inform on suspected  benefit cheats on its first day of operation. Within minutes of Peter Lilley, the Social Security  Secretary, launching the scheme, lines on the 'beat-a-cheat' were ringing. By the end of the day 1,654  people had registered their suspicions.  <p>  <p>A spokesman for the department said: "It was very good for a short day." The line opened after Mr  Lilley unveiled it at 11pm and ran until 6.30pm. From now on it will operate from 8.30am to 6.30pm  daily. Ministers are expecting 2,000 calls a day after an inital rush of 20,000 a week. At the  hotline's launch Mr Lilley announced record savings from "fraud and benefit incorrectness" of  &#163;1.44bn in 1995/96. Excluding housing benefit savings by local authorities - not previously  included in government figures - the 1995/96 total of &#163;1.22bn compares with &#163;717m the year before. The figures are calculated by multiplying by 32 the value of an erroneous claim to  represent the average time it would have continued if undetected.  <p>  <p>Meanwhile, it emerged that three weeks after closure of the Benefits Agency's free telephone lines  offering advice to claimants the agency's emergency out-of-hours service is under threat.  <p>  <p>Although the agency insisted that no decision had been taken, social workers believe existing  arrangements will cease in the autumn, leaving them to deal with the destitute. An agency office on  Merseyside has already written to social services, saying: "The service will be withdrawn in October.  The decision has been taken at national level, so all out-of-hours services throughout the country are  to be withdrawn."  <p>  <p>Benefits officers are on call at night, at weekends and on public holidays to consider help for  people who have no money. There is an out-of-hours office in south London. The service is under review  as the agency tries to meet ministers' demands that it cut its running costs by at least a quarter  over three years.  <p>  <p>A spokeswoman said social services departments were braced for the worst. They feared a steep  increase in their workload as social workers were called out to assist penniless people.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Vivek Chaudhary</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Government is to launch a hotline for people who want to report dishonest employers, after its  line for exposing suspected benefit cheats attracted more than 12,000 calls in less than a week.  <p>  <p>Hundreds of calls were from people reporting cheating employers, motivating the Secretary of State,  Peter Lilley, to order his officials to bring forward the separate scheme, which has been under  consideration for some time. A spokesman for the Department of Social Security said last night that  the benefits hotline, which Mr Lilley launched amid a blaze of publicity last Monday, was revealing  "across the board fraud, which we are determined to stamp out".  <p>  <p>Many calls have concerned employers with small businesses, such as those in construction, and  involve National Insurance fraud, which costs an estimated &#163;170m a year.  <p>  <p>The move coincides with plans announced by the Labour Party to tackle National Insurance fraud by  tighter rules to identify phantom numbers. Launching its campaign, Labour accused ministers of failing  to take tough enough action to protect the public purse from criminals, who use some of the millions  of numbers in existence from people who have died, moved abroad, or whose accounts are redundant.  <p>  <p>Labour's social security spokesman, Henry McLeish, called for a task force to find out the extent  of abuse and make urgent recommendations for improving security.  <p>  <p>Mr McLeish said a Labour government would toughen up the procedure for issuing numbers to stop  fraudsters assuming another person's identity to apply for benefits or to obtain a number; match all  existing numbers to information held by other government departments, for example the Inland Revenue,  to ensure claims are valid; and run spot checks on inactive numbers to ensure they are not being  abused.  <p>  <p>A spokesman for the Department of Social Security said the benefits hotline had been receiving 250  calls an hour since opening on Tuesday. Information was being passed to social security fraud  investigating officers. "The quality of the information has been very good. In some cases we have even  been given the National Insurance numbers of people suspected of fraud." The 'beat-a-cheat' hotline  has for the first time since the 1980s pushed the issue of benefit fraud to the front of the political  agenda. Already, more than 4,000 civil servants are employed in special teams trying to track down an  estimated &#163;1bn a year wrongly paid out. The attack is being led by a new cabinet committee under  the direction of Mr Lilley and Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime Minister.  <p>  <p>There is a growing cross-party consensus that the attitude to fraud needs to change from passive  acceptance to an active drive to combat it. Bernard Crofton, who as director of housing in Hackney,  east London, launched a campaign against housing benefit fraud, said: "People who suspect fraud tend  to keep their heads down. First of all, life is easier if you do that, but also people are genuinely  nervous of challenging fraud and are frightened of being called a grass or a racist."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael Walker</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Alan Shearer will bring Newcastle to a standstill when he makes his first appearance at St James's  Park today.  Up to 20,000 supporters are likely to clog the city centre in the hope of getting a glimpse of the  world's most expensive footballer. However, they will not be allowed inside the ground. Instead the  club has fixed up a huge Tannoy system to relay Shearer's press conference interview to the thousands  waiting outside. "With the factory holiday it's going to be frenzied but we are making plans with  police to keep things moving," said a club spokesman. <p>  <p>"We are providing entertainment to keep fans  amused and Shearer will come out to greet them after his media interviews. It's a huge operation  because there hasn't been a signing like this in the club's history." Shearer's arrival will be beamed  across the world and Northumbria Police have made special provision to deal with the unprecedented  public interest. Shearer-frenzy caused fans to queue around the ground for additional tickets for  Sunday's Charity Shield game with Manchester United - scheduled to be the striker's first appearance  in a black and white No 9 shirt. Meanwhile hundreds of supporters were at Newcastle airport yesterday  to welcome Keegan's squad home from the club's pre-season Far East tour. Shearer had flown in 24 hours  earlier to prepare for his big day.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Newcastle buy Alan Shearer for £15m and 15,000 turn out to welcome him to the town  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Geordies salute the people's champion  Shearer</h2><h3>Tyneside witnessed a fine debut by Billy Big Pockets  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael Walker</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It felt like the moment a mass fantasy became a reality. At five minutes past two yesterday Alan  Shearer walked around the lush, pre-season turf of St James' Park, Newcastle, and a city swooned.  <p>  <p>Inside the spanking new stadium were 1,400 workers from Newcastle Breweries, which sponsors the  club, and outside thousands more waited patiently in the rain. All they wanted was a glimpse of their  hero and an assured, nimble performance.  <p>  <p>Shearer gave them this and even supplied the deadliest of finishes with a line that sounded like a  song by Johnny Cash: "After all, I'm just a sheet-metal worker's son from Newcastle."  <p>  <p>Johnny Cash could actually be Shearer's nickname (at Blackburn it was Billy Big Pockets), but the  world's most expensive footballer responded to questions about his wealth drily. "If money comes my  way," he said, "that's fine, I'll deal with it when it comes along. It certainly won't change me. I  decided to join Newcastle before money was even mentioned."  <p>  <p>He laughed off a report that he would earn &#163;6.17 a second every time he was on the pitch, and  said that there was no pressure from the fee. "I'll say it now, and probably say it time and time  again, but the price-tag has nothing to do with me. I don't set that price and all I can do is do my  best. If I'm worth &#163;15m and someone is prepared to pay that, then that's out of my hands."  <p>  <p>It was, of course, in the hands of the two men who flanked Shearer on the podium, Sir John Hall and  Kevin Keegan. When Keegan arrived at Newcastle as a player 14 years ago he was hailed as the Messiah,  and now as manager it seemed appropriate that his prodigal son signing should sit on his right-hand  side.  <p>  <p>Keegan, however, was taking none of the glory; instead, as he frequently does, he chose to praise  the Newcastle fans. "It's your money,' he said of the &#163;15m. "It's the money you've spent on your  replica shirts, the money you've spent on your season tickets and your bonds, the programmes and the  Black and White magazines."  <p>  <p>Nine days ago when Keegan announced the Shearer deal he had described it as "a signing for the  people of Newcastle". This was a press conference for the people, and Keegan and Hall took the  opportunity to reiterate their Geordie manifesto.  <p>  <p>The manager said he saw his job as "reinvesting" the supporters' money. "So when you come to watch  the product on the park here it's the very best we feel we can provide."  <p>  <p>Both Keegan and Hall thought it especially good news that Shearer was a Geordie returning home. "We  have sold them off time and time again up here," said Keegan. "We built stands with the money and  we've tried to buy players to replace them quickly. That's gone at this club now."  <p>  <p>It was an echo of his "biggest-thinking team in Europe" remark last week, and he repeated that he  intended not to sell any of the current squad and that he would play Shearer alongside, and not in  place of, Les Ferdinand. "Despite what some people think, I think they will make a terrific strike  force. I think they can both take each other places where they dream about going." Shearer concurred  and thanked Ferdinand for the iconic No 9 jersey, although he said he would play in any number for  Newcastle - "even No 29". Shearer also had praise for the club he left behind, Blackburn Rovers, and  revealed that there was a stage in negotiations with their owner when the striker was swaying towards  staying another year. "I had a long meeting with Jack Walker on the Sunday," said Shearer. "I asked  him if I could consider my options and see what I wanted to do."  <p>  <p>The England centre-forward then flew back from Walker's Jersey home and met Alex Ferguson on the  Monday. Then he spoke to his mentor at Blackburn, Kenny Dalglish, whose advice was typically laconic:  "Whatever you do you can't lose."  <p>  <p>Shearer finally met Keegan on the Tuesday and his mind was made up. "Obviously I was very  impressed. Everyone knows I've always wanted to play for the club, but if I'd gone elsewhere I would  have had the best years of my career behind me; now at Newcastle I have got the best years in front of  me. And to play in front of my mum and dad at St James's Park is something else."  <p>  <p>With Shearer's decision made, all Blackburn could do was name their price.  "&#163;15m and no  quibbling", Newcastle's chief executive Freddie Fletcher was told, but neither he nor anyone else was  quibbling yesterday, not in Newcastle anyway.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

After all, I'm only a  sheet-metal worker's son from Newcastle"</h2><h3>The city's entire population seemed to be wrapped in black  and white stripes to hail Alan Shearer's return  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jim White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>She is 63, gets &#163;67 a week state pension; he is 25 and scrapes by on &#163;30,000 a week, or  maybe &#163;35,000 or possibly even &#163;42,000 depending on which tabloid you read. Her last pair of shoes cost her &#163;9.99 from a discount  warehouse; he gets paid &#163;500,000 a year to wear his. She lives in a &#163;40,000 house in Denton  Burn, a Newcastle suburb with a fashion bypass; he is said to be looking for a place in snazzy  Ponteland, something for around &#163;750,000. But the moment Barbara Donaldson heard Alan Shearer was  coming to her town, she thought she was the lucky one. "The morning he signed for us I went to get my  pension at the post office," said Mrs Donaldson. "Normally, they're a right grumpy lot, but that day  everybody in the queue had a smile like a Cheshire cat. If you'd put us in for the Olympic high jump  that morning, we'd have set a world record."  <p>  <p>Mrs Donaldson was by no means alone in her reaction to the purchase of Shearer for &#163;15m. On  the day he was presented to his army of new lovers (fans is too slight a word) the entire population  of Newcastle appeared to be wrapped in black and white striped nylon.  <p>  <p>Everywhere you looked, people in replica Newcastle shirts were heading for St James's Park,  Newcastle's ground which stands on top of a hill dominating the town. And Newcastle were not even  playing. Fifteen thousand people just wanted to be there, to roar and chant as the new man was  paraded. Mrs Donaldson was luckier than most. While the 15,000 were left in a car park along with the  press and 1,400 invitees sent tickets by Newcastle's sponsors, she found herself inside the stadium  itself.  <p>  <p>"I've been offered &#163;100 for my tickets," said Brian Bloomfield from Gateshead, sitting next to  Mrs Donaldson. "But I wouldn't take it. It wouldn't be fair on him," he added, pointing to his son,  Dean, aged nine, who was beaming beside him. "He has to be here on this of all days." Now this is an  unexpected thing. Shearer cost enough to equip a hospital. He earns more in four days than a teacher  will earn in a year. In a town where unemployment is endemic, you might think spending so much on a  mere footballer would be regarded as wanton extravagance. But you could find few in Newcastle  yesterday who did not think he represented the biggest bargain this side of a Marks & Spencer prawn  sandwich.  <p>  <p>"I'd have paid the money myself if I had it," said Brian Bloomfield. "This is the best thing to  happen to this town since I can remember." Which is the point about Shearer. On the BBC's 'Match of the  Seventies' broadcast on Monday night, we saw footage of Malcolm Macdonald, a previous incumbent of the  number No 9 Shearer is about to make his own, signing for Arsenal. That was the way things used  to be around these parts: every time someone made good he went down south: Gascoigne, Waddle, Cole,  they all migrated. Now the real thing was coming Newcastle's way. Not only that, he is a Geordie  coming home. Better still, he was snatched out of the grasp of traditionally bigger, richer rivals.  <p>  <p>"There's real pride in that," said Mrs Donaldson. "That we are in a position to compete with Man U,  who just seem to be able to get whatever they want." Thus the very size of Shearer's fee, the weight  of his wage, are seen locally as symbolic of a new muscular ambition abroad in the town, the Nineties  equivalent of the grandiose town halls the Victorians used to build.  <p>  <p>"This sends out a signal to the rest of the world," Kevin Keegan, Shearer's new manager, said.  <p>  <p>And the man who provided the funds to bring Shearer back to Newcastle was everywhere yesterday,  making sure this point was made. "Football has always been part of our tradition," said Sir John Hall,  Newcastle United's owner, bouncing around St James's Park in a pair of unexpectedly pointy blue shoes.  "Football has never left the area. It's the talent that's gone away. What we're saying here is you  don't have to leave Newcastle."  <p>  <p>And, indeed, there will be economic benefits to the place from buying Shearer. Dozens more staff  have been taken on in the club shop to process orders for Shearer shirts.  <p>  <p>Thousands of extra pounds have flowed through pub tills toasting the new arrival. Hundreds more  Scandinavians will flock in for football and shopping weekends.  <p>  <p>The cynic might suggest the chief beneficiary of the Shearer boom will be Sir John Hall, owner of  Britain's biggest shopping centre, the Metro Centre in Gateshead: in an economy built on retail, to be  in possession of a brand as potent as Shearer is to be king.  <p>  <p>But then there was no place for cynics around St James's Park yesterday. "Of course, Sir John's  making money out of this," said Dave Trainer, from Darlington, at 25 the same age as Shearer but  earning slightly less as one of the area's unemployed. "But without him, we'd have none of this," he  added. "Sure, I can't afford to come and watch them, but I'd rather not be able to afford to watch my  team with Shearer in it, than get in to see rubbish."  <p>  <p>As for the man himself, well, Shearer clearly prefers his venomous right foot to do his talking:  his press conference pronouncements were not in the sardines and trawlers class. Blinking modestly in  the flashbulb blaze, he limited himself to talking of "giving 110 per cent" and saying "For me the  season can't come quick enough."  <p>  <p>He also declared: "If money comes my way, that's fine; I'll deal with that when it comes along. It  certainly won't change me. After all, I'm only a sheet metal-worker's son from Newcastle."  <p>  <p>Mrs Donaldson was thrilled by the man. "He's lovely, everything a mother dreams her son to be," she  said. "Not one you'd lust over, mind. Not like Sir John. Power, now that's the real aphrodisiac."  <p>  <p>Meanwhile, outside the stadium, the 15,000 fans waited for their new man to appear on the stage. A  sense of parochial triumphalism was on their minds as they ignored the rain and sang as one: "Are you  watching, Sunderland?"   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nick Varley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>We may not have been alone. The scientific world was buzzing with excitement last night as rumours  circulated of new evidence of life on Mars. Reports of the discovery of a fossil in meteorite rock  from the planet had academics and researchers waiting with bated breath for further details from the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) in the United States.  <p>  <p>Nasa said last night that its findings pointed to the possibility that "a primitive form of  microscopic life may have existed on Mars more than three billion years ago."  The scientists based their theory of life on Mars on an examination of a Martian meteorite that  landed on earth 13,000 years ago.  <p>  <p>Nasa administrator Daniel Goldin said: "I want everybody to know that we are not talking about  'little green men'. These are extremely small, single-cell structures that somewhat resemble bacteria  on Earth. There is no evidence or suggestion that any higher life form ever existed on Mars."  <p>  <p>Science magazine, the academic journal which was due to publish a paper on the work next week,  announced that it would bring forward publication to today.  But scientists who have debated the question of life on Mars for decades were struggling to wait  that long.  <p>  <p>Dr Monica Grady of the Natural History Museum said the findings, if correct, were some of the most  sensational in scientific history.  "It's entirely possible that very, very primitive organisms might have arisen," she said.  I'm not talking about ammonites or corals or anything like that but something incredibly primitive  such as micro-fossils from highly primitive organisms. It's absolutely fascinating to find these."  <p>  <p>Former Cambridge University physicist Fred Hoyle, who maintained in the early 1980s that there was  life on Mars when Nasa was insisting the planet was sterile, said: "I'd be very pleased if it was true  and what we published in the Eighties was right."  <p>  <p>But he struck a note of scepticism: "I have certain reservations. Considering Nasa is absolutely  avid to get funding from Congress, one has to be a bit suspicious.  It is within the realms of possibility but I think one has to be cautious - and I'm triply  cautious if it's the result I want. Nasa is fighting by any means it can to get money."  <p>  <p>Astronomer Patrick Moore said more evidence was needed. "For a long time we have known there was  once running water on Mars because we have seen the evidence of it. There has long been the theory  that life started there but died out.  "But for all that I still need to be convinced by hard evidence. It is still not confirmed that  these meteorites definitely came from Mars - though they are very similar in composition to what we  believe their make-up would be if they were.  I defer judgment. If it is proved that these do come from Mars and that they contain life, all it  proves is life can exist in these places but not that it still does or has evolved to significant  levels."  <p>  <p>The Nasa research centres on meteorites found in Antarctica in the 1980s as ice melted. It is  thought they are fragments of meteorites from Mars created when an asteroid collided with the planet  and deposited on earth. Analysis of the rock at the Natural History Museum has revealed remnants of  organic material, possibly from underground water reserves. Scientists have long suspected these  subterranean pools - feeding rivers whose dried-up beds can be seen on the surface of the planet -  could have supported life. But a mini-laboratory, sent to examine the surface 20 years ago, killed the  theory when it found no evidence to prove it.  <p>  <p>Now the discovery of a fossil would turn the conventional wisdom of the last 20 years on its head.  It would only indicate the existence of the most primitive life - and with the typical temperature  -23&#176;C and the poles capped by frozen carbon dioxide, it is impossible for anything to live there now.  But it would confirm for the first time that life has been supported by a planet other than earth.  <p>  <p>It would also give some basis for the fascination everyone from HG Wells to David Bowie has had  with the Red Planet for hundreds of years. Most famously Orson Welles caused panic in 1938 when a  radio broadcast of 'War of the Worlds' telling of a Martian invasion was taken as the truth by many  Americans who heard it.  <p>  <p>The facts to be revealed later today will be less dramatic but without question far more  significant.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Discovery of 'bacteria-like' structures in a meteorite gives new clue to life on Mars</b><br><br><br><b><h2>8 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Secrets of the Red Planet</h2><h3>As scientists claim that Fossil evidence indicates there have been life forms on Mars, we may have to come to terms with the fact that, after all the fiction, we really are not alone</h3>
<br>By <b>Ruaridh Nicoll</b><br><br>


<p>
<p>Bill Clinton ushered Daniel Goldin, his chief adviser on off-world matters into the Oval Office and
sat him down. Nasa's administrator wanted to brief the president and Al Gore on news that would soon
hit Earth with the power of a meteor - life had finally been found on Mars.
<p>
<p>Beyond the walls of the White House, America's cinema screens flickered with the violence of
Independence Day depicting the carnage brought by an invading alien horde. It was turning out to be
one of the stranger moments in Clinton's term.
<p>
<p>Goldin went public late on Tuesday, quashing more imaginative reactions. "I want everybody to know
that we are not talking about 'little green men'," he said. "These are extremely small, single-cell
structures that somewhat resemble bacteria on Earth. There is no evidence or suggestion that any
higher life form ever existed on Mars."
<p>
<p>But this was science, not science fiction, and the sensible were stirring with the news, excitment
spreading in antipation of the article which would cause the storm. The academic journal, Science, was
going to press and when it arrived late last night the news was as good as people had hoped. The
beauty was in the payoff: "We conclude there is evidence for primitive life on early Mars," the
authors wrote.
<p>
<p>In the White House, Clinton and Gore were said to be excited. Theories were collapsing, others
gaining strength, and scientific intrigue was at its most fitful. "We have evidence that life as we
know it is not unique to this planet," said Colin Pillinger of the Open University, with all the
weight due such a discovery.
<p>
<p>The emergence offers views of the start of the worlds. Back at the beginning of time in the deep,
dark horror of space, the Earth and Mars were beginning to cool. It was 4,500 million years ago and
the crusts were forming, volcanoes bursting through their thin surfaces. There are arguments about
where the water came from but it is clear that once here it would support life. Where life came from
provides its own mysteries.
<p>
<p>To look at Mars it is necessary to look at Earth. However life came to be, it was on earth as far
back as 3,500 million years ago, the tiny fossils showing up in some of the world's oldest stone.
Details are sketchy, over such periods of time a planet eats itself, swallowing its surface and
sending it back into the intense pressures of its interior before spitting it out again.
<p>
<p>"It's more likely life evolved on Earth than in space," said Graham Durant of Glasgow University's
Hunterian Museum, assuming that any life on Mars followed suit. But what was here, and what was added
from space over the eons by the constant stream of meteors that hit the earth? There is an argument
that says because space contains the basic building blocks of life - the amino acids within everything
living - that the life was delivered from outside.
<p>
<p>Two scientists who have helped construct this theory are Sir Fred Hoyle and Professor Chandra
Wickramasinghe, who started looking at the stuff that made up space in the early moments of the
science. "We were struggling to understand the intersteller dust," said Wickramasinghe about how they
began. After decades their conclusion was: "The universe must be teaming with life."
<p>
<p>Still the main theory is that out of the bubbling primordial soup, life received the spark which
caught and which has burned to this day. But even this makes academics uncomfortable. "What makes it
slightly worrying is the speed which it happened," said one scientist. Life in a mere 1,000 million
years.
<p>
<p>Eventually, of course, it led to humankind and the search into space. Astronomers have always been
fascinated by the Red Planet - at the end of the last century, Giovanni Schiaparelli thought he saw
canals on Mars built by sentinent beings. The chase was taken up by Percival Lowell who mapped a
criss-crossing network and decided there was an advanced civilisation across the way and that they
were desperate for water.
<p>
<p>By 1976 the US was in a position to check what was on the planet. Although an earlier Mariner
Mission had photographed it from space, the two Viking probes would actually land and use a
spectrometer to beam back analysis of the surface. The probes went in and took their readings, which
when transmitted to Earth caused enormous excitment which quickly faded into the dull realisation that
the probes said no, the planet was dead. The world, which had feared for its existence in the face of
aliens, almost seemed to fall into a state of loneliness. "It was the equivalent of somebody landing a
spacecraft in the middle of the Gobi desert and saying that there is no life on earth," said Douglas
Millard, assistant curator of the Science Museum in London.
<p>
<p>For Hoyle and Wickramasinghe the failure of the Viking probes knelled the death of the scientific
establishment's interest in their work. All talk of other life in the solar system was scoffed at and
research moved on to other things. For the scientists, a life's work being trashed was hard to bear.
"It came to the point where we were not getting listened to at meetings," said Wickramasinghe.
<p>
<p>But, back on Earth, scientists were busy collecting rubbish in the most pristine area of the
planet. While the Apollo moon landings are high on the list of the most dramatic events on history
they were also giving a perfect analysis of the makeup of the Moon. The Viking landings had done the
same for Mars. Now the scientists, as far as rock, dust and air goes, knew what was there.
<p>
<p>Bill Cassidy was battling the vicious Antartic weather as he and his team of American colleagues
embarked on a very strange Easter egg hunt. They were wandering the freezing wastes of the Allan
Hills looking for meteors from Mars. The idea that pieces of another planet could be on Earth had long
seemed absurd, a fantasy of the lunatic fringe. But then after the Apollo missions a meteor was proved
by analysis to have come from the Moon, its qualities matched material brought home by astronauts.
<p>
<p>The same went for Mars. Viking had sent back quality readings which allowed researchers to be sure
whether a piece of rock came from the distant planet. The team found a melon-sized piece of rock which
was quickly dispatched back to Houston.
<p>
<p>The process by which the rock had found its way to earth was a amazing. About 15 million years ago
a giant asteroid ploughed into Mars, cutting into the planet's surface and throwing up vast amounts of
the surface. One chunk, ALH84001, found itself floating around in space. It stayed there until about
13,000 years ago when the Earth's gravity grabbed and pulled it in and it buried deep into the Allan
Hills' ice.
<p>
<p>Back at Houston the rock was split up and sent around the globe to be analysed by every scientist
who had an interest. "The strange thing is that it seems to have been forgotten about," said
Pillinger. But finally they started to test for organic materials and something unexpected turned up:
"A number of minerological features observed in the rock, [that] may be evidence of ancient Martian
micro-organisims."
<p>
<p>The scientists were keen to stamp on suggestions that this was any proof that life is seeded from
the heavens or, in some cases, that this was proof of anything at all. "If, after much more
investigation, it proves to be true that life did - or does - exist on Mars then that is a truly
amazing discovery," said one. "It also should be pointed out that the critters were buried under rock
almost 3.6 million years ago."
<p>
<p>Mars is a hell of a place. For a third of the year sandstorms blanket the surface, the poles are a
mixture of permanently frozen ice and carbon dioxide, and even at its best the temperature rarely
rises above minus 25 degrees.
<p>
<p>But there is a group of scientists who have been discovering life in the strangest places.
Biologists were shocked to find life close to the ocean floor, near the mouths of volcanoes. Down
there the pressure is extreme, the temperatures well over 100 degrees and there is none of the
sunshine that makes the rest of us glow. "The essential ingredient is water," said Millard.
<p>
<p>Quite apart from their size, our little neighbours have a couple of other problems. Many scientists
believe that if they were alive, they have long since gone. Although there is still hope that they can
survive underground or near some of the planet's volcanoes, looking across the homeland now seems a
little bleak.
<p>
<p>Of course, to find out for sure American's cash-strapped space agency will have to send some
missions out there and they have quite a programme lined up. There have been a number of suggestions,
which no scientists will put their names to, that Nasa might be after funding.
<p>
<p>After years of being attacked Hoyle is urging caution while saying that if the claims are true it
is wonderful. Wickramasinghe was less charitable, hoping that those who attacked them would get over
the "psychological response to accepting that there is life outside the earth". Others say that if it
is life then it is far too early to say where it came from, but even Wickramasinghe would agree with
that. "The ultimate source of life is still an unscratched surface," he says.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Juan Carlos</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>What until yesterday was the Las Nieves campsite is now a desolate place. A bombsite, an  earthquake, 'Apocalypse Now' rolled into one. Soldiers, police, ambulances, helicopters taking off and  landing continually.  Rivers where once were plains, crushed cars instead of trees, fallen trees in place of caravans.  And rocks, thousands of rocks.  <p>  <p>The half-light of early morning reveals dozens of silhouettes staggering amid the remnants of the  catastrophe. Some look for their cars. Others for the spot where they pitched their tents. Some seek  their children. Nobody responds to their calls.  <p>  <p>The silhouette of a woman stands out clearly in the mud. She is face down and has something in her  arms. She moves. But nobody doubts that she is dead. When they turn the body over, life stirs  miraculously. The baby, barely two months old, is alive. Its eyes are shut and it spits mud from its  little mouth.  <p>  <p>Its mother does not want to let her go. Although her heart has stopped beating, her arms still  stoutly defend her child. With tears in their eyes the men separate the living from the dead.  <p>  <p>Francois, half-crazed, his clothes in tatters and his eyes open unnaturally wide, stops everyone he  comes across on the road to show them the crumpled photo of his wife and daughter. He splutters their  names in all the languages he knows. Desperately, he clutches the chest of the civil guard trying to  calm him. "No, no, leave me. They're there, I know it. In that tree. She was holding on tight and my  little one..."  <p>  <p>Francois falls silent. He looks on the point of tears, remembering how the water carried away his  daughter. He shuts his eyes and lets himself be led away quietly to the car.  <p>  <p>Carolina is the only one who seems mad with happiness. She was lucky. With her hair tangled in her  eyes she hugs and kisses her dog which barely has the strength to wag its tail. She refuses to be  separated from it. She calls it by its name, laughs hysterically, talks confusedly. Nobody knows  anything about her, if she was alone or with others.  <p>  <p>A man from Burgos searches among the shattered furniture without a word. He arrived this morning  and has checked all the hospitals, hotels and reception centres in the area in a vain search for his  three-year-old nephew. He looks fearfully to the bottom of the hillside. Something tells him that he  is down there.  <p>  <p>As the day progresses, the 'harvest' of bodies diminishes. Beside the main road alone they have  found about 20. If there are more, they could take days to turn up. News arrives of a body found 10  miles away, floating in the marshes where the Gallego river passes through Sabinanigo.  <p>  <p>The search now concentrates on this area. Most of the rescuers fear the worst. If the force of the  current has managed to sweep bodies so far away, it is possible that the reservoir is full of them.  <p>  <p>Juan Carlos de la Cal is a correspondent for El Mundo.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Julia Hayley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The death toll in the Spanish Pyrenees campsite disaster rose to 75 last night with half as many  holidaymakers still missing.  <p>  <p>Torrential rain sent an avalanche of water, mud and rocks sweeping through the site, wrecking cars,  caravans and tents in minutes.  <p>  <p>More than 150 people, including at least three Britons, were injured at the Virgen de las Nieves -  Virgin of the Snows - resort near the mountain town of Biescas.  <p>  <p>Rescue workers found some bodies 10 miles from the camping area and officials feared more could  still lie downstream in the River Gailego. The remains of mangled cars and flattened caravans were  carried half a mile in the torrent.  <p>  <p>As water and debris engulfed the site, which had been filled to capacity with 700 tourists, some  holidaymakers saved themselves by clinging to trees. Antonio Espinosa described how he gave up helping  others and saved his own life. "I ran to try to help a girl. But a time comes when it's either you or  them. I got out alive, but I don't know what happened to the girl." Briton Barry Copestake, aged 49,  who was injured with his wife Andree, aged 47, told ITN: "The torrent came down and just took the car  and swept it away... we were upside down in the water for 400 metres and eventually we came to a  standstill. Andree was trapped and eventually rescued." Another survivor said: "It began to rain like  we'd never seen before. We managed, with the water up to our waist, to reach the toilets and climb on  to the roof. That saved us."  <p>  <p>Disaster struck at about 8pm on Wednesday. A storm was expected but no one predicted the flood.  <p>  <p>The Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, who interrupted his holiday to survey the damage,  said: "I have flown over the area - it's a dreadful sight."  <p>  <p>King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia flew to the disaster area from their holiday palace in Palma de  Mallorca.  <p>  <p>Twenty-eight of the dead had been identified last night, all Spanish. German, French and Belgian  holidaymakers were thought to be among the victims.  <p>  <p>Adrian Cox, a spokesman for the British consulate, said that at least 14 Britons were at the site.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Holidaymakers killed by flash flood at Pyrenees campsite  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>10 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Questions start over Pyrenees camp tragedy   </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Harrison</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The region of Aragon declared three days of mourning yesterday for the holidaymakers at a Pyrenees  campsite who were swept to their deaths by flash floods on Wednesday.  With the death toll standing at 76 so far, the debate was concentrating on how the disaster at Las  Nieves could have been prevented.  <p>  <p>The meteorological office had warned of heavy storms due in the area. A children's summer camp 12  miles away from Las Nieves had been evacuated as a precaution, it emerged, but Las Nieves and sites  nearby were not. Both the meteorological office and the civil protection department were adamant that  this type of storm was highly localised. "These storms are very difficult to pinpoint exactly. It  could rain very hard 10km away, and where you are nothing falls at all," said Juan San Nicolas  Santamaria, the civil protection director.  <p>  <p>The camp was built 12 years ago in a fold of the Pyrenees beside the Gallego river where it is  joined by the smaller Aras, which runs from the mountains behind the site.  <p>  <p>The flow of the Aras is controlled by man-made barriers. Experts have suggested that trees and  rocks which were washed down by the rain might have built up behind a barrier, creating a temporary  dam until the whole structure gave way, unleashing the flood on campers below.  <p>  <p>"The campsite had an excellent reputation and no one had questioned its set-up," said Santiago  Lanzuela, governor of the Aragon region. Francisco Ayala, a director of the Technical and Geo-mining  Institute, was less sure. He told the Spanish news agency Efe: "A campsite like Las Nieves on the  flood plain of a potentially torrential river... is the chronicle of a catastrophe foretold."  <p>  <p>At Jaca, a Pyrenees resort town near Biescas, 90 miles east of Pamplona, the bodies of the dead -  dug out of the mud and marshes - were arriving in white plastic bags throughout the day. They were  carried down steep stone steps to the local ice rink for identification.  <p>  <p>In half an hour three bodies were found 1,000 yards from the Las Nieves campsite. At least two more  were found near the dam in Sabinanigo, nine miles away.  <p>  <p>In the bustle at the rink at Jaca, it was not difficult to pick out the relatives of victims. They  were the ones with red-rimmed eyes and a frightened stare.  <p>  <p>As a bag was opened and a name put to a muddy and often disfigured face, the tears would run down  creased, crushed faces. "No, no! Por Dios, No!" cried a frantic woman in her forties. She stumbled and  was helped to a chair by at least five people.  <p>  <p>A young man in his twenties sat staring ahead in silence, wild-eyed with incomprehension and grief.  "His mother and his father," said a Red Cross worker, his own eyes moist. "How can this happen when  you are on holiday?" Other relatives were still waiting. But yesterday the talk was no longer about  survivors, though rescue workers kept digging.  <p>  <p>Most of the 657 campers registered at the site have now been accounted for - though an official  noted it was difficult to know how many others might have been in the area when the storm hit.  <p>  <p>Unofficial estimates said 20 people could still be missing. About 40 were still in hospital. All of  the identified victims were Spaniards except for two, a French girl and a Dutch man, the national  civil protection department said.  <p>  <p>The British embassy said it had located 14 British holidaymakers who had been at the site. They had  only minor injuries.  <p>  <p>Roy Ward, a statistics lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University, yesterday revisited the site. He  and his wife Ann, a catering assistant, and their two children - Oliver, nine, and Rhea, six - were in  their caravan when the torrent swept it away.  <p>  <p>"My son shouted, 'We're going to die' and I said, 'No we're not son'. But watching the news today,  some kids have. Mine haven't, so I am lucky," he said. The caravan came to a halt when it crashed into  a tree.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Two trains collide on main west coast line</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Trains collide in 'blinding flash'</h2>
<h3>Experts hope 'black box' will provide clues  </h3><br>By <b>David Connett</b><br><br>


<p>
<p>Rail crash experts were last night trying to discover how two trains were involved in a collision
which killed a woman and injured 69 people, four seriously.
<p>
<p>Investigators hope to retrieve two aviation-style 'black boxes' from the wreckage today. The boxes
could tell them what happened. It is thought to be the first time they have featured in a rail crash
inquiry.
The Health and Safety Executive said two inspectors from HM Railway Inspectorate had also been sent
to the scene.
<p>
<p>Railtrack sources said the investigation would focus on why two trains were travelling on the same
line. Initial reports said the empty southbound train was changing tracks at a cross-over point south
of Watford Junction, Hertfordshire, when it and the crowded 5.04pm from Euston to Milton Keynes
collided. Emergency services fought to release up to 40 passengers who were trapped inside one
carriage.
<p>
<p>Experts said the empty train appeared to be correctly crossing to a safe track when the full
passenger train struck it. They speculated that the packed train either received a faulty signal or
passed a warning signal. Witnesses reported that the driver and the guard of the empty train threw
themselves out of the cab when they realised a crash was inevitable. The line on which the accident
occurred is the main west coast line between London and Glasgow. It is expected to be closed for 24-48
hours. Bryan Leaker, commercial director of North London Railways, the company which runs both
services, said: "It was the empty train that was crossing over the line. The two trains normally run
every day and neither of them was running late yesterday. It's standard practice to move from one line
to another when we are moving rolling stock. There's signalling to detect any problem but we are not
aware of any work going on in the area. There will be a full investigation.
<p>
<p>"Using signalling that's in place, mostly likely one of the trains would have stopped and the other
would have passed. I don't know which of these trains would normally have waited."
<p>
<p>Peter Rayner, a former BR manager who was in charge of the West Coast Main Line for six years,
said: "Because the track is owned by Railtrack, the trains are owned by someone else, and the driver
employed by someone else, we are in a situation where to conduct an inquiry is so much more difficult
because everyone wants to protect their own interests.
<p>
<p>"The big weakness is that no longer is there one railway authority to take its own inquiry and feed
that to the Health and Safety Executive. They are all now tainted with commercialism."
<p>
<p>Sir George Young, the Transport Secretary, expressed "my deepest sympathies for the families of the
dead and injured" and praised the rescue services. He pledged that the investigation findings would be
made public. Witnesses to the crash said carriages smashed into the overhead power lines when the
impact forced them off the rails. There was "an incredibly loud bang and a blinding flash".
<p>
<p>One injured passenger described how he was thrown across the carriage. Mick, a builder from Milton
Keynes, said: "There was a huge bang and a crash as the wheels of another carriage came through the
window. People were flying everywhere. When it stopped there was blood pouring down the faces of
people near the broken window. Someone smashed the window of the emergency door and opened it but the
overhead wires were wrapped round the train and still sparking.
There was a girl with a broken ankle who had to be carried on to the track but most of the other
people were able to walk."
<p>
<p>As they walked away, he said, they saw a carriage on its side. "We could see about 40 people in it.
They could not get out but very soon firemen were there helping them."
<p>
<p>Police said 69 people were taken to hospital, included 64 to the Watford General. Fourteen were
detained, including a pregnant woman, and four with serious injuries. One passenger with a serious head
injury was evacuated to a London hospital.
<p>
<p>The dead woman's body was retrieved from the wreckage four hours after the collision. David Larkin,
chief executive of the Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire Ambulance Service, said a search of the
carriages and the surrounding area was continuing. "Sixty people were trapped in the carriages
although 40 were able to get out on their own. Others had to be rescued with the assistance," he said.
<p>
<p>British Transport Police said between 300 and 400 people were travelling on the train.
<p>
<p>An injured commuter told how the impact threw him around the carriage "like a pea in a concrete
mixer".
<p>
<p>Barry Keates, aged 61, a group personnel officer with a London firm, was in the front carriage. He
suffered a broken arm and later had stitches for a gashed forehead.
He said he was on his way home to Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire. "I knew the train was in trouble
at the very last minute because the driver started to sound his horn and sound it increasingly," he
said.
<p>
<p>"Then we felt the brakes come on and there was just a tremendous bang. The carriage tipped on to
its right. We were thrown about in all directions. It was like being a pea in a concrete mixer. When
we stood up we were standing on the windows."
<p>
<p>Passenger groups and unions have warned that the West Coast Main Line is "worn out" and
"cash-strapped".
<p>
<p>Commuter and long distance services out of Euston have been subject to serious disruption over the
past year with speed restrictions in place on both North London Railways and the West Coast Main Line
because of the poor condition of the track.
<p>
<p>The main rail union, the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers union, warned this year that the
track running through Harrow and Wealdstone station would collapse unless urgent repair work was done.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Two trains collide on main west coast line</b><br><br><br><b><h2>14 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>'No blame' in rail crash  </h2>
<br>By <b>Rebecca Smithers</b><br><br>


<p>
<p>Labour last night called for Railtrack to be stripped of its safety responsibilities, after the
privatised track authority concluded in an internal report that no one was to blame for a fatal train
crash at Stafford in March.
<p>
<p>Two people died and 22 were injured after a derailed freight train was struck by a Royal Mail
train. Both trains belonged to privatised operators bought by the US railroad company Wisconsin
Central.
<p>
<p>The internal report - leaked yesterday to Labour - was carried out for Railtrack's Midlands zone
and the operators by a private rail safety consultant.
<p>
<p>It has concluded that none of the parties involved was to blame for the accident, which it says was
caused by a broken axle on one of the freight wagons. Railtrack would only say last night that it was
waiting "for the results of the Health and Safety Executive's detailed investigation". Labour's
transport spokeswoman, Glenda Jackson, said: "It is quite amazing that Railtrack has concluded no one
is to be held responsible for such a serious accident."
<p>
<p>The report had fully justified concerns that following privatisation operators would seek to avoid
blame for incidents, she added. "We are again calling for the removal of Railtrack's responsibility
for investigating all serious safety issues and for that responsibility to be placed in the hands of a
fully independent safety executive."
<p>
<p>Railtrack has also delayed its initial conclusions about the cause of last Thursday's rail
collision near Watford Junction until next month. 
<p>
<p>* The rail regulator, John Swift, yesterday ordered significant changes in rail penalty fares procedures after complaints from passengers that some
on-the-spot fines have been draconian.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mark Tran</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The beleaguered tobacco industry last night suffered a legal setback when a Florida jury awarded  damages to a couple who sued Brown & Williamson, an American subsidiary of BAT, the British tobacco  giant.  <p>  <p>The only previous occassion on which a court ordered a tobacco company to pay up in a liability  suit occurred in 1988 in the Cippollone case. But that $400,000 (&#163;265,000) award was overturned  on appeal and the suit was dropped in 1992. The Florida case will almost certainly go to an appeals court. In at  least 19 liability suits, the industry has not yet had to pay a penny in damages.  <p>  <p>Word of the verdict sent shares of Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco down sharply. "This is a severe  blow to the industry," said Allan Kaplan, a tobacco analyst with Merrill Lynch. "We knew that when you  keep running cases, some jury is going to vote in favour of the plaintiff." The six-member jury in  Jacksonville ruled in favour of Grady Carter, aged 66, of Orange Park, Florida, awarding him $500,000,  and his wife, Millie, $250,000 in damages. The case, which was brought against American Tobacco, a  unit of Brown & Williamson, alleged that Mr Grady contracted lung cancer from smoking and that he was  misled by advertising into thinking that smoking was safe.  <p>  <p>The jury deliberated for nine-and-a-half hours over two days. The foreman, Samuel Gaskins, said  that the panel reviewed medical articles and technical documents, including material from Brown &  Williamson.  <p>  <p>Mr Carter, a retired air traffic controller, said: "Somebody needed to take these people on. A lot  of people are dying because of lung cancer." Brown & Williamson had argued that Mr Carter was aware of  the dangers but continued to smoke until he became ill in 1991. "He continued smoking Lucky Strikes  because he liked them," said tobacco company lawyer Bruce Sheffler, adding that Mr Carter only stopped  when he started coughing up blood. The tobacco industry is besieged by lawsuits. Several states are  demanding billions of dollars in compensation for health costs incurred by tobacco-related illness.  The Florida case was the first of a barrage of similar cases scheduled for this and next year in  Jacksonville. Mr Carter's attorney, Norwood Wilner, represents 60 clients with suits against tobacco  companies.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Lisa Buckingham</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The tobacco-to-insurance group, BAT Industries, will next month discuss whether to split its  operations into two after last week's US court ruling which found it guilty of causing lung cancer.  <p>  <p>Shares in BAT yesterday plunged 45p to 464p - cutting the company's stock market value by almost  &#163;1.4bn - following the decision to award nearly &#163;500,000 in damages to an long standing  smoker who developed lung cancer.  <p>  <p>A Florida jury decided last Friday in favour of retired air traffic controller Grady Carter and his  wife against Brown & Williamson, a BAT subsidiary. Mr Carter, 66, had been a smoker for 44 years, most  of that time as a consumer of Lucky Strikes.  <p>  <p>He claimed BAT had been negligent not to warn of the health damage associated with cigarette  smoking.  <p>  <p>BAT said it was confident, as in other cases, of overturning the judgment on appeal. If the group  fails, however, it will be the first time a tobacco company has been forced to pay damages. Industry  sources are concerned that a host of similar lawsuits might follow.  <p>  <p>"The case doesn't make the industry culpable," said Martin Feldman, an analyst at Smith Barney, the  American stockbroking group. "It will be overturned."  <p>  <p>Analysts said yesterday that internal documents used in the latest case should not have been  allowed as part of the trial. An appeal was therefore likely to succeed.  <p>  <p>But US companies are feeling the pressure from at least ten state governments which are suing to  recover the alleged billions of dollars they have spent nursing smokers under their Medicaid budgets.  <p>  <p>The shares in other cigarette producers such as RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris were also savaged  after the judgment.  <p>  <p>BAT admitted that it might look at spinning off its financial services operations - which include  Farmers in the US and Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar in Britain - at some stage.  <p>  <p>But a spokesman said the latest US court ruling would not dictate policy - even though BAT has a  history of amending its corporate structure as a result of outside influences such as James  Goldsmith's &#163;13.5bn break up bid.  <p>  <p>A BAT spokesman said, however, that directors were convinced that additional shareholder value  could be created from combining insurance and tobaccos. The decision on Friday was "a rogue verdict,  not a trend", the company said.  <p>  <p>BAT found itself in court after acquiring Lucky Strike cigarettes which were part of the portfolio  of American Tobacco which was acquired by the British group early last year.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mandy Allwood is revealed to be carrying Britain's first octuplets </b><br><br><br><b><h2>12 August  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Woman could die bearing octuplets</h2><h3>Multiple births risk complications   </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Luisa Dillner</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Mandy Allwood could be risking her life if she continues to carry eight foetuses in her pregnancy. Kypros Nicolaides, her obstetrician at King's College hospital, London, has warned her that not  only is it unlikely any of the octuplets will survive but also that multiple births increase the risks  of many of the complications of pregnancy.  <p>  <p>A recent confidential inquiry into maternal mortality in Britain found that most deaths were due to  thrombosis, haemorrhage during or after birth, and eclampsia, a condition in which blood pressure  rises and can lead to seizures and coma.  <p>  <p>"She has an increased risk of everything," said Nicki Whittaker, obstetrician and gynaecolgist at  St Michael's hospital, Bristol. "Not only is she more at risk from the biggest killers in pregnancy,  but she will suffer from anaemia, nausea and breathlessness. The mechanical effects of having an  abdomen full of eight babies are going to be enormous." Although doctors are reluctant to rule out a  miracle, the outcome for octuplets has never been successful. In Britain Susan Halton gave birth to  four boys and three girls in 1987 after in-vitro fertilisation. All died within days. In recent times,  the highest number of successful births has been six. Jan and Graham Walton had sextuplet daughters in  1984 after infertility treatment. In 1993 Jean Vince gave birth to five girls and a boy after refusing  a selective abortion.  <p>  <p>Ms Allwood, aged 31, took infertility drugs, prescribed by her GP, to stimulate egg production.  They caused super-ovulation: more than the optimal number of eggs (usually fewer than four) was  produced and released by the ovaries. Her GP is reported to have warned her not to have sex, but she  ignored that advice. Two of the foetuses are thought to be twins. Women who undergo such treatment are  normally monitored by ultrasound scans to ensure that super-ovulation does not occur.  <p>  <p>For pregnancies created outside the body and reimplanted at embryo stage, potential foetuses are  restricted by law to three. Usually only one or two successfully implant. Doctors often recommend  selective abortion in the case of triplets because the risk of premature delivery is so high. "Once  the uterus gets to a certain size it tends to go into labour," says Tim Mould, obstetrician and  gynaecolgist at the Whittington hospital, London. "The risk rises with the number of foetuses you have.  Obviously you cannot fit eight eight-pound babies into one abdomen. It's unlikely that this pregnancy  could go on past 28 weeks."  <p>  <p>If Ms Allwood does continue her pregnancy the babies would have to be delivered by caesarean  section. In multiple births, the second and any subsequent babies are often not in the right position  for a vaginal delivery.  <p>  <p>"If she prematurely went into labour, an emergency caesarian section involving eight babies would  be a nightmare," Dr Whittaker said. Ms Allwood would be highly likely to bleed heavily after the  birth. Much of the surface of her womb would be covered by placenta, leaving lots of potentially raw  areas to bleed once the afterbirth was removed. Since the womb would be abnormally large, it would be  floppier than usual after the birth and unable to contract to its normal size. This would also  increase the risk of heavy bleeding.  <p>  <p>She might loose some of the octuplets naturally, but this usually happens early in multiple  pregnancies, before individual heart beats can be identified.  <p>  <p>Dr Luisa Dillner is the Guardian's health editor.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mandy Allwood is revealed to be carrying Britain's first octuplets </b><br><br><br><b><h2>13 August  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Stop the freak show</h2>
<h3>Fertility issues deserve an informed  debate  </h3><br><b>Leading article</b>  <br><br><br>      <p>The unfolding saga of Mandy Allwood reflects to no one's advantage. First, we have the unedifying  spectacle of a woman hawking the contents of her womb in Max Clifford's 'marketplace'. Her reasoning  includes ludicrous statements such as wanting "nature to take its course" (after injections of  powerful fertility drugs) as she rejects medical advice that unless she reduces the number of  foetuses, she runs a high risk of losing all of them and her own life. Remember, she already has one  five-year-old child who needs its mother. This is an absurd and irresponsible distortion of a woman's  right to choose.  <p>  <p>The second absurdity is that of the pressure group, Life, supporting Ms Allwood because their  absolutist respect for the sacredness of human life is such that they are prepared to run the risk of  eight dead foetuses and a dead mother. Third, add to this circus the ghoulish News of the World and  Max Clifford with their 'sliding scale' fee to Ms Allwood for the number of babies she manages to  produce. A plague on all their houses. What is serious is that for the second time in two weeks the  enormously complex and difficult questions surrounding fertility treatment have been reduced to the  level of a freak show. Last week, Professor Nicolaides, the head of foetal medicine at King's College,  London, and the consultant in the Allwood case pleaded in the Guardian for an intelligent, informed,  dispassionate debate. He said he and his colleagues were "daily tortured" by the ethical dilemmas  which advances in fertility technology were throwing up. He wants society to participate and  contribute as to how these dilemmas should be resolved. What he gets instead is a emotive accusations  of doctors "playing God". (If that means they have decisions over life and death, that is exactly the  judgment we expect of doctors in an enormous variety of medical circumstances.)  <p>  <p>The medical details with which we have been provided in Ms Allwood's case raise important  questions. Why did a woman who has had a child, an abortion and a miscarriage in six years need  powerful fertility drugs? Should a woman be given such drugs without the involvement of her partner?  Infertility pressure groups rightly point out that the impression of 'off-the-shelf' fertility  treatment is misleading. Thousands of couples are disappointed every year because of restrictions on  funding, availability and questions of suitability. As the rate of infertility rises - one in six  couples now need medical treatment to have a child - the real issue is how to increase the  availability of fertility treatment.  <p>  <p>But the Allwood case appears to raise one area of genuine concern. Strict guidelines on  counselling, and investigation into the circumstances of the future parents is part of standard  procedure of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) clinics which are tightly regulated by the Human  Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). So it should be with all fertility drugs. Even  clomythene, which can be routinely prescribed by a GP, can be powerful enough to produce triplets or  quads. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have guidelines for the use of fertility  drugs including metrodin, which can only be prescribed in specialist hospital units. They emphasise  the importance of the welfare of any future child and any existing children, and for the need for  couples to be counselled as to the risks of multiple pregnancies. There are still too many multiple  births, and many of them are attributed to fertility drugs. The question is: how closely are these  guidelines being followed? And has Mandy Allwood driven a coach and horses through them?  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mandy Allwood is revealed to be carrying Britain's first octuplets </b><br><br><br><b><h2>13 August  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Conception of a multiple nightmare</h2><h3>Debate on press deal and pregnancy overwhelms  couple</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Vivek Chaudhary</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Mandy Allwood, in hiding in an Oxford hotel with her partner Paul Hudson, woke up yesterday to face  the full effects of the deal in which she has sold her story to a Sunday newspaper.  <p>  <p>Graphic reports about her personal and business life, an alleged police investigation into a petrol  fraud and comments from her family calling her a "money grabber" have appeared in national newspapers  over the past two days. For Ms Allwood, it is all in stark contrast to the events of May, when she  discovered that she was pregnant, marking the end of a two-year trauma in which her desire to have a  baby with Mr Hudson dominated her life. Ms Allwood met Paul Hudson in 1992, when she was working for  General Accident Property Services. Both were involved in other relationships - Ms Allwood was married  to Simon Pugh with whom she had a son named Charlie in 1991 and Mr Hudson was living with his partner  Maria Edwards. The son of Jamaican immigrants, Mr Hudson was the epitome of the 1980s yuppie, a  flamboyant young businessman who cruised nightclubs in his gold BMW and had a bit of a reputation as a  'ladies man'. He ran his own lettings company, called Chunkmonster Property, in Birmingham, and made  the bulk of his money during the 1980s property boom.  <p>  <p>Ms Allwood was responsible for letting out some of Mr Hudson's properties and the two became close  as Mr Hudson's business went from strength to strength. Their relationship is believed to have started  after he asked her to manage his company in 1993.  <p>  <p>"I liked the way she operated. She was really professional and really impressed me," Mr Hudson told  the News of the World on Sunday. After leaving her husband in 1994, Ms Allwood and Charlie moved into  a Solihull flat next door to Mr Hudson. The couple soon ran into personal and professional problems.  Mr Hudson's business folded in 1995, leaving him and Ms Allwood unemployed and reliant on state  benefits for survival, although both continued to drive their BMWs.  <p>  <p>Described by friends as besotted with Mr Hudson, Ms Allwood became desperate to have his child and  thought that her prayers had been answered when she became pregnant last October. Two months later Ms  Allwood lost the child and spent Christmas in hospital recovering.  <p>  <p>Fraught with the worry that she might never be able to give birth again, Ms Allwood became  determined to have Mr Hudson's child and last April went to see her GP, asking if she could be  prescribed fertility drugs. The doctor treated Ms Allwood with a seven-day course of the hormone  metrodine, which is injected into the arm, and Pregnyl tablets, which have to be taken at the same  time. She was warned not to resume a full sexual relationship while on the drugs because she ran the  risk of a multiple pregnancy. The advice went unheeded.  <p>  <p>Mr Hudson was unaware that Ms Allwood was undergoing fertility treatment but when she told him he  ordered her to stop taking the drugs after two days of the seven-day course.  <p>  <p>The couple continued to have sex and in May Ms Allwood brought a home pregnancy kit which confirmed  what she had been waiting for so long to hear - that the test was positive and she was pregnant.  <p>  <p>It was not until July, however, that hospital scans revealed that there were eight babies. Mr  Hudson approached Central Television and it was Central's reaction that brought home to him the impact  and value of the story. After speaking with his solicitor, he was advised to contact Max Clifford. He  took the couple to the News of the World to negotiate a deal. Mr Clifford said: "They approached me at  the beginning of last week to tell me that this story was about to break, that people were aware that  it was going to happen. So they came in to see me and I have tried to get together a package that  would be of maximum benefit to all those involved." The nature of the story meant that a special deal  had to be worked out, effectively linking the amount of money the couple receive to the number of  babies that will be born alive. While neither Mr Clifford nor the News of the World will confirm the  money involved, it is believed that the couple still stand to make at least &#163;100,000 if none of  the babies is born. If all the babies are born they could make up to &#163;1m for their story and  sponsorship.  <p>  <p>Stuart Kuttner, managing editor of the News of the World, who was one of the key figures in  negotiations, said yesterday there was no fine print linking the number of babies to the amount of  money.  <p>  <p>He told Radio 4's Today programme: "There is no step by step or contingency element whatsoever in  the contract. The last thing the News of the World would want is for her to take any risk herself or  to the children. We are not that kind of business."  <p>  <p>One thing the couple probably never expected was national newspapers competing to expose the most  personal details of their lives. Ms Allwood's sister Jackie Burgess is quoted in yesterday's Daily  Mail as saying: "Mandy is infatuated with [Paul] but I don't think even having Paul's babies would  keep him. I just want her to be careful - her health is already suffering." Ms Burgess added: "Mandy  is a very strong character and very ambitious herself. You meet someone with property and money and  your head gets turned."  <p>  <p>Other newspapers claimed that the couple have county court judgments against them for failing to  pay debts totalling almost &#163;2,000. According to reports, the couple have run up debts at four  different addresses and Ms Allwood has applied for credit cards at least four times under her own name  and five times under her married name.  <p>  <p>The Daily Mirror claimed that Ms Allwood and her partner are to be questioned by police over a  number of petrol thefts in the Midlands area. And then there is Mr Hudson's relationship with Marie  Edwards, whom he met in a nightclub in 1991, and Ms Allwood's former marriage to Mr Pugh. Ms Edwards  and Mr Hudson are reported to live together in Leicestershire and have a son called Kane, now aged  two, and Zack, aged seven months, who was born while Mr Hudson was also seeing Ms Allwood. News of her  multiple pregnancy has, according to friends, left Ms Edwards upset and stunned. Some reports claim  that she was unaware that he was having a relationship with another woman.  <p>  <p>"She definitely has no intention of sharing Paul with Mandy - or anyone else for that matter," one  report said.  <p>  <p>Mr Pugh, a plasterer, claims he has spent thousands of pounds fighting court battles for access to  his son and Ms Allwood was having an affair with Mr Hudson while she was still married to him, which  she denies. Ms Allwood's mother, Marion, who lives in Coventry, says she has disowned her daughter  because of her relationship with Mr Hudson and found out about the multiple pregnancy only in the  press. "She has caused us so much hurt. She had a good home and a loving family but she turned her  back on us."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tories unveil their 'demon eyes' poster campaign to much condemnation </b><br><br><br><b><h2>13  August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Church criticises Tory 'demon Blair' ads</h2><h3>'Puerile' use of satanic imagery  endangers party's £10m campaign with angry backlash  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rebecca Smithers</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Conservative Party's &#163;10m pre-election campaign strategy was thrown into turmoil last  night, as Church leaders warned that the use of "satanic" imagery in its latest advertising campaign  was potentially dangerous.  <p>  <p>The advertisement, which portrays Labour leader Tony Blair as a 'demon' with burning red eyes, was  unveiled at the weekend in three Sunday newspapers as the latest phase of the Tories' New Labour, New  Danger campaign. The eyes are the same as those used in an earlier poster campaign, when they were  shown peering through a pair of curtains, and are underlined with shadow cabinet member Clare Short's  recent comments about New Labour: "It's a lie and it's dangerous".  <p>  <p>In an unusual political intervention, the Anglican Bishop of Oxford, the Rt Rev Richard Harries,  claimed that the use of such material was not only puerile and silly but could prove harmful. He urged  all political parties not to resort to "dirty tricks" in their campaigning, but to concentrate on the  main issues facing the country.  <p>  <p>Even Tories were privately surprised after party sources dismissed the bishop's complaint, saying  the poster was not intended to appeal to the "sneering so-called intellectuals of Islington" but was a  graphic way of making a point.  <p>  <p>Labour's election campaigns manager Peter Mandelson retorted: "To show such contempt for the Bishop  of Oxford shows how deep in the gutter the Tories are and how completely out of touch they are with  ordinary, decent opinion in Britain."  <p>  <p>In his statement, Bishop Harries said: "Vilifying members of other political parties is a puerile  exercise and when that vilifying draws on satanic imagery it is not only silly but potentially  dangerous."  <p>  <p>Casting his message further afield, he said: "As the election draws near, I hope all parties will  resist the temptation to go in for personal abuse and dirty tricks and concentrate on some of the  important issues the country needs to consider at this time."  <p>  <p>Later George Austin, the Archdeacon of York, added his voice to the criticism, saying the poster  was deeply offensive and that the Conservatives were heading in the direction of American political  propaganda. "They really are plumbing the depths with this. The whole Tory propaganda is unpleasant. I  just wonder how far it is going to go before the election." He thought the devil imagery was  particularly distasteful, saying "this is not the way to treat someone whose religious beliefs you  respect". Tory backbencher Sir Teddy Taylor earlier warned party leaders they were wrong to  concentrate on "negative" campaigning by attacking the Opposition. "Perhaps we're making the mistake  of constantly attacking Mr Blair and the Labour Party," the leading Eurosceptic told the BBC.  <p>  <p>One senior Tory said: "I have to admit that I feel very uncomfortable with this campaign and I  think we ignore the views of religious leaders at our peril."  <p>  <p>The Liberal Democrats also leaped to Labour's defence. Lord Holme, Liberal Democrat general  election chairman, said his party was "appalled" by the latest advertising ploy, attempting to  demonise Mr Blair.  <p>  <p>"This sort of crude character assassination, which is reminiscent of Dr Goebbels, is unfortunately  all too typical of the Tory party at bay. Most decent people, in all parties, will deplore it and it  will probably boomerang against Conservative Central Office."  <p>  <p>Mr Mandelson pointed to the results of research carried out by Labour yesterday morning, in which  40 per cent of respondents said the advertisement had made them less favourable towards the Tories,  while only four per cent said it made them more so. The fears expressed about the satanic imagery were  confirmed by the poll, where two-thirds of those questioned said they thought the advert was  'untruthful and misleading' and portrayed Mr Blair as 'devil-like or evil'.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tories unveil their 'demon eyes' poster campaign to much condemnation </b><br><br><br><b><h2>17  August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Tories pitch 'Vatman' against 'demon'</h2><h3>Advertising watchdog says satanic  image may breach code of practice  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rebecca Smithers</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The controversy over the Tory advertisement demonising Tony Blair escalated yesterday, when the  party's former communications chief, Hugh Colver, said the image was unpleasant and ineffective.  <p>  <p>Labour's hopes of getting the advertisement banned by the Advertising Standards Authority were  boosted when the watchdog chairman, Lord Rodgers, confirmed there was a prima facie case that it  breached the industry's code of practice.  <p>  <p>But the Conservative Party said it was planning to launch a 'robust' defence of the image, which  portrays the Labour leader - a practising Christian - as a demon with blazing red eyes.  <p>  <p>Mr Colver - who quit as Tory director of communications last year - said of the advert: "I don't  like it, partly because I don't find it particularly pleasant, but also, more importantly, I just  don't think it works." He admitted the thinking behind such tactics had "partly" led to his departure  and claimed he would have argued against the use of the poster. "I have to say that although one  recognises that negative campaigning does tend to work... I do wonder whether this is the right  tactic for the Conservatives, given the undoubted credibility that Tony Blair has personally and that  New Labour has acquired," he told BBC Radio 4's 'World at One'.  <p>  <p>But the Defence Secretary, Michael Portillo, said that the Tories' submission to the Advertising  Standards Authority would highlight Labour campaign adverts, such as a 1992 poster featuring the then  Chancellor, Norman Lamont, as 'Vatman'.  <p>  <p>Mr Portillo said much of the criticism was misplaced. "I think that is based on a complete  misunderstanding and that is that the eyes are demonic. The eyes are not demonic. They are dangerous.  <p>  <p>"What people seem to be very worried about is that the face of Tony Blair should be used with those  eyes.  <p>  <p>"Do we really have now such a cult of personality in the Labour Party that we cannot do to Tony  Blair what the Labour Party happily did to us with Norman Lamont in 1992?"  <p>  <p>The Advertising Standards Authority launched an investigation into whether the poster is offensive  this week after complaints from members of the public. Church leaders have warned that the  advertisement's use of "satanic"' imagery was "potentially dangerous". Yesterday the Bishop of Aston,  the Rt Rev John Austin, said the poster would be disturbing to many Muslims as well as Christians. And  an editorial in Reform, the journal of the United Reformed Church, likened the attempts to demonise Mr  Blair to attacks on Israeli prime minister Yitzak Rabin shortly before he was shot dead by a religious  fanatic.  <p>  <p>The ASA would ban the poster if it is found to breach the industry's code of practice by causing  "serious or widespread offence" or portraying a politician in an "offensive or adverse" way. Peter  Mandelson, head of Labour's election planning, welcomed Lord Rodgers' comments. "We have full  confidence that the Advertising Standards Authority will reach the most appropriate finding in this  case. The Tories certainly have a case to answer, and we hope this will encourage them to clean up  their act." Mr Mandelson rejected the Tories' claim that the poster was in the same vein as Labour's  image of Norman Lamont.  <p>  <p>"We were attacking a subject, not a person. There were no complaints and, indeed, Mr Lamont's  office even asked for a copy of it."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>James Meikle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>If nothing else, the eyes have it. Scott Woods, sometime waiter, former hotel manager and often  out-of-work actor yesterday revealed his starring, indeed staring, role as the demonic Tony Blair.  <p>  <p>The 42-year-old Labour supporter knew he was working for a Conservative Party advertising campaign  when he accepted a fee of about &#163;200. But he thought his eyes were to be used glaring from behind  a curtain rather than in the New Labour, New Danger 'demon Blair' poster which has been roundly  condemned.  <p>  <p>"It was only when I saw the eyes transposed on Tony Blair that I was surprised and felt some  anger," said the actor. "I admire the man. I look forward to having him as Prime Minister."  <p>  <p>The personal attack went too far, said Mr Woods, whose screen performances include playing a pirate  in Ken Russell's 'Treasure Island' last year and as a security guard in 'The Fifth Element', a Bruce  Willis science fiction film. "I am a Labour voter but an out-of-work actor as well. Work is work. I  did not think it was going to be used in this way and I did not expect this controversy."  <p>  <p>Mr Woods, who lives in Hackney, east London, said political campaigning should be about principles  not personalities. The poster job, which lasted about two hours, was his first gained through the Ugly  Showbiz Agency. He said he was not told, even by the production company which also filmed him on  video, that his eyes might be substituted for Mr Blair's. He wore blue contact lenses over his already  blue eyes and was told these would be touched up into red later by computer. "It is my eyes that are  evil and demonic, not Tony Blair's. It is a role I play." That role, part of a campaign directed by M  & C Saatchi and authorised by the Tory chairman, Brian Mawhinney, looks shortlived. Their appearance  has split Tory opinion and the Advertising Standards Authority is investigating.  <p>  <p>"It is not an easy life," said Mr Woods. "If I have to wait tables again, I will wait tables." But  he does have some work lined up in a film called 'The Lighthouse' - playing a serial killer.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Plans for world's largest offshore windfarm to be built off the Norfolk coast  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>15 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Largest offshore wind farm planned</h2><h3>Norfolk  project would involve up to 25 giant turbines  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Owen Bowcott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Built on a shifting sandbank two miles beyond the Norfolk coast, the world's largest offshore wind  farm could be generating electricity by 1998, PowerGen claimed yesterday.  <p>  <p>Plans for the &#163;35m development near Great Yarmouth, which will involve up to 25 giant turbines  - each 190 feet high and producing 1.5 megawatts of electricity - have already been submitted to the  Department of Trade and Industry.  If it is successful, other projects may be announced soon.  <p>  <p>Exploiting unobstructed windflows at sea, the PowerGen wind farm, based on prototypes already  operating in Denmark, could revolutionise the capacity of the renewable energy industry. Ten turbines  placed at sea are estimated to produce the same energy as 15 to 20 turbines on land.  <p>  <p>Despite research work on potential sites in the North Sea by the now defunct Central Electricty  Generating Board as far back as the 1970s, wind generation of electricty offshore was not thought to  be technologically feasible until recently.  Rival commercial operators, such as National Wind Power, and the environmental group Friends of the  Earth, yesterday gave a qualifed welcome to the news that PowerGen and its Danish partner, Vestas, are  pursuing the scheme.  <p>  <p>The final go-ahead depends on the DTI granting a power supply contract under what is known as the  Government's non-fossils fuels obligation. Ministers have set a target of generating 1,500 megawatts  of capacity from renewable resources - including small hydro-electric plants - by 2000. The National  Grid's total generating capacity is around 50,000 megawatts. The backlash against wind farms in the  countryside has become more vocal amid claims that giant turbines are defacing the landscape and  revolving propeller blades are too noisy.  <p>  <p>PowerGen is confident that the environmental impact of its scheme will not be damaging.  "We have been have been careful to site the turbines away from the areas on the sandbanks used by  seals for basking," explained Mike Pollock of PowerGen yesterday.  <p>  <p>"They will be well out to sea, so there should be little noise. We hope there will be other  opportunities for more such projects in the future." Friends of the Earth's windpower campaigner, Anna  Stanford, warned that sanddunes north of Scroby Sands, where Powergen would base its scheme, had been  designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.  "But we are broadly in favour," she added. "There is an opportunity to increase the use of  renewable sources and provide skilled jobs. It won't involve any loss of land."  <p>  <p>The base of the 190ft turbines, standing in 20ft of water at high tide, will be anchored to the sea  floor by concrete plinths.  Two such farms are currently operating off Denmark, and one off the Dutch coast.  <p>  <p>Richard Silberman, of Vestas, which operates one of the Danish projects, said that the cables  taking the electricity generated into the local supply grid would be tied to the sea floor.  <p>  <p>"We put a bird observation platform on one of the turbines off Denmark to monitor the environmental  impact," he said.  "But the birds are sitting there quite happily, using it as a resting place."  <p>  <p>Wind generated electricity costs around 4.3 pence a kilowatt to produce; power derived from large  gas-burning stations costs only 2.6 pence a unit. The price difference is subsidised by the  Government's non-fossil fuel programme.  Nuclear power, environmental campaigners point out, is also heavily subsidised.  <p>  <p>Mike Dowling, Great Yarmouth's chief planning officer, said yesterday that he hoped to be consulted  in future.  <p>  <p>"It is more than two miles offshore so it's not technically within our district. But you can see  the Scroby Sands out to sea. They shift around a little and there are boat trips out to view the  seals."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Windmill tilting</b>  <p>  <p>Advantages  <p>  <p>Non-polluting; no carbon or sulphur dioxide emissions.  <p>Renewable; uses only the force of the wind.  <p>Saves diminshing fossil fuel reserves.  <p>  <p>Becoming cheaper as alternative technology advances.  <p>  <p><b>Drawbacks</b>  <p>  <p>Gas-fired power stations currently produce cheaper electricity. Wind-generated power is not large enough to supply UK's total needs.  <p>Wind farms take up land in the countryside.  <p>Turbines have been criticised as eyesores and too noisy.  <p>Potential navigational hazard at sea.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Belgium buries the two eight-year-old victims of a paedophile gang </b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>House of horrors stuns Belgium</h2><h3>Police  search for children's bodies amid fears of international sex ring </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stephen Bates</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A story of almost unimaginable horror was unfolding in Belgium yesterday as police searched for the  bodies of missing children at properties owned by a Belgian builder, who has admitted that two girls,  aged eight, starved to death while locked up at his home as he served a prison sentence last winter.  <p>  <p>With rumours of an international paedophile ring circulating, Belgian police have found three  bodies in the last 48 hours - the two missing eight-year-olds and an unnamed accomplice of the  builder.  <p>  <p>The arrested man, Marc Dutroux, aged 39, a convicted rapist, has been charged with abduction and  illegal kidnapping and is also likely to face murder charges.  <p>  <p>Discovery of the bodies of the two eight-year-olds brought to seven the number of dead girls found  at different locations after a series of disappearances dating back to 1989.  <p>  <p>Fears are growing for six other children, abducted or missing in recent years.  <p>  <p>Police yesterday said they were keeping an open mind about spreading their inquiries  internationally, including to Britain, in search of an organised kidnapping conspiracy by paedophiles.  <p>  <p>Michel Bourlet, the prosecuting magistrate, told a press conference yesterday that Mr Dutroux and  some of the five other people arrested had admitted kidnapping two teenage girls, Ann Marchal, aged  19, and Eefje Lambreks, aged 17, near Ostend last August.  <p>  <p>"Finding these girls is now the priority," Mr Bourlet said.  <p>  <p>Two other girls were found alive last Thursday, imprisoned in a tiny basement room at Mr Dutroux's  home in a village outside the southern Belgian city of Charleroi.  <p>  <p>Both had been sexually assaulted.  <p>  <p>Mr Dutroux allegedly told police: "I am going to give you two girls," and led them to a basement  where Laetitia Delheze, aged 14, who was kidnapped on 9 August, and Sabine Dardenne, 12, who  disappeared nearly three months ago, were locked in the room disguised behind a wall shielded by a  metal cupboard.  <p>  <p>Sabine, who endured 10 weeks in the room, which had bunks, books, a television and kitchen  equipment, was said to have wept and told her new companion, Laetitia: "I will never see my family  again." The crime has unnerving parallels with the case of Frederick West, the Gloucester builder, and  his wife Rosemary, who imprisoned and killed at least 12 young women. The police have brought in  mechanical diggers and pneumatic drills to dismantle Mr Dutroux's house in the village of Marcinelle  and 11 other homes he is believed to have owned.  <p>  <p>Mr Dutroux was sentenced to 13.5 years imprisonment in 1989 for the rape and abduction of  teenagers and the rape of a woman, aged 50. He was released from prison in 1992 after serving just  four years.  <p>  <p>His second wife, Michele Martin, a former teacher, has also been arrested, as has Michel Lelievre,  a lodger at their home; a Brussels estate agent named Jean-Michel Nihoul; and two others whose names  have not been released, one of whom is believed to be Greek.  <p>  <p>Mr Nihoul allegedly told police that Mr Dutroux had spoken of building cages to keep young girls  in.  <p>  <p>The chief investigator, Marcel Guissard, told the Guardian: "We have not ruled out an inquiry into  possible international paedophile links. We have not yet consulted other police forces, but may do  so." Ms Martin, aged 36, is protesting her innocence. The couple, who have been married for nearly  eight years, have a son aged three and a daughter aged eight months. Mr Dutroux also has a son, aged  12, by his first wife.  <p>  <p>Yesterday, police in Neufchateau, where the inquiry is centred, admitted they had searched the  house at Marcinelle several times over the last year without finding the hidden room. If they had  found it when they first visited the house a year ago, it seems certain that Julie Lejeune and Melissa  Russo would be alive.  <p>  <p>Mr Dutroux was imprisoned from last December to February this year on a charge of theft with  violence.  <p>  <p>Mr Guissard said: "The two little girls effectively starved to death. According to Dutroux's  statement he returned from prison to find one still alive. He saw her moving and tried to revive her  but it was too late." He claimed to have left money with associates so the children could be fed. The  disappearance of the two girls, while they were playing outside their homes in June 1995, caused an  immense search and widespread public anxiety in Belgium. Their pictures and descriptions were soon in  almost every shop window, but they appeared to have vanished until their bodies were dug up in Mr  Dutroux's back garden at the weekend.  <p>  <p>The rescued girls have told police that Mr Dutroux threatened that if they called out, they would  be dealt with by his associates "who are much more nasty than I am". The two children were silent when  the police broke in to rescue them.  <p>  <p>Mr Dutroux was traced after an eyewitness saw a van near the spot where Laetitia Delheze was  abducted as she walked home from a swimming pool and was able to recall the number plate.  <p>  <p>Mr Dutroux, who accompanied police during their search of his home on Saturday, was flown out by  helicopter to avoid a confrontation with angry crowds who besieged his house and the court at  Neufchateau where those arrested are being interrogated.  <p>  <p>Protesters have demanded the death penalty for Mr Dutroux and his wife, which even in Belgium's  current frenzied climate remains unlikely. Although the country still has the death penalty, it has  not been used since the execution of several hundred Nazi collaborators at the end of the second world  war.  <p>  <p>The father of Melissa Russo last night accused the authorities of not doing enough to find the two  girls. "It is very hard to bear that these children were alive for nine months and they could have  been saved," Gino Russo said. The police are coming under pressure for bungling the investigation, but  last night there were signs that the affair was also being laid at the door of senior politicians. A  recent law allows paedophiles early release, providing they seek therapy, but this is voluntary and  there are insufficient places for all to be treated.  <p>  <p>The families through their lawyer accused the government of paroling Mr Dutroux too early, and said  police had refused to let them accompany the original search of his home. If they had done so, the  relatives said, the children might have heard their voices and called out.  <p>  <p>  <p>    <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stephen Bates</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Belgium buried the two little girl victims of a paedophile gang in Liege yesterday with all the  pomp and emotion of a state funeral.  <p>  <p>Melissa Russo and Julie Lejeune, both aged eight, were buried as they had lived and as they had  died, side by side, at a private service in the village cemetery at Mons-lez-Liege near their homes  just outside the city. But they were carried there only after a memorial service, televised live, had  unleashed a new wave of national grief. It came at the end of a week in which the discovery of their  deaths at the hands of a group of paedophiles has convulsed Belgium with shock and recrimination.  <p>  <p>Two fire engines and 14 hearses laden with flowers and wreaths preceded the two hearses bearing the  children's bodies. People wept as their small, white coffins were carried into the gothic basilica of  St Martin, on a hillside overlooking Liege.  <p>  <p>Many clutched the composite photograph of the two little girls, used during the long search for  them. Now, below the pictures of their bright optimistic faces, ran the words: "We were only eight,  with lots of dreams. We thought life would be beautiful. You grown-ups, build us a better world." At  the church door, among the mountainous bouquets of lilies, roses and irises, lying next to the posies  and single flowers left by local children and their parents was a wreath from King Albert and his  wife, Queen Paola. Many businesses and shops in the city closed for the morning as a mark of respect  and the government asked people across the country to observe a minute's silence.  <p>  <p>The two children were abducted 15 months ago and were discovered last Sunday buried in the back  garden of Marc Dutroux, a builder and convicted sex offender, in Charleroi 60 miles away. They  apparently starved to death in the spring, hidden in the cellar while he was detained by police for  four months on unrelated theft charges.  <p>  <p>The discovery of their bodies and the rescue of two teenage girls from the cellar have revived the  hunt for missing children in Belgium and aroused fears that Dutroux, his wife and two other men, who  have been charged with him, may be part of a ring of sex offenders trading in abducted children.  Several thousand people crowded outside the church, waiting patiently for hours to pay their respects.  Valerie Delhain, cradling her 15-month-old son Julian, said she had arrived more than two hours before  the service. "I think it is important to show solidarity as a mother. It is just so very sad," she  said.  <p>  <p>Yvan Augeraux held his three-year-old son Jools tightly. "It is important to be here. It is as if  the whole city has died. It is a tragedy." There was sympathetic clapping for the parents of An  Marchal, who disappeared a year ago and is one of the teenagers still missing, and for the children of  the village where Julie and Melissa lived.  <p>  <p>The parents of Julie and Melissa, their faces taut with grief, clutched their sons as they walked  into the church past an honour guard of weeping local firemen. The girls' mothers wore white as a sign  of hope and purity. After the 90-minute service, Stefaan de Clerck, the justice minister representing  the government, was one of the first to leave. He was booed and hissed.  <p>  <p>The last to leave were the parents, fathers hand in hand. Outside they embraced Paul Marchal, An's  father - three men, for two of whom all hope has faded while for the third it flickers dimly on.  <p>  <p>* A fifth person has been arrested in connection with the suspected paedophile ring, the public  prosecutor, Michel Bourlet, said last night. He also said police were studying videotapes they have  found of Dutroux and accomplices with unidentified children.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Coroner creates legal precedent by linking BSE-contaminated beef with CJD death </b><br><br><br><b><h2>20 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Coroner links death to 'mad cow'  beef</h2><h3> Legal precedent established in inquest on 20-year-old  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tim Radford</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A coroner created a legal precedent yesterday by linking beef contaminated with mad cow disease to  the death of a 20-year-old from a new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.  <p>  <p>The North Durham coroner, Geoffrey Burt, said the death of Peter Hall, who died of CJD in February,  was caused on the "balance of probabilities" by something like a beefburger infected with BSE.  <p>  <p>It is thought to be the first time that the connection between CJD and BSE has been made in the  courts, and it will put pressure on the Government for a public inquiry into mad cow disease and its  equivalent in humans. All previous inquests of CJD cases have had verdicts of death by natural causes.  Mr Burt's decision to record a verdict of misadventure - because the death came about "through an  outside course" - may open the door to relatives taking legal action against the Government.  <p>  <p>The coroner said there was no scientific proof for a link between BSE and CJD but in a coroner's  court the burden of proof was less stringent. He said: "I am satisfied it is more likely than not that  Peter contracted this disease prior to 1990 due to eating some form of contaminated beef product,  probably a product such as a beef burger."  <p>  <p>Peter's parents applauded the verdict, saying it furthered their campaign for a public inquiry. His  mother Frances said: "I was surprised but very pleased that the coroner was so brave and open-minded.  We will carry on fighting for the Government to recognise there has been a problem for many years  which should have been dealt with. Our son died because of their mistakes."  <p>  <p>A Department of Health spokesman said last night: "Our position remains unaltered. There is no  scientific proof that human beings can contract CJD from beef."  <p>  <p>Peter, of Chester-le-Street, was one of 10 cases of a new strain of CJD announced earlier this  year. He became the 'public face' of concern about the disease because his parents had filmed his  decline, which was broadcast on television.  <p>  <p>He was forced to abandon his degree course at Sunderland University because of deteriorating  health.  <p>  <p>His case was also picked up because he had been a vegetarian since 1990, when he saw a television  programme about cruelty to animals. His father Derek said: "Before that he liked beefburgers as a  quick snack when he came home from school at lunchtime. He liked brisket, too, and we would have that  more often than not on a Sunday."  <p>  <p>The discovery of the new form of CJD precipitated a crisis for British farmers, and for the  Government. For almost a decade from the discovery of BSE in a British dairy herd in 1986, ministers  and health officials had insisted that there was no chance of infection of humans by 'mad cow  disease'.  <p>  <p>But the announcement on 20 March specifically confirmed a pattern of brain damage in human victims  that was very close to BSE. More alarmingly, the new strain showed up in people younger than 40.  <p>  <p>Classical CJD is rare, and hitherto has been found only in the elderly. Only one of the 10 original  sufferers is still alive.  <p>  <p>Robert Perry, who conducted the post-mortem, said Peter had contracted an "unusual" form of CJD  which in many ways resembled the condition known as Kuru found in the Fore tribe in south-east Asia.  Members of that tribe performed a ritualistic form of cannibalism in which human flesh was eaten and  it was thought the disease was acquired as a result of this.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jonathan Freedland</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Step aside Brides magazine and Weddings Monthly. America's newsstands now have a more pragmatic  addition: Divorce magazine, the world's first journal dedicated solely to the business of breaking up.  <p>  <p>Targeting the million American couples who split up each year, Divorce offers advice on finding a  good lawyer, a sympathetic therapist and an estate agent with experience in selling the house and  splitting the proceeds. There's even a problem page, with tips for philanderers on whether to tell  their soon-to-be-ex they're having an affair.  <p>  <p>For the publisher Dan Couvrette, Divorce - launched this month with a pilot edition in Chicago and  its own internet homepage - represents quite a departure. He used to publish Wedding Bells magazine.  <p>  <p>"I'm not against marriage and I'm not against romance," Mr Couvrette said. It's just that during  his own divorce - "probably the most challenging period of my life" - he struggled to find information  beyond a few weighty tomes. "Magazines are very accessible, they're not as daunting as a 300-page  book."  <p>  <p>There is no shortage of advertisers. Besides lawyers and accountants, Divorce runs ads from  masseurs, beauty salons and Glenn's Custom Photo - offering to airbrush out a former lover.  <p>  <p>The Canadian-based Mr Couvrette understands his readership. "Haven't been on a date in 15 years?  We'll show you some great new ways to find Mr or Ms Right in the 90s," promises one story.  <p>  <p>A more sober note is struck in the legal advice pages. They remind readers that if they live in  Illinois and their spouse tries to kill them - it may be grounds for divorce.  <p>  <p>Divorce also advises: "Don't choose a lawyer based on physical attractiveness."  <p>  <p>Divorce appears in Chicago as Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party gather in the city next week to  cast themselves as the guardians of family values. The magazine insists it is not at odds with  America's conservative trend. Instead, Divorce is part of a growing school of sociologists and  counsellors who champion the so-called good divorce - believing that, handled properly, a break-up can  enhance a couple's relationship with each other and with their children.  <p>  <p>Mr Couvrette himself is now anxiously looking for a partner - to form a joint venture and publish a  British edition of Divorce.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Hannah Pool</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The victim of a rapist forced to endure six days of his cross-examination about his attacks in  court after he opted to defend himself, last night led calls for changes in the law to prevent other  women suffering a similar ordeal.  <p>  <p>Ralston Edwards, aged 42, was found guilty at the Old Bailey yesterday on two counts of rape.  Police observers said he had appeared to gain gratification when questioning the 34-year-old woman  during his trial. He has a long record of rape and violence to women.  <p>  <p>His victim, who has two children and is under 5ft tall, joined lawyers, court workers, police and  women's groups in calling on the Government to change the law which allowed Edwards to humiliate her.  A Home Office spokesman said: "The Government is concerned to ensure that victims of these hideous  crimes are adequately protected and we will be giving further consideration to the issues raised by  this case."  <p>  <p>Police officers last night praised the victim. On one occasion she had run from the courtroom,  physically sick, and yesterday left the Old Bailey in tears. She now depends on sleeping tablets and  valium.  <p>  <p>"I was raped once by Edwards and again by the British justice system," she is reported as saying in  this morning's Daily Mail. "To male politicians, I would urge them to swiftly change the law with  regard to rape victims. For God's sake and for women's sake may this never happen again." Edwards, of  Catford, south-east London, was found not guilty on two other charges of raping her over a 16-hour  period. He will be sentenced next month after psychiatric reports. Judge Ann Goddard, describing him  as dangerous, told him she was considering a life sentence. The jury of seven men and five women,  deliberated for five hours.  <p>  <p>Police revealed he was once acquitted of rape after defending himself. Edwards was jailed for three  years for breaking into a young woman's flat and raping her in front of her 16-month-old baby in 1984.  <p>  <p>He was jailed for three years in 1987 for causing his common law wife grievous bodily harm, and he  was jailed for four years in 1991, reduced to three, for two separate attacks on women.  <p>  <p>Detective Sergeant Milne Davidson, who led the investigation, supported calls for a change in the  law. He said after the case: '"He enjoyed every minute of it - reliving it all in detail. No doubt he  was getting some kind of sexual gratification and pleasure from it. He is very cunning and into  domination."  <p>  <p>After Edwards exercised his right to defend himself, Judge Goddard gave him considerable leeway to  avoid giving him grounds for appeal. She told the jury: "The rules have been somewhat flexible during  the case." He forced his victim to relive her rape in minute detail, but she tried to answer every  question. She once said: "I don't think you appreciate the terror you are putting me through."  <p>  <p>Some of Edwards's questions verged on the bizarre. He had given her a milkshake at his home and  wanted to know what flavour it was. "What were the colour of bricks in the alley you say I took you  to?" he asked. The woman says she has now moved "a very long way" from the scene of the attack.  <p>  <p>After the verdicts, Edwards requested a solicitor and barrister for his sentencing.  <p>  <p>The Old Bailey had heard the victim was standing at a bus stop in Catford in December 1995 when  Edwards approached her for a cigarette. She was moving property from the house she had shared with her  alcoholic husband to her boyfriend's.  <p>  <p>Edwards bundled her into an alleyway when she got off the bus, and forced her to go to his home  which had neither heat nor light. He claimed she had gone willingly and suggested she had had sex in  the hour between leaving his house and reporting the rape.  <p>  <p>His victim told the jury that in the alley, as he kissed her and his hands were all over her, she  was frightened that if she screamed he might become violent.  <p>  <p>At his filthy home, Edwards showed no intention of letting her leave. "He wanted to keep me. I  don't know how, but he really wanted to keep me." She added: "I was afraid of what was going to  happen. It was obvious that something was going to happen. I had almost given up the fight. Was I  going to live or was I going to die?

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sweden hosts world congress on sex crimes against children </b><br><br><br><b><h2>27 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>World congress on sex crimes against children opens in Sweden  </h3> <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Elizabeth  Williams</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Recognising a paedophile would be easy if they had some sort of distinguishing mark, but they don't. In reality, they live in our  communities unsuspected. They are usually someone you know. <p> <p>When my son was two, he was sexually abused by his childminder's husband. He  had been cared for by her since he was five months old and I had returned to work full-time. It was a good arrangement, I thought, providing my  baby with a warm and loving domestic environment. My friendship with the childminder developed over time and extended also to her husband and  two children. She was registered with the local council, took her job seriously and was particularly committed to my son because the  relationship had begun when he was so tiny. <p> <p>The first indication that anything might be amiss was just after my son's second birthday  when, during some after-bath play, he pulled on his penis, looked at me and lisped, with all the inaccuracy of two-year-old speech: "Ken does  this." Gentle questioning elicited no response, so, perplexed, I dropped the subject. A few days later he said a similar thing, but its meaning  still remained unclear. <p> <p>Within the next few months, I changed my childcare arrangements, for reasons entirely unconnected with any  indication of mistreatment. In retrospect, however, I am deeply grateful that I did. Several months after this, we were driving to see friends  and passed the end of the road where my son's childminder lived. With piping clarity, a small voice from the back said: "Ken lives there. Ken  put his willy in my mouth. I put my willy in Ken's mouth." My son's speech, now he was almost three, had progressed to the extent that he could  now tell me what had happened. <p> <p>I was speechless. I also had no idea what I should do with this information. I talked to numerous friends  who offered different advice, ranging from do nothing to kill the bastard. As I considered the details, my priorities emerged. I had to make  sure that my son had suffered no emotional damage, even if I was reasonably sure there was no physical damage. I actually had no idea, over and  above what he had told me, about what had happened. I rang a child psychologist who worked within my area to ask her advice. She was  unequivocal: I must report this man to social services. She would support me, she said, and make herself available for any intervention with my  child, should the child protection team request it. <p> <p>I rang social services and asked to speak to the duty social worker. They were  unhelpful, asking why, and I was forced to blurt out over the phone that my ex-childminder's husband had sexually abused my then two-year-old  son. I was asked to come in and give further details. <p> <p>While the social worker was kind and solicitous, I was very aware that she was  trying to judge the veracity of what I was telling her. Was I, she seemed to think, some hysterical middle-class mother with an axe to grind?  Or even someone with Munchhausen by proxy, perhaps? While I sat there bereft, facing the reality of my failure to protect my son and not  knowing what damage had been done, she made light of the situation. I was told not to worry, she would confer with her boss, contact the child  protection unit and they would deal with it. I had no further role to play; by reporting this man, I had discharged my responsibility. <p>  <p>The next day she rang me. If I wanted to make an allegation of child sexual abuse, she stated as if reading from a manual, then I had to do  so formally and both I and my child would need to be interviewed by the police. I said that I didn't want to make an allegation, I was simply  passing on information disclosed by my young son, and it then became their responsibility to do whatever was required to protect other children  being cared for by this man's wife, not to mention his own young children. She repeated her statement. There was nothing they could do unless I  made a formal allegation with which they could confront him. <p> <p>This involved an interview with me and my child, in my home, with the  social worker and female police officer who worked with the child protection unit. I was terrified about what repercussions might follow in the  future. This man knew where I lived, alone with my child in a ground-floor flat, and as he lived locally, it was likely that at some time, in  the years to come, I would pass him in the street. I didn't sleep well for a long time afterwards. <p> <p>We went ahead. The first interview  led to another between my child and the psychologist behind a two-way mirror. She had been concerned because my son seemed so angry with me,  yet seemed also to be trying to protect me, so she had advised a subsequent session at which she could talk to him alone, without my presence  in the room. So we sat, his father and me, a consultant child psychiatrist, the police officer from the child protection unit, three social  workers (two trainees), another child psychotherapist, the room crowded with all these professionals. <p> <p>The psychologist began her gentle  routine, taking my son through various daily events with the childminder. Without a single leading question, she began to talk about Ken and,  after a while, my son looked up and reiterated very clearly the disclosure he had made to me all those months ago. The atmosphere on our side  of the two-way mirror was electric. I could only weep silently, as I do now at the memory, yet my son seemed strangely unburdened by the  sequence of events; he seemed to relieve himself of the responsibility of disclosing something he must have been told was secret. I have no  idea whether any threats, verbal or physical, had been made, or whether my son had been told that he mustn't ever tell, although I can only  imagine that this must have been the case. <p> <p> <p> <p>The child psychotherapist took me to one side and told me categorically that she felt  sure he was undamaged emotionally. The police officer recommended that I didn't prosecute, as it would be too traumatic and damaging for my son  in the long run. <p> <p>Some weeks later, the same police officer visited me, unexpectedly, early one evening. She had just come from a meeting  with Ken, at which she and a male colleague had confronted him with my "allegation". She told me that he was entirely convincing in his  protestation that he had loved my son and would never have done such a thing. She said that if she hadn't witnessed my son's disclosure, she  would have believed him, and she was obviously shaken and upset. But I knew him well and I could imagine him sitting there, distressed and  shocked himself that anyone could accuse him of such a thing, when he loved children. And indeed he does, but he was abandoned by his mother as  a baby and brought up by an uncle and aunt who, although brother and sister, lived together as man and wife. I'm sure he does love children but  somewhere along the way this has become confused with sexual interest, perhaps from his own experience of sexual abuse as a child. He is, and  continues to be, a paedophile. <p> <p>After a case conference, it was decided that his wife could continue to work as a registered childminder,  with the proviso that he shouldn't ever be left alone with the children. I was never told this formally - what happened subsequently was judged  to be none of my business - but the psychologist who had supported me let me know. That is the best they could come up with. Let's hope that  subsequent children get off as lightly as my own son. Eight years later, I see him playing with his two-year-old brother - confident, outgoing,  happy and secure - and I know I was right to take the path I did then: to ensure he was OK and to leave it at that, protecting him from the  further trauma that prosecution would have involved. In time, I felt reassured, comforted even, that my child had been able to tell me what  happened and that I had listened and acted on what he had told me. A sense of perspective eventually returned and I have managed to avoid the  worst inclinations of overprotectiveness. But a paedophile remains unchecked. All names have been changed. <p> <p> <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>      <p>Liam Gallagher yesterday shrugged off any suggestion that Oasis would split after he walked out on the rest of the group at Heathrow 15 minutes before they left for a tour of the United States. The 23-year-old singer demanded his luggage be unloaded from a Boeing 747 before catching a taxi to the house he shares with fiancee Patsy Kensit in St John's Wood, north-west London, but has recently sold. On emerging briefly yesterday he said: "You know the story, it's all in the papers. I've got to move house." He said he had spoken to Noel, his brother and fellow group member, and dismissed rumours of a split. "I've nothing to say. That's all that's going on. There's no story." Oasis's record company said he would rejoin the group at the end of the week.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stuart Millar</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Oasis singer Liam Gallagher finally set off to rejoin the band on their United States tour yesterday, insisting he would be welcomed by his songwriter brother Noel.  <p>  <p>He left behind his fiancee, Patsy Kensit, who last night denied she was responsible for keeping him in Britain for three extra days. Reports had accused Ms Kensit, aged 28, of making Liam walk out on the band 15 minutes before they were due to depart on Monday, leaving Noel to assume singing duties at the opening concert in Chicago on Tuesday. A statement from Ms Kensit's solicitors said: "Our client wishes to make it clear she did not instruct or in any way seek to persuade Liam Gallagher to withdraw from travelling to America with Oasis."  <p>  <p>Before flying to Chicago, Liam, aged 23, insisted Ms Kensit had nothing to do with his decision to stay in Britain. He also played down reports of a rift between him and Noel. "Me and Noel are all right. We have chats and that and he can't wait to see me," he told GMTV.  <p>  <p>He defended his decision to let the band begin the 14-date tour without him. "Being in a band, you write songs for yourself first. You do your gigs and that after you are settled and happy. I wasn't happy. I didn't have anywhere to live."  <p>  <p>The laryngitis which he claimed stopped him singing at an acoustic set for the music video channel MTV in London last Friday and in Chicago has cleared and he will lead the band for their second date in Michigan tonight. Noel, who sang at the MTV recording and in Chicago, said he would not "give Liam a slap". He added: "We have had enough of slapping each other." MTV may not broadcast the 'Unplugged' acoustic session in the US because Liam pulled out. The channel's executives are said to be considering cancelling Oasis's showcase on the live Video Music Awards in New York next Wednesday.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Caroline Sullivan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Liam Gallagher has probably never seen 'This Is Spinal Tap', being too busy living the rock star life  to watch a movie parodying it, but if he had he'd probably recognise himself in the Nigel Tufnel  character. Tufnel is temperamental and impetuous, prone to mid-show walk-offs and rows with the  long-suffering guitarist. Liam may not have stooped to emulating Tufnel's Lycra leggings - yet - but  otherwise, it's a clear case of life imitating art.  <p>  <p>Gallagher's public behaviour has been spoiled, brattish and stupid ever since Oasis came along  three years ago, and we adore every ill-judged second of it. With the exception of Michael Jackson,  he's the best pop soap opera in the last 15 years, invariably leaping without looking and damn the  consequences.  <p>  <p>His refusal to accompany the rest of the group to America on Monday because he wanted to buy a  house was Liam at his Liamest. "I can't go around looking for a house while I'm playing for silly  fucking Yanks," he scowled through his hideous new beard. The first date, a 17,500-seater in Chicago,  went ahead without him, though a fan complained on TV, "I feel I'm being cheated if I don't see Liam  sing; there's no point without him." (Yep, they love him there despite his contempt toward Americans.  A source at Epic Records in New York said, "Maybe people here just like the abuse. At least he has a  personality.") Everything Gallagher does reinforces his reputation as a heat-seeking missile. From the  furious quarrels with Noel (one was clandestinely recorded and released as a most excellent single,  Wibbling Rivalry) to the mandatory affair-with-sexy actress to the drug abuse, he's doing it all by  the rock star script. Yet Liam is too ingenuous to misbehave for its PR effect; he is just following  his instincts. And, fortunately, those instincts are the worst.  <p>  <p>'Fortunately' because everything he does is such compulsive viewing. Before Gallagher, rock excess  had been out of fashion for many years. The days when Keith Moon could drive his Rolls-Royce into a  swimming pool with impunity had been succeeded, thanks to Live Aid, by a soberer mind-set. It's been  an REM-ish world since, stuffed with musos who get the job done, then go home. Humbug. No wonder we're  so thrilled by the odd incidence of colourful behaviour, like Jarvis Cocker's clash with Jacko. Liam,  bless his self-destructive soul, is colourful every minute of the day. He seems to have absolutely no  sense of enough being enough, and we love, love, love it. That doesn't mean he's destined for the  early demise of pop stars who live too much. His relationship with Noel, tempestuous though it is,  seems to exert a steadying influence. Northern to the marrow, he places great store in family ties,  and he and Noel will probably plod into old age together. As for leaving Oasis - he's not that silly.  He knows what happened when Sid Vicious went solo.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Seven Iraqi hijackers looking for political asylum give themselves up </b><br><br><br><b><h2>28 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Iraqis' hijack gamble  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Christopher Elliott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The security services were last night expected to begin debriefing seven Iraqi hijackers who gave themselves up at Stansted airport yesterday, sparking a political row. It appeared the Iraqis, thought to be dissidents, may have been successful in their high-stakes asylum-seeking gamble, in spite of the dilemma their action caused ministers.  <p>  <p>The hijackers, who safely released the other 192 passengers and crew on the Sudan Airways flight diverted from Jordan, had claimed they were carrying explosives. They are likely to be prosecuted and serve jail terms in Britain instead of being returned to the Sudan, closely linked to Saddam Hussein's regime.  <p>  <p>Their relatives, who were on the flight, may be allowed to stay. Last night six women were being held under immigration law, and two children were being looked after by police.  <p>  <p>Jordanian officials who arrived from London to help the 13 Jordanian passengers on board reportedthere had been great fear among the passengers when one man stood up and proclaimed the flight was being hijacked. "The hijackers were quite aggressive at first. One man stood up with a knife just before they reached the Red Sea," one official said. "He was tackled by someone else but then another hijacker stood up and said he had a grenade. In the early part of the hijack they were a little violent, there was no food or water for people and they wouldn't let them go to the toilet, but when they knew they were going to England they relaxed."  <p>  <p>One of the hijackers is understood to be an attache to the Iraqi embassy in Khartoum, travelling on a diplomatic passport. The others are believed to be low-ranking opponents of Saddam Hussein's regime on a military delegation to Khartoum. They had been summoned back to Baghdad. Others recalled in similar circumstances have been executed.  <p>  <p>The hijackers, who were being held at Harlow police station in Essex, believed they could trade off political asylum for their families for their own jail terms. Their success could depend on how much their relations knew when they boarded the flight, and how much the hijackers can tell the security services.  <p>  <p>While maintaining the asylum applications of the hijackers would be treated no differently from any others received, the Home Office emphasised that their arrival by criminal means would be taken into consideration. There were indications this meant they would be prosecuted and jailed, then allowed to remain.  <p>  <p>Even if the hijackers failed to prove 'a well-founded fear of persecution' because of race or politics if they returned home, Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, could grant them and their families exceptional leave to remain. Britain has granted refugee status to 1,325 Iraqis since 1992, and exceptional leave to remain to a further 1,905. The hijackers appear to be banking on Britain's unwillingness to turn its back on opponents of Saddam. But David Howell, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, insisted the hijackers be returned to the Sudan. Permission to remain would make Britain seem a soft touch for terrorists.  <p>  <p>Mr Howell said: "If the word gets round that the quick way to asylum is three years in jail and then you're out, and in the country where you wanted to get to, that would be absolutely disastrous to the whole policy towards asylum seekers."  <p>  <p>Sir Peter Lloyd, former Conservative Home Office minister, said: "However much sympathy we might have with people who want to be as far away from Iraq as possible, the law must take its course." Otherwise, he warned, similar incidents could follow.  <p>  <p>Sudan Airways Flight 150 landed at Stansted shortly before 4.30am, sparking the first hijack crisis on British soil for 14 years. Within two hours groups of passengers started to be released. There were no British passengers on board.  <p>  <p>The hijackers had taken control 25 minutes into the flight on Monday and diverted the jet to Larnaca in Cyprus, threatening to blow it up. They then directed it to Heathrow, signalling their wish for asylum.  <p>  <p>The British authorities diverted the pilot, Abdel Hamid Hidirbi, to Stansted only 15 minutes before landing.  <p>  <p>John Bowden, Chief Constable of Essex, said the crisis ended when the hijackers were told Iraqi dissident Sadiq Sadah, based in London, had arrived. They had demanded to talk to him.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Emma Nicholson</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>In the wake of the Iraqi dissidents' hijack of a Sudan Airways passenger plane and its  consequential drama on British soil, it is timely to examine both the British Government's response to  this potential tragedy and to the vast, continuing disaster that is Saddam's Iraq. None of us knows  who the hijackers are nor whom they represent, but it seems likely that they are high-ranking  officials, probably from Saddam's army or even his notorious Republican Guard. How else could they  have been allowed to leave Iraq together with their families? Even some of his most long-serving  diplomats are forbidden to take wives and children with them outside the borders of Iraq. Their  families are held hostage, with lives and safety conditional upon the travelling members' return. Such  relative freedom to travel in entire family structures can only mean one thing: these men were close  to Saddam Hussein himself, and their defection would mean prolonged and agonising execution for them  and their families if they were caught by Iraqi agents still loyal to the regime. <p>  <p>Ironically, until  Saddam falls, the defectors' safest place may be the British prisons, with family members outside  given some security protection. Were these men close to Saddam, as I believe to be the case, then they  have knowledge which governments seeking his downfall would find useful in strengthening the case at  the United Nations for the continuance of sanctions. This dreadful weapon, proven so successful in  South Africa against apartheid, has had limited success so far against Saddam only in that it has  inhibited him from major purchases of new or replacement armaments. This has not stopped him, however,  from continuing to harm the Iraqi people. He has laid waste the country from top to bottom. In Iraqi  Kurdistan his forces have continuously assaulted towns and villages, destroyed harvests and  slaughtered those who resist. Admittedly he has been grotesquely aided in this gruesome task by the  Iraqi Kurdistani political parties themselves. As a White House spokesman commented privately last  year, it has become difficult to distinguish between the actions of the Iraqi Kurds towards each other  and those of Saddam's armies against them. The tragedy of the Turkish Kurdish community has blurred  the picture internationally and may have cloaked from time to time the marauding Iraqi army's actions  around Iraq's northern safe-haven. The bitter pill for those countries such as the United Kingdom who  initiated and still support the safe-haven, has been the sight of Barzani and Talabani fighting each  other as opposed to moving against Baghdad.  <p>  <p>This Iraqi opposition inability to have a clear focus and a single aim has dogged their efforts to  dislodge Saddam for years. Surely one form of opposition, and by far the strongest, should come from  the very large Iraqi communities now sheltering in the region and the West. The United Kingdom  harbours perhaps 65,000 Iraqi refugees. France has a smaller number, as does Germany. The Europeans'  volume of Iraqi refugees shrinks in comparison with the 645,000 who have gained a safe haven in Iran,  where I assist 90,000 to survive through the Amar (Assisting Marsh Arabs and Refugees) appeal. More  have fled to Syria or Lebanon, and others again, although very small in number, are in the US. All of  these communities are bedevilled by a singular lack of cohesion and aims. Turning again to the battle  against apartheid, the Iraqi opposition would do well to study the African National Congress (ANC).  Despite their difficulties, which are being aired now in front of Archbishop Tutu and fellow members  of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, they form a model which the Iraqi National Congress (INC)  would do well to study. Wherever they were living, members of the ANC put the aims of the organisation  above their tribal grievances. The destruction of apartheid and one-man-one-vote (one-woman too) in  South Africa were their goals - which they have achieved. A modern miracle created by consistent,  united work.  <p>  <p>In contrast, the Iraqi National Congress, despite its backing by the European Union, the US and  many Gulf regional governments, has been riven by disunity. Without a unified opposition within and  outside Iraq, how can sympathetic governments assist the people of Iraq in any tangible way other than  through the provision of humanitarian aid?  <p>  <p>Of course, it could rightly have been expected by all and sundry that the British Government would  have taken a lead political role. After all, Iraq was a British protectorate. It was the British who  determined the shape of modern-day Iraq, with its awkward and unwieldly three-part mixture of the  independently minded Kurds, the non-political and hard-working majority group of Shi'a in the South,  and the Ottoman-Empire-backed Sunni, the minority to whom the British gave power in the 20s. Yet,  despite our great knowledge of Iraq, from which seems to stem the Edward Kennedy view that Iraq is a  European problem, the British Government choose to stand aside and watch and photograph while the  historic marshlands of Mesopotamia were destroyed.  <p>  <p>With this background it is proper for Britain to give all the assistance possible to the Iraqi  refugees. Under no circumstances can it be right to do other than actively oppose in every way  possible aerial terrorism such as the hijacking of an aircraft. But we should also recognise the  desperate situation in which the Iraqi people find themselves. Extradition to a country where death  certainly awaits, even with Sudan as a stopover, is not a solution within recent rulings of the  European Court of Human Rights, or older international conventions. But it is typical of today's  Conservatives that they should call for it nonetheless.  <p>  <p>Emma Nicholson, Liberal Democrat MP for Devon West and Torridge, chairs the British All-Party Group  on Iraq.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alan Watkins</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Basra was the epicentre of the brief but bloody uprising that shook southern Iraq after the allied  victory over Saddam Hussein. Vengeance came quickly and brutally for the rag-tag Shi'ite Muslim  rebels, with thousands killed or driven into exile in Iran or into hiding in the nearby marshes. Some  dead were left to rot where they fell. Others were strung up on telephone poles. The signal for the  rising was given on 1 March 1991, by a Republican Guard tank driver, returning from the slaughter in  Kuwait, who fired his cannon at a giant portrait of Saddam. Ba'ath party officials and secret  policemen were brutally slaughtered before a government counter-offensive wiped out the opposition.  <p>  <p>One witness saw 400 people executed. Other civilians were used as human shields. Resistance  continued sporadically but had died out by the end of March. Throughout, the Allied forces allowed  Iraqi helicopters to fly in support of anti-rebel operations, though the distraction permitted the  Kurds to rise in the north.  <p>  <p>The conflict shattered families and flung their remnants throughout the Middle East in the frantic  search for safety. On Tuesday, six of the survivors found themselves in Britain on board a hijacked  Sudanese jet. The six Iraqi women - a mother in her 50s, her four daughters aged between 18 and 28 and  another woman related to one of the male hijackers by marriage - claim they did not know they were  coming to Britain. The plane left Khartoum and was bound for Jordan before being hijacked.  <p>  <p>The plight of the women, who do not want to be identified because of the risk to relatives at home,  was graphically described yesterday by David Watts, an Essex lawyer, who has been advising them since  their arrest at Stansted airport.  <p>  <p>All the women are related to people who played a prominent part in the abortive Basra uprising. The  husband and two sons of one of them were executed by Saddam's security officers.  <p>  <p>She learnt of the death of the second son when the Iraqi security forces presented her with his  ears.  <p>  <p>She and her daughters have twice been imprisoned and were released on the last occasion under a  general amnesty proclaimed by the Iraqi dictator. Mr Watts said yesterday he believed all had also  been tortured during their detention. He had not specifically asked them for details, although they  had indicated to him that they had suffered brutality and ill-treatment during their time in prison.  <p>  <p>Also with the party are the two children of one of the detained women, a girl aged eight, and a boy  aged five. The oldest of the women, who has heart trouble, was taken to hospital upon her arrival at  Stansted and receives daily medication.  <p>  <p>About four years ago, said Mr Watts, the women fled Iraq and were smuggled into Jordan. Since then  they have been to Yemen, back to Jordan and most recently to Sudan, all the time moving from one safe  house to another for fear of detection by the Iraqi security services.  <p>  <p>In each country all six had made applications for a visa to Britain, the Netherlands, Canada and  Italy but had been refused each time, believing that the refusal was always because they were Iraqi  nationals.  <p>  <p>During their last visit to Jordan they approached the British consul to ask for a UK visa but once  their background became known they were seen only by a Jordanian official, who refused their request  and declined to allow them to press their case with the British consul.  <p>  <p>Mr Watts said that, through his own interpreter, the women had told him they had led a life  virtually in hiding for the past three or four years, dependent for their safety on help from groups  opposed to Saddam. About 12 months ago they tried to go to Kuwait as a possible refuge but found that  Iraqi soldiers were still guarding every border. They abandoned the plan for fear of being captured.  <p>  <p>Mr Watts said all the women had boarded the flight in the belief that they were going to Jordan  where they had been told that someone who could arrange a visa to a safe country had been found.  <p>  <p>He added: "When the hijack attempt began they were as frightened and surprised as the rest of the  passengers and were treated in exactly the same way. They were ordered to sit in their seats and look  straight ahead." When he first saw them after their arrest they were barely able to speak because of  their distress. He said: "There are two incidents which graphically illustrate both their fear and  their mental state. When one of the women was removed from her seat by the police at Stansted she  refused to come down the aircraft steps because she could see a number of armed police officers  standing there and assumed that she would be shot either as she walked down or when she reached the  ground. It took a great deal of persuading that she would be physically safe if she left the plane.  "The trauma for these people continued when they were taken to the police station at Colchester. There  was a drunk in the cells who was kicking and screaming to be let out and the effect upon this party of  women was quite extraordinary. Because of their own experiences they naturally assumed that the man  was being tortured and they all but collapsed as the result of hearing what was simply a noisy drunk.  <p>  <p>"Two more were brought in during the evening before the police had the good sense to see the effect  that it was having on the women and dealt with the matter by moving our local alcoholics to another  police station." Mr Watts said that when he first interviewed them they were terrified because they  assumed he was some sort of prosecutor rather than a lawyer sent to represent them.  <p>  <p>He said: "It is impossible for me to overstate the fear and trepidation with which these women now  confront the world each day. They know that if they are not allowed to remain here they will go to  their death and no doubt it will be a death made as hideous and painful as possible. I cannot believe  that once their case is properly investigated and their story is heard fully by the authorities that  there can be any other just decision except to allow them to stay."  <p>  <p>Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, is likely to make a decision on their asylum application within  the next three weeks.  <p>  <p>Iraqi exile sources said last night that the women's claims were wholly credible. "There is  absolutely no question that people coming from these areas who have been abroad or have family members  who were involved in the Basra uprising are under threat - whether that means death or imprisonment,"  said Leith Kubba, of the Iraqi National Council (INC).  <p>  <p>"They would take a huge risk by going back. Life is cheap in Iraq. People can just disappear and no  one will even ask what happened to them." More than a million Iraqis have fled the country in recent  years, scores of thousands from Basra alone. There are an estimated 300,000 Iraqi exiles in Iran and  an unknown number of Iraqi Kurds in Turkey. Britain is the main centre for organised opposition groups  that work under the umbrella of the INC.  <p>  <p>Mr Watts said that if the asylum applications were rejected he would use the appeals procedure and  continue to take the matter through all available legal channels. At present, his representation is  being funded by the legal aid system.  <p>  <p>* The seven men, who had been questioned at Harlow police station, were charged with hijacking under  the Aviation Securities Act 1982.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>James Meikle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The sight of people sleeping rough on the streets is damaging Britain's tourist trade, a charity  for the homeless said yesterday.  <p>  <p>More than a million visitors to London - bringing &#163;1bn a year in foreign earnings - may have  their holidays spoiled by the experience, according to St Mungo's, which shelters nearly 1,000 people  a night in the capital.  <p>  <p>Its frank economic message is rare coming from the voluntary sector, but echoes John Major's  remarks two years ago over the damage beggars did to the holiday trade. The remarks brought outrage  from charities and the Opposition, but more recently Trevor Nunn, the next artistic director of the  Royal National Theatre, said that in parts of London "every doorway now houses a shivering  blanket-huddled homeless person". Some districts were so repellent "no person of sound mind" would pay  money in search of entertainment there.  <p>  <p>St Mungo's commissioned an NOP poll that said one in six tourists thought the sight of people  sleeping rough spoiled their holiday, four in 10 thought the experience would put others off visiting  London, and about four in 10 thought the situation in London worse than in their capital. Charles  Fraser, the charity's director, said: "This proves that we should devote more resources to tackling  homelessness - not just because it is right, but because it is in our economic interest.  <p>  <p>"Foreign tourists spend more than &#163;5bn a year in London. Anything which puts them off coming costs us dearly. This survey shows that homelessness hits our  pockets as well as our hearts."  <p>  <p>He appealed for private enterprise to match the multi-million pound, six-year effort by the  Government that initially reduced the number of people sleeping rough from more than 1,000 to around  350 in central London. The number has hardly changed over the last two years, as voluntary groups and  government agencies have tried to tackle a hard core of people, many addicted to drink and drugs or  suffering from mental health problems, who are reluctant to use emergency shelters.  <p>  <p>The London Tourist Board said yesterday that it had not recorded "any significant level" of  complaints during its annual surveys of tourist opinion, but it was concerned that many homeless  people were put in bed and breakfast accommodation when the capital had a severe shortage of cheap  hotels suitable for tourists.  <p>  <p>The Department of the Environment said that figures for those sleeping rough in London had gone  down since 1990 - "the only documented decrease in any capital city of which we are aware".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

Honeymoon at Broadlands in Hampshire and on the Royal Yacht Britannia.  <p>  <p>21 June 1982: Prince William is born. Rumours are dismissed that the Princess is suffering from  post-natal depression and anorexia nervosa. But it emerges later that strains are already emerging  over their incompatible interests and friends - particularly the Prince's old women friends.   <p>  <p>15  September 1984: Prince Harry is born. Princess confides to friends that the marriage is in trouble.  Details emerge later of worsening rows and rages, with the Princess becoming more lonely and the  Prince more desperate.   <p>  <p>March 1991: After years of public silences, behind-the-scenes row and holidays  spent apart, the tabloid papers report that the Princess is a close friend of Life Guards officer,  Major James Hewitt.  <p>  <p>June 1992: Diana: Her True Story, by Andrew Morton, reveals that she has suffered from bulimia and  attempted suicide. Tour to India reveals strains in the marriage, with Diana photographed alone before  the Taj Mahal. The couple are dubbed 'The Glums' during tour of Korea.  <p>  <p>August 1992: A tape is published giving details of a telephone conversation between Diana and her  friend James Gilbey: he calls her Squidgy and tells her he loves her and she tells him she doesn't  want to get pregnant.   <p>  <p>9 December 1992: John Major announces in the Commons that the Prince and  Princess are to separate. He says there are no constitutional implications and no reason why the  Princess should not be crowned Queen in due course.   <p>  <p>January 1993: Tape published which is alleged to  be between the Prince and his friend Camilla Parker-Bowles. She calls him darling and he makes  intimate remarks.  <p>  <p>June 1994: In a TV interview with Jonathan Dimbleby, the Prince admits he was unfaithful after the  "irretrievable" breakdown of the marriage.   <p>  <P>November 1995: Diana appears on BBC1's 'Panorama' and admits she was unfaithful with James Hewitt. But she insists she does not want a divorce.  <p>  <p>December 1995: The Queen writes to both the Prince and Princess telling them to seek a divorce. Charles immediately  agrees but says he has no intention of remarrying.  <p>  <p>February 1996: Diana agrees to divorce and negotiations start between lawyers. At one point she  threatens to withdraw because of Charles's alleged unwillingness to agree to her demands.  <p>  <p>15 July 1996: Decree nisi granted after terms are finally agreed. Princess loses title of Her Royal  Highness but gets a lump sum of &#163;17m and &#163;350,000 a year to run her private office.  <p>  <p>19 August 1996: Buckingham Palace floats plans to scrap the &#163;9m Civil List, end the monarch's  role as head of the Church of England, allow woman equal rights of succession, and allow the monarch  to marry a Catholic.   <p>  <p>28 August 1996: Decree absolute ends the 15-year marriage which began as a  fairy tale but became a tabloid soap opera.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Madeleine Bunting</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Prince Charles as a divorced man should not hold the position of Supreme Governor of the Church of  England, according to a majority of churchgoers. Remarrying would prompt the opposition of more than  half the Anglican clergy.  <p>  <p>There has been a marked erosion of support for the traditional links between Crown and Church, once  viewed as beyond debate by the vast bulk of the Church, according to a Gallup poll commissioned by the  Protestant Reformation Society and published today. Since their last survey in 1984 the number of  Anglican laity who want the Queen to continue as Supreme Governor has fallen from 88 per cent to 71  per cent. Fewer than half of the Anglican clergy said the reigning monarch had to be a member of the  Church. Fifty-five per cent of Roman Catholics, 50 per cent of free churches and 46 per cent of  Anglicans were opposed to a divorced monarch as Supreme Governor, regardless of whether he remarried  or not.  <p>  <p>Anglican clergy were more tolerant of Prince Charles divorcing - 45 per cent accepted it, 40 per  cent opposed - but objected strongly to the idea of his remarrying, with 56 per cent opposed to it and  only 29 per cent accepting it.  <p>  <p>The survey of 1,000 Anglican clergy and a sample of the general population (the response rate of 25  per cent of bishops was too low to be accurate) also found a huge majority against one of the key  pillars of the establishment of the Church. Nearly 80 per cent of clergy and 72 per cent of the active  Anglican laity do not want Parliament to have the final say on decisions relating to the Church, nor  do they want the Prime Minister to have the right of veto in the appointment of bishops.  <p>  <p>Yet in contradiction to these findings, a majority still wanted the Church to remain as the  established church. Significantly, support for this position was lower among clergy than among laity,  and 35 per cent of clergy want dis-establishment.  <p>  <p>"There has been a falling off of support for the constitutional relationship of Church, state and  monarchy, and a significant drop in support for the Queen as Supreme Governor," said the David  Samuels, president of the Protestant Reformation Society.  There is a real contradiction in the Church's views about its established status."  <p>  <p>The survey, Current Beliefs and Attitudes Towards the Church, covered a wide range of doctrinal,  moral and constitutional issues.  <p>  <p>The Church should ordain women as bishops, according to a significant majority of both clergy and  laity. On doctrine, Anglican laity showed an increasing uncertainty, opening up a gulf between their  beliefs and those of their clergy; a majority of laity no longer believe that Jesus Christ was raised  bodily from the dead, and they are equally sceptical of miracles in the New Testament.  <p>  <p>On one thing clergy and laity were in agreement - they don't know what hell is.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>The Prince and Princess of Wales divorce</b><br><br><br><b><h2>29 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>£20  fee casts royal couple asunder  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Ezard</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The first divorce of a future king in British history became legal quietly yesterday, with only a  few signs of the watershed it marks in British constitutional and public life.  <p>  <p>Fifteen years and 30 days after their wedding at St Paul's, the marriage of Prince Charles and  Princess Diana reached its close less than a mile away at the High Court in London.  <p>  <p>The instrument was decree absolute number 5,029, evidence of the fact that they are hardly alone in  their misfortune. It put them finally asunder in 176 words.  <p>  <p>After the estimated &#163;15m divorce settlement, the final reckoning was less expensive. In return for the standard fee of &#163;20, Robin West, chief clerk  to the court's Family Division, issued the decree. As at their wedding up the road, every detail of  the divorce was subject to scrutiny. Somerset House staff recorded that the marriage ended at 10.27am  and that it was the 5,029th decree absolute processed this year. Copies of the historic document were  later made available for &#163;1 each, an unpoetic souvenir to add to the royal mugs, brochures and  plaques produced for the marketing of the marriage in 1981.  <p>  <p>Six weeks after the divorce was granted, the certificate records: "And no cause having been shown,  it is hereby certified that the said decree was on the 28th day of August 1996 made final and absolute  and that the said marriage was thereby dissolved."  <p>  <p>Charles remained behind the walls of Balmoral all day. Elsewhere in the family's summer holiday,  there was a tendency to seek even greater privacy by taking to the hills.  <p>  <p>The Queen went riding alone by the river Dee. The Duke of Edinburgh went fishing alone on a trout  loch; prudent escapes from morning television bulletins which were leading on a mildly jarring gesture  by Diana. She turned up at a long-arranged visit to the English National Ballet wearing her wedding  and engagement rings, watched by a crowd which happened to contain an instant expert on such conduct.  <p>  <p>'It's not a sign of letting go," said David Cohen, author of Body Language In Relationships. "I  think it's an unhappy thing to wear your wedding and engagement rings on the day of your divorce."  <p>  <p>Later, however, another expert, David Williamson, of Debretts, said: "If they are nice rings, and  she likes them, there is no reason why she should not continue to wear them. There is no form or style  on this." Inside the English National Ballet, a television interviewer asked the company's principal  male dancer: "It is said that she was particularly keen to meet you?" In Scotland, John Major did not  rule out Charles remarrying. For both of the ex-couple, it was an all too typical first day of the  rest of their lives.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>The Prince and Princess of Wales divorce</b><br><br><br><b><h2>29 August 1996</h2></b><br><h2>So why did the Princess wear the rings?   </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sally Weale</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>With this ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship, and with all my worldly goods I thee endow.  <p>  <p>She may have been stripped of her title, but yesterday, as an anonymous clerk in the bowels of Somerset House rubber-stamped the divorce of the century, Diana, Princess of Wales, made it plain that she and her diamonds are not to be parted.  <p>  <p>As she made her first public appearance as a divorced woman at the headquarters of the English National Ballet, all eyes fell to her left hand, on which she wore the bulky sapphire and diamond engagement ring which launched the Wales's ill-fated union - and a million cheap Ratner's copies besides. Tucked beside it, for those with sharp eyes, was the plain band of Welsh gold that Charles slipped on to her finger in St Paul's. In 15 years of public squabbling and private despair, the dazzling blue and white cluster, purchased for &#163;28,500 by Charles as bridegroom-to-be from Garrard, has endured. It was there at the beginning, in the awkwardly posed engagement pictures; it was on the mugs and the posters; it was there on the foreign tours; it was probably there in the operating theatre, tucked away under latex gloves, in breach of hospital hygiene regulations. But why, on the day the marriage finally ended, did she decide to wear it? For dyed in the wool feminists, the ring has always been the symbol of the oppression of marriage, to be cast off with a triumphant flourish. But with one in three marriages now ending in divorce, the ring has lost much of its historic symbolism.  <p>  <p>Diana's decision to wear hers may be little more than a final gesture of girlish defiance. It's a bloody nice ring, why shouldn't she wear it?   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chris McGreal</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>After months of speculation, a spokesman for Nelson Mandela confirmed yesterday that the South African president has a "steady relationship" with Graca Machel, the widow of former Mozambican president, Samora Machel. Parks Mankahlana was responding to a report in a Johannesburg newspaper that Mr Mandela, aged 78, is in love with Mrs Machel, aged 50. "All I can say is, the story is not untrue. But I'm not aware of any marriage plans," Mr Mankahlana said.  <p>  <p>The relationship has been an open secret in South Africa since last year, but speculation was fuelled again two weeks ago when the couple kissed at the wedding of the Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe.  <p>  <p>The story, in yesterday's Sunday Independent, quoted sources in the president's African National Congress as saying the couple will take a higher public profile and that Mrs Machel will spend two weeks a month at the president's home.  <p>  <p>There is unlikely to be any serious public objection to the relationship, given the widespread view that Mr Mandela deserves whatever happiness he can find, and general respect for Mrs Machel, who heads a United Nations children's project in South Africa.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Damon Hill sacked by Williams team</b><br><br><br><b><h2>3 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Why Williams dropped the £5m man  </h2>
  <br><br>So you want to know why Damon Hill isn't good enough for Frank Williams. Or, to put it another way, why a man worth &#163;5m a year ago is apparently worth nothing now, despite winning more than half the Formula One races held this season.  <p>  <p>What on earth could persuade Williams to reject the services of a driver who may well wrap up the world championship in Italy on Sunday afternoon? A man who has worked happily with the team for six years?  <p>  <p>The answer is short and brutal, and you could see it with embarrassing clarity halfway through the telecast of the Belgian Grand Prix nine days ago.  <p>  <p>Hill, his nerves jangling as the race for the championship neared its climax, had already messed up the job of getting pole position, foiled when the rain came during the qualifying session, ceding the initiative to his team-mate Jacques Villeneuve.  <p>  <p>Bad luck. Bad timing. But a truly great champion suffers from neither. The likes of Fangio and Senna had a poker player's sixth sense telling them when to draw and when to hold. In this generation, Schumacher has it. By those standards Hill is mortal, like the rest of us.  <p>  <p>Then he made an indifferent start to the race. He has been doing that all season, leading to the extraordinary sight of a potential world champion being treated like a learner driver. Try to imagine Schumacher allowing himself to be dragged into public explanations of his difficulty in co-ordinating the movements of the throttle and clutch pedals. And then, for one reason or another, Hill's pit-stop routine went wrong, making him look foolish as he dodged in and out of the slip-road barriers like an advert for the Cones Hotline.  <p>  <p>Even when he found himself back in 13th place after that little misadventure, he had the opportunity to show what he can do in hot blood. Fangio, Moss, Clark, Senna and even Prost occasionally used such episodes of misfortune as excuses to demonstrate their virtuosity, thrilling the crowd by slicing through the field.  <p>  <p>Maybe Hill was just unfortunate that a camera was focused on him as he came up behind Martin Brundle's fifth-placed Jordan on lap 21 and tried to overtake into Les Combes, a right-hander which offers the Spa circuit's best passing opportunity. At this point Hill's Williams, the best car in the field, was three seconds a lap faster than Brundle's Jordan, a margin that should have made overtaking easy.  <p>  <p>But the world could see what happened when Hill drew alongside, taking the inside line as they approached the corner. Suddenly he seemed to think better of it, braking early and dropping back, letting Brundle take his usual line through the corner. Schumacher - and Villeneuve, Hakkinen, Alesi and probably quite a few others - would have outbraked the Jordan, leaving Brundle to worry about the consequences. There is no time for second thoughts in the business of driving a racing car.  <p>  <p>It took Hill five more laps to get back up to Brundle, ready for another go at the same corner. This time he brought it off, but as he went past a strange thing happened. He made the Williams lunge across the track towards the Jordan, as if unconfident of his ability to bring off the manoeuvre without a hint of intimidation - or as if, after his failure five laps earlier, he felt he needed to make a public show of aggression. A whole theory can plausibly be erected on the basis of a single incident such as this, but there have been several other examples of Hill's flawed decision-making in the heat of battle, and Williams has clearly seen enough of them to reach the logical conclusion that, though he may be a first-class test driver, he lacks a racer's edge and at 36 is unlikely to develop one now.  <p>  <p>Hill's financial demands are beside the point. They are not, in any case, excessive. No, Williams knows that next season, facing Schumacher and Ferrari, his team will need every ounce of competitive advantage, and one way is to raise the level of internal competition by confronting Villeneuve with a new threat from inside the team.  <p>  <p>If I were Hill, I would draw a line under the past four years. And if I were Villeneuve, I would watch Frank Williams more closely from now on.   <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>New children's hospital in Derby to close a few months after opening </b><br><br><br><b><h2>3 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Derby's new children's hospital is the first to be built in Britain this century: It cost the NHS £15m and soon it may have to close  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Ward</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Liam Barry, aged seven, flew in by helicopter yesterday to declare open Derby's new &#163;17m children's hospital - which could be closed by the local health authority in November. Health officials, proud to be involved with the first children's hospital built in Britain this century, tried to prevent gloom from clouding the celebrations.  <p>  <p>"We at the Derby City General Hospital NHS Trust are confident that full use will be made of the new hospital, and we are totally optimistic about its future," said Norman Woods, the trust's chairman.  <p>  <p>But that future is uncertain as the South Derbyshire Health Authority reviews acute services in local hospitals and tries to decide how to cut costs and end duplication. South Derbyshire Health Authority is concerned that it is spending &#163;5m more each year on acute hospital services than other authorities in the Trent region, and is getting less activity for its money.  <p>  <p>It has proposed four options for public consultation to try to end duplication of services by Derby City General (site of the new children's hospital) and Derby Royal Infirmary.  <p>  <p>The first would be to retain both sites, with some 'downsizing'; the second and third would centralise services at one of the present sites; the fourth would be to build a new hospital on a greenfield site.  <p>  <p>Brian Blissett, the health authority's chief executive, described the last as unlikely, but agreed that the new hospital was threatened by one of the remaining options.  <p>  <p>"Of course the health authority and the trusts will want to ensure that they retain, where possible, new developments on both sites. But the authority has to take a long-term view," Mr Blissett said.  <p>  <p>Liam, a regular patient since birth at the old Victorian children's hospital two miles away, did not let this prospect spoil his big day as he drove a model car through a paper barrier into the colourful entrance hall of its replacement, where a fountain plays near the reception desk. Like those in Ladybird, Puffin and Sunflower wards, the desk is child-high, enabling young patients to see what is going on. Parents and children were interviewed as part of the design process and have been rewarded with swirling floors, varied ceilings and two Loch Ness monsters. The NHS gave &#163;15m but the people of Derby, through the Kite Appeal, chipped in &#163;1.5m to provide specialist equipment and create an environment which suggests fun rather than pain.  <p>  <p>Every ward entrance has a play area with books and toys; curtains round the 72 beds are vibrant; one waiting area is in the form of a boat; and a mural in Ladybird ward shows a garden scene with smiling bears, ducks and tortoises plus an infinite number of ladybirds.  <p>  <p>"This is a beautiful place," said Rhiannon Gray, mother of 18-month-old Jordan, who was exploring the carpets of the new building. He was brought in with a broken arm at the old hospital on Sunday, the day it closed after 113 years of service.  <p>  <p>"It's a bit like a fairy tale," said Chris Nelson, a consultant paediatrician with seven dwarfs on his tie. "I have never come across anything like this. My colleagues' jaws drop when they see it. It has been designed for its purpose rather than shoehorned into an existing building." Parents can remain with their children during their hospital stay, sleeping by their side on fold-down chairs or in separate bedrooms. The oncology suite has three self-contained flatlets where parents can live with their children for several weeks. The adolescent unit has its own games room, and terraces and courtyards offer fresh air.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Brindle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Apart from Derby, new children's hospitals are planned in Birmingham and Bristol in what looks like a frenzy of building work compared with the inactivity of the past 100 years. However, experts say this does not signal a return to the fashion for free-standing children's hospitals. The reasons no others have been built for a century in England will continue to dictate policy.  <p>  <p>Most children's hospitals were built by the Victorians through philanthropy and public subscription. Typically, Derby's started as a six-bed unit in a converted house and was expanded six years later into the hospital that served the city for more than 100 years.  <p>  <p>The vogue for children's hospitals receded as doctors realised they needed close access to the specialist skills and equipment in district general hospitals (DGHs). At the same time, the number of children admitted as in-patients was falling. Operations such as tonsils removal are far less common. Surgery is increasingly performed as a day case.  <p>  <p>Keith Dodd, honorary secretary of the College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said that while the new hospital in Derby remained self-contained, it was moving to the general hospital site. "We have super facilities, but we also have the back-up of a DGH - the surgeons, anaesthetists, all the support services on one site."  <p>  <p>Except the very large children's hospitals such as Great Ormond Street in London, and Alder Hey in Liverpool, the future for the remainder will increasingly be as departments within, or alongside, large general units.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>Police last night said the body of a boy found drowned on a beach at Sheringham, north Norfolk, on Sunday had been formally identified as that of four-year-old Tom Loughlin, who vanished from a beach 30 miles away with his six-year-old sister, Jodi, two weeks ago.  <p>  <p>Jodi's body was found on a beach between Sheringham and nearby Weybourne last week, and tests showed she drowned.  <p>  <p>The two children were last seen running excitedly toward the beach at Holme, near Hunstanton, Norfolk, on Sunday, 18 August, a day after beginning their holiday. Neither could swim. Their parents, Kevin Loughlin and Lynette Thornton, both 37 and from Norwood, south London, have remained in Norfolk since the tragedy.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Maggie O'kane</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Four-year-old Tom Loughlin was to have his first day at school today but instead his parents are preparing for his funeral. He is to be buried with his sister, Jodi, aged six, in the next few days.  <p>  <p>The parents of the two children, who drowned on holiday in Norfolk, said yesterday they were bracing themselves for a traumatic return home without them. Their bodies were washed up about 30 miles from Holme beach, near Hunstanton, where they disappeared on 18 August. Jodi's body was found last Friday and Tom's on Sunday.  <p>  <p>Speaking to the media yesterday, Kevin Loughlin and Lynette Thornton, said their plans were to go home to Norwood, south London, and try to lead a normal life: "Whatever normal is now; I am not sure what it is," said Mr Loughlin.  <p>  <p>There was some consolation in the fact that the bodies had been found and the uncertainty was over. The worst part had been the waiting and not knowing.  <p>  <p>"They were very close," he said. "They played together all the time. At least they have died together. They have not suffered, and we can give them a decent burial."  <p>  <p>The couple, who were composed throughout their interview, said they had since discovered that the tide at Holme was particularly high when the children vanished and that there were strong currents offshore. Ms Thornton said the sea had appeared so shallow and calm when they arrived: "We were duped by it."  <p>  <p>Mr Loughlin said the couple had paid the highest price for taking their eyes off them for a few minutes.  <p>  <p>"With the best will in the world I don't think there is a parent in the whole country who can honestly say they keep their eye on their children at every moment," Mr Loughlin said.  <p>  <p>The couple had been swamped with cards, flowers and goodwill messages from the people of Norfolk and throughout the country during the "emotional nightmare" of the past two weeks.  <p>  <p>"It comes and goes: sometimes we felt desperate; other times it doesn't feel so bad," said Mr Loughlin. "Before Jodi's body turned up last Friday we were both hopeful that they would be found safe and well. Since Friday it has been difficult."  <p>  <p>He said they took comfort from the fact that the children's last moments alive were spent on the beach: "It does help a little to think that they were having fun. They were happy."  <p>  <p>It had been hard to return to their holiday cottage on the day they vanished, he said. "We had got the children's things around - games, Jodi's teddy and other little bits and pieces. A million 'if onlys' have been going through our minds: if only we had gone straight into the water with them; if only we had not gone to the beach."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>'Stormin' Norma Major joins Conservative campaign trail</b><br><br><br><b><h2>4 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Stormin' Norma braves Scots' no-fly zone</h2><h3>How 'first lady' may swing it for Major with the older generation  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hencke</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Norma Major has the reputation of a woman who tells her husband the truth about what the electorate think of his policies.  <p>  <p>A shrewd judge of character and a brilliant gladhander with the party faithful, she is said by Conservative Central Office to be the perfect consort for the grey man of politics - "a Denis Thatcher without the gin". But experts believe that the Tories' new campaigning strategy, to use Mrs Major as a come-on to wavering voters, is quite another matter. Her main political act, after all, has been to arrange quiz shows for the party faithful in Mr Major's Huntingdon constituency.  <p>  <p>Bob Worcester, chairman of Mori, the opinion poll organisation, believes the Tories want Mrs Major to woo the older woman back to the fold. He says she might be an antidote to Cherie Blair's image as a strong, independent woman and bring the more conventional older generation back on side. Ms Blair, who has carved out a successful and highly-paid career as a barrister, is judged to have added to Labour's appeal among younger female voters.  <p>  <p>A recent opinion poll involving more than 18,000 voters shows a big generational divide among women which could give the Tories an improbable fifth election victory.  <p>  <p>Labour has a startling 50 per cent lead among 18 to 24-year-old women which falls to 38 per cent among the 25 to 34-year-old age group and to 28 per cent among 35 to 54-year-olds. There is only a nine per cent lead for Labour among the over 55s. So Norma, aged 54, could be the ideal person to persuade them that perhaps another five years of John is not a bad deal after all.  <p>  <p>But Mr Worcester says that while America has had almost 50 years of strong women who have made a big impact, right up to Hillary Clinton, Britain has no such tradition. "The evidence is that even Glenys Kinnock, who went on stand for the European Parliament in her own right, had no real impact on voting intentions in 1987 or 1992," he says.  <p>  <p>Peter Golds, a public relations consultant who introduced John to Norma in the 1970s, sees her as a perfect backroom woman rather than a vote-getter. "Contrary to the public image, Norma does enjoy politics, but just as she is someone who does not flaunt her interest in people with learning difficulties, her work with Mencap for over 30 years, her role in delivering meals-on-wheels in the constituency, she doesn't rush to talk about it. She is extremely good at talking to people, shrewd and perfectly capable of conveying their views to her husband."  <p>  <p>Certainly the official role Central Office was claiming for her yesterday will centre on meeting and greeting businessmen and women at Tory dinners, and being by John Major's side as he campaigns. But there will be no policy speeches and no standing on crates.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Norma Major</b>  <p>  <p>Age: 54  <p>  <p>Upbringing: Brought up by her mother, Edith Wagstaff, in Bermondsey, after her father's death in a motorcycling accident in Belgium at the end of the war.  <p>  <p>Education: Boarding schools, then state school in Peckham, then teacher training college.  <p>  <p>Married: 1970 to Lambeth housing chairman, John Major.  <p>  <p>Children: Two. Elizabeth, 24, and James, 21.  <p>  <p>Favourite charity: Mencap, which says she brings in &#163;1m a year. <p>  <p>Career: Taught domestic science and needlework. Became a nanny for Australian opera singer June Bronhill. Gave up work after marriage.

  <br><br>A man caught with a stolen parrot was given away when the bird told police its real name.  <p>  <p>Clive McLoud insisted the sulphur-crested cockatoo, worth more than &#163;1,000, was called Billy and had been given to him. But when suspicious officers introduced the bird to its real owner, Sacha Hinds, it said "Hello" and gave its name as Primrose.  <p>  <p>McLoud, aged 40, a painter and decorator from north-west London, was jailed for 15 months yesterday for handling the stolen parrot. He had insisted he had owned it for nine months.  <p>  <p>Sentencing him at Harrow crown court, Judge Barrington Black said Primrose had been a popular attraction at Miss Hinds' shop, Pets Are Us, in Ealing, west London. "It was known to people and performed tricks."  <p>  <p>The judge said that the bird had been neglected during the time prior to its discovery in a small budgie cage in McLoud's home.  <p>  <p>Judge Black added that the sentence took into account the fact that McLoud had denied the crime, necessitating a three-and-a-half day trial with expert witnesses, costing an estimated &#163;28,000.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Maggie Brown</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Sue Douglas, the only female editor of a national newspaper, resigned yesterday from her &#163;175,000 a year post at the helm of the Sunday Express after eight tumultuous months.  <p>  <p>Insiders said she had paid the price for imposing revolution rather than evolution on the title, scaring middle-aged male readers away with provocative columnists and misjudged headlines.  <p>  <p>Her regime will be remembered for the shock of a front page splash last April, 'A bunch of shits', claiming to quote John Major on European leaders during a summit meeting - rather than for the new sports section and magazine with which she tried to pep up the paper and appeal to younger readers.  <p>  <p>She alienated many staff by her high-handed 'Queen of Sheba' behaviour and willingness to sack long-serving staffers: one, Graham Jones, complained of being discarded like a toffee wrapper, and took her to an industrial tribunal. It found she had hired and fired with complete disregard to good employment practice. "The atmosphere has been toxic," one staff member said yesterday.  <p>  <p>The former deputy editor of the Sunday Times, aged 39, was toppled after returning from holiday in Scotland and was yesterday negotiating a pay-off expected to approach &#163;400,000. Those who had spoken to her report that she was resentful at the way her hard work was being downplayed. She also dismissed suggestions that she may wish to move into the Channel 5 or television arm of MAI, the parent company.  <p>  <p>The Daily and Sunday Express, both selling about 1.2 million copies and urgently seeking readers after 25 years of decline, are being merged into a single editorial team, under Richard Addis, editor of the Daily Express. About 85 jobs, equivalent to the staff of the Sunday paper, are being axed, saving about &#163;4m.  <p>  <p>The weak sister paper, the tabloid Daily Star, is unaffected by the changes. Seven-day operations are common in the United States and some European countries and have been flirted with at the Daily and Sunday Telegraph and the Independent and Independent on Sunday. But they have yet to prove workable in Britain where Sunday papers have personalities of their own. Sir David English, chairman of Associated Newspapers, whose Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday dominate the middle market in which Express titles have to sell, said: "They will be going against the newspaper culture of this country."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sole female editor Sue Douglas resigns from the Sunday Express </b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>A case of poor circulation?</h2><h3>So Sue Douglas has been sacked from her post as editor of the Sunday Express - An everyday tale of newspaper folk, or a victim of her own ambition?  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Angela Neustatter</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Sue Douglas had one senior writer at the Sunday Times almost incoherent with lust the day she came in wearing "a minute doeskin outfit and cowboy boots", and she had no compunction about voicing the stuff of pre-never mind post-feminist thought when she declared that using her sexuality to further her career, if she could, was quite legitimate. Yet nobody is suggesting that her unceremonious removal from much-prized job as editor of the Sunday Express is sexism. Indeed, one fiercely feminist journalist sums up the widely-held view that: "Sue was removed because she threatened to take circulation below one million."  <p>  <p>Ginny Dougary, author of a book on women and the media, feels the same. "It's pure economics," she says. "I think it would be quite wrong to portray Sue as a victim in an anti-female act."  <p>  <p>Certainly victim is not the word that comes to anybody's lips and it is to Douglas's credit that, whatever anyone says about her editing abilities - and opinions are as different as editorials on the Sun and the Times - she has created an image for herself that has defined her very vividly in the collective consciousness. As one colleague on the Sunday Times says with a smile: "Sue made sure she was noticed in as many ways as possible, from the minute she parked her TVR Griffiths sports car outside on the first day. She dressed with huge style and suggestiveness, and she feminised the office in a way that is sadly missed now. There was lots of sweet talk and coaxing and flirting and making us all feel loved."  <p>  <p>She left not an ounce of doubt about her towering ambition, which doubtless endeared her to the likes of Andrew Neil, who recognised that appointing a woman as deputy would be a smart move, but who would have been unlikely to feel warmly towards a Ms who kept needing days off for kids' dental appointments or to stand in for sick nannies. And Douglas has made it publicly plain that this is not a threat, with the most-quoted utterance of all, when she said she felt fine about spending four nights a week staying in her London flat, while her children, Freya and Felix, were still almost toddlers: "They are too young to realise I'm not there much," she said. "The loser isn't them, the loser is me."  <p>  <p>This as much as anything polarised views on Douglas. After all, her decolletage and thrust, her overt sexiness, pales beside that of predecessor, Eve Pollard. But for a mother to be so unapologetically ambitious that she disregards the reams of psychological research about how much children may suffer if they are left too long with nannies pushed her outside the realm of empathy, even of women who support to the hilt a mother's right to work. It evoked the passion of columnist Carol Sarler, a mother herself: "Every mother in the land read that with a shudder. There was sympathy for what she is missing, but it was a shudder unrelieved by her pointing out that men have done it for ever."  <p>  <p>After all, if Douglas were using her femaleness as an asset in her career - one former colleague quoted the story, which may be apocryphal, that during her unsuccessful interview for editorship of the Sunday Times, Douglas leant across and touched Murdoch's knee - she could not have it both ways. And that applied to her tenure. The circulation of the Sunday Express, which had certainly been declining for the best part of a quarter century, stood at 1.23 million when Douglas took over in January and has now dipped to 1.2 million. <p>  <p>Veronica Wadley, associate editor of the Daily Mail, sees it as entirely logical that this has happened. Like Douglas, she has operated from an utterly focused ambition and has climbed the ladder steadily in the midst of ambitious male hierarchies, although, unlike Douglas, Wadley has kept her personal profile low, believing that success is not the cult of the individual but that you must be judged by what you produce. She says: "The only thing anyone can be judged by is results."  <p>  <p>A section editor from the Sunday Times recalls - somewhat sadly, in light of the affection he clearly felt for Douglas: "When she came in as deputy editor, it seemed plain to me that she wasn't up to it. She had tabloid ideas for a broadsheet paper. She is not a good judge of writing. But as stupid as anything was the people she insisted on taking on at the Express - writers like Christa d'Souza and Julie Burchill who were utterly wrong for that paper."  <p>  <p>Yet, in the view of Lesley White, who also worked for Douglas at the Sunday Times, she could have made a go of it. "She was making radical changes and she had the courage of her convictions to keep going. She was a terrific boss, very inspiring for writers. The best of editors make waves and it is the job of management to support them."  <p>  <p>Although the raft of writers Douglas removed within a fortnight of arriving at the Express do not feel the same, the interesting thing about this woman is that even they suddenly voice a sort of protective warmth. Take Harry Ritchie, who was literary editor at the Sunday Times under Douglas. "At first I was perplexed by her," he recalls, "but I gradually came to like her. She would flatter more than threaten, which was by no means house style. And the thing I really admired was that she was brilliant at putting up with people's hostility. When she first came to the Sunday Times, the management hated her, but she didn't let it affect her. I would have gone home in tears."  <p>  <p>A woman writer who declares that she believes Douglas is in a way two people rolled into one may well get closest to pinning the essential truth. She says: "You could go out and have a girlie lunch with her and talk about men, clothes and all that and be really cuddly. But then you saw how absolutely, terrifyingly ruthless she was as well."  <p>  <p>Douglas, forging her way in a world that makes shark-infested waters look like a teddy bears' picnic, attempted to mould these two personas into one, believing that this formula could work for her ambition. And, while she must look back with bewilderment on the splendid, glittering party the Express powers-that-be held for her just a month ago, Douglas is unlikely to be crawling home to Oxford cowed and beaten. Indeed not, says White, a friend as well as colleague. "She'll be burning with frustration," she says, "because she will know she could have made a success of the Express, given time. But while some of us might be licking our battered egos and wanting to keep out of sight, she'll be planning her comeback. I imagine she's on the phone right now."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>      <p>The Duchess of York has been threatened with a &#163;2m law suit over an attempt to block a book about her affair with John Bryan, it emerged yesterday.

"I have warned the duchess my company will be seeking damages from her of &#163;2m if Dr Starkie's book is wrongly delayed by her actions," he said.  <p>  <p>At a preliminary hearing on Friday, a High Court injunction granted to the duchess to prevent publication of Dr Starkie's 'Fergie: Her Secret Life', was extended for at least two weeks pending a full court hearing.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sarah, Duchess of York, gets injunction against Allan Starkie's biography  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>26 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>£500,000 hurdle for duchess in Bryan book fight</h2><h3>We will see her in court, says publisher of "explosive account"  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Kamal Ahmed</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Duchess of York, who is reported to have debts totalling more than &#163;1m, has been ordered to lodge &#163;500,000 with a court as part of her attempt to block the publication of a book detailing her relationship with John Bryan.  <p>  <p>The money is security for any damages that might be won by the publishers of the book, 'Fergie: Her Secret Life', by former close friend Allan Starkie. The book has been halted by an injunction lodged by the duchess. Mr Justice Astill agreed yesterday that the injunction should be continued and a hearing has been set for 7 October.  <p>  <p>The duchess faces the prospect of giving evidence at that hearing, where she is likely to be questioned closely about her private life.  <p>  <p>The injunction, granted after a four-day hearing in private, prevents publication of information gained during Dr Starkie's involvement in the duchess's affairs. He was once a business partner of Mr Bryan. Dr Starkie signed a deal last month with Michael O'Mara Books, which published 'Diana: Her True Story'. Dr Starkie's book has been described by Mr O'Mara as an "explosive account of every element of her relationship". If the duchess failed to find the money, said Mr O'Mara's solicitor, Suzanne Reeves, an immediate application would be made to have the injunction lifted.  <p>  <p>"The judge has asked her to provide &#163;500,000 to compensate me for damages in the event of her losing the case," Mr O'Mara said. "We are assuming the duchess will be called to give evidence in the case and we look forward to seeing her there."  <p>  <p>He said he expected the duchess would have to answer "a lot of questions about her relationship with various people over the past six years". The case, Mr O'Mara said, would be "extremely amusing for everybody". Mr O'Mara said he believed the main reason for the duchess seeking an injunction was so that her own memoirs, which are due to be published next month, would have "a clear run" into the vital selling period leading up to Christmas.  <p>  <p>"She is publishing her own version of events, as vetted by the palace, in a few weeks. She, and perhaps the palace as well, have an interest in keeping the truth from the public," he said.  <p>  <p>Jonathan Coad, of the duchess's solicitors, Schilling and Lom, said he had "absolutely at this stage no idea" whether the duchess would appear in court.  <p>  <p>One source of the money could be American publishers Simon & Schuster, which has signed a &#163;1m contract with the duchess for her memoirs.  <p>  <p>The duchess also recently signed a lucrative deal with the magazine Paris-Match for a series of celebrity interviews.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>The former INLA leader, Hugh Torney, shot dead</b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Murder of INLA leader "signals end of feuding"</h2><h3>A republican group's position after 21 years of bloody dispute  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Vivek Chaudhary</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The political wing of the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) said yesterday that the murder of Hugh Torney, its former leader, could signal the end of bloody internal feuding that has plagued the organisation since it was founded 21 years ago.  <p>  <p>Torney, aged 41, was shot dead outside a house in Lurgan, Co Armagh, on Tuesday night. He had been staying in the safe house after jumping bail on arms charges in the Republic of Ireland.  <p>  <p>Torney was arrested with three other men early last year after they were caught moving a big arms consignment outside Dublin during the IRA's ceasefire.  <p>  <p>His killing is the latest episode in a power struggle within INLA, which has claimed the lives of six people since January, including a nine-year-old girl who was accidentally killed during a shoot out between rival INLA members.  <p>  <p>A spokesman for the Irish Republican Socialist Party, INLA's political wing, said: "The feud is all but over. Torney and a handful of others led an insignificant breakaway faction. Many of his men have defected and there are no experienced gunmen left to take over."  <p>  <p>The feud started after Torney, who was married with three children, was deposed as INLA chief of staff when he independently declared a ceasefire from a Dublin court after his arrest on arms charges.  <p>  <p>Gino Gallagher took over as the INLA's leader, but the organisation split between his Belfast Brigade and Torney's GHQ faction, leading to a bloody battle for control. In January, Gallagher was shot dead in Belfast, sparking the latest round of killings.  <p>  <p>Torney was first imprisoned in 1971 when, aged 17, he was shot by a British soldier while holding a shotgun. He was an active member of the IRA but left in 1975 and joined INLA, a breakaway faction.  <p>  <p>Torney, who became known as 'Cueball' because of his baldness, survived several assassination attempts both by rivals within his own organisation and by loyalist groups. He wore a blond wig and glasses when he last appeared in public at the funeral of Dessie McCleery, a close friend and leading republican.  <p>  <p>In 1993 Torney was named as the INLA's chief of staff during an Old Bailey trial in which two Irishmen were convicted of trying to steal explosives from a North of England quarry.  <p>  <p>The INLA became know for some of the worst attacks during the troubles and for its internal disputes. It was held responsible for the car bomb that killed Tory MP Airey Neave, the chief opposition spokesman on Northern Ireland, at Westminister in March 1979.  <p>  <p>With Torney now dead, many in Northern Ireland fear that the INLA will try and unite its members by concentrating attacks on security forces and the mainland.  <p>  <p>* Up to 3,000 people marched to the centre of Portadown, Co Armagh, last night in support of Billy Wright, the loyalist who continues to defy the Protestant paramilitary leadership's death threats if he does not leave Northern Ireland.  <p>  <p>The march ended in a rally addressed by Mr Wright and the Rev William McCrea, Democratic Unionist MP for Mid Ulster. Outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force members also attended.  <p>  <p>Mr Wright said that it represented a massive show of support for his stance against the way the peace process was going and loyalist parties' involvement in it.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Duncan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>There were no long queues of Chelsea fans lining the road from Fulham Broadway to cancel their season tickets yesterday, no true Blues spitting mad at the Reds under the Stamford Bridge bed, just a stream of hurried lunch-break arrivals picking up tickets for the next home game. <p>  <p>"I think Matthew Harding should be able to do what he likes with his money," said Bill O'Regan. "I suppose it would be nice to see another million quid going on players at Chelsea, but he's obviously got plenty more where that came from, so he can do what he wants."  <p>  <p>Others, like Kenny Baxter, a Fulham resident, were positively happy. "I'm Labour myself so I think it's great. Harding is genuinely a man of the people and it doesn't surprise me that he supports Labour. To be honest though I wish it could all be kept secret. I don't really like politics and sport getting mixed up. I hate all these politicians getting involved and claiming they are football supporters. David Mellor is all right, but the rest..."  <p>  <p>Mellor himself, a Chelsea regular, MP and presenter of Radio 5's 606 phone-in, was putting a brave face on Harding's pro-Labour deal. "I wish he had bought a chunk of Georgi Kinkladze," he said. "We could have had his left leg and a bit of his right wrist for that money!"  <p>  <p>The wryest smiles came from those Chelsea fans who recalled the distinctly right-of-centre views of the club chairman Ken Bates, who has been known to expound upon patriotism, national service and free-market politics in his programme notes.  <p>  <p>"I wouldn't mind being a fly on the wall at the next board meeting or the next time John Major comes to the Bridge," said Alan Holdaway, from Haslemere, Surrey. "It's not as if Bates and Harding need another thing they can disagree about, is it?" The pair have fallen out regularly over the running of the club. <p>  <p>"There's no doubt it will wind up Ken," said Ross Fraser, chairman of the Chelsea Independent Supporters' Association. "I should think Mr Harding will be having a chuckle over his oysters and Guinness at the effect it has on him. But Matthew Harding is a genuine man of the people; it's not an affectation when you see him with supporters in the pub before games, or on the terraces. Ken's probably seething."  <p>  <p>"Why should I be interested?" said Mr Bates, with the merest hint of gruffness. "I have no view of what Mr Harding does with his money." Maybe. Or perhaps the Brinks Mat van that left Chelsea at midday yesterday was sending a Bates contribution to Smith Square?  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Matthew Harding donates £1m to the Labour Party</b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Blues see red - Chelsea's Trojan Horse  </h2><b>Leading article</b><br><br><br>
       <p> <p>Labour's strategists were quite right to be quietly gloating over yesterday's revelation that Matthew Harding, the City financier and vice chairman of Chelsea Football Club, had given the party &#163;1m. What was interesting was not just that it was a record individual donation to Labour of transfer fee proportions (and the second donation of &#163;1m in a week), but where it came from. Chelsea has hitherto been seen almost as a Tory fiefdom - run by Ken Bates, a Tory voter, and with John Major and David Mellor as its most prominent supporters (until Mr Major was persuaded last year to stay away after supporters barracked him believing he brought the team bad luck). Although no one has done a survey it is probable that Chelsea supporters contain a higher share of Tory-inclined voters than most other clubs.  <p>  <p>Supporters may jest that &#163;1m could have been used to buy another player (or at least a downpayment on one), but it is Mr Harding's own money and the way he chose to spend it couldn't have been more hurtful to Mr Major. The successful City businessman said bluntly he regarded Mr Blair's Labour Party as the true party of enterprise and added yesterday: "I really feel that what New Labour under Tony Blair's leadership is trying to do is the right thing at the right time. In America you can be fabulously wealthy and be a Democrat and nobody blinks an eyelid. As we come towards the millennium I think it's a great opportunity for the whole country to rethink how it is governed." Ouch. It was as if Vinny Jones announced he was becoming a Quaker.  <p>  <p>Mr Harding has at least been practising what he preaches by sinking his own savings into improvements in Stamford Bridge's infrastructure which, together with Football Trust money and the construction of a hotel, will produce a kind of Keynesian regeneration. If the rest of industry had followed Chelsea's example, the recovery of the economy would have been much more robust. Of course, part of Chelsea's revival is down to the traditional British vice of buying imports (manager Ruud Gullit and sundry European stars). But they are classy players who have boosted the image of a club renowned for its rough edges. In this sense Chelsea may be a metaphor for the Labour Party as it moves itself subtly upmarket.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Cardinal Basil Hume says the government has a "moral duty" to asylum seekers </b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Hume's plea for asylum seekers</h2><h3>Government's "moral duty" to restore some aid  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>James Meikle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Cardinal Basil Hume, leader of Roman Catholics in England and Wales, yesterday said the Government should show "moral responsibility" by restoring some state aid to asylum seekers. He said that voluntary and church groups trying to help up to 10,000 people stripped of their benefit and housing rights might not cope this winter. Britain's response to their plight would be a touchstone of its moral health.  <p>  <p>The Government should devote part of the &#163;400m a year it may save through the curbs to prevent destitution and "acute social distress". Cardinal Hume, opening a 50-bed night shelter in central London to which he is said to have made a "very generous personal donation", said the Government had a legitimate interest in ensuring fair and efficient procedures for genuine asylum seekers.  <p>  <p>But such people, often blamed for being a burden on the state or taking others' jobs, were "a useful scapegoat for those who wish to appeal only to other people's self-interest or who promote a narrow nationalism". The curbs apply to asylum seekers who fail to seek refugee status on arrival in this country or who are appealing against rejection of their applications.  <p>  <p>But Cardinal Hume said even those granted refugee status were often surviving on income support and living in overcrowded accommodation. The need for the shelter was a grim omen, he said.  <p>  <p>"I do believe the Government have a moral responsibility... to provide financial support to those voluntary organisations which are taking the strain."  <p>  <p>By denying asylum seekers funds, the Government was denying them the chance to pursue legal claims.  <p>  <p>He and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, had met the Social Security Secretary, Peter Lilley, in January and had warned him of the "grave misgivings" about the effects of the changes, which were first introduced in February.  <p>  <p>Voluntary groups say a crisis is approaching, especially since emergency legislation in July put the policy on a legal basis following an Appeal Court ruling in June that the initial benefit cuts were illegal. Increasing numbers are thought to be sleeping rough although most are still being offered shelter in their different communities. Some may wait three years for their cases to be determined.  <p>  <p>The shelter, run by the Refugee Council, includes an advice centre, washing and laundry facilities, a medical centre, room for prayer, and English classes. Several organisations and companies, including the building industry's charity, Crash, have helped provide the centre, which will cost nearly &#163;400,000 a year to run. There is only enough cash at present to last to December.  <p>  <p>The Department of Social Security said yesterday: "Genuine refugees currently not getting benefit but granted asylum will get benefits backdated. "They can then pay the voluntary organisations and church groups who have been accommodating them."  <p>  <p>Voluntary organisations would have to take the strain. "If a church is convinced of an individual's case, they can be confident there will be money there at the end of the day."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Extracts from Cardinal Hume's speech yesterday</b>  <p>  <p>Asylum seekers are not generally popular. They easily arouse hostility and resentment - because they are foreign, or apparently a burden on social security, or suspected of taking jobs for low wages from citizens of this country. They make a useful scapegoat for those who wish to appeal only to other people's self-interest or who promote a narrow nationalism which denies our obligations as members of a single human family to those who come here fleeing persecution.  <p>  <p>It seems to me that the reception given to those applying for asylum is an illuminating indicator of the state of a society's moral health. Most refugees and asylum seekers come from very poor countries and flee to neighbouring very poor countries. By far the greater part of the burden of helping refugees in today's world falls upon those with least to share with them. How do we react to the far smaller numbers who come here? I do believe the Government has a moral responsibility not only to monitor the situation very carefully, but also to provide financial support to those voluntary organisations who are taking the strain. They cannot and should not be expected to cope unaided when the humanitarian demands they are faced with have become so much more acute as a direct consequence of government policy.  <p>  <p>There is a question of justice here. Those deprived of benefits include all who apply for asylum 'in-country' rather than at the port of entry, and all who are appealing against a negative decision. Both are in the middle of a legal right to seek asylum. But the acute lack of funds deprives them of the basic means of living and of paying the telephone, stamps, and travel costs of pursuing their legal claims.  <p>  <p>For this reason the Court of Appeal ruled earlier this year that the denial of benefits effectively rendered their legal right to apply for asylum valueless. The Government overruled the court by amending the Asylum and Immigration Bill. But the moral and practical force of the court's judgment still stands."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Labour Scottish spokesman, George Robertson, comments on Scottish devolution </b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The Scottish conundrum</h2><h3>The long fight against Westminster centralisation and the federal problem Labour has yet to solve  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>"The trouble with devolving government in Britain," the Tory policy guru, David Willetts, once observed, "is that England is the wrong size." By that he meant it is too big to sit easily in a federal system with regional government in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  <p>  <p>Unlike Germany or Spain, few English regions have sufficient local identity to readily allow for eight or 10 regional assemblies to match those demanded, at least by the political classes, on the Celtic fringe. It has not stopped efforts to decentralise the modern British state almost since the enforced union with Ireland in 1800 came a century after the more-or-less voluntary Act of Union between England and Scotland in 1707. <p>  <p>With Labour in turmoil over its Scottish devolution plans again yesterday, there was also trouble simmering in Wales where Tony Blair's insistence on proportional representation for a Cardiff assembly has stirred resentment among Labour MPs in the valleys, who fear it will give disproportionate power to Plaid Cymru.  <p>  <p>It is d&#233;j&#224; vu. Home Rule for Ireland wrecked Gladstone's last government in the 1880s. But for the first world war it might have wrecked Asquith's in 1914 after Protestant Ulster threatened a rebellion. Instead, the IRA emerged from the blood of the 1916 Easter Rising.  <p>  <p>In Scotland, nationalism has been a reviving force since the prestige of the imperial British state collapsed after the second world war. Ironically, the immediate damage inflicted on Labour stems from John Major's appointment of the Thatcherite Michael Forsyth as Scottish Secretary in 1994 after a series of conciliatory grandees. Forsyth backed symbolic gestures, like the return of the ancient Stone of Scone to placate the Scots. But he also opened up against Labour's devolution plans which had been honed in a multi-party Constitutional Convention since 1991. With Liberal Democrat and Scottish TUC support - the Scottish Nationalist Party walked out and the Tories never joined in - they produced a model for an assembly which would have tax-raising powers and proportional representation, unlike the model the last Labour government failed to impose.  <p>  <p>John Smith, a Scot who believed in Europe of the regions, had been happier with this consensus than Tony Blair. When the wily Forsyth started saying the 'Tartan tax' would cost Scots up to 3p in the pound, and hit jobs and inward investment, Mr Blair and his shadow Scottish secretary, George Robertson, instituted a review.  <p>  <p>The result was the 26 June announcement that before a Blair government legislates to create an assembly it would seek a majority of Scottish voters in a two-question referendum: do they want an assembly and should it have tax-raising powers? It is hard to convey the anger this U-turn created among nationalists, Liberal Democrats and nationalistic-Labour activists.  <p>  <p>The theory was that a referendum win would legitimise the proposed assemblies and make it harder for Tories to fillibuster in Parliament as they did in 1976-79. What infuriated pro-devolutionists was the suspicion that Mr Blair was really inviting Scots voters to say 'No' to tax-raising powers which Mr Robertson had wanted precisely because it would instill responsibility into an assembly.  <p>  <p>Without them, he reasoned, the SNP would be able to accuse London of keeping Scotland short of cash even though - as John Major said again in Glasgow this week - the Treasury gave "over &#163;17 more per person per week" to support public services in Scotland than in England.  <p>  <p>It might not under devolution, if Scots MPs continued to keep voting powers over England's affairs, as in the famous West Lothian riddle posed in 1976 by the anti-devolutionist Tam Dalyell. Why should West Lothian's MP be able to vote on West Bromwich's schools and not vice versa? he asked. It is hard to have a semi-federal system and in 17 years of opposition Labour has managed to refine the problem, but not solve it.  <p>  <p>Yesterday's U-turn which brought Tory and SNP jeers reflects tactical maneouvres to minimise Labour as a Tory target.  <p>  <p>Labour's Scottish executive, split over the 26 June change as is the whole Scottish party, voted on Saturday to back the two-part referendum, but only if voters were offered another referendum before the Edinburgh assembly actually raised (or lowered) the Scots tax rate.  <p>  <p>Touring Scotland this week Mr Robertson found no support for this compromise. So, he revealed yesterday, he persuaded Mr Blair to drop it. Some Scottish commentators compare the June 26 U-turn with 1707 or with Bannockburn - a decisive turning point which will lead neither to Mr Major's status quo nor to Labour's halfway house of an Edinburgh assembly, but to an independent Scotland.  <p>  <p><b>Road to Devolution </b> <p> <p> 1970: Discovery of potential North Sea oil boosts Scottish nationalism. Tory prime minister, Edward Heath, favours a devolved Scottish assembly, Labour does not.  <p>  <p>1974: Scottish National Party (SNP) polls 21 per cent of Scots votes, and and takes seven Commons seats in the February election. Labour returns to power and drops its opposition. All three UK parties support devolution in October general election when SNP wins 11 seats.  <p>  <p>1975: Margaret Thatcher wins Tory leadership and reverses devolution policy. <p>  <p>1976: Labour introduces Scotland and Wales Bill to give both devolved assemblies. Fails to get enough votes to guillotine filibustered debates. Abandons bills.  <p>  <p>1977: Labour splits bill into two and tries again against strong Tory and some Labour opposition.  <p>  <p>1978: Labour rebels insert a referendum clause with assembly needing 40 per cent support from total Scots electorate if bill is to be enforced. <p>  <p>1979: Devolution rejected by voters, heavily in Wales, narrowly in Scotland. Nationalists vote with Thatcher. Labour government falls and 17 years of anti-devolutionary Tory rule begins.  <p>  <p>1991: Constitutional Convention set up by Labour, Liberal Democrats and SNP, to reach consensus on home rule. Tories boycott it and Nats withdraw. <p>  <p>1992: John Major plays Unionist card in general election, and wins two seats back in Scotland. Scots QC and arch-devolutionist, John Smith succeeds Kinnock.  <p>  <p>1993: Major promises to concede more devolved adminstration to Scottish Office.  <p>  <p>1995: New Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth takes initiative against 'Tartan Tax' of up to 3p in the pound granted to Labour's proposed assembly. Blair sets up devolution review committee.  <p>  <p>1996: June - Labour announces referendum on devolution before proposed legislation, plus controversial second question on tax-raising powers. Pro-devolution Scots suspect Blair is luke-warm. Scots executive backs U-turn.  <p>  <p>August - Scottish executive backs further compromise, with second question on tax before Scots assembly actually uses proposed powers.  <p>  <p>Sept - Labour abandons second referendum plan.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Labour Scottish spokesman, George Robertson, comments on Scottish Devolution </b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Blair faces scorn over tax switch  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Labour leader, Tony Blair, last night backed his embattled Scottish spokesman, George Robertson, in the face of a torrent of anger, ridicule and resignation calls that followed abandonment of a devolution policy which was just six days old.  <p>  <p>Less than a week after Labour's divided Scottish executive endorsed Mr Blair's two-question referendum plan, Mr Robertson revealed that he wanted to drop the idea of a second referendum on the tax issue which had been appended to clinch last Saturday's majority. The U-turn is the third devolution policy refinement in just over two months and it stunned Labour activists north of the border.  <p>  <p>Relief at the ditching of the almost universally derided second referendum was matched by fury at the evidence of Walworth Road's contempt for the rulings of its Scottish executive.  <p>  <p>Senior ministers, including the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael Heseltine, and the Scottish Secretary, Michael Forsyth, who will renew calls for Mr Robertson's dismissal at a Tory 'rally for the union' in Perth today, were joined in their condemnation by scornful Scottish Nationalists and dismayed Liberal Democrats.  <p>  <p>Mr Robertson, who saw Labour's poll rating in Scotland slip to 48 per cent and the SNP's rise nine points to 29 per cent this week, insisted the latest move was not a change in policy, only "a change in tactics" designed to rid the party of an idea which commanded little or no support.  <p>  <p>Determined to ride out the storm, he nonetheless paid a harsh price at the end of a week in which John Major visited Glasgow to warn that Labour's proposed Scottish assembly, with its power to levy a 3p in the pound 'tartan tax', would jeopardise revived prosperity and the 300-year-old union with England.  <p>  <p>Last night Mr Blair's office said: "Tony is 100 per cent behind George. This initiative has come from George, and Tony gives him his full support. Tony is very happy with what's happened today."  <p>  <p>Mr Forsyth claimed Labour's policy on devolution was in "an extraordinary shambles". He said Mr Robertson had been betrayed by Mr Blair, much as happened when the original referendum U-turn was imposed on Scots activists on 26 June.  <p>  <p>Mr Forsyth yesterday told Radio 4's 'World at One': "We had George Robertson challenging the Prime Minister to respond to their new policy on Tuesday, and almost before we had time to answer they had changed the policy. I think he has been betrayed by his leader."  He added: "This policy has been made in Islington and made by people who have little understanding or sensitivity towards the interests of Scotland." <p>  <p>It was fear that the Scottish executive might reject the Blair-Robertson referendum scheme that made Mr Robertson accept Saturday's second referendum idea, proposed by Mohammed Sarwar, Labour's candidate in Govan. It would have given voters a second vote before the proposed assembly actually used its tax powers.  <p>  <p>Behind the manoeuvres are Labour fears that Mr Major will use the issue to arouse English concern that New Labour is still a high tax party. For that reason many pro-devolution Scots suspected Mr Blair had engineered a referendum with a tax question precisely so that voters would reject it. Mr Robertson dismissed such talk. "We listened to the people and there was no support for the idea of the second referendum," he said. "The policy for devolution was designed in Scotland and it hasn't been changed one dot or comma."  <p>  <p>The Liberal Democrat spokesman on Scottish affairs Jim Wallace, claimed Labour had "driven themselves into a cul-de-sac and they are trying now to get out".  <p>  <p>Ian Smart, secretary of the pro-home rule grouping, Scottish Labour Action, which led the campaign against the second referendum which produced last Saturday's contentious compromise, said: "We regard this as a move in the right direction: two questions is clearly better than three." Mr Sarwar, the executive member who helped to engineer the ill-fated proposal designed to bridge the gap between the leadership and rebels who wanted to drop the question on the parliament's tax-varying status, applauded the party's change of heart.  <p>  <p>"I am glad we have had the courage to accept the people's view," he said. "It is arrogant for any party to stick to policies that are unpopular."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Labour Scottish spokesman, George Robertson, comments on Scottish Devolution </b><br><br><br><b><h2>7 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>A tartan U-turn - And the sooner the better  </h2> </h2><b>Leading article</b><br><br><br>
  <p>In politics as in business there are times to cut your losses. Such a moment has arrived for the Labour Party in Scotland. Its plan to hold not one but two referendums on devolution got more laughs than any stand-up comic on the Edinburgh Fringe; but it was laughter of the wrong sort, laced with justifiable derision. If Labour fell into so disastrous a muddle in opposition, people asked, what on earth would it do in government? <p><p>In Glasgow this week the Prime Minister had sport with what he called a "steeplechase" of stupidity and the Nationalists were able to contrast the simplicity of their message of independence in Europe with the now ludicrously extensive set of fences over which a Home rule Bill, until recently simply dependent on a Labour electoral victory, would be made to jump. More ominously, the SNP are moving up in the opinion polls and are four points short of their historic high point - the second election of 1974 when they took 33 per cent of the vote in Scotland and 11 seats. <p><p>Labour's support for devolution has always contained a large element of pragmatism: above all it is designed to stop the Nationalists in the old industrial heartlands. But home rule within the Union is not a simple concept; were it so, then one of the many devolutionary proposals brought before Westminster since the 1890s would by now have succeeded. <p><p>The devolution quagmire of the Seventies ultimately led to the defeat of the Callaghan Government, and Mr Blair will be well aware of its perils. It would be a bitter irony were his progress in middle England and the City boardrooms threatened by a sudden collapse in the Scottish bedrock. Had shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson simply faced down the criticism that greeted the announcement of the first referendum, the disillusion felt by Labour's partners in the Scottish Constitutional Convention would have been manageable. It is hard to dispute the principle that an important constitutional change should receive direct popular endorsement. Mr Robertson was rattled in the first place by Tory attacks on the 'tartan tax', which the Government asserts will flow from a tax-raising Scottish parliament, and in the second by recriminations about a diluted commitment from within the broad devolutionary camp and the nationalist wing of his own party. The result was the curious fudge of a second referendum. <p><p>Devolution may be designed to head off nationalist sentiment, but there are better reasons why Parliament should support it. A Scottish parliament will not only give Scotland a chance to express its distinctive values within the Union, but will address a real democratic deficit in Scotland, ruled by an oligarchy of quangos loaded with government sympathisers. The powerful Labour regions have been dismembered in a reform of local government imposed without consultation in the most squalid traditions of gerrymandering. <p><p>Scottish devolution is a trail-blazer for more general constitutional change. The most immediate consequence is that the number of Scottish MPs at Westminster will have to be reconsidered, as will the place of the Scottish Secretary in the Cabinet. Labour's acceptance of proportional representation for a Scottish parliament makes it harder for it to resist its application at UK level, and the principle that decision-making should be brought near to the people it affects is ostensibly endorsed even by the Tory Europhobes. <p><p>If Labour's muddle in Scotland has been risible, the cynicism of the Tory tactics is scarcely less so. Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth puts on the kilt for the premiere of 'Braveheart' and persuades the Queen to return the Stone of Destiny to Scotland. He and the Prime Minister talk up nationalism, praising its clarity. This is a masquerade. Their real purpose is to split the opposition vote, and a small Tory recovery along with the SNP rise in the polls suggests that the tactic is having some slight success. Labour has given them further ammunition. It is now in the throes of ditching its commitment to a second referendum. It can't be discarded too quickly. Better a short-season of comedy than a long-running farce.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

       <p>Anyone who still grieves publicly about poor syntax cannot be all bad. Someone needs to speak up for Robert Runcie, former Archbishop of Canterbury, who is under fire for a catalogue of sins: refusing to take 'sexual shenanigans' at a theological college seriously (Observer); keeping his doubts about the 'arranged' marriage between the Prince and Princess of Wales private (Sunday Times); and believing that 'with treatment' homosexuals could marry and have children (The Times). Lord Runcie was accustomed to controversy in his Canterbury days but he could not be blunter about a new biography now being serialised: "I have done my best to die before this book is published." He is upset that his "burblings" into a tape-recorder for background have ended up in print.  <p>  <p>Lord Runcie made the mistake of reaching a gentleman's agreement with his new biographer, Humphrey Carpenter, in an era when gentlemen need legal contracts. Lord Runcie's main sin is naivete. His biographer admits Runcie never asked for a right of veto: "If he had asked for it, I would have said yes. But he didn't." Or he didn't until it was too late. Runcie should relax. His reputation will survive one more biography. His courage - Military Cross and refusal to follow Margaret Thatcher's instructions for the Falklands memorial service - will not be forgotten. He served in the war with Willie Whitelaw. They were both amused by their ultimate careers. Perhaps if Runcie had ended up Deputy Prime Minister and Whitelaw Archbishop, Britain would have been a better place.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Neil Jordan's film, 'Michael Collins', wins the Golden Lion award at Venice </b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Top awards for film depicting rise and fall of IRA legend  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Derek Malcolm</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Irish are coming. 'Michael Collins', Neil Jordan's film about the IRA legend, has won Venice's Golden Lion for best film after receiving a 10-minute standing ovation at its public screening.  <p>  <p>In addition, Liam Neeson who plays Collins - and was rushed from Venice to Parma hospital to be operated on for a blocked intestine halfway through the festival - was voted best actor by Roman Polanski's jury.  <p>  <p>"He's not playing 'Braveheart' and the film's not anti-British," Neil Jordan said. "It's about a man who organised an army and then tried to disperse it - which surely has a lesson for today."  <p>  <p>Jordan insisted that the film was as much about the Irish fighting the Irish as the Brits. That seemed to be accepted, which will be a godsend for a nervous Warner's, who are putting out the film in this country but resisting the American idea of a good poster, which has Neeson waving the IRA flag. Much more surprising than the award given to Neeson was the best actress gong, which went to Victoire Thivisol for her part in Jacques Doillon's 'Ponette'. At four, the actress is the youngest to get a major festival award. She plays, and pretty astoundingly too, a child who loses her mother in a car crash and cannnot accept that she will never see her again, despite everything the father (Xavier Beauvois) can do.  <p>  <p>The film is written and directed by Doillon with great understanding of childhood fears and fantasies.  <p>  <p>Ponette also won the International Critics Award and that may mean increased interest from buyers at a festival where some were in despair at finding a suitable film for audiences suffocated by Hollywood.  <p>  <p>Art was given another fair chance against commerce when the jury awarded Otar Iosseliani, the Georgian director now living in France, the special jury prize for 'Brigands', an overlong but often brilliant parable about the misuse of authority which naturally enough concentrated its fire on the Stalinist era Iosseliani knew so well.  <p>  <p>The jury, which included novelist Paul Auster and actress Anjelica Huston, called this bitter comedy, in which contemporary times are mixed with medieval and each makes a parallel comment about the Communist experience, brilliant and ironic. And so it was.  <p>  <p>Mexican director Arturo Ripstein, once an assistant for Bunuel and now in his 30th year as a director, was another festival success. His 'Deep Crimson', a subtly funny and also horrifying Latin-American take on Leonard Kastle's 'The Honeymoon Killers', won three Osella d'Oro awards - for screenplay, production design and music.  <p>  <p>This weird but rather wonderful film has a fat nurse with halitosis and an ageing gigolo with a slipping hairpiece and migraine pursuing rich widows around Mexico to grab their money.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>James Meikle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Plans for Britain's first 1,000ft plus skyscraper will be unveiled today as London takes a Manhattan-style approach to proving itself a leading world city.  <p>  <p>The proposed &#163;550m, 90-storey building - a third as high again as Canary Wharf - would be Europe's tallest, and will spark a furious debate about just how far architects and City bosses should reach for the sky. The tower has been designed by Sir Norman Foster. Staff at his offices last night refused to discuss the plans for the site of Baltic Exchange, badly damaged by an IRA bomb attack in 1992 which killed three people and injured 80.  <p>  <p>The building, housing up to 10,000 people in hotels, penthouses and offices, would also have 'parks in the sky' at 20-storey intervals, restaurants and recreation areas.  <p>  <p>Those who claim to have seen the plans give a range of descriptions - sleek, elegant, a mixture of concave and convex sides, or a building with 'erotic' gherkin-shaped structures on top.  <p>  <p>Its highest point reaches 1,200 feet, slightly smaller than the Empire State Building in New York, still the best known if no longer the biggest skyscraper of all.  <p>  <p>Tim Cordy, director of the Town and Country Planning Association, warned that there was already a surplus of three million square feet of office space in London.  <p>  <p>Owen Luder, president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, expressed his excitement at the project and his annoyance at those who would object to it. "There were howls of derision when Eiffel wanted to build his tower," he said.  <p>  <p>The Prince Charles camp of architectural traditionalists were bound to oppose it, he said, because "it's not decorated with doric columns. People come from around the world to visit tall buildings and go up to the top of them. Tall buildings are attractive on the skyline."  <p>  <p>Stuart Murphy, former city architect and planning officer to the City Corporation, had reservations. "The corporation is in a dichotomy - it does not want to lose out to any other capital, but then what ruined Manhattan is that they didn't make any effort to preserve the skyline." He dismissed concerns about the shadow cast by the tower. "It's clearly a slim tower, so the shadow will be short."  <p>  <p>A spokesman for the corporation said: "My understanding is a formal application will be submitted and the planning commiteee will look at it next month."  <p>  <p>Owners of the Baltic Exchange, a Grade II listed building, are thought to have been paid about &#163;26m by insurers after the bombing. Two years ago the Exchange transferred to another building nearby.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Norman Foster reveals designs for his Millennium Tower to be built in London </b><br><br><br><b><h2>10 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Foster's vision: a tower to trump the rest of the city  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>James Meikle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>It will be the ultimate in social climbing - the 1,200 ft high home which everyone can see but where a helicopter is needed to peer into the windows.  <p>  <p>Those who believe the sky is the limit and money no object will soon be competing for a new top 40 as one of a select band of owners of multi-million pound apartments in the tail-fin tops of Europe's biggest building.  <p>  <p>Floors 75 to 87 of the London Millennium Tower will become among the most exclusive addresses in Europe if plans outlined yesterday by the architect, Sir Norman Foster, win approval.  <p>  <p>But hopes that the residents will move into the two mini-towers, one higher than the other, in 2001, are likely to be dashed even if the Corporation of London allows the 92-storey building.  <p>  <p>It will house scores of offices, up to seven trading floors, restaurants and 'gardens in the sky', including one 1,000ft above street level, where the public will also be allowed on to a viewing gallery.  <p>  <p>The Government seems certain to order an inquiry, thus delaying the timetable for the tower, which will cost &#163;400m in building expenses alone, and is nearly 1,265ft high, with a 162ft mast. It will house about 8,000 office workers - but who wants to live so high up? Quite a lot of people, according to Nick Tomlinson, of the international division of estate agents Knight Frank.  <p>  <p>"There are those who have always wanted to be on top of the world. They tend to be wealthy and not to have any children," he explained. "Once you are above 20 floors, above the treescape and adjoining buildings, you are in a different world. It is a fantastic feeling if you are not afraid of heights." The new apartments would fetch a "stonking price", he said.  <p>  <p>Life in high condominiums in New York, or even in the Belvedere penthouses at the top of the pagoda-like 20-storey tower at Chelsea Harbour in London, where prices can be &#163;3.5m, was different, he pointed out, from being in a council tower block where the lifts were inclined not to work. Betty Lou Taradash, who lives on the 60th floor of Chicago's Hancock building, the world's tallest residential tower block, 100 storeys high, said: "I can't think of any disadvantages. We have a residents' association and we even have a grocery store on the 44th floor."  <p>  <p>Outlining his plans for the site which is now occupied by the Baltic Exchange building, badly damaged by an IRA bomb four years ago, Sir Norman, aged 61, said: "Tall buildings are expressions of the energy and aspirations of world class modern cities." He went on: "The London Millennium Tower will be a statement of confidence in the City for the next century."  <p>  <p>Sunlight hitting the curved glass facade of the building would make it appear "elegantly slender and provide a different view of the building from each side", Sir Norman said.  <p>  <p>The building would fit in with the skyline in the heart of the City. It would not in any way stand out like "a stick of rhubarb". He added: "The thrill is doing it in London and not having to travel to other parts of the world. London deserves it."  <p>  <p>Alan Winter, of developers Trafalgar House, said: "It will provide a landmark statement of the City of London's pre-eminence as Europe's financial capital."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Stylish markers along the way </b> <p>  <p>The range of projects designed by Sir Norman Foster is considerable. Among them are:  <p>  <p>Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, University of East Anglia, Norwich - opened 1978: Gleaming, aluminium-skinned arts centre, easily mistaken for aircraft hangar.  <p>  <p>Willis Faber Building  - Ipswich - opened 1975 - Shiny black insurance company headquarters, in the shape of a grand piano, with a lawn on the roof and swimming pool in basement. Now Grade I-listed. <p>  <p>Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank - Hong Kong - opened 1986: Exposed steel skyscraper, with huge internal atrium and a remote-controlled sun scoop to bring light inside. Cost: &#163;500m.  <p>  <p>Stansted Airport - Essex - opened 1991: Huge, white steel-and-glass minimalist temple with a vaulted-umbrella like roof.  <p>  <p>Barcelona Communications Tower - opened in 1992: Looks like Tintin's rocket. A needle-thin mast held in position by steel cables.  <p>  <p>Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre - Glasgow: Locals have dubbed it 'the armadillo'.  <p>  <p>The Reichstag - Berlin - Due to open in 1998: Glass dome inserted behind classical facade.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>British tourist Brian Hagland killed on Bondi Beach</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Bondi Beach killer was "like a robot"  </h2>
  <br><br>The girlfriend of the British holidaymaker Brian Hagland, who was murdered near Bondi Beach at the weekend, spoke yesterday of the moment he was attacked by "a robot".  <p>  <p>Connie Casey, aged 25, told a press conference in Sydney, Australia: "He didn't know these people. They just picked him off the street, and they killed him. He didn't stand a chance."  <p>  <p>Miss Casey said she and Mr Hagland, who is the cousin of 'EastEnders' actor Sid Owen, were on their way home from her leaving party from her job at the Australian Trade Commission. It was then that Mr Hagland, a 28-year-old postman from West Hampstead, north London, and Miss Casey were approached by two youths thought to be high on drugs.  <p>  <p>Miss Casey said: "These men were coming towards us and I just knew by the look on this man's face he was dangerous and was going to do something. I said to Brian: "Don't say anything to him." I was given a presentation of flowers from work and he was holding the flowers and holding my hand. He said: "I'm not going to do anything."  <p>  <p>"Then this man just ran up to him straight away and he said: "Come on, come on, let's have him." And his friend stood back and he just punched Brian and dragged him to the ground. He was on top of him and I hit him with my bag, and was hitting and hitting him because my bag was quite heavy." Miss Casey said she then went to get help. "When I came back he was unconscious and he was covered in blood. It happened in minutes. I didn't think it was serious at first." Of the man who attacked Mr Hagland, she said: "His eyes were glazed. He was robotic. He looked as if he didn't even see Brian."  <p>  <p>She said that she had known Mr Hagland for seven years and they had travelled to Australia with compensation she had received after being a victim of a robbery in which she was doused with petrol by thieves who threatened to set her alight.  <p>  <p>Mr Hagland's mother Shirley, of West Hampstead, has told how Miss Casey had hoped the trip would settle her nerves after the hold-up last year while she was working in a jewellers in Kilburn, north London.  <p>  <p>Mrs Hagland told the People newspaper yesterday: "She was a very nervous girl because of what happened then, so God knows what this will have done to her. When she rang to tell us the terrible news, she said she was drenched in Brian's blood as she tried to save him. I couldn't believe he was dead, and broke down."  <p>  <p>The couple had planned to get engaged in Tahiti later in the year. Miss Casey was in Australia on a work visa while Mr Hagland had a six-month travel visa.  <p>  <p>A spokeswoman for Sydney police said they believe Mr Hagland's attacker was injured during the struggle as they found a trail of blood along Bondi Beach.  <p>  <p>Mr Hagland's murder is the latest in a series of violent incidents which have damaged the reputation of the famous mile-long beach in recent years. Last Christmas rioting broke out when gangs of youths went on the rampage in the early hours of Boxing Day after the traditional festive beach party. In April, a Dorset backpacker Gawen Whalley, aged 22, was stabbed to death by a gang of youths as he walked on a neighbouring beach.  <p>  <p>Australian police have spoken of a worrying new trend of "thrill seeking" attacks which are totally motiveless and often carried out by people high on drugs.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>A witness has claimed British tourist Brian Hagland might have been hit by a bus while brawling with two assailants on a street near Bondi Beach, Sydney's Daily Telegraph reported.  <p>  <p>However, the driver of the bus has denied running over Mr Hagland, aged 28, from north London, who was killed in the early hours of Saturday. Instead the driver told detectives two men hit the side of his bus as they fought, a police spokesman said.  <p>  <p>Mr Hagland's girlfriend, Connie Casey, 25, also from London, earlier told police two men bashed him to death in an unprovoked attack. She described one of the men as "robotic".  <p>  <p>She left the scene during the fight to seek help. When she returned she found her boyfriend unconscious and bleeding. Police said a trail of blood showed one of the assailants was also injured in the fight.  <p>  <p>However, the Telegraph said a witness saw the fight from his apartment window. His view was obscured by a passing bus. He then saw Hagland lying in the street after a bus had left.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>22-year-old Australian has been charged with the murder of the British tourist Brian Hagland on Bondi Beach, police said yesterday.

A 23-year-old man also questioned about the murder was released earlier yesterday without charge.  <p>  <p>Mr Hagland, 28, was beaten and kicked to death by two men as he and his girlfriend, Connie Casey, 25, walked home along a well-lit street near Bondi Beach early on September 7.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chris Drake</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktash, warned yesterday that the island of Cyprus was heading for catastrophe unless immediate action was taken to reduce the growing tension between his community and the Greek Cypriots. He was speaking after a Turkish Cypriot soldier was shot dead on Sunday and another was wounded at a sentry post on the line which has separated the communities since 1974. His people have blamed the Greek Cypriots, but the Cyprus government says there is no evidence its supporters were involved. Turkey's foreign minister, Tansu Ciller, will attend the soldier's funeral today.  <p>  <p>Last month, two Greek Cypriots were killed during demonstrations against the Turkish army's occupation of the north of the island. Mr Denktash said he was again appealing for talks with the Cypriot president, Glafcos Clerides. "If the Greek Cypriots want to keep Cyprus in the headlines and instead of cooling the atmosphere by meeting and talking they want to keep on adding fire to it, then I think the signals are that we are heading for catastrophe," he said.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Norman Foster reveals designs for his Millennium Tower to be built in London </b><br><br><br><b><h2>10 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The ethics of cloud-capped towers</h2>
<h3>Extra tall skyscrapers are not about economics, but egos  </h2></h2><b>Leading article</b><br><br><br>      <p>Sceptics will say it confirms only one fact: Britain's membership of the Third World. Plans were unveiled yesterday for Britain's biggest skyscraper. The proposed 1,200ft Millennium Tower on the site of London's Baltic Exchange would be Europe's tallest building and even 15ft higher than New York's Empire State. Certainly the dimensions of the new project signal the same sense of desperation which surrounded Malaysia's successful bid to build the world's tallest building in Kuala Lumpur. Millennium Tower will still fall 276ft short of Kuala Lumpur's Petronas Towers but will be twice as high as the City's current highest building, NatWest Tower, and half as tall again as Docklands' Canary Wharf. It will ensure that Britain jumps ahead again of Germany, currently completing a 984ft tower in Frankfurt, which may be juvenile but then no-one can accuse Germany of Third World status.  <p>  <p>Ideally there should be no skyscrapers in central London, not because they are nasty but because Europe's historic cities should not need to imitate America. Paris demonstrates the success of rigorous planning rules which push all highrise buildings to the periphery. Life is much more civilised there, living among architecture of a human scale. But central London already has skyscrapers so it would be perverse to rule out a further one. Sir Norman Foster is one of our most creative architects so people cannot quibble about the quality of the proposed building. The existing surplus of three million square feet of London office space raises a more pertinent question. But then, as a member of the Council of Tall Buildings, the body which adjudicates on various international construction claims, has noted: "extra tall skyscrapers are not a matter of economics or population density, it's basically ego".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>The blunders of Brian Mawhinney</b><br><br><br><b><h2>10 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Major's hard man turns off the voters</h2><h3>The dour Ulsterman who has managed to alienate even the blue-rinse Tories  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hencke</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Brian Mawhinney was brought in by John Major to be the Arnold Schwarzenegger of the Tory Party. A tough guy with a killer instinct when dealing with Labour. But now, just over a year into his job as chairman of the party, the hard man of the hustings is doing no better than his wimpish ham-acting predecessor, Jeremy Hanley.  <p>  <p>Far from being a box office hit with the voters, Mr Mawhinney is rated as a doing a bad job by an astounding 85 per cent. Even among the blue-rinsed loyalist vote, the second Ulsterman to make the Cabinet since Walpole's premiership, can only muster a 31 per cent approval rating.  <p>  <p>Labour's equivalent of Big Arnie, John Prescott, who promotes Labour with tough talking and whirly hats, commands 55 per cent support. Mr Mawhinney's final humiliation came yesterday with the Daily Telegraph poll showing that even 41 per cent of all Tory voters back Mr Prescott as doing a good job in putting over the anti-Tory case - 10 per cent above the Tory chairman's rating for bashing Labour.  <p>  <p>How has Mr Mawhinney done so badly? The dour Ulster Protestant had an appalling reputation in the Department of Health and the Department of Transport.  <p>  <p>"The ego has landed" was a regular catchphrase among civil servants when his plane landed.  <p>  <p>"I can honestly say he was the most unpleasant man I've ever had the misfortune to work with," said another Department of Transport official. Those in the Department of Health said he was narrow-minded, prudish, stand-offish and bad tempered. This came out when he banned the "smutty" safe sex guide issued by the now defunct Health Education Authority. He can be charming to individual journalists, but the man who quaffs Lucozade Lite by the crate has little time for small talk and is not keen to take advice or expend too much time on research. Except, of course, to calculate the anti-Tory swing in his Peterborough constituency, where after representing the new town for over a decade, he has now joined the chicken run by opting for a safe new rural Cambridgeshire seat next door.  <p>  <p>Even nearby Tory neighbours like Jerry Hayes, who plans to stand to the bitter end to defend Harlow from rampaging Blairites, have privately felt his action was a stab in the back.  <p>  <p>His year in Central Office has led to a series of gaffes in speeches and the mishandling of presentations to revive the Tories standing in the polls. But he does have strong points. He is guaranteed to be loyal to John Major, and is one of the most sleaze-free politicians in the Tory Party - the only member of the Cabinet who instructed his ministers to have nothing to do with lobbying companies.  <p>  <p>He also has loyal spin doctors - Sheila Gunn, the former Times lobby correspondent and ex-mistress of former transport minister Steven Norris, and Charles Lewington, the former Sunday Express political editor. But Mawhinney was never the favourite of Mr Norris, whose memoirs have been sold to the Daily Mail for a reputed &#163;250,000. Tory insiders will be amazed if yet more Mawhinney gaffes do not emerge in the party faithful's favourite newspaper next month.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Chairman's blunders</b>  <p>  <p>Brian Mawhinney's gaffes landed him in trouble within months of him becoming party chairman on 5 July 1995.  <p>  <p>October 10: Ridiculed Camden Council at the party conference for funding the Hopscotch Asian Women's Centre. It emerged the scheme was funded by the Home Office and Save The Children to teach childcare and basic literary skills to Bangladeshi Women.  <p>  <p>October 11: Angered judges by urging people who feel a sentence is too lenient to write in protest to the judge.  <p>  <p>December 7: Confused a speaking engagement by the Lord Chancellor at the Guildhall with a cabinet document briefing ministers on Lord Mackay's views. The Telegraph printed a story saying Lord Mackay had warned judges not to overstep the mark in quashing ministers' decisions at the Guildhall when he had said nothing of the sort. The leak was traced back to Mawhinney. <p>  <p>February 12, 1996: He attributed remarks supporting the existing House of Lords to left-wing author and director Jonathan Miller confusing him with journalist Jonathan Miller who had penned them. The author Miller said afterwards: "The man is a fool."  <p>  <p>April 17: Became furious on Radio 4's 'Today' programme on the day the local election campaign was launched when it was suggested the Tories would need to do something as dramatic as dumping Thatcher to win the next election. Used mock baked bean tins to ridicule Labour and Lib-Dem tax plans. <p>  <p>April 19: Launched Look! the good news tabloid which was derided by a number of the people it featured.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Australian man first to die by legal euthanasia</b><br><br><br><b><h2>10 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Dignity in death - Doctor at Large  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Luisa Dillner</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Today Annie Lindsell, a 45-year-old businesswoman who suffers from motor neurone disease, will be seeing a human rights lawyer, in her quest for euthanasia. Lindsell, backed by the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, can no longer use her arms and knows that death, when it comes, will involve a gradual paralysis that will leave her unable to use her muscles to breathe. Understandably she would, like most of us, like to die with dignity. Knowing that she could ask a doctor legally to help her to die would, she says "transform my quality of life".  <p>  <p>Under British law, assisting in a suicide is a criminal offence subject to 14 years in prison, whether the person helping out is medically qualified or not. Active euthanasia, which differs from assisted suicide because it involves an action (usually) by a doctor actively to end a life, is also illegal. Although the law is fairly flaky on charging people who carry out euthanasia with murder it is entitled to do so - murder carries a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.  <p>  <p>Dr Nigel Cox escaped relatively lightly in 1992 when he was found guilty of attempted murder after injecting potassium chloride (in a lethal quantity) into a woman who was suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. Cox was only given a year's suspended sentence and allowed back to work; the woman was already ill and may have died soon anyway.  <p>  <p>But until the law is changed, there can be few doctors who would risk a lifetime behind bars in the interests of openly providing a guaranteed death with dignity. The only exception seems to be US pathologist Jack Kervorkian - whose 40th assisted suicide was raided last week. Isabel Correa, who reportedly suffered from intractable pain in her spine, promptly held a press conference denouncing the violation of her final hours. Shortly afterwards the assisted suicide sneakily went ahead.  <p>  <p>There are some people who would accord Kervorkian heroic status on the basis that he relieves suffering. But many doctors question his cavalier approach (no second opinion or psychiatric assessment and not every patient has a terminal condition) and dislike his 'in your face' manner. Undeniably his actions, like the cases of Cox and Lindsell, make doctors feel uncomfortable.  <p>  <p>Euthanasia is practised in hospitals every day, in silence and in secret. I once heard a consultant issue instructions that he did not want "this patient to be here when I do my ward round tommorow". He wasn't, on this occassion, talking about care in the community. The patient was suffering from cancer, gangrene, and required large doses of morphine to control his pain. A bit more morphine and he wasn't around the next day. He was nudged, rather than pushed, but all of us involved in his care felt uneasy and duplicitious. There was no full and frank discussion - even among ourselves. I know that this is not, strictly speaking, euthanasia, even if it felt like it at the time. The law allows for morphine to be given to relieve suffering in doses that may hasten death. It also allows, in certain cases, withdrawing or withholding treatment. All are quantifiably different from administering a lethal injection, at a patient's request, with foresight and planning. The ethical dilemma is exactly how different, and whether patients have the right to medical help in ending their lives.  <p>  <p>The latest national opinion poll found that 79 per cent of the public believe that people should be entitled to medical help for a peaceful death if they are suffering from an incurable, intolerable illness, provided they have made the request in writing. A BMA news review survey of 750 doctors published last week found that 46 per cent (a small majority) would favour a change in the law to accommodate euthanasia, although only 37 per cent would be willing actively to end a life themselves. Most of the arguments for euthanasia are based on patients' autonomy, which in the age of medical consumerism is increasingly hard to ignore. Palliative care is improving, but there will always be some patients who actively choose death. Terminally ill patients usually cite their fear of dependence and loss of self respect as reasons for wanting to die, above their fear of pain.  <p>  <p>Opponents of euthanasia argue that any sanctioning is the beginning of a slippery slope and that the old and disabled will be put under pressure to request it. The practise could be extended to those incompetent to make the decision (children or the demented) and encouraged by cost-cutting managers. The availability of euthanasia will erode the trust that doctors have with their patients - if the latter think the former are keen to dispatch them. The only open use of euthanasia is in the Netherlands, which has been criticised for already slipping down the ethical slope (a woman who was depressed over the death of her family was helped to end her life by a doctor), but it has tried to bring the whole business above board. Euthanasia is illegal, but doctors are immune from prosecution if they follow stringent rules, including getting a second opinion. About 1,400 cases of euthanasia are reported each year but an estimated 2,300 are not. The Northern Territories in Australia recently passed an act making voluntary euthanasia legal, which had more thoughtful and more stringent requirements than the Netherlands, including a psychiatric assessment and a full exploration of palliative care options. But the act has met with such fierce opposition from doctors and pro-life groups that it may well be reversed before anyone can utilise it.  <p>  <p>In Britain it would require an Act of Parliament to change the legal status of active euthanasia. Linsdell is therefore unlikely to succeed in her legal battle. It is to be hoped that when the time comes, if she still feels as she does now, she will find a sympathetic doctor to do what doctors have been doing, unregulated, for centuries.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Christopher Zinn</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A former pilot has used a computer-driven 'death machine' to become the first person in the world to die using legally sanctioned euthanasia, it was revealed today.  <p>  <p>The Northern Territory man, who suffered from prostate cancer and was in his mid-sixties, allowed the machine to pump barbiturates and a muscle relaxant into his bloodstream.  <p>  <p>The Australian, who wished to remain anonymous, was accompanied by Dr Philip Nitschke and two other doctors who signed consent forms.  <p>  <p>His death in Darwin on Sunday has already drawn condemnation from religious leaders and pro-life groups.  <p>  <p>The death by euthanasia is the first under the Northern Territory's Rights of the Terminally Ill Act, which became law 18 months ago.  <p>  <p>It allows a terminally ill patient to ask a doctor to give a lethal injection or provide it for self-administration.  <p>  <p>Dr Nitschke, who pioneered the new act, said: "The patient was suffering from terminal cancer and had asked for assistance under the Act. In consultation with his wife, [he] chose a time and asked for assistance with a lethal injection."  <p>  <p>The man left a detailed letter explaining the reasons for his decision, which is due to be released at a press conference later today. The man's death comes as the legislation faces a challenge from a Federal Private Members Bill. The Act could also be overturned in the High Court in November.  <p>  <p>The head of the Catholic Church in Australia said the first case of euthanasia was a "shameful day for Australia".  <p>  <p>Archbishop Goodhew of the Sydney Anglican diocese said: "It's a very sad thing... [The] consequences may not be known for another 25 years and we may be very sorry."  <p>  <p>And a spokesperson for the Australian Federation of Right to Life Associations commented: "I feel very sad that we are the first nation in the whole world to have voluntary euthanasia."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>      <p>The Vatican yesterday expressed its "horror" at the world's first legally assisted suicide, saying no law or human suffering could justify euthanasia. "One remains stupified and horrified by this shocking case of euthanasia that was requested and granted," said Father Gino Concetti, a Vatican theologian close to the Pope.  <p>  <p>He was reacting to the case of an elderly cancer patient who became the first person to take his life under a unique voluntary euthanasia law in the Northern Territory, Australia. Bob Dent died by a computer-delivered lethal injection in Darwin on Sunday after persuading doctors his case was hopeless. "No law of the state can justify euthanasia.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Richard Norton-taylor</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Government yesterday bowed to pressure to divulge the secrets of Nazi loot by disclosing that gold worth nearly &#163;4bn at today's prices was deposited in Swiss banks, only 12 per cent of which was recovered by the wartime Allies.  <p>  <p>New evidence of what British officials knew about the Nazi gold - which included jewellery stolen from Jews - and why they gave in to Swiss refusal to release any more of it, is contained in a Foreign Office report published just weeks after Malcolm Rifkind, the Foreign Secretary, implied that the Government knew nothing of the matter.  <p>  <p>The report - which confirms that &#163;40m of the gold is in a Bank of England account - has merely fuelled the controversy about the loot's whereabouts and why it has not been returned to its owners. Mr Rifkind will raise the issue during a pre-arranged visit to Switzerland next week. The Nazis deposited $500m (&#163;3.9bn in today's money) in Swiss banks during the war, the report says. The Allies demanded the return of $130m in 1947 but received only 250 million Swiss francs ($58m), 12 per cent of the total.  <p>  <p>Greville Janner, Labour MP for Leicester West and chairman of the Holocaust Educational Trust, yesterday welcomed the FO's report but said it raised as many questions as it answered, particularly about gold melted down from Jews' possessions.  <p>  <p>He released newly-declassified 1946 US intelligence documents which refer to 'gold teeth fillings' which had been melted down by the Nazis into bars. The FO report concedes that coins and jewellery as well as looted Nazi gold were resmelted into ingots marked with the Reichsbank stamp, concealing its origins.  <p>  <p>"Switzerland now has a moral obligation to think again about the gold," Mr Janner said yesterday. "They should be ashamed of themselves. I believe very many Swiss people are ashamed."  <p>  <p>The Swiss foreign ministry said its parliament was drafting legislation to create a historical commission, possibly with judicial powers to demand secret bank records.  <p>  <p>Mr Janner urged Mr Rifkind to say on his visit to Zurich next week: "Look, I'm Foreign Secretary for the UK and I'm under enormous pressure. I'm going to get it in the neck if something doesn't happen."  <p>  <p>A Treasury official referred in 1946 to "the unalterable attitude of the Swiss that there was no legal basis which they would admit as conveying an Allied right to German assets in Switzerland". He added: "In the case of Switzerland, the claims against Germany were very large and, on balance, the Allied negotiators had every reason to be satisfied that the best terms possible were made."  <p>  <p>FO officials repeated yesterday that the Allies had "no legal right over the Swiss".  <p>  <p>Their report reveals that during postwar negotiations a Mr Hirs of the Swiss National Bank had let slip the $500m figure, far greater than the Allies had assumed.  <p>  <p>The report was hurriedly put together by FO officials, partly from documents at the Public Records Office, partly from papers secreted in the Bank of England, after pressure from Mr Janner. Mr Rifkind told the MP in June that the FO "have not heard of allegations that British intelligence knew of documents concerning holdings by Swiss... banks of seized funds deposited by the Nazis".  <p>  <p>Yet the report says that as early as 1945 the Government estimated that the Nazis had looted gold worth at least $550m. British intelligence had closely monitored German looting of gold during the war, but, it notes, "too tight a squeeze on Swiss-German trade might result in German occupation of Switzerland, or in pushing Switzerland further into the Axis camp, both to the detriment of Britain's own war effort". The report also refers to British officials ignoring claims on the gold by individuals as opposed to governments occupied by Nazi Germany on the grounds that "private claims... might run into many thousands". <p>  <p>The comment prompted a stinging rebuke yesterday from Mr Janner, who said claimants seeking repayment for gold plundered by the Nazis would be "hundreds of thousands...

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Lawrence Donegan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The roll-call of abject British failures, which stretches from Eddie the Eagle to the Sinclair C5, gained a new entry yesterday with the discovery of the airline co-pilot who was scared of heights.  <p>  <p>The British-born first officer, who had been flying since 1989, caused an aircraft carrying 49 passengers from Britain to Italy to divert after he told the pilot he was "frightened of the altitude".  <p>  <p>Despite the efforts of other crew members to calm him, the co-pilot continued to "show symptoms of anxiety and stress" and the pilot was forced to land the aircraft at Lyon, according an Air Accidents Investigation Branch report.  <p>  <p>The incident happened as a Maersk Air flight from Birmingham to Milan was passing over Moulins, France, at 33,000ft in May.  <p>  <p>The co-pilot's condition improved once the plane started its descent into Lyon and he was able to help the pilot with landing procedures, the report says.  <p>  <p>He was immediately suspended from duty and subsequently failed the required medical tests. He has since left Maersk Air.  <p>  <p>A company spokeswoman would say only that he was a married man in his 30s. He is thought to have joined the airline company, a British Airways franchise operator, after working as a commercial pilot for two other airlines since 1989.  <p>  <p>"He had been with us for just under a year and there had been no problem before. I don't believe he is flying any more and I'm not sure what work he is now involved in," the spokeswoman said.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Style wars between Armani and Versace</b><br><br><br><b><h2>12 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Style or fashion?</h2> <h3>Top designers go to war</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Susannah Frankel</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Only weeks before the start of the spring/summer collections, a fashion war appears to be breaking out between Italy's two superstar designers Gianni Versace and Giorgio Armani.  <p>  <p>Earlier this week, an article in the Corriere della Sera, one of Italy's leading broadsheets, said Armani was "celebrating the death of fashion". "Fashion is finished," he told the paper and Versace, himself not averse to more than his fair share of publicity - particularly in the run-up to show time - wasted no time in responding. "At the beginning of each season there are fashion designers who discover all of a sudden that fashion is dead, perhaps confusing overall appreciation with a personal problem," he said. Of course, Armani and Versace, Italy's kings of minimalism and glamour respectively, are hardly strangers to this kind of feuding. In fact, if the Italian press is to be believed, they're at it constantly. Armani, in particular, repeatedly expresses his disdain not only for Versace but also for other leading Italian houses, including Prada and Gucci, currently finding favour with the fashion cognoscenti.  <p>  <p>Sour grapes? Versace certainly seems to think so. And perhaps with good reason. It's no secret, after all, that, where Armani used to be the designer favoured by the glitterati, today any Hollywood starlet or rock star worth his or her salt (from Liz Hurley and Lisa-Marie Presley to Robbie Williams and Madonna who also starred in two of Versace's recent advertising campaigns) wears Versace instead.  <p>  <p>In terms of Hollywood, an arena of prime importance for any fashion designer, Armani is clearly fighting a losing battle. To underestimate his genius, however, would be a mistake.  <p>  <p>It is perhaps ironic that, with fashion in general at its most effortlessly stylish, pared down and minimal, the designs of Giorgio Armani, without question the man responsible for introducing this type of dressing to the world in the first place, seem sadly dated.  <p>  <p>Although he is still routinely described as one of the world's most important and influential fashion designers (he's certainly one of the richest), Armani, aged 62, finds himself in the unhappy position whereby his imitators (Calvin Klein and Jil Sander to name just two) have overtaken him. Still, Versace, aged 50, clearly feels he should keep his grievances to himself. "Armani is one of the big names for products made in Italy and he should support them as I and many others do," he said.  <p>  <p>For his part, Armani says he has been quoted out of context. "When I said 'fashion is finished' I meant specifically the fashion system in which style is dictated from above and the public swallows each season's diktat about this colour, that length, this mood and no other... Modern fashion is about freedom, democracy and individualism, and this is a development that I, for one, welcome."  <p>  <p>"Fashion is absolutely not dead, it just goes on and on and that's the best thing about it. The best thing about fashion is its ability to constantly reinvent itself." Betty Jackson  <p>  <p>"Fashion is definitely very much alive in London." Ren Pearce, Pearce Fionda  <p>  <p>"Fashion is not quite dead although mass manufacture downgrades things. Neither Armani nor Versace is about fashion. They are about style, about mass manufacture and about hype. Fashion is a barometer of culture. If there is no fashion, there is no culture." Vivienne Westwood  <p>  <p>"Saying fashion is dead is a very fashionable thing to say." Katharine Hamnett  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stephen Byers's controversial comments on Labour links with TUC</b><br><br><br><b><h2>13 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Blair caught in union split controversy</h2><h3>Leadership denies plan to ballot over voting rights</h3>
<br>By <b>Rebecca Smithers</b><br><br>


<p>
<p>Labour was last night embroiled in fresh embarrassment over its relations with the unions - potentially the most explosive row in a week of friction at the TUC conference in Blackpool.
<p>
<p>Tony Blair's office embarked on frantic damage limitation after reports that the Labour leadership was preparing to end the party's links with the unions after the general election.
<p>
<p>The reports were based on comments made by Labour's employment spokesman Stephen Byers at a dinner with four lobby journalists. They claimed the party leadership planned to ballot members on whether they wanted the unions to retain voting rights at the party conference and their seats on Labour's ruling body, the National Executive Committee.
<p>
<p>A ballot could take place within weeks of Mr Blair becoming Prime Minister, should his fears of a 'summer of discontent' through disruptive strike action materialise, it was reported.
<p>
<p>Any such move would spark civil war in the party, and it was a measure of the Labour leadership's concern that officials issued swift denials, hours before the story had appeared on the front pages of four newspapers. A spokesman for Mr Blair said last night the journalists had misinterpreted Mr Byers's comments. "The story has no foundation at all. Mr Blair has made no such proposal and no such proposal is even under discussion." Mr Byers, the MP for Wallsend, was promoted to the employment portfolio in Mr Blair's recent reshuffle and is strongly identified with the party's modernising wing. He was unavailable for comment. But in a statement he said: "I understand four political correspondents are running a story based on a conversation I had with them. I said nothing to justify the ludicrous interpretation being put on our conversation."
<p>
<p>Despite the denials, the suggestion that the leadership was seeking to sever links with the union movement - which founded the party at the turn of the century - is consistent with Mr Blair's attitude in recent debates on the direction of the party.
<p>
<p>During the battle over the selection procedure for parliamentary candidates, he argued in meetings with senior Labour and union leaders that the party should break its formal union links and become a fully 'one member one vote' organisation.
<p>
<p>At last year's TUC Congress a leaked memorandum drawn up by Mr Blair's campaign strategy consultant, Philip Gould, noted that the leadership's long-term aim was to become "a genuine one member one vote party". The unions agreed to acquiesce in a reduction of their share of the party conference votes to 50 per cent on condition that no further moves were made this side of the election.
<p>
<p>Lew Adams, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef, said last night: "The trade union movement has seven million members, the vast majority of them traditionally vote Labour. If these reports are true, it's political suicide. The Labour party cannot deny its parenthood."
<p>
<p>This week has been a tempestuous one in the party's relations with the unions. The TUC has defied Mr Blair over setting a level for a minimum wage under a Labour government, while there was also confusion at the top of the party over the way Mr Blair and the shadow education and employment secretary, David Blunkett, announced their proposals to limit public sector strife.
<p>
<p>Last night the Tories seized on the stories as evidence of confusion in Labour ranks. "This sounds like a typical Labour ploy of planting stories attributed to 'Labour sources' which the Labour leadership will hope will appeal to middle-class voters but then denying them," a spokeswoman for Conservative Central Office said.
<p>
<p>"Labour's official spokesmen must now say publicly what their policy is and not leave it to the spin doctors to weave conflicting stories." Yesterday unions voted for a much greater expansion of workers' rights than is acceptable to Mr Blair, in a 14-point list of demands.
<p>
<p>On Wednesday the leader of the Communications Workers' Union, Alan Johnson, rejected Mr Blair's intervention in the postal strike, when he called for a fresh ballot of workers. Further, although 10 days ago TUC leaders were confidently expecting a minimum wage of &#163;4.26 an hour to be defeated at Congress, it was subsequently approved.

<p>Conservative hopes that the Government's summer recovery would co ntinue were dashed yesterday as Labour reopened a 15-point lead in the latest opinion poll.  Labour's lead over the Tories is up by three points, according to the September Guardian-ICM survey.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stephen Byers's controversial comments on Labour links with TUC</b><br><br><br><b><h2>14 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>How unions found they were on the menu</h2><h3>Disputed restaurant briefing signals end of historic link with Labour  </h3>
<br>By <b>Seumas Milne</b><br><br>


<p>
<p>When Stephen Byers sat down to a plate of Dover sole with four lobby journalists at Blackpool's Seafood Restaurant on Wednesday night, he laid the ground for what is likely to become a watershed in Labour's 96-year-old relationship with the trade unions.
<p>
<p>The party's amputation from the trade union movement that founded it is a central - if hitherto publicly unspoken - element of the Blair 'project'. The outraged demands of union leaders for Tony Blair to rule out the break are therefore bound to fall on deaf ears.
<p>
<p>Despite some local difficulties yesterday with shadow cabinet members and union leaders, there can be no serious doubt that Mr Byers - and by extension Tony Blair - floated the prospect of severing the union link deliberately to capitalise on a week of unprecedented Labour 'union bashing'.
<p>
<p>In contrast with Mr Blair's love-in with business people the previous week, the Labour leadership went to Blackpool to highlight the growing gulf between it and the trade union movement. And although David Blunkett came unstuck on the detail of his schemes for no-strike deals and compulsory reballoting, his intervention was transparently aimed at creating the same impression. Mr Byers and Mr Blunkett went to the TUC conference to provoke public rows.
<p>
<p>New Labour has proved particularly partial to the long-established practice of floating, denying and then implementing sensitive policy changes - the U-turn on the Scottish devolution referendum is a recent example - and the events of the past few days follow that pattern.
<p>
<p>For all yesterday's frenetic denials, the claim attributed to Mr Byers - the member of Labour's employment team closest to Mr Blair - that the Labour leadership is preparing to sever the links between the party and unions by mobilising individual members in a post-election ballot is soundly based. Only the timing remains in question.
<p>
<p>As with the row created by Mr Blunkett's roller-coaster proposals to curb public sector strikes, few trade unionists will believe that Mr Byers's TUC restaurant briefing was anything other than a calculated attempt to widen the gap between party and unions in the public mind. A final rupture is firmly on the political agenda.
<p>
<p>Mr Blair himself has never made any secret in private of his view that the unions' constitutional role in the party is inappropriate for a modern political organisation. He argued that case openly in meetings with union leaders during Labour's last great constitutional spat over the unions' involvement in parliamentary selections in 1993.
<p>
<p>That involvement was duly junked, the unions' share of the vote at Labour conference reduced to 70 per cent and balloting of individual union members introduced into party leadership elections. In the wake of the 'one member-one vote' row, John Smith called a halt to the argument and wooed the unions with a raft of new employment rights policies.
<p>
<p>Mr Blair has mostly dropped those commitments and accelerated the drive to weaken the historic links with the unions that set Labour apart from other European socialist and social-democratic parties. Last year, the unions agreed to cut their share of the conference vote to 50 per cent on condition that no further moves were made this side of the election.
<p>
<p>Bill Morris, leader of the Transport and General Workers' Union, warned that the unions were drawing a line in the sand at 50 per cent, though Mr Blair insisted the issue remained open. Policy-making has since effectively been transferred from the national executive and conference to the leader's office.
<p>
<p>Senior union officials yesterday poured scorn on the idea that Mr Blair could end the relationship, because the party conference has the final word. "It is just not within his power," one remarked. "Any proposal would need the consent of the unions and it is simply not on the agenda." That view is almost certainly wrong. The scenario sketched out by Mr Byers mirrors exactly the tactics used by Mr Blair last year to ditch Labour's Clause Four commitment to common ownership. He won that issue by a landslide in the constituency parties, but only just secured a majority of union votes.
<p>
<p>Many more unions would be likely to oppose breaking the union-party link than voted against dropping Clause Four, though a minority - such as the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union - could be expected to back the change.
<p>
<p>But with only 50 per cent of the conference reserved for affiliated unions - compared with 70 per cent when Clause Four was abandoned - Mr Blair could probably rely on the traditional lack of enthusiasm for the union link among individual members to offset a larger union majority against a break. Added to that would be Mr Blair's authority as the first Labour prime minister for 18 years. In Mr Byers's scenario, the rupture would be forced through as punishment for industrial action in the public sector, where wage pressures are building up after years of Tory pay squeezes.
<p>
<p>Senior Labour sources have said they regard potential demands from public sector unions as one of the two most serious issues - along with the single European currency - that would face an incoming Labour government. Labour and union leaders have speculated that Mr Blair may even pick an early fight with the public sector unions in an effort to draw their sting. But union officials said yesterday they regarded a confrontation next summer, immediately after a May election, as implausibly early. In any case, an organisational break with the unions would more likely foment than curb industrial action.
<p>
<p>Far more difficult for Mr Blair than winning a party conference vote would be replacing the unions' huge financial support, which provides half the party's annual income, multi-million pound donations to the general election fund, sponsorship of party leaders' private offices and the underwriting of Labour's campaign in the marginal constituencies.
<p>
<p>None of Mr Blair's new friends in the business world is going to be able to match that, so state funding of political parties would be an absolute precondition of ending the union link. Although it has been Labour policy for several years, Mr Blair may find that difficult to get past some of his backbenchers.
<p>
<p>As for the trade unions, they have too much invested in a Labour victory to go beyond ritual expressions of dismay for the meantime. But in the longer term, the growing breach with Labour is certain to have a profound impact on both sides - and the whole structure of British politics.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stephen Byers's controversial comments on Labour links with TUC</b><br><br><br><b><h2>14 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Battered unions cut adrift</h2><h3>Labour faces TUC anger  </h3>
<br>By <b>Seumas Milne</b><br><br>


<p>
<p>A permanent rupture between Labour and the trade unions, a relationship that has shaped British politics for most of this century, is in sight after senior party sources acknowledged that the historic link could be severed after the next election.
<p>
<p>In the face of increasingly half-hearted Labour denials of contingency plans to cut ties, the endgame of this week's drive by Tony Blair and his lieutenants at the TUC conference to highlight the growing gap between party and unions became clear.
<p>
<p>After Stephen Byers, Labour's employment spokesman, briefed journalists at the TUC in Blackpool on how a Labour government might respond to public sector strikes, sources close to Mr Blair emphasised that Labour-union relationship would continue to change and acknowledged that cutting the ties over time was an option, though an early breach was unlikely. In recent years, the Labour leader has privately made no secret of his view that a modern party should part company from the unions.
<p>
<p>Mr Byers refused to speculate whether the unions would still have their places on Labour's national executive and vote at party conference at the end of a first term in office. He would say only that there were "no plans at the moment" to break the alliance which has put organised labour and class-based politics centre stage since the party's foundation. Union leaders were furious at the reports, which dominated the last day of the TUC.
<p>
<p>Lew Adams, the leader of the train drivers' union, Aslef, said he was "fed up to the teeth with the way that our conference has been persistently hijacked by politicians who keep talking about an evolving relationship with the trade unions, which keeps evolving until we disappear".
<p>
<p>George Brumwell, general secretary of the building workers' union, Ucatt, said the threat of a breach with the unions would only benefit Arthur Scargill's breakaway Socialist Labour Party.
<p>
<p>John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, said Labour had caused "confusion, not clarity" during the week.
<p>
<p>The reports that the Labour leadership was preparing to break the historic links in response to an expected rash of public sector strikes in the first few months of a Labour government were based on comments made by Mr Byers at a dinner with four lobby journalists in Blackpool.
<p>
<p>All stood by their stories yesterday and Mr Blair ruled out any move to discipline or demote Mr Byers - as called for by John Edmonds, the GMB general union leader.
<p>
<p>One senior source claimed Mr Byers, one of the Labour leader's most enthusiastic supporters, had come close to being sacked, though that was strongly denied last night by Mr Blair's office.
<p>
<p>The shadow education and employment secretary, David Blunkett, was described as incandescent with rage over the fact that Mr Byers had given an unauthorised briefing, but he was asked by Mr Blair not to intervene. John Prescott, the deputy leader, dismissed Mr Byers as a "junior spokesman".
<p>
<p>Mr Byers's briefing comes after a week of high tension between Labour and the unions at the TUC, where Mr Blunkett caused consternation by suggesting no-strike, binding arbitration agreements for the public sector and a requirement to re-ballot where an employer makes a 'significant' new offer. That was followed by a spate of rebuttals and counter-briefings. But there was also little doubt that Labour politicians had gone to the TUC to provoke a high-profile row.
<p>
<p>The Tories moved swiftly to take advantage of the confusion. Party chairman Brian Mawhinney said: "New Labour cannot bite the hand that feeds it. Mr Blair knows that his links with the trade unions are embarrassing. But he cannot get rid of them."

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stephen Byers's controversial comments on Labour links with TUC</b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Shadow minister in union row makes jobless benefit gesture  </h2>
<br>By <b>Rebecca Smithers</b><br><br>


<p>
<p>The shadow employment spokesman at the centre of last week's row over Tony Blair's plans to sever links with the unions will today make a conciliatory gesture to the unemployed, pledging for the first time that a Labour government will allow those doing more than 16 hours' voluntary work a week to continue to receive benefit.
<p>
<p>Stephen Byers, Labour's spokesman for training and industry, will make the commitment as part of a programme to help the long-term unemployed back into the workplace.
<p>
<p>At the moment those working in a voluntary capacity for more than 16 hours a week become ineligible for benefit because they are considered not to be actively seeking work. In a speech in Edinburgh today to the annual conference of the Institute of Careers Guidance, Mr Byers will say that Labour believes volunteers should not be financially penalised, especially as such experience could stand them in good stead when it comes to applying for jobs. Mr Byers kept a low profile over the weekend after a political row blew up over his briefing of four journalists at the TUC conference in Blackpool. Labour stressed its "evolving relationship" with the trade unions after Mr Byers supposedly briefed the journalists on his party's contingency plans to cut ties with the unions should it win power after the election. Revealing further details of Labour's plans for the unemployed, Mr Byers will today also announce proposals allowing people who have been without work for more than a year to receive interest-free loans which would be repaid once the individual got a job.
<p>
<p>A Labour government would also appoint 'job advocates' to individuals who are either long-term unemployed or facing that prospect. Each unemployed person would have his own individual career plan.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Letter from Zeljko Raznatovic-Arkan, President of the Serbian Unity Party</b><br><br><br><b><h2>14 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Arkan: I am no war criminal  </h2>
<br>Letter by <b>Zeljko Raznatovic-Arkan</b><br><br>


<p>
<p>I write to reply to certain matters raised by Julian Borger, principally in two recent articles (UK funds Serb war criminal, 5 September, and Corners cut in race to stage Bosnian polls, 6 September).
<p>
<p>Let me deal first with the statement (not simply an allegation) that I am a war criminal or 'warlord'. This is not the place in which to justify in detail my activities in Croatia and Bosnia, but I would point out to your readers that, principally because of the American hostility to those activities in defence of Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia, I have been investigated by the prosecutor's office of the Internatinal War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague. The result is that I have not been indicted for any war crime nor, as I understand it, is it the intention of the prosecutor that I should be so indicted. This is perhaps the best indication of the lack of evidence against me in this regard.
<p>
<p>During the second world war, hundreds of thousands of Serbs were killed by the Croatian nationalist regime ('Ustashe') then in power in Croatia. When Croatia declared independence from the former Yugoslavia in June 1991, many Serbs feared a repetition of those events at the hands of the new regime in Croatia, widely regarded as similarly nationalist. President Tudjman has done and continues to do much to foster this feeling, and the independent evidence of the persecution of Serbs in Croatia by the Tudjman regime is formidable. Take, for example, the latest US State Department Report on human rights in Croatia, published in March 1996. In my view, the Serbs were entitled to defend themselves against 'ethnic cleansing' by Croatia, and, in supporting their cause, I was helping to defend my people.
<p>
<p>As regards Bosnia, there was widespread feeling among Serbs when the declaration of independence took place that they were being forced into an Islamic-run state. President Izetbegovic had, in Tito's time, been imprisoned following publication of his 'Islamic Declaration' - a thesis on the creation of an Islamic state. He, like Tudjman, has done little to disabuse the Serbs of this fear. As Dr Owen states in his book Balkan Odyssey, Izetbegovic knew that his declaration of independence would lead to bloodshed and his party, the SDA, became even more intolerant under the pressures of war.
<p>
<p>I would agree with those - referred to by Dr Owen - who noted that Izetbegovic's closest advisers are "shadowy fundamentalists" and I believe that the Serbs were and are entirely justified in fighting to avoid being part of a budding fundamentalist state. Julian Borger was right in another recent article concerning the current election campaign to refer to intimidation by the SDA towards government by Islamic principles. I support the Serb people in their fight against this threat.
<p>
<p>Julian Borger is, however, wrong to refer to me as an extreme nationalist. Yes, I am a Serb and proud of that and of the Serb heritage. It is also true that my party, the Serbian Unity Party, advocates the development of close links with Serbia. The Serbs, after all, fought two world wars on the winning side in order to ensure the security which a constitutional connection with Serbia would guarantee. Contrary to common perception in the West, however, there are still non-Serb minorities living in Republika Srpska - Muslims, Croats, Hungarians, Albanians, Jews, gypsies. I do not suggest that their numbers are large proportionally to Serbs but I welcome their continuing presence. A great many of these people support and are members of my party, surely an indication that they do not regard me as an extreme nationalist.
<p>
<p>These people are supporters of the old united ethnically mixed Yugoslavia who went to live side by side with their Serb neighbours. They recognise that the mainstream political parties presently operating in Bosnia, the Muslim SDA, the Croatian HDZ and Serbian SDS are nationalist parties which cannot represent their viewpoint. They also recognise that my policy advocating the development of close links with Serbia - currently the most multi-ethnic of all the former Yugoslav republics - far from demonstrating a wish to cleanse them from Republika Srpska indicates ethnic tolerance and a respect for other religious and ethnic groups.
<p>
<p>It is for this reason that, quite contrary to the impression given by Mr Borger, my party's platform is far more in the spirit of the Dayton accord than any of the mainstream parties and entirely worthy of funding by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
<p>
<p>That is not to say, however, that Bosnia should not be partitioned. It has always seemed to me naive of the Americans if they thought that by hammering out the Dayton agreement, and dividing Bosnia 49 per cent to 51 per cent between Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat Federation, they were not, in fact, reinforcing partition.
<p>
<p>I do not believe that, in reality, Serbs can live in a state governed by Muslim and Croat nationalists or even work in a government alongside such people. That is the legacy of Bosnian politics before the Serbian Unity Party was created and, if I am right, the resulting partition is no more my responsibility than the initiation of the wars fought in Croatia and Bosnia during the last five years.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Keith Harper</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Thousands of National Bus pensioners are in line for a &#163;200m payout after it emerged yesterday that the Government was guilty of raiding the company's pension scheme when it was privatised 10 years ago. The pensions ombudsman, Julian Farrand - appointed by the Social Services Secretary, Peter Lilley, to investigate complaints from the public - has instructed trustees to "take all possible steps" to recover the money from the Treasury.  <p>  <p>Bus pensioners could gain by up to &#163;1,000 a year after trustees disperse the money "with interest windfall", unless ministers appeal against the ruling, although industry sources suggest this would be unlikely to succeed.  <p>  <p>The case will be a considerable embarrassment to ministers. The Government plundered the fund's huge surpluses when the industry was privatised in 1986. Later, the National Audit Office ruled the bulk of the money raised from the National Bus sell-off came from the winding up of the pension fund. It is not the first time that the Government has pocketed the surplus in the pension scheme of a privatised company. In 1994, it took an estimated &#163;2bn out of the former British Coal pension funds in return for a guarantee that pensions would be linked to the rate of inflation. The ruling comes as the Department of Social Security is pushing through reforms to protect the members of company pension schemes from unscrupulous employers following the Robert Maxwell scandal, where thousands of workers' pensions were siphoned off to prop up the media mogul's failing business empire.  <p>  <p>Dr Farrand revealed his decision earlier this week in a letter to Jimmy Knapp, leader of the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, many of whose members are victims of the raid.  <p>  <p>The letter confirms the complaint against the action has been upheld. "The amendment to the rules of the scheme was found to be in breach of trust, and the consequence of pressure improperly brought by the National Bus Company," said Dr Farrand.  <p>  <p>His letter says that he does not have the resources to make copies of his decision publicly available, but gives the trustees the authority to recoup the money with interest. He says the money was originally handed over to the Department of Transport.  <p>  <p>Mr Knapp said: "This is another example of a huge pensions fund raid by political cowboys who have no concern for people who have given loyal years of service."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Oasis abandon tour </b><br><br><br><b><h2>14 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Some might say Britpop's dysfunctional</h2><h3>The Gallaghers creative disagreements were complicated, fatally, by genes  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mark Lawson</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Having always sought comparison with the Beatles, Oasis may have finally and indisputably matched one achievement of the group that so shadowed their ambitions: splitting up and, moreover, going their separate ways when one of the two central figures - then John and Paul, now Liam and Noel - becomes involved with a controversial singer-performer. But - beyond these cross-decadal debates about whether Patsy Kensit is more Yoko or Linda to her boyfriend Liam - the 'Oasis split' story is about more than pop music. In small ways, it touches on creativity, families, Britishness and, above all, the media.  <p>  <p>Artistic collaboration has always been a problematic business. From the Beatles and Monty Python via Simon & Garfunkel, Woody and Mia, Ike and Tina to the Police and Newman & Baddiel, the creative duo or group has been prone to, at best, simmering resentments and trial separations and, at worst, total communication breakdown and physical violence. Indeed, the life cycle of cultural co-operation is clearly established: struggle; success; split up.  <p>  <p>This is generally because one mind in each unit tends to be the creator and controller, while the other(s) are interpretative and tend, eventually, to feel merely decorative. The lessons of artistic endeavour seem to be that creativity happens alone and celebrity feels best as a solitary sensation. In the younger arts, there is often the added complication that one member is more sexually desirable and active than the other. Noel is said to have envied Liam's copulation roster but, for all that and their important differences in age (Noel 29, Liam 23) and temperament (Noel introverted, Liam especially extrovert), the most combustible diversity between the Gallagher brothers was surely that Noel was the songwriter while Liam was the singer. Many of Liam's elaborate antics - the fights, the walk-outs, the drinking bouts - were probably psychological compensation for his fear that he was Ringo to his brother's John, Garfunkel to his Simon. "I'll carry on as a guitarist and singer just like John Lennon did," Liam is reported to have said yesterday, but Lennon's mystique depended on his ability to write songs.  <p>  <p>In the case of the Gallaghers, the creative disagreements, nearly inevitable when two people share a stage, were fatally complicated by genes and background. Even the Osmonds - raised in American mid-western comfort as strict Mormons - were not immune from the difficulties of trying to share both blood and limelight, so pity the Gallaghers, poor working-class Mancunians from a broken home. If John Lennon, brought up by a doting aunt, perfectly represented the dysfunctional family of the 1960s, then Noel and Liam exemplified the 1990s ruined brood: a family in which son thumps father and brother punches brother.  <p>  <p>The fact that so much alleged information about the brothers is now on public record - Liam's threat to kill his father if he ever saw him again, a description by an ex-girlfriend of a "sex and cocaine hell" - is a measure of the extent to which the Oasis break-up is a model of the operation of the modern media. A common remark about the media coverage of the Princess of Wales has been that royals were written about as if they were rock stars, but the Gallaghers offer a contrasting example of rock stars being written about as if they were royalty. The tabloids in particular followed an identical pattern of early saccharine adulation giving way to a diligent rift-watch.  <p>  <p>Like other contemporary celebrities including Princess Diana and Terry Venables, Oasis tried to control their media image by a careful flow of exclusive spin and information to a friendly journalist - in the case of Noel and Liam, pop reporter Andy Coulson of the Sun - but suffered the revenge of excluded newspapers seeking hostile confidences. If there should be any sympathy for the Gallaghers, it must be that they lived through a period in which to be famous meant the existence of dedicated phone numbers printed in newspapers touting for dirt on the pair.  <p>  <p>Given the internal pressures and the external attention, the real surprise is not that divorce seems now to have occurred, but that it was so rapid: from no-ones to page-ones in the space of 18 months. But the intensity of media attention and pressure for new angles has speeded up the life cycle of a story. It is significant that Oasis's second and possible last album, '(What's the Story) Morning Glory', is not among the biggest-selling albums of all time but is the fastest-selling. (Just as John Grisham is the fastest-selling novelist.) In a media world of hard-hype and low-stamina, everything happens quicker and so even the band's self-destruction was fast-track.  <p>  <p>The scale of the media coverage has also been unprecedented. Middle-aged press executives who would sack the literary editor if he suggested a symposium on whether Salman Rushdie was better than Dickens, and would send the political correspondent on emergency gardening leave if he filed a point-by-point comparison of Gladstone and Ashdown, were happy enough to print detailed check-lists in the no less ludicrous Beatles-Oasis showdown. This was partly because of a contempt for pop music as a form and partly to suggest trendiness, but mainly because of a curious development in the media.  <p>  <p>In the early days of television in Britain, the medium was seen by idealists as a 'common culture', the one art which might transcend class and generational divides to bring the population together before the same event. Old telly types still talk mistily of the days when - allegedly - the whole nation would be talking in the morning about the same programme shown the night before. Video recorders and multi-channel broadcasting have removed the tube's claim to the massive, single simultaneous audience but, curiously, as television has fragmented, newspapers have homogenised. Where once there was a clear divide between tabloid and broadsheet news values, increased competition between newspapers has led to a rise in lighter, jollier stories at the cost of high-attention reads. The same welterweight entertainment stories - boorish sportsmen, bi-sexual entertainers, abusive musicians - are likely to receive equal play in both the posh and the yob branches of the press. Given the statistical evidence that almost the entire adult population sees a newspaper every day, a common culture of sorts has been achieved, at least in the area of entertainment news. Oasis's fame has been helped by this journalistic blur. Finally, like so many modern stories, the tale of Oasis is a story of the relative insignificance of Britain. The noise they make was joyously dubbed Britpop, but, as the band well understood, Britpop could only achieve real meaning by becoming Globepop, hence the tour of America which has just been abandoned, perhaps in part because American audiences did not respond as the Gallaghers had hoped. Like the numerous manifestations of the British Film Industry, Britpop remained resolutely Brit. Oasis remained in the desert of their domesticity.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alex Duval</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Despite persistent rumours that he is unfit to travel, the Pope looks set to go ahead with a four-day visit to France this week which has divided clerics and brought to the fore widespread hostility to the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.  <p>  <p>A survey published at the weekend found that only 53 per cent of those polled had a "good opinion" of the Pope - down from 79 per cent in 1986. Twenty-six per cent of people had a bad opinion of the Pope, up from just 6 per cent 10 years ago.  <p>  <p>The Figaro magazine survey came as protest groups ranging from feminists to ecologists confirmed plans for demonstrations during the visit, which begins on Thursday and includes Brittany, the Atlantic region of Vendee, Tours and Reims.  <p>  <p>The visit has upset a wide range of people, from Roman Catholics who are critical of the Pope's views on abortion and the use of condoms, to defenders of the secular French state.  <p>  <p>On Sunday, the Pope will celebrate Mass at Reims cathedral to mark the 1,500th anniversary of the baptism of King Clovis, an event which united a country riven by warring tribes after the decline of the Roman Empire. The commemoration has been given political significance since King Clovis is admired by the racist National Front.  <p>  <p>The Church in France - which last year defied papal teachings and recommended the use of condoms to fight Aids - is known to be divided over the visit.  <p>  <p>In an attempt at a conciliatory move, the Archbishop of Tours has arranged for the Pope to meet representatives of homeless, handicapped and unemployed people, gays and lesbians. However, the meeting is to be staged under the banner 'The Injured of Life', which has offended many.  <p>  <p>Security is expected to be a prime concern. Three weeks ago, a crude bomb was found in a church in Vendee which the Pope will visit. Two weekends ago, a Belgian anarchist group smeared churchgoers in Nantes with cream cakes. Speculation about the health of the Pope, aged 76, was only dampened slightly at the weekend when his doctors said he would have an operation before the end of the year to remove a recurringly inflamed appendix. Last week, during a visit to Hungary, the Pope cut short a speech, allegedly because he was exhausted by efforts to speak Hungarian. Observers have also noted a tremor in the Pope's hands - an affliction described by the Vatican as 'extra-pyramidal' and related to the nervous system.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Pope visits France amid controversy on Clovis anniversary </b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Le Pen rebuked for exploiting papal visit  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alex Duval</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The National Front leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, yesterday intensified his efforts to exploit the divisions between moderates and conservatives already laid bare by controversy over the Pope's planned visit to France later this week.  <p>  <p>Buoyed by a local election victory, a demonstration in Marseille at the weekend and a successful campaign to rally rightwing papists to his cause, Mr Le Pen said he would attend a mass celebrated by the Pope in Reims Cathedral on Sunday.  <p>  <p>But he received an instant rebuff from Church leaders who said he was not among the 393 guests invited to hear the Pope celebrate the 1,500th anniversary of the baptism of King Clovis, and would not get a VIP seat. The fifth century king, who was baptised in an effort to unite lands riven by warring tribes after the decline of the Roman Empire, is a nationalistic symbol as potent as Joan of Arc. His baptism united France under one state religion, earning her the title of 'elder daughter of the Church'. Mr Le Pen has been quick to exploit the opportunity thus presented. "I believe in the past, I believe in roots, I am proud of belonging to an ancient country. I will therefore be where the Pope will be, among the deputies, because I am a European [parliament] deputy," he said. The Pope's decision to centre his visit, starting on Thursday, on the anniversary of Clovis's baptism has caused controversy since the plans were first laid. There have been accusations that the government wants to use the event to reclaim Clovis and the nationalist vote.  <p>  <p>The head of the 800,000-member Protestant Church in France, Jacques Stewart, said yesterday: "The resurgence of expressions like 'France, elder daughter of the Church' are the most troubling. France today cannot define itself as a 'Catholic country'. Other faiths but also non-religious schools of thought have made a strong contribution to our society." A leading theologian, Jean-Paul Willaime, said that to celebrate Clovis's baptism was to "endorse monarchic religions and the divine right of kings, which was celebrated until Charles X - crowned in Reims Cathedral in 1825".  <p>  <p>Mr Le Pen's party, which roundly denounces critics of the Pope as "unpatriotic", has staged several anniversary events in honour of Clovis this year.  <p>  <p>His party has a strong following among anti-abortion activists and fundamentalist Catholics - advocates of the Latin mass.  <p>  <p>Mr Le Pen supports the spirit of many pronouncements by the Pope, whereas many French Catholics - who make up 80 per cent of the population - are critical of Vatican teachings on condoms and abortion.  <p>  <p>After a weekend dominated by racist rhetoric from the National Front, politicians of all parties condemned Mr Le Pen yesterday for calling on his supporters to prepare for revolution as "the worm-eaten structures of our system collapse".  <p>  <p>Mr Le Pen's call to youth members to "rescue the country from decadence" followed a statement last week in which he repeated his belief in white racial supremacy. This prompted the government to say it would consider drafting a new anti-racism law.  <p>  <p>Yesterday political leaders ranging for the communist Robert Hue to the rightwing former interior minister Charles Pasqua condemned his remarks. Mr Pasqua denounced "those who disseminate theories which are foreign to the human dignity which is integral to our country."  <p>  <p>Mr Le Pen has achieved his promotion to centre-stage in the run-up to the Pope's visit with a well-tried tactic: making provocative statements which prompt response from mainstream politicians and which, as a result, receive wide media coverage.  <p>  <p>An opinion poll in yesterday's Liberation found that 51 per cent of people approved of some of the National Front's ideas, even though 71 per cent considered it to be a racist party.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Pope visits France amid controversy on Clovis anniversary </b><br><br><br><b><h2>19 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Pass Notes - No 889: King Clovis  </h2>
  <br><br>      <p>Age: Merovingian, about 1,530 years old.  <p>  <p>Occupation: King of the Francs. In what could be termed a shotgun baptism, he had himself christened. That convinced all the warring barbarians left behind after the Roman Empire to join together in one happy family called France.  <p>  <p>Appearance: Every 100 years, or whenever France needs to remind herself that she is a great nation - the 'elder daughter of the Church'.  <p>  <p>Clovis had a daughter? No, France is the 'elder daughter' because Clovis arranged for her to be the first western European state to adopt Roman Catholicism.  <p>  <p>Did Clovis have a son then? That's not really the point of this Pass Notes but yes, he had four sons by a couple of wives, including Queen Clotilde. Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the National Front, counts himself among them. That Queen Clotilde had a knack for delayed gestation: Mr Le Pen would probably concede that he is a descendant. Anyway, he feels very strongly about being in attendance in Reims on Sunday when the Pope celebrates the 1,500th anniversary of Clovis's baptism.  <p>  <p>Don't tell me, someone has dug up a family tree and Mr Le Pen is not related to Clovis: Actually no. Fifth century records are a bit vague which has allowed Mr Le Pen to make all sorts of remarks about the purity of the French race.  <p>  <p>That must be a bit embarrassing for the Pope: If he is conscious, yes. All that is known is that John Paul II has appendicitis but is determined to go to Reims anyway.  <p>  <p>You might call it ap-Pendicitis! Ha-ha. In fact, the two men seem to be broadly in agreement about condoms, abortion and the dozens of other topics which are inspiring anti-Pope demonstrations throughout France this week. What about Clovis's views on condoms? They are not known. What historians have managed to ascertain, however, is that he may not have been baptised in Reims after all, certainly not on 22 September and probably not in 496. When then? Christmas time 498 AD, along with 3,000 of his soldiers. In that case, I know what Clovis would be most likely to say - "Let's march on Rome": No, that was Umberto Bossi, the leader of the Italian Northern League, in Monday's Pass Notes. King Clovis would be more likely to say: "Capital - we'll put it right here." He decided that Paris should be the capital of France, you see.  <p>  <p>And least likely to say? "Let's march on Rome."  <p>  <p>Not to be confused with: Umberto Bossi, Joan of Arc, Asterix, Elvis.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alex Duval</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Pope left France yesterday at the end of his controversial four-day visit, his departure marked by a low key final demonstration of protest. Up to 10,000 gathered in Paris to condemn the "return to moral order" with which the papal visit had, in some minds, been associated.  <p>  <p>On the final and most contentious day of his tour, the Pope travelled to Reims to commemorate before 200,000 people the baptism in 496 of King Clovis, the first western European leader to convert to Roman Catholicism. But in his homily at a military base, the frail 76-year-old pontiff avoided describing France as the 'elder daughter of the Church' - a title cherished by nationalists and religious traditionalists in a country which is 80 per cent Roman Catholic.  <p>  <p>Instead, he called Clovis's christening a "great baptismal jubilee". The Pope told the congregation: "It gives you an opportunity to reflect on the gifts which you have received and on the responsibilities which flow from them. It should also lead you to review the vast spiritual history of the soul of France."  <p>  <p>In Paris, demonstrators - ranging from feminists to anarchists and the traditionally leftwing French freemasons - denounced official funding of the papal visit. They said it conflicted with France's secular ideals, established in 1905 when Church and state where constitutionally separated. Nicole Baruth, a retired teacher, said: "We want a tolerant republic, for all religions, not one with echoes of the divine right of kings. This papal visit, endorsed by the state, has undermined secular ideals which are just beginning to be understood."  <p>  <p>Other demonstrators, who included Protestants and campaigners against racism, denounced Vatican teachings. They released inflated condoms, and chanted: "If only the Virgin Mary had known about abortion." One placard, echoing rumours about the Pope's health, said: "The Pope has cancer, God exists!"  <p>  <p>Benoit Gauchard, chairman of David & Jonathan, an influential gay and lesbian Christian group, said he felt the protests had been successful. He said: "The clergy distanced itself from statements about Clovis from Jean-Marie Le Pen (the leader of the far-right National Front) and tried very hard to include all Catholics in the celebrations."  <p>  <p>But the meeting on Saturday in Tours between the Pope and 200 'injured of life' - immigrants, homosexuals, homeless, unemployed and handicapped people - had been disappointing, he said.  <p>  <p>"The Pope shook hands with the 'religiously-correct' guests, like old ladies, but an Aids sufferer who had been promised an audience was turned away."  <p>  <p>Many of the demonstrators in Paris were not attached to organisations. Emma Filoche and Lea Heldman, both aged 17, conceded that the Pope had visited France three times under the former Socialist president Francois Mitterrand without raising eyebrows.  <p>  <p>"It is different now because so much has been made of Clovis, as if that ancient king represents us. But it's the Revolution and all that happened after it which represents modern France."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Roderick Wright, Bishop of Argyll, quits post over affair with divorcee </b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Bishop surfaces to quit his post  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Peter Hetherington</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Anguished leaders of the Roman Catholic church in Scotland last night urged the runaway Bishop of Argyll and the Isles to show penitance and remain in the priesthood after a day of unprecedented drama involving hierarchy and priests.  <p>  <p>Bishop Roderick Wright, appointed five years ago to the Highland diocese, finally emerged late on Sunday to tell Cardinal Thomas Winning, head of the church in Scotland, that he was "physically and spiritually unable" to sustain his responsibilities.  <p>  <p>"It was a very emotional meeting because he was very upset and I didn't think he realised the kind of trauma he put everyone else in," said the cardinal.  <p>  <p>"He was very insistent on expressing his deep, deep sorrow and regret for the hurt he had caused by his sudden disappearance, and he insisted on resigning."  <p>  <p>After a trip to calm troubled clergy in the northern diocese, at a special meeting near Loch Ness, Cardinal Winning told a news conference in Glasgow yesterday that there was no chance of the 56-year-old bishop remaining in his post. He had tendered his resignation to the Pope.  <p>  <p>Cardinal Winning spoke candidly and with some irritation about the bishop's long-standing relationship with Mrs Kathleen Macphee, a 40-year-old nurse from near Fort William who went missing about the same time as the bishop, leaving her youngest child with relatives.  <p>  <p>At the meeting in the cardinal's official residence in Glasgow late on Sunday, it was clear they went into some details about the relationship, although the cardinal insisted that the question of sexual relations did not emerge.  <p>  <p>But it was clear the hierarchy felt that Bishop Wright had crossed the boundaries of clerical morality some time ago and had a clear choice to make: give up Mrs Macphee as a first step towards rehabilitation. Cardinal Winning, regarded as more of a traditionalist than his English counterpart, Cardinal Hume, emphasised that Bishop Wright had no intention of giving up the Church. "In fact, I would still hope that he will continue sometime, somewhere his ministry as a priest - we both felt in his heart of hearts he probably would want to do that."  <p>  <p>Without compromising on points of principle, he said that at a time of personal crisis the Church had to show compassion to a man who apparently accepted, under great strain, that he might have been unsuitable for a senior role in the Church after a long period of self-examination. Asked bluntly if the bishop could continue as a priest if he had had a relationship with the woman, Cardinal Winning said: "Well, it depends what you mean by a relationship. You can go to confession, you know. There's a church of sinners... there's many a fallen person who is penitent enough... "  <p>  <p>Had there been a sexual relationship? "Well, I did not go into the sexual relationships. He has had a long-standing friendship with this lady but I did not ask him about details."  <p>  <p>Would the affair deeply damage the Church? "Well, scandals are part and parcel of the Church's history. I came to call not the just but sinners." The cardinal was insistent, however, that celibacy remained an essential, almost crucial, feature of the priesthood.  <p>  <p>"The fact that we have celibacy is to make us totally available to other people... the fact that lapses do occur does not mean to say that we have to abandon celibacy."  <p>  <p>He said it would be wrong to make changes in a society which was "sex ridden... we would be following the fashion."  <p>  <p>But it is clear that these comments go to the heart of what seems to have been a growing rift between Bishop Wright and the Church.  <p>  <p>In an attempt to rehabilitate the bishop, Cardinal Winning said he had been offered facilities in England at a special location, for special counselling.  <p>  <p>But it seems already that matters have probably gone too far, in spite of the cardinal's cautious optimism that the bishop might return to the priesthood.  <p>  <p>For some time, he acknowledged, Bishop Wright and Mrs Macphee had apparently been "living together under the same roof". But after a period of reflection, the bishop had promised to contact the hierarchy. The appointment of a new bishop could take up to a year. The resignation of Bishop Wright must first be accepted by the Pope. A shortlist is then drawn up among the 30 priests within the diocese of Argyll and nominations for the post accepted from outside.  <p>  <p>Eventually, a detailed questionnaire is sent to 20 people who know the candidates well before a shortlist of three is sent to the Pope for the final decision.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tories criticise Anna Ford's "hostile"  interviewing of Kenneth Clarke on 'Today' </b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Conservative  Party chairman says Blair got kid glove treatment</h2><h3>Tory fury at "hostile"  radio interview with Clarke  </h3> <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ewen Macaskill</b><br><br>      <p> <p>The Tories sparked a fresh confrontation with the BBC yesterday, after the  Conservative Party chairman Brian Mawhinney complained about the "hostile" and  "caustic" way the Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, was interviewed on Radio 4's  'Today' programme. <p> <p>Dr Mawhinney fired off a furious letter to the BBC  director general, John Birt, claiming that in a separate interview on the same  programme, Labour leader Tony Blair had been treated "with kid gloves". <p>  <p>During the interview by Anna Ford, Mr Clarke gave a propaganda boost to Mr  Blair when he admitted Labour was not the threat it used to be. The Tories had  earlier unveiled a new poster, the latest in their 'New Labour, New Danger'  campaign, which depicts a pair of glinting eyes looking down at the figure of  &#163;700, and a hand reaching out to grab the money. The slogan reads: 'This  year the average family has &#163;700 more spending money, after tax and  inflation, than at the last election'. <p> <p>Launching the poster, which will  appear on sites throughout the UK, Dr Mawhinney said: "The good news is that this  represents &#163;700 more for the average British family to spend or save as they  wish. This fact is supported by independent official statistics. The message is  clear: Life is better under the Conservatives and will get better still." <p>  <p>But Labour accused the Tories of "peddling lies". <p> <p>In his letter to Mr  Birt, Dr Mawhinney said: "This morning's edition of the 'Today' programme  displayed a blatant lack of balance between the ways in which Ken Clarke and Tony  Blair were interviewed." <p> <p>He added: "Anna Ford repeatedly interrupted the  Chancellor, who was not given the chance to develop his points. Her questions  were openly hostile and her final remark at the end of the interview - 'So you  are not going to elevate the debate?' - was a disgraceful lapse from impartiality  into blatant editorialising." <p> <p>He went on: "By contrast Jim Naughtie  treated Mr Blair with kid gloves. Mr Blair was barely interrupted at all. The  exchange started and ended gently and was not conducted with the caustic manner  that Ms Ford used in her interview with the Chancellor." <p> <p>He called on the  BBC to take action to correct what he described as similar lapses by 'Today'  presenters and to remind them of their need to pay more than lip service to the  guidelines regarding equal treatment between the parties. A Conservative Central  Office spokesman said that unlike Labour it was rare for the party to complain  but Mr Clarke had been "shell-shocked" by the "sneering" tone of the interview.  <p> <p>Labour dismissed the Conservative complaint as retaliation over its  objection to what it saw as a recent 'News At Ten' interview with John Major.  Frank Dobson, the shadow environment secretary, said: "In time honoured fashion,  Mr Mawhinney is embarking on the ritual pre-election BBC softening up exercise.  His bullying tactics must not be allowed to prevail." A BBC spokesman said: "We  have received the letter and it will be considered and replied to in the usual  way."    <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tories criticise Anna Ford's "hostile"  interviewing of Kenneth Clarke on 'Today' </b><br><br><br><b><h2>18 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Why 'Today'  should pull no punches  </h2>
 <br>Commentary by
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Catherine Bennett</b><br><br>      <p> <p>In Iraq, we may take it, the interviewing style of the 'Today' programme  is not much prized. Saddam Hussein prefers to stage his own appearances  unassisted by the domestic equivalent of the disgraceful John Humphrys, or that  hostile minx, Sue MacGregor. <p> <p>It is a state of affairs which must inspire  yearning in Brian Mawhinney, the Conservative Party Chairman. How agreeable to  brook no dissent; to be addressed always as 'Saviour of the Nation'; to dissemble  with no fear of contradiction. How tiresome Mawhinney must find it in democratic,  uncouth Britain, where he must endure the niggling interjections of journalists.  No wonder that, in April, he snapped. <p> <p>Sue MacGregor (recently voted the  country's politest interviewer), had had the impudence to ask Mawhinney whether  the Tories didn't need to take some dramatic corrective action. She added that,  in 1990, they had ditched the poll tax and got rid of Mrs Thatcher. <p> <p>"Let's  stay in the real world, can we?" Mawhinney raved. "What you have just suggested  to me in front of the nation is that we should dump the Prime Minister. Don't be  ridiculous. That isn't even worthy of any answer. You drew the parallel with Mrs  Thatcher and that is a ludicrous and indefensible question and if you think I'm  annoyed with you it is because it is that kind of smeary question by  'Today'-programme presenters which so annoys people who listen to this programme  up and down the country." <p> <p>A week after the interview, 129 listeners had  contacted the 'Today' programme: 110 supporting MacGregor, 19 for Mahwinney. This  appears to be the usual pattern after Tory politicians have belaboured 'Today'  presenters, claiming to represent outraged listeners 'up and down the country'.  Last year, for example, when Jonathan Aitken claimed that John Humphrys'  interviewing technique had "poisoned the well of democratic debate", Humphrys  said that he subsequently received "the biggest postbag I'd ever had - about  1,200 letters and faxes. Ninety-six per cent said keep at it, and 4 per cent  agreed with Aitken". Even the Daily Telegraph, in a recent monitoring exercise,  failed to find evidence of political bias. Perhaps no one on his staff has dared  to present Mawhinney with the evidence of a BBC poll that the only people who  appear to share his feelings about the 'Today' programme are over 65 and resident  in south-east England. With the exception of this influential three per cent,  most listeners apparently find 'Today' presenters quite polite enough, and are  more concerned that politicians be made to answer the questions they are asked.  Either ignorant of, or indifferent to, this public preference for robust  interviewing, Mawhinney has persisted in his campaign to humble 'Today''s  interrogators, currently stamping up and down in a temper about the alleged  differences in treatment accorded to Kenneth Clarke and Tony Blair on Monday's  edition of the programme. A Conservative Central Office spokeswoman said: "I  think any independent observer just looking at the transcripts and comparing the  two would be absolutely horrified." <p> <p>Wrong. The interviews are not  horrifying, but - most unusually for the 'Today' programme - inadequate. One  interviewer is not hard, or interruptive, or 'rude' enough; the other is not  usefully aggressive, merely ineptly querulous, to the point that her more  experienced subject comes off better. Tony Blair, indulgently questioned by James  Naughtie, was allowed to pour forth, virtually unchallenged and almost  uninterrupted, a stream of meaningless piffle: "What we've got to be about is the  best practical means to deliver a different kind of society in Britain today that  faces the modern world, that is based absolutely on our values, but is not tied  to some outdated form of ideology." He was then allowed to advertise "what I want  to be talking about this evening", and to recite, in yawnsome detail, his "four  millennium challenges", which turned out - surprise! - to be four unanswered  questions. For instance: "How do we create a modern welfare state, a decent  cohesive society in a world that has wholly changed, socially, in terms of the  way people lead their lives?" How indeed? Sadly, Naughtie failed to elicit the  answer to this weighty poser, or "challenge". Clarke, on the other hand, was  treated to a such a variety of curious, mostly disconnected interjections by Anna  Ford - "I'm saying yes, yes, yes, you've failed to catch the mood of the  electorate" - that he still succeeded in delivering the usual bromides about  Britain being "a successful modern industrial economy", and in claiming,  repeatedly, that Labour "is still advocating increased taxation". So why the  complaints? According to the Central Office spokeswoman, Clarke was longing to  treat us to another rendition of 'New Labour, New Danger'. For preventing that,  if nothing else, Ford has earned our thanks. <p> <p>Anyone who listens regularly  to 'Today' knows that it is not the presenters, but their subjects, who get away  with being fabulously, insufferably rude. Heseltine, always respectfully  introduced to the masses by his latest, self-awarded title, is unpleasant to  everyone, seemingly on principle. From so many offensive appearances it's hard to  pick a favourite - but who can forget the morning, last summer, when he accused  the 'Today' programme of fomenting anarchy? "You spend your whole time trying to  undermine what is going on in government, you know you do, you're paid to do it,"  he hissed at John Humphrys. <p> <p>In less sophisticated style, Clare Short, in  her previous job, was invariably nasty to anyone who presumed to ask if Labour  would renationalise the railways. Indeed, should Labour win the next election,  there will certainly be no diminution in rudeness, evasion and post-interview  whingeing. Peter Snow's recent warnings about excessive spin-doctoring have  already received a Mawhinneyish response from Tony Blair's press officer, Hilary  Coffman: "I would have said there are few bigger bullies than Peter Snow." <p>  <p>If so, Snow should be promoted. For is it possible to be too firm and  searching in questioning a minister or party spokesman? The senior 'Today'  presenters are rightly admired, by the majority of their listeners, for their  rigour and impartial persistence; many of us, shouting imprecations from the  bath, would only wish them tougher still. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400  border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tories criticise Anna Ford's "hostile"  interviewing of Kenneth Clarke on 'Today' </b><br><br><br><b><h2>27 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Tory  politicians silenced in confrontations with Ford  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Andrew  Culf</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Anna Ford <br>Age: 52 <br>Born: Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, and brought  up in Cumbria with four brothers <p> <p>Married: 1st - Alan Bittles (dissolved);  2nd - cartoonist and Tatler editor Mark Boxer, who died in 1988. Two children:  Claire and Kate. education: studied economics at Manchester University; president  of the student union 1966/67; postgraduate diploma in adult education; Open  University staff tutor in social studies at Belfast University. Television:  joined Granada TV's newsdesk in 1974; joined 'Man Alive' on the BBC in 1976,  presented 'Tomorrow's World' from 1977 before joining ITN in 1978; involved in  the launch of TV-am in 1981, joining BBC1's 'Six O'Clock News' in 1989; Began  presenting Radio 4's 'Today' in 1993. <p> <p>When Anna Ford upbraided the  Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, for refusing to elevate the debate, the line to the  'Today' programme's radio car went dead. It was the second time in her career  that the famously cool and polished 52-year-old broadcaster had left a senior  Conservative politician speechless. <p> <p>On this occasion, according to the  BBC, the abrupt ending was due to a technical hitch, but both incidents hit the  headlines with dramatic impact. The first was in 1983, two years after the  disastrous launch of TV-am, when Ms Ford confronted her former boss, Jonathan  Aitken, and threw a glass of white wine in his face. <p> <p>Lord Callaghan, the  former prime minister, and Lord Hailsham, then Lord Chancellor, watched in  astonishment. Her complaint was that Mr Aitken had betrayed the stars of the ITV  breakfast station, who were sacked after just three months on the air. <p>  <p>Last week's tetchy on-air interview with Mr Clarke was described by  broadcasting colleagues as "completely out of character". <p> <p>One radio  presenter said: "Brian Redhead used to get away with it all the time, putting his  own gloss on the story, but Anna is normally courteous. It was a totally  different interview from normal." <p> <p>But in the corridors of the BBC others  were less sure. Some were questioning whether Ms Ford, who has a contract to  present between 30 and 40 editions of 'Today' each year, had the political savvy  to cope with the big set-piece heavyweight interviews. <p> <p>Ms Ford, who was  reading BBC1's 'Six O'Clock News' last night and not commenting on the row, had  posed for pictures on the day of her clash with Mr Clarke, maintaining it was a  lot of fuss over nothing. <p> <p>It is not the first time Ms Ford, who is a  friend of the BBC's new chairman, Sir Christopher Bland, has fallen out with her  BBC employers. Last year she was forced to apologise after writing to the  Guardian to complain about shadow home secretary Jack Straw's toughened crime  policy. <p> <p>Some colleagues find her self-possessed icy coolness difficult to  cope with, and she made enemies in 1994 when she crossed a BBC picket line,  insisting that as a single parent she could not afford to strike. <p> <p>Ms Ford,  who is well-known for her liberal views and feminist campaigning, has faced one  big hurdle throughout her broadcasting career - how to be taken seriously while  the commentators and critics concentrate on her classically fragrant good looks.  <p> <p>Sometimes she has played along with the image, last year posing for a  Snowdon photo spread in Vogue in a glamorous ballgown. <p> <p>When she took to  newsreading in 1978 with ITN's 'News at Ten' she was just 34 and seen as the  commercial channel's answer to Angela Rippon. Her early morning bust-up with Mr  Clarke has at least helped her shed the dreaded 'bimbo' image and proved she is a  tough interviewer, to be reckoned with alongside the BBC's acknowledged hard men  Jeremy Paxman and John Humphrys. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400  border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Christopher Elliott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A British hostage freed after being held for seven months by guerrillas in the Colombian jungle said yesterday that his captors treated him "no better or worse than if they had a cow or pig".  <p>  <p>Philip Halden, 48, who was seized in February a month after arriving there to work, returned to his Staffordshire home last night where he is recovering with his wife, Dolores, 47, and four children.  <p>  <p>Speaking from his home in Stoke-on-Trent, he said yesterday: "They didn't want to kill me because they wanted money. I was a commodity - I was treated no better or worse than if they had a cow or pig. They fed me and kept me dry and tried to keep me quiet.  <p>  <p>"They said if I attacked one of them they would kill me or if I tried to escape they would break my legs. They are not nice people and you don't argue with people with Kalashnikovs."  <p>  <p>Mr Halden, who was working as a consultant for a Danish engineering company, was kidnapped with two other European engineers, Karl Heinz and Ulrik Shultz, both from Denmark, while travelling on the main road to Bogota by guerrillas of the National Liberation Army. They were all released on Saturday outside the north-western city of Medellin.  <p>  <p>Speaking in Copenhagen yesterday, company representatives who negotiated for the men's release refused to confirm reports they had paid &#163;1.4m ransom to the guerillas, and would only say they were "very pleased and relieved"' their employees had been freed.  <p>  <p>"Our main objective was to get them out as safe and soon as possible. Our management team had free hands economically to do that."  <p>  <p>Mr Halden said of his capture: "It was 10am on a Monday and I was going to work. There are many army roadblocks on the road so it was not unusual to be stopped. We were told to get out of the car and get away from the road as quickly as possible.  <p>  <p>"They did not say we were being kidnapped, only that they wanted to speak to us."  <p>  <p>He and the other men were then forced to march for five or six days into the jungle. After being kept in a shack for a month with the other men, he was separated and taken further into the jungle with a group of 15 guerrillas, some as young as 14 and 15, from the Marxist-Leninist group.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Joe Haines reveals Harold Wilson tried to have Idi Amin assassinated in the 1970s </b><br><br><br><b><h2>18 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Wilson 'tried to organise assassination of Idi Amin'  </h2>
<br>By <b>Michael White</b><br><br>


<p>
<p>Former prime minister Harold Wilson tried to organise the assassination of the Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin, in the mid 1970s, his former press secretary Joe Haines revealed last night.
<p>
<p>At the time, in 1974/75, Foreign Office officials told Mr Wilson that they were "very much against it" and later said they had no-one capable of such work, Mr Haines said.
<p>
<p>The story will emerge in a BBC television documentary on Sunday entitled 'How To Be Prime Minister', but Mr Haines, a close lieutenant of Mr Wilson, who died last year, said: "Harold called me up to his study one day. At the time Amin was killing about a thousand people a day. He was worried about it and said he thought Amin should be killed.
<p>
<p>"He asked my opinion. Then he said he was going to see what could be done." Mr Haines admits that he supported the idea in the exceptional circumstances then prevailing.
<p>
<p>Amin, a former colonial army sergeant who was later driven into exile in Saudi Arabia, staged a prolonged period of terror in Uganda as well as expelling thousands of Ugandan Asians who were the mainstay of much of the local economy. Many came to Britain in the early Seventies.
<p>
<p>Later, when Labour had returned to power, Mr Wilson's foreign secretary, Jim Callaghan, had to visit Kampala in person to obtain the release of a British lecturer Denis Hills, who was under threat of execution.
<p>
<p>Mr Haines said last night that Lord Wilson, as he later became, was concerned about massacres and terrorism in Africa and the Middle East and often wanted to take action. He had not mentioned it in his own book on 'Life In Downing Street', Mr Haines admitted, "It was not mentionable at the time."

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Cardinal Hume says celibacy rule for priests may have to go</b><br><br><br><b><h2>18 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Hume says celibacy rule may go  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Madeleine Bunting</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Cardinal Basil Hume dramatically intervened yesterday in the controversy over the resignation of the bishop who formed a long-standing friendship with a divorcee by suggesting that the insistence on celibacy for Roman Catholic priests could be changed.  <p>  <p>The leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales conceded that many "excellent" people were being lost to the Church because of the rule that Catholic priests must remain celibate.  <p>  <p>"It is not divine law. It is Church law, so any Pope could change it. We are losing excellent and very good people because they would wish to be married priests."  <p>  <p>In his intervention, the cardinal touched upon an anomaly which allows married former Anglican priests to work alongside Catholic priests who would have liked to marry but could not.  <p>  <p>The situation has been created by the growing body of married former Anglican priests who have been accepted into full communion with Rome since the ordination of women by the Church of England.  <p>  <p>These number 20 already, with more due to be ordained in Westminster Cathedral next month.  <p>  <p>The cardinal was speaking a day after it was announced that the Right Reverend Roderick Wright, Bishop of Argyll and the Isles, had decided to resign because he could not "physically or spiritually" continue. The bishop has been in hiding for 10 days with Kathleen Macphee, a 40-year-old divorced nurse.  <p>  <p>Sources in the Catholic Church were quick to point out last night that the cardinal's comments were simply a reiteration of fact. But his decision to highlight how celibacy deters good candidates for the priesthood was seized upon as a brave move.  <p>  <p>Pope John Paul II has insisted that the celibacy requirement must stay. Bishops who step out of line on the question have even found themselves summoned to Rome to discuss the matter.  <p>  <p>Greg Murphy, editor of the Catholic Times, said: "The cardinal has been courageous this week to involve himself in this debate. But he won't get into trouble with the Pope who is well aware of this issue and that there are particular extenuating circumstances in England."  <p>  <p>John Wilkins, editor of the Catholic weekly, the Tablet, said: "Britain is the testing ground for how married clergy can work and, eventually, there will be about 100 of them here. The debate on the issue at all levels of the Church is being fuelled by the presence of the married former Anglican priests."  <p>  <p>William Oddie, a former Anglican priest and now a Catholic, said the cardinal's remarks "will certainly create a bit of a stir". But he added: "Celibacy is one of the Catholic Church's great treasures. It would be foolish to throw it away."  <p>  <p>The cardinal was careful to measure his comments with praise for the Church's tradition - which sets it apart from all other Christian denominations and was only adopted by Rome in the 12th century. "Many of us would find it very hard to give all our energy and our time to our ministry and to give good quality time to our families," he said. After his comments dominated news bulletins, the cardinal, later interviewed by the Daily Telegraph, made it clear he personally was against any change in the celibacy law. "Celibacy is the right answer for the Church." The question of priestly celibacy does not affect Cardinal Hume personally because he is a Benedictine monk. He said he had prayed throughout his life on the example of Christ as a celibate.  <p>  <p>He told BBC Radio 4: "Our society is very preoccupied with sex. It is not a bad thing to have people who can witness to love without sex." Declining numbers of vocations, particularly in Europe and North America, have generated a sense of urgency among many Catholics that the question must be tackled. Celibacy is one of the most controversial issues in the Roman Catholic Church worldwide.  <p>  <p>Campaigns organised by protest movements in Austria, Germany and France have gathered hundreds of thousands of signatures, with one of their main demands being an end to priestly celibacy. In parts of Africa and Latin America, many priests are in relationships.  <p>  <p>A spokesman for the Pope's official representative to England and Wales, the Papal Nuncio, said there would be no comment from the Vatican, because "it rarely responds instantly".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Holy orders</b>  <p>  <p>There were 5,259 priests in England and Wales in 1994, the last year for which figures are available.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Women's groups condemn ruling by Italian court of cassation on violent husbands </b><br><br><br><b><h2>20 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Italian ruling sparks outrage for 'sanctioning wife-battering'  </h2>
<br>By <b>John Hooper</b><br><br>


<p> <p>Italian women across the political spectrum joined yesterday in condemning a ruling by
the country's highest court which they fear could legitimise wife-battering. <p> <p>Yet the
Sicilian victim in the case said she was delighted with the decision. <p> <p>The court of
cassation ruled that a man could not be convicted of maltreatment if his violent actions were
occasional, provided his partner did not report him. It gave weight to the claim that the
attack by Francesco Lombardo, aged 42, had been prompted "solely by jealousy". <p> <p>Anna
Mannino, aged 39, described her husband yesterday as "a good man and a good husband who doesn't
deserve to be hounded by the courts". She dismissed the attack as "one of those things that can
happen in any family". But the equal opportunities minister in Italy's centre-left government,
Anna Finocchiaro, said: "The ruling introduces a dangerous distinction between violence and
violence - violence is always an offence." <p> <p>Tina Lagostena Bassi of Silvio Berlusconi's
Forza Italia movement said: "To ask the victim to demonstrate the continuity of
ill-treatment... is diabolical." Alessandra Mussolini, a far-right MP and granddaughter of the
late fascist dictator, said the ruling "legitimises violence". A spokeswoman at the centre in
Rome for victims of violence against women called the ruling "scandalous", while the
anthropologist and feminist Ida Magli said: "I find it grotesque that we are still arguing over
issues of this sort." <p> <p>In 1990 Mrs Mannino went to a hospital at Capaci, in Sicily, her
face covered with bruises which doctors said would take a week to heal. Her husband had beaten
her, accusing her of acting provocatively and causing gossip. <p> <p>"Like all Sicilians, my
husband is jealous," Mrs Mannino said in an interview published yesterday. <p> <p>She refused
to report the attack, which was reported by doctors. The ruling overturned an eight-month jail
sentence for ill-treatment. <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Prince Charles criticises "unnatural practices" in farming</b><br><br><br><b><h2>20 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Prince hits at farming's "unnatural" methods  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Paul Brown</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Prince Charles hit out at "unnatural practices" in farming yesterday and said the BSE crisis was the result of catastrophic experiments in treating animals like machines.  <p>  <p>In an indictment of British farming policy and its results in destruction of wildlife, he suggested that mad cow disease was the result of man disturbing the balance of nature. "Perhaps BSE will come to be seen as one example, albeit a very expensive and damaging one, of how nature hits back when we violate her laws."  <p>  <p>He also said the decline in male fertility across Europe might be linked to diet, and vital minerals in fruit and vegetables had been lost because of intensive farming.  <p>  <p>In the speech last night to the organic farming organisation, the Soil Association, on its 50th anniversary, he pulled no punches in condemning current agricultural practices and the failure of the Government to give organic farming a fair chance to compete.  <p>  <p>He took pains to defend individual farmers who had been locked into intensive production because of polices which stemmed from the food shortages of the last war and the need for self sufficiency. The prince, who practises organic farming at his Highgrove estate, said the effect of intensive farming on animals was often horrifying. "We must recognise that for the last 50 years we have given our farmers a remarkably narrow set of goals, and accompanying incentives to help them get there: economic performance without environmental accountability; maximum production without consideration of food quality and health; intensification without regard for animal welfare; specialisation without the consideration of the maintenance of biological and cultural diversity. The signals we sent said we wanted cheap food and plenty of it. We can hardly blame the farmers now for their outstanding success in achieving these goals."  <p>  <p>Urgent reform of the Common Agricultural Policy was needed to change the farmers' role. Looking after the countryside as a service to society as a whole had to be recognised in farmers' pay.  <p>  <p>He revealed that he had arranged two seminars at Sandringham to discuss future farming policy. These had included European farmers who also wanted reform. He said a seminar between farmers and environmentalists in Brussels next month, to be attended by EU Commissioners, was a further step towards that reform.  <p>  <p>He was not interested in returning to the past, but learning from it. Highgrove, which had been farmed organically for 11 years, was profitable, with premium prices obtained for produce.  <p>  <p>He criticised the Ministry of Agriculture for its failure to encourage other farms to convert to organic production, saying that the financial incentives to do so were less than of any other country in Europe.  <p>  <p>The way a country grew its food was a model of its society: "If the way in which people farm is grasping, looks only to the short-term, and is indifferent to the effects of what is being done to the generations that will follow, then that is what their society will be like too."   <p>  <p><b>Soil matters</b>  <p>  <p>Britain has 800 organic farms, a total of 120,400 acres - less than one per cent of the land farmed.  <p>  <p>Germany and Denmark expect to have 10 per cent organic farms by 2000. Dairy cows which once lived 20 years now produce their own body weight of milk every month and "milk themselves to death in seven years", Prince Charles said.  <p>  <p>More than 50 per cent of Britons would buy organic food if it were available, according to MORI polls.  <p>  <p>The UK has the lowest level of incentive payments to farm organically in Europe.  <p>  <p>The cost of BSE is so far estimated at &#163;1.4bn.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Susannah Frankel</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The supermodel Claudia Schiffer has announced her retirement at the age of 26. Ms Schiffer said yesterday that from now on she would only be making "guest appearances" for top designers such as Versace and Valentino.  <p>  <p>Her move, following the decision of IMG models to lay off more than 60 of their girls aged 27 and over, does not bode well for those in the profession of 'a certain age'.  <p>  <p>But age is not the only thing that suggests Ms Schiffer is past her sell-by date - after all, Stella Tennant, who has taken over from her as the face of Chanel, is also 26.  <p>  <p>The real reason for Ms Schiffer's premature retirement is more likely to be that, when seen alongside the more idiosyncratic, so-called 'real' good looks of the new wave of models (Ms Tennant, Kate Moss, Trish Goff, and Esther de Jong), her appeal seems sadly dated - as, indeed, does that of her contemporaries Linda Evangelista, aged 30, Cindy Crawford, also 30, and Naomi Campbell, 26.  <p>  <p>Only last year, Jean Paul Gaultier advised Ms Schiffer to "get a new haircut - people are really growing bored of this blonde mane."  <p>  <p>On hearing of the retirement of his muse, designer Karl Lagerfeld said he wished a time machine could transport her back to the silent film era. "She would have been a wonderful Hollywood silent star. Claudia is part of another world, another fashion, another spirit, another time." Now, he said, she would be "better off doing promotions".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

 <br>By 
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Brian Logan</b><br><br>      <p> <p>What is the most innocent and beautiful woman on the catwalk doing with  the seediest, low-down renegade in American cinema? Having announced her  retirement from modelling, Claudia Schiffer is making her first movie, with the  maestro of the Lower East Side demi-monde, Abel Ferrara. It's a bizarre coupling.  <p> <p>And what of the rumour - not surprising given the Ferrara canon - that she  gets raped in her first scene? "We're not authorised to comment," comments  Schiffer's agency, Metropolitan, in New York. Excuse me? Is Claudia Schiffer, the  vegetarian, teetotal, non-smoking image of perfection to be sullied by amoral  Ferrara? Over to Steven Zeller, publicist for the film, The Blackout. He says: "I  can't remember. I think if Claudia Schiffer got raped, I would remember." The  rumour is groundless. <p> <p>'The Blackout', which has just finished shooting in  Miami, is Ferrara's first venture since his almost-excellent 1930s gangster  flick, 'The Funeral', made a killing at the Venice Film Festival. His has been a  distinctive, rather than distinguished, career, in a long tradition of  non-mainstream New York film-makers. His 1979 debut 'Driller Killer' - in which  an artist, irked by noisy neighbours, drills everyone to death - is the prototype  video nasty. His most renowned feature, 'Bad Lieutenant', charts miserable  moments in the life of a bent cop who wallows in drugs 'n' sleaze until  stimulated to redemption by the rape of a 'beautiful young nun'. He followed that  with 'Dangerous Game', a grim film- within-a-film, 'like "Who's Afraid Of  Virginia Woolf' on acid". <p> <p>Not unlike Scorsese, he dwells on religion,  salvation and self-destruction; his movies exploit, shock and - sometimes -  subvert. In his time, Ferrara has outraged the tabloids, the moral majority and  the liberal establishment. 'Driller Killer' had a special screening in the House  of Commons. He doesn't seem to care. On his partnership with actor Christopher  Walken he once told the Guardian: "We're like Fassbinder. Just get the cash, get  the chicks and shoot it over the weekend, like a porn movie." Schiffer can be  naughty - "I ate a whole bar of chocolate!" - but usually she is "very romantic.  I like candle-lit dinners and curling up at home and watching movies on the  television." Movies like Ferrara's 'Ms 45', in which a deaf-mute rape victim  wreaks vengeance on the male world? It seems unlikely. Perhaps Ferrara identified  a gritty Schiffer alter-ego through reading 'Memories', her photo-laden  autobiography ("I didn't write it, but I like it"): According to the blurb: "Her  life is a reflection of the inner integrity that flows from her wholeness,  harmony and radiance." Schiffer - or Choufleur, as some unimpressed photographers  once dubbed her - has until now remained an unexploded German bombshell. In 1992,  she launched a &#163;17m lawsuit against a paparazzo who snapped her starkers  during a quick change; it jeopardised, she protested, her &#163;4.5m Revlon  contract. Her two-year engagement to magician David Copperfield lent polish to  the image; subsequent suggestions that it was an affair of convenience to bolster  her fame in the States and his in Europe left her name untarnished. So what  possessed her to throw in her lot - and, at &#163;4,784 per minute on the  catwalk, it's a lot - with Abel Ferrara? Claudia has put herself on the chopping  block. Is this any time to remind her that the most recent Ferrara hero, the  Italian avenger Ray Temple, wielded a sharp axe? Mark Damon, the MD in MDP  Worldwide, producers of the movie, explains: "Abel was saying he'd like to use a  very-well known actress, or a very famous model who wanted to act. I thought  Claudia might be interested. She'd received over 100 offers before and turned  them all down; but she was fascinated with this script, and with the prospect of  working with a talented director like Ferrara." Schiffer's part is that of a Soho  art dealer and girlfriend of Matthew Modine's drug 'n' booze junkie who's been  chronically affected by Beatrice Dalle and Dennis Hopper, and who has 'entered  the dark side'. That's Hollywood-ese for a baby-murdering, beer-swillingly bad  hangover. Her role, according to Damon, is very meaty, which may refer to the  scene in which her loved one walks into the sea telling Claudia that he's  murdered his ex. As an untrained actress, could she cope? "She was excellent,"  says Damon. "In her first scene, she was a little tense and nervous, and she  wasn't doing too well. So Abel stopped the shoot, they went off for three hours  and they improvised. Abel discovered that, as soon as she improvised, she became  natural and real." The best and most gruelling scene in Ferrara's 'Dangerous  Game' features Madonna improvising an actress improvising a scene in a movie.  Ferrara enjoys that kind of game. "I think," says Damon, "he's the best director  around for actors today." In today's Hollywood, there's no shortage of MTAs -  Models Turned Actressses. Many model agencies have established special divisions  and Equity, the actors' union, has a distinct category, Models/Temporary  Membership, for models taking to the stage or the screen. "Modelling," says Sarah  Doukas, head honcho at London agency Storm, "has gone extremely high-profile. If  you put Kate Moss in a film, the box office would turn serious money, because  there's a huge interest in her." But is there a logical progression from  modelling to acting? Saffron Burrows, model and star of Dennis Potter's Karaoke  and Cold Lazarus, doesn't think so. She says: "Modelling is the antithesis of  acting. It can be like an out-of-body experience: you're constantly aware of your  own body language, of everything you're projecting, to an extent that's very  unhealthy. If you do it for too long, it's hard to lose yourself in a character."  <p> <p>Schiffer has aspired to the screen for some time. "I look at scripts  periodically and would like to find the right role but I have to study and learn  more about acting," she said three years ago. <p> <p>Ferrara's opinions on acting  are legendary. Of his usual principals, Harvey Keitel and Walken, he claims: "I  just let 'em go. I just make sure they're in focus." As for his relationship with  actors: "All they care about in Hollywood is sympathy for the character. I never  did understand that concept. My guys ain't asking for sympathy." When all else  fails, glamour counts in the US. Ferrara wants it, and doesn't care where he  finds it, as his casting of Madonna demonstrates. <p> <p>He seems to relish  demystifying and humbling those who seem untouchable. So why did Schiffer choose  'The Blackout'? She may be grabbing at gravitas. It has been argued that if his  films had subtitles, Ferrara would be called an auteur. <p> <p>And she must have  been aware her catwalk appeal was waning. "I don't want to be nasty," said  Jean-Paul Gaultier unconvincingly last year, "but she's got no personality."  Popularity polls across Europe identified her as fake and manufactured. The  perception, after she retired last week at 26, is that her look is irredeemably  dated. <p> <p>So can the pure public face of Schiffer survive now she's to appear  in a seamy Ferrara flick? Those in the know say yes. For while Dalle, as Matty's  other lover, has passionate sex in the back of a car, and aborts her baby -  commonplace by Ferrara standards, "Claudia stays sweet and innocent," says Mark  Damon. <p> <p>"Modine has three relationships in this movie; Claudia's is the  most likely to succeed, because she's sweet and supportive. She's a giving person  who has a vulnerability that comes out on screen." Hollywood is a place of  miracles. As Sixties waif Twiggy announced on the very day in 1970 when she quit  the catwalk to become an actor: "I couldn't do a big dramatic acting part, but  I'm willing to try anything that's nice." <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400  border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>High Court rules that Kevin Maxwell won't face second trial over pension fraud </b><br><br><br><b><h2>20 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Another one lost to the SFO</h2>
<h3>The answer? Specialist tribunals for complex cases  </h3>  <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br>        <p>Which is worse: a long, drawn-out, 18-month complex fraud trial that exhausts jury, judge and the criminal justice process; or simpler, shorter and more focused prosecutions requiring defendants to face not one but two successive trials? The judiciary made its view clear after a marathon fraud case in the early 1990s that it did not want a repeat performance. Multiple charges and multiple defendants must be avoided. Accordingly, the prosecution severed and chopped up the Maxwell indictments into two separate parcels only for the jury to reject the first in January and the judge the second yesterday. In the words of Mr Justice Buckley, the presiding high court judge, the trial was sending out the wrong signal, namely that "the authorities have not accepted the verdict of a jury". Faced, as he saw it, with "an affront to fair play and decency", justice required a stay to the proceedings.  <p>  <p>Once more the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) and the jury system is under scrutiny. Yet the arguments which led to the creation of the SFO still stand. Only the naive - and fraudsters - could want the work handed over to the criminal prosecution service. Complex fraud requires specialist teams. City investigators yesterday were speculating about the resurrection of specialist juries. But returning to a medieval institution - fishmongers trying people who sold bad fish - is not a solution. Remember, it was the judge who threw out this latest prosecution. Moreover, he did so with an inappropriate reference to the suffering of Kevin Maxwell's wife. He should have been more circumspect. If the plight of families was weighed, few suspects would ever go to trial. The SFO was set up by the Roskill committee, which also wanted specialist tribunals instead of juries. In reality, Roskill was right.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Dan Atkinson</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Demands for radical changes to the system which involves juries hearing complex fraud cases escalated yesterday as Kevin Maxwell walked from the High Court a free man. A judge ruled he will not face a second trial in connection with the &#163;425m pension fund scandal that sank his father's media empire nearly five years ago.  <p>  <p>The decision, which ends all criminal proceedings in the Maxwell affair, prompted the Serious Fraud Office director, George Staple, to warn of "serious implications" for trials of white-collar crime.  <p>  <p>There are suggestions from inside the SFO that courts should be given back the power they lost 26 years ago to swear in 'special juries' composed of bank managers, accountants and other financially experienced people. Kevin, aged 37, former chairman of Maxwell Communication Corporation, told a news conference shortly after the decision: "I stand before you as an innocent man." He would be "eternally grateful to the judge for showing common sense and humanity".  <p>  <p>His view was still that his late father, Robert, was not dishonest. It was after the former Labour MP died after falling off his yacht in the Atlantic in November 1991 that his publishing empire crashed, and the pensions scandal came to light.  <p>  <p>Mr Justice Buckley delivered his decision in a 55-minute statement in Court 13. "These proceedings serve no further public interest and benefit," he said. A second trial "would be unfair, so unfair as to amount to an abuse of power of the court".  <p>  <p>Kevin, his brother Ian, and the financial adviser, Larry Trachtenberg, were cleared in January after a 131-day trial on charges on conspiracy to defraud pension funds. The SFO announced it would proceed with separate charges against Kevin, Mr Trachtenberg and the former Maxwell executive, Albert Fuller, on conspiracy to defraud bankers.  <p>  <p>Two more counts involved Kevin, Mr Fuller and Mr Trachtenberg on related charges. The former Maxwell executive, Michael Stoney, would have faced two accusations of false accounting.  <p>  <p>None of these charges will now be prosecuted. The SFO claimed yesterday's ruling had put it in an impossible position. Already the judiciary has ruled that jurors should not have to sit through lengthy trials relating to large numbers of offences, so the SFO has responded, as in the Maxwell case, by 'severing' the indictment into separate cases.  <p>  <p>Now, Mr Justice Buckley has ruled it ought in future to be "unusual" for there to be a second trial in such cases.  <p>  <p>Mr Staple said: "This case vividly illustrates the difficulties of large fraud cases." In June, the director suggested the time may have come to examine the possibility of taking juries out of lengthy fraud trials and replacing them with panels of judges, 'expert assessors' or a mixture of the two.  <p>  <p>The SFO believed it had a right to verdicts on the whole of its Maxwell indictment; the judge disagreed. He said that where there was an "affront to fair play and decency... the administration of justice is better served by staying the proceedings".  <p>  <p>He attacked the "unhealthy and adverse media publicity" surrounding the affair and said another trial would signal to the public that the authorities did not accept the verdict of the first jury. I accept the jury's verdict. These proceedings are stayed."  <p>  <p>There were extraordinary scenes outside the High Court as Kevin emerged with his arm around his brother, Ian. Police battled with reporters to clear a path to a waiting car. Shortly afterwards, Kevin faced the media in the Great Hall of Lincoln's Inn and spoke of a 'sense of relief that a nightmare is over'.  <p>  <p>He thanked his wife, family and friends and responded to criticisms of his multi-million pound legal-aid bill. "Justice... and my freedom [don't] have a price.  <p>  <p>"This is... a great day for me personally." His next move would be "lunch, hopefully". He was "still pretty numb from this morning's decision. It hasn't sunk in."  <p>  <p>As the Maxwells celebrated, the SFO was once again the target for criticism. Labour's economic spokesman, Mike O'Brien, confirmed that the role of the anti-fraud force would come within the regulatory review promised should the party form the next government. "Some of the decisions taken by the SFO and the way in which they have been implemented have raised concerns for some years."  <p>  <p>The Liberal Democrats suggested the office's twin investigation-prosecution function ought to be separated.  <p>  <p>Pandora Maxwell made a remarkable impression on Mr Justice Buckley at private pre-trial hearings when she spoke of stress posed by a second trial. "Her obvious distress was, I am convinced, entirely genuine. She described the agony of trial and the days waiting for the verdict with the prospect of a significant prison sentence in the balance.  <p>  <p>"She told me of problems with her children. In particular, their son, who had been told by schoolmates that his father was going to prison. Whenever her husband goes out she is asked 'Will daddy be coming home again?'" "Mrs Maxwell's bewilderment and anger at the decision to proceed to another trial were not feigned. I cannot be over-influenced by such matters, but no one could have been unmoved by her evidence."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Australian scientists discover Aboriginal rock art is the oldest </b><br><br><br><b><h2>21 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>'Oldest art' alters origins of man  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Christopher Zinn</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Australian scientists last night upset theories of human origins with the discovery of rock art which they said was at least twice as old as that in the caves of Lascaux, France.  <p>  <p>They have identified four sculpted boulders dating back 75,000 years in the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia. They also claim to have found human artefacts in sediments known to have been laid down between 116,000 and 176,000 years ago.  <p>  <p>If confirmed, the discoveries, to be published in the British scientific journal Antiquity in December, could send anthropologists back to the drawing board.  <p>  <p>One of the scientists, Paul Tacon, of the Australian Museum, told the Sydney Morning Herald: "It changes enormously the way we think about Australian pre-history. To suggest that Aborigines have been in Australia for more than 100,000 years really does change a lot of things."  <p>  <p>The site is 50 miles north east of the township of Kununurra at a place known to Aborigines as Jinmium. Photographs show isolated boulders covered with hundreds of small engravings of circles.  <p>  <p>Dr Tacon said the designs must have been made by humans and despite their primitive form were art. On one rock there were 3,200 engravings. A stone tool was found in layers possibly dating it up to 176,000 years old. The scientists say it may be the oldest dated rock-art site on Earth. Rock dating is always tricky. The scientists themselves say their results should be "the beginning, and not the end, of public scrutiny and discussion". But the find presents a problem for the orthodoxy which has it that humankind began in Africa. Homo erectus picked up a stone axe and set out to colonise the world 800,000 years ago. Homo sapiens - modern man - emerged about 250,000 years ago in Africa, and began migrating 150,000 years ago.  <p>  <p>The Australian Aboriginals have been known to have settled in Australia about 50,000 to 60,000 years ago. Genetic evidence links them firmly with other modern humans. Their own 'Dreamtime' version of prehistory holds that they have always lived in Australia and did not migrate there. But an occupation more than 100,000 years ago poses a problem for everybody. "I don't know what sort of humans these are, walking about in Australia that far back, but one suspects they could not be anatomically modern humans," said a spokesman of the Natural History Museum in London last night. "There is not time for them to get there, according to the out-of-Africa scenario. It implies more than one occupation of Australia, possibly by Homo erectus. We would have to get used to the idea of Homo erectus being responsible for art. That could be difficult to stomach."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Government figures show Camelot paid out less than 15 per cent of awards to causes</b><br><br><br><b><h2>21 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Lottery cash delays boost Treasury</h2><h3>More than £2bn has been allocated to lottery good causes but only £374m has been paid out</h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Maev Kennedy</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Less than 15 per cent of almost &#163;2.5bn available to the five lottery good causes has actually been paid out, according to government figures.  <p>  <p>Figures disclosed by the Heritage Minister Iain Sproat to the former Tory prime minister Sir Edward Heath reveal that although more than &#163;2bn has been allocated in grants, in the fields of arts, sports, heritage, millennium and charities, just over &#163;317m has been paid out. That figure has risen, in the round of grants over the last few weeks, to &#163;374m.  <p>  <p>The undistributed money helps make the Government's finances look rosier. Although the money remains part of the good causes funds, and earning interest for them, for accountancy purposes the &#163;2bn is counted as part of the Government's wealth until it is paid out, and helps reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement.  <p>  <p>A Department of National Heritage spokeswoman confirmed the figures yesterday, but said: "We expect the sum to reduce rapidly once a wide range of projects comes on stream." Mr Sproat insists that "the impression that little money has actually been paid out" is false.  <p>  <p>The lowest percentage paid out of the amounts awarded is the millennium grants, at three per cent, and the applicants to the heritage fund have done best, at 29 per cent paid out. The arts fund has paid out 17 per cent, the sports fund 21, and charities 23.  <p>  <p>Mr Sproat said 71 per cent of successful applicants had received at least part of their money, rising to 90 per cent in the charities sector. A spokeswoman for the Millennium Commission said that many of their projects were fairly large, and were subject to delays in detailed designs and planning permission. The money will also be paid out on a milestone basis, with some paid over as foundations of buildings go in, and more as the building work proceeds. Legal agreeements have been signed committing the fund to &#163;232m payments.  <p>  <p>A Heritage fund spokeswoman said they had paid out more than the other bodies because many grants were for acquisitions of objects, buildings or land at auction, while their fast-track procedure for urgent appeals had led to some being processed and agreed within two days.  <p>  <p>But thousands of projects are stalled waiting for the necessary partnership funding to match the grants, as the letter from Mr Sproat admits. The distributing bodies see lottery funding as a means of attracting other funds. "The award may be made before the entire partnership funding package is in place, although no money will be paid until the distributing body is satisfied that all conditions of the award have been met."  <p>  <p>Mr Sproat defends the figures, saying that successful applicants only get their money when they hand in the relevant invoices. "A long-term project will therefore only be drawing down funds in a number of instalments, and this will add to the impression that little money has actually been paid out."  <p>  <p>Sir Edward, MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup, sought the figures on behalf of Denis Vaughan, who lays claim to having invented the lottery, and has been critical of the way it has been set up, through his Lottery Promotion Company.  <p>  <p>Although all the lottery funds have relaxed the rules on partnership funding and found ways around the original strict rule on funding only capital schemes, many projects are having great difficulty finding the extra funding, particularly in poor areas, or where many different projects are competing.  <p>  <p>The chairman of English Heritage, Sir Jocelyn Stevens, has already attacked the heritage fund for failures, delays and restrictions.  <p>  <p>The art world expressed envy last week when the Wallace Collection in London applied for a &#163;7.5m grant with all its partnership funding in place, through a single &#163;2.5m donation.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Amir Zia</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Murtaza Bhutto, the only remaining brother of the Pakistani prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, was killed in a gun battle with police in Karachi last night.  <p>  <p>Murtaza, aged 42, who was estranged from his sister, was pronounced dead at Karachi's private Mideast hospital after doctors vainly tried to save his life. He leaves a wife and son, and a daughter from a previous marriage. It was the latest tragic chapter in the turbulent history of Pakistan's foremost political family. Their father, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, was deposed by General Muhammad Zia ul-Haq in 1977 and hanged two years later. Ms Bhutto's other, younger, brother, Shah Nawaz, died in mysterious circumstances - poisoning was suspected - at his home in the south of France in 1985.  <p>  <p>In yesterday's clash in Karachi, six members of Murtaza's breakaway Shaheed Bhutto faction of the ruling Pakistan People's Party (PPP) died instantly. The police said the incident occurred when the cars in which Murtaza's supporters were travelling failed to halt for checks.  <p>  <p>They said Murtaza's followers, who were returning from a party in three cars, fired first when asked to stop. The police returned fire, killing six people, all members of Murtaza's faction, the deputy inspector general of police, Shoaib Suddle, said.  <p>  <p>Five people, including two police officers, were injured in the clash in the exclusive seaside Clifton district. The police imposed a curfew. The police said they had insisted on checking the vehicles because of tightened security after three bomb blasts in the city on Wednesday, in which one person was killed and at least three were wounded. Hours before his death, Murtaza denied that his group had been involved in the bombings, which he blamed on the police. He told a news conference that the police had arrested at least 70 group members in the previous 24 hours. There has been considerable tension in recent days between the police and Murtaza's supporters, after the arrest of one of his key aides, Mohammed Ali Sunara.  <p>  <p>In exile, Murtaza led a militant resistance group which fought against Zia's dictatorship. He fell out with Benazir - who, like him, was educated at Harvard and Oxford - partly over his support for armed struggle. Murtaza returned to the country in 1993 as Benazir was starting her second term as prime minister after Zia's death in an air crash. He was immediately arrested in connection with a hijacking carried out against Zia's government. "My sister's democratic government is pursuing cases made in martial law against me," he said at the time. He faced 80 charges, all carrying the death penalty, but was released on bail in 1994.  <p>  <p>According to one Karachi newspaper, he had a one-point programme: "To make life miserable for his sister."  <p>  <p>He took the side of his Iranian-born mother, Nusrat Bhutto, when Benazir ousted her from the PPP chairmanship, and he subsequently campaigned to have her reinstated and for former members of Zia's regime to be expelled from the government.  <p>  <p>Murtaza set up his rival PPP branch in March last year, but attracted no heavyweights from his sister's mainstream party.  <p>  <p>"We want to save the party and Pakistan from looters, plunderers and dacoits  [bandits]," he said at the time.  <p>  <p>When the faction was formed, his followers decked his Karachi home with banners carrying anti-United States slogans, such as: 'America is the enemy of Pakistan' and 'America is the killer of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto'. In July, Murtaza met his sister for the first time in six years, but afterwards he commented: "Before the meeting I thought there could be some convergence of views, but the gulf has become even wider."    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ibrahim Khan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Members of the divided Bhutto political dynasty came together at the weekend at the family's ancestral home in Larkana to pay their respects to Murtaza, the Pakistani prime minister's brother, who was killed in a gun battle with police officers on Friday night.  <p>  <p>His death has visibly shaken the prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, who accompanied their mother, Nusrat, and another daughter, Sanam, in laying red roses on Murtaza's grave yesterday.  <p>  <p>His Lebanese widow, Ghinwa, called on supporters to stay calm after they clashed with police yesterday near his house in Sind province. She urged them to wait until a government inquiry completes its work. "Even today people were raising slogans and I have asked them 'Let us curse the killers, but let us not take names now'," she said.  <p>  <p>Witnesses said the demonstrators prevented President Farooq Leghari from making a condolence visit to the house by chasing the police away as his motorcade approached.  <p>  <p>They said about 250 supporters of Murtaza blocked the road with burning tyres and chanted slogans accusing Benazir's husband, Asif Ali Zardari, of being part of a conspiracy to kill their leader.  <p>  <p>Murtaza, aged 42, was shot and killed with six of his followers in the clash with police in Karachi. Another of his supporters died of his wounds on Saturday.  <p>  <p>A spokesman for his Pakistan People's Party-Shaheed Bhutto faction said it had no confidence in the high court judge appointed to head the inquiry, Ali Mohammed Baloch.  <p>  <p>The spokesman claimed that yesterday the police shot dead a detained survivor of Friday's gun battle. He said the man, identified only as Asif, had been in the back of Murtaza's vehicle, but had escaped injury at the time.  <p>  <p>He added that the security forces had detained 3,000 party members in the past few days. Karachi police confirmed only six arrests.  <p>  <p>Murtaza was estranged from his older sister Benazir for much of his turbulent life. She inherited the leadership of the PPP from her father, the former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was hanged in 1979. Yesterday Nusrat Bhutto issued a statement saying Murtaza's death was part of a conspiracy against the family and denying reports that she had implicated Benazir and her husband.  <p>  <p>"The vicious, malicious and unkindest remarks attributed to me are only designed to create confusion in the people's mind, with a view to diverting attention from the real culprits, whom the independent commission will identify," she said.  <p>  <p>Nusrat lost another son, Shahnawaz, who died in France in 1985, possibly after having been poisoned.  <p>  <p>The PPP-Shaheed Bhutto faction accused Zardari, Benazir's husband, of engineering Murtaza's death. A statement issued yesterday by Zafar Arif, a member of its central committee, said Zardari had held secret talks with 'criminal elements' in the security forces last week.  <p>  <p>"The murder of Murtaza Bhutto is the direct result of these conspiracies," it said.  <p>  <p>No comment was immediately forthcoming from Zardari, who is Pakistan's investment minister.  <p>  <p>The police say Murtaza's guards fired first on Friday night, but opposition politicians dispute their account.  <p>  <p>Nawaz Sharif, the leader of the main opposition Pakistan Muslim League, has accused the government of "state terrorism" against its political opponents.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ewen Macaskill</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A block on a visit by the Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, to the House of Commons this week has been welcomed by the Labour leader, Tony Blair. Mr Adams had been due to hold a press conference on Thursday to mark the launch of his autobiography. The Labour MP for Islington North, Jeremy Corbyn, had booked the room.  <p>  <p>Although press conferences by senior members of Sinn Fein have been held at the Commons, the Serjeant at Arms, Peter Jennings, who is responsible for administration, ruled at the weekend that Mr Adams could not use the Commons. Mr Blair, who distanced himself from Mr Corbyn as soon as the row broke, condemned the plan to allow Mr Adams to use the facilities. Conservative back-benchers had protested but had been unable to stop Mr Adams. The crucial intervention came from a Labour MP, Michael Martin, chairman of the Commons administrative committee, who pointed out to Mr Jennings that the original plan had been for a book launch, which could not be prevented because Mr Adams was a former MP, but that had since been changed to a press conference.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gerry Adams cancels Jeremy Corbyn's invitation to House of Commons</b><br><br><br><b><h2>26 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Even the foolish have rights</h2>
<h3>Jeremy Corbyn can invite whom he likes to Westminster  </h3>  <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br>        <p>Every few years, the London Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn indulges his romantic support for Irish republicans by using his parliamentary privileges to give them a publicity platform. These occasions always also provide a showcase for Mr Corbyn's abiding qualities: his lack of wider political and moral judgment, his predilection for gesture politics, his insensitivity to the feelings of most Londoners and his indifference to the policies of his party.  <p>  <p>Now he has done it again, this time by inviting Gerry Adams to Westminster in a week in which London is still reeling from its narrow escape from a major bombing, at a time when the IRA's reversion to violence has been arguably the principal cause of the deterioration of the situation this year in Northern Ireland, at a time when Parliament is not even sitting, and in the days leading up to his party's important annual conference on the eve of an election which Labour has to win.  <p>  <p>Mr Corbyn's actions do not advance the cause of peace in Northern Ireland and are not seriously intended to do so. It is surprising that a politician as clever and important as the Sinn Fein leader should be bothered with him. Grown-up people ought to keep this childish sideshow in perspective. Mr Corbyn is a fool, and a fool whom the Labour Party would probably be better off without. However, even fools have rights. As an elected MP Mr Corbyn is entitled to invite whom he pleases to Westminster, certainly including Mr Adams. The parliamentary authorities, let alone the Government, have no business trying to prevent him from doing so. It comes pretty ill from Conservative MPs, some of whom treat Westminster as a pig's trough for their own commercial clients, to pontificate about Mr Corbyn's judgment when their own is hardly any better.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Gerry Adams will make his controversial visit to the House of Commons this morning, despite this week's huge seizure of IRA explosives in London and Tony Blair's threat to discipline the leftwing MP who invited him. The president of Sinn Fein will stage a symbolic meeting with Jeremy Corbyn, MP for Islington North, in a Commons committee room before going on to the Camden Irish Centre to launch his book of memoirs which was the centre of controversy even before IRA suspect Diarmuid O'Neill, was shot dead by police on Monday.  <p>  <p>After yesterday's shadow cabinet meeting unanimously backed Mr Blair's call for Mr Corbyn to withdraw his invitation, Labour's chief whip, Donald Dewar, issued a sharp statement.  <p>  <p>He said that the MP "is acting on his own behalf and must take responsibility for so doing".  <p>  <p>The former cabinet minister Tony Benn will also attend the meeting, and Mr Corbyn said Ken Livingstone had signalled support. He said he would not be backing down and that the Serjeant-at-Arms, who supervises parliamentary regulations, had reluctantly accepted the situation.  <p>  <p>"It should not be a dispute within the Labour Party when one MP wants to meet Sinn Fein to press for a ceasefire. I do not want to get into a public brawl," Mr Corbyn said.  <p>  <p>He plans to urge Mr Adams to press for a renewed ceasefire and peace talks, and fears that rebuff for such talks will strengthen Sinn Fein/IRA hardliners.  <p>  <p>Outraged MPs, Labour as well as Tory, thought otherwise about what is widely seen as an ill-judged publicity stunt intended to embarrass the Government until the IRA arms find intruded.  <p>  <p>"The Labour Party is not involved or associated in any way. We utterly condemn his proposed action. If he persists it will be a matter for disciplinary action," Mr Dewar said.  <p>  <p>That was being interpreted as a New Labour return to the 1950s and 1960s, when troublesome MPs lost the party whip.  <p>  <p>That would mean an MP could not stand as a Labour candidate, an almost inconceivable move so close to an election.  <p>  <p>Mr Corbyn says today's meeting will not include a press conference, though Sinn Fein sources say he will talk to reporters on the pavement outside. The Labour chairman of the Commons administration committee, Michael Martin, said: "Unfortunately, there is nothing in the rules of the House to prevent my colleague Jeremy Corbyn from having a meeting with this man who is the flunkey and the mouthpiece for the IRA."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Gerry Adams cancels Jeremy Corbyn's invitation to House of Commons</b><br><br><br><b><h2>27 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Smooth Adams steals agenda</h2><h3>Hostile press bemused as Sinn Fein leader pays tribute to Jeeves  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ewen Macaskill</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Gerry Adams allowed himself a little smile yesterday. He had been asked about literary influences. After listing a handful of Irish writers, from Liam O'Flaherty to Roddy Doyle, he threw in a surprise, the creator of Jeeves and Bertie Wooster, epitomes of the English class system. A bemused journalist asked why one of the key figures in the Irish republican movement had chosen PG Wodehouse. Mr Adams said it was because he identified with the oppressed, even butlers.  <p>  <p>"I always treat butlers with absolute deference," he said. "I think they are long suffering." He did not add "like the Irish people" but he did say "like representatives of Sinn Fein".  <p>  <p>Mr Adams is smooth, good at public relations, backed by a Sinn Fein machine that puts a lot of money and thought into presentation. Even the Unionist community acknowledges this, lamenting the extent to which Sinn Fein can dominate the news agenda.  <p>  <p>On the opening day of the multi-party talks in June, Mr Adams secured the pictures he wanted, to the distress of the Northern Ireland Office, showing him behind a wire-mesh gate, barred from the peace talks.  <p>  <p>A month later, he was pictured in the Lower Ormeau Road in Belfast, trapped behind two rows of Royal Ulster Constabulary armoured vehicles. And yesterday he did it again. He was in the Irish Centre in Camden, north London, for what should have been a relatively low-key event for the launch of his autobiography, 'Before the Dawn'. Instead, he was happy to be at the centre of a semi-circle of more than 100 television cameramen, photographers and reporters, drawn by the IRA arms find earlier in the week and the Labour Party row over his invitation to the House of Commons.  <p>  <p>This ensured that he spent the day being chased by the media, from a private meeting with Labour MPs Jeremy Corbyn and Tony Benn through to a photo opportunity on the College Green outside Parliament. By the evening, he had done a series of interviews, including a radio phone-in. This morning, he is due to fly to Dublin, a successful trip behind him.  <p>  <p>At the press conference, apart from the odd soft question about literary influences - after all, it was a book launch - the tone of the journalists was hostile.  <p>  <p>Had he in fact shot dead a British officer, as described in the book in a section he claimed was fictional?  <p>  <p>Did he write the articles under the pseudonym Brownie expressing pride at being in the IRA?  <p>  <p>Was he pleased or sorry about this week's London arms find?  <p>  <p>Mr Adams has been dealing with hostile questions for years. He has learned not to become rattled, to provide an answer of some sort. No, he had not killed a British officer. Yes, he had written some of the Brownie articles but not that one. He could hardly answer otherwise: admitting to membership of the IRA carries a prison sentence.  <p>  <p>On the arms find, he said: "I am very pleased that only one person was killed." But he hadn't answered the question: was he pleased or sorry? He replied that as far as he was concerned he had answered the question. A handful of people at the back of the hall applauded at the end. One, 85-year-old Kathleen Gibbons, had travelled from Hampstead just to see him, and spent the press conference balancing on top of a wobbly chair. She had been impressed: there had been nothing "boastful, nothing bombastic" about him. But she was not disinterested: her dead husband, Danny, had been in an IRA flying column in County Mayo in the years immediately after the 1916 Rising.  <p>  <p>The journalists were less impressed, checking notes, realising they had yet again failed to pin him down.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Autobiography of Brigitte Bardot </b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Love and hate: Bardot bares her soul  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Paul Webster</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>As her 62nd birthday approaches on Saturday, Brigitte Bardot is about to reveal the full misery and the rare joys of being the most famous Frenchwoman since Joan of Arc.  <p>  <p>Her autobiography - 'BB' - threatens to claim a record for cinema world heartbreaks and attempted suicides.  <p>  <p>The book, inspired by a song written by a former lover, the musician Serge Gainsbourg, will be released in France and Germany this week during a publicity extravaganza which includes an entire night of television interviews and film re-runs.  <p>  <p>The cinema-going public will adore her for her demolition of co-stars such as Alain Delon and Sacha Distel, and weep over the unhappiness of innumerable affairs. However, the former actress could cause repulsion by her warm support for the racist French politician Jean-Marie Le Pen. BB, who is married to one of Mr Le Pen's aides, has not appeared in a film since she retired at 40 to set up an animal rights foundation. She has spent much of the last 21 years putting together her own story as a reply to "all the rubbish that has been written about me".  <p>  <p>In her pre-publication build-up, BB has lost none of the art of being the century's greatest tease, announcing that she has been "conned, manipulated and abused". The management of guarded interviews, spontaneous comments and leaked snippets from the autobiography, published in France by Grasset, has been better scripted than most of her films.  <p>  <p>"I am very afraid of the impact," she said yesterday. "This is more stressful than a first film. My life has been a succession of brief moments of joy and terrible trials. With me, life is made up only of the best and the worst, of love and hate. Everything that happened to me was excessive. In this book, I have stripped myself bare."  <p>  <p>The image is entirely in keeping with the semi-naked femme-enfant temptress of Roger Vadim's 1956 film 'Et Dieu Crea la Femme' ('And God Created Woman'). First leaks of the text allude to alcohol abuse, self-destructive depression and a cinematic form of nymphomania in which the actress falls in love with her leading men from the first screen embrace.  <p>  <p>"When you live such intense moments as I have done there is always a bill to pay," she said, revealing that just before she retired she drank two bottles of champagne and three bottles of wine a day.  <p>  <p>Referring to suicide attempts when she cut her wrists, took sleeping pills and tried to gas herself, she said: "You cannot escape the distress which follows great happiness."  <p>  <p>Her book tells of lovers who beat her, betrayed her and exploited her because she was naive and vulnerable. They treated her as a slut and a prostitute. Her upbringing in a strict Parisian bourgeois family, who hoped she would become a ballet dancer, did not prepare her for her meeting with Vadim, her first husband, who turned her into a universal sexual fantasy. She was 14 when they met, and he was a Paris Match photographer covering the moral liberation movement in Saint-Germain-des-Pres that brought together an intellectual elite, led by Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir, and a mass of popular talent including the actress Juliette Greco and the writer Francoise Sagan.  <p>  <p>The best known of her lovers were cinema stars such as Jean-Louis Trintignant and Warren Beatty. She neglected her only child, Nicholas, by the actor Jacques Charrier, and describes pregnancy as "the punishment of God". She found the film world boring and felt satisfaction only when filming ended.  <p>  <p>"The madness which surrounded me always seemed unreal," she recalls. "I was never really prepared for the life of a star. I'm happier in my routine life today than when I was chased after by 100 photographers."  <p>  <p>She has deliberately destroyed her image as a sex symbol by refusing cosmetic surgery, dressing badly and, after giving away her Saint Tropez villa to her foundation, living in a small house surrounded by rescued animals, a rusty Renault 4L and a broken down Range Rover.  <p>  <p>"You mustn't think I am dissatisfied," she said. "That would be a form of bitterness. My life is now what I always wanted - what I dreamed about subconsciously."  <p>  <p><b>Thoughts of BB</b>  <p>  <p>On actor Alain Delon: "Alain is handsome, certainly, but so is my Louis XVI commode. And I don't communicate any better with my commode than with Alain. Nothing happens in his face or in his eyes to cause emotion, nothing happens which attracts you, nothing which makes you believe in a sliver of truth, feelings or passion. Alain is a cold being, extremely egocentric who has found nothing better to warm up his image than advertising furs. He makes a fine pair with Sophia Loren."  <p>  <p>On singer Sacha Distel: "All of a sudden the star of the couple was him with his contracts, his musicians, his think tank, his public relations. If only he had known at the time that his first public relations asset was me. He didn't find out until afterwards when he had become a zero... All the men who shared my life, whether singer, actor or playboy, had their moment of glory. They thought it was due to their own selves and were cruelly disappointed when they saw the glory pass to their successor and they were abandoned to their sad fate."  <p>  <p>On actors Jean-Louis Trintignant and Sami Frey: "Those two are worth all my admiration and my love, which in some ways, still lasts. But I was so young and so mad that I did not realise I was involved with exceptional beings. I need to devour life and I let them pass. I have always fled to somewhere which I think better and never go back. When it's finished, it's finished."   <p>  <p>On National Front leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen: "He is a charming and intelligent man, who, like me, is revolted by certain things. On the terrifying surge of immigration, I share his views completely."   <p>  <p>On Charles de Gaulle: "There is not a single politician who even comes up to his ankle. He had what makes great statesmen: authority. It's the same for teachers and fathers - if there is no respect then it's a mess."   <p>  <p>On men and love: "I love intense, reckless affairs. They must burn you up. Love must be passionate, even if passionate love does not last. That's why I have a life full of amorous liaisons. I fell in love with my male acting partners from the moment of the first love scene."  <p>  <p>On society: "I hate it, I detest it and think it's horrible with its decadence, moral and physical filth, the loss of essential values and the spread of pornography."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>British crime survey shows rise in violent crime of 10 per cent</b><br><br><br><b><h2>25 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Violent crime soars by 10 per cent  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alan Travis</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Michael Howard yesterday banished all talk of 'turning the tide' against criminals as the annual figures showed the crime rate rising for the first time in three years, including a 10 per cent jump in violent crime. The confirmation that the three-year decline in the crime rate had been halted instead prompted the Home Secretary to accuse the public of failing to appreciate that the recorded crime figures had just been through their largest sustained fall for 40 years.  <p>  <p>The Government's efforts to re-establish its law and order credentials also received a knock with the publication yesterday of the 1996 biennial British Crime Survey, based on interviews with 16,000 adults.  <p>  <p>It showed that crime has continued to rise in the past two years, albeit by only two per cent. Only four per cent of the public believed that the official crime rate had really fallen by 10 per cent in the past three years. Instead the survey showed that three-quarters believed it had continued to rise substantially.  <p>  <p>"I wish that the public had a keener appreciation of what we believe is actually happening. It is not unusual for the public perception to lag somewhat behind what is actually happening," said Mr Howard. The annual figures show there were 5.1 million crimes recorded by the police in the 12 months to June 1996, an increase of 0.4 per cent.  <p>  <p>Although violent crime only accounts for six per cent of offences, Mr Howard said he was "extremely concerned" the category had suffered its largest increase for eight years, to 331,000 offences.  <p>  <p>But the Home Secretary took comfort in continuing minor falls in burglary (one per cent), theft (two per cent) and car crime (one per cent). "My concern is the long-term picture. Both the bulletins published today provide encouraging evidence on the trends in crime.  <p>  <p>"I make no bones that the rise in violent crime is a matter of concern. If you look at the fastest growing parts of the rise in violent crime, particulary domestic violence and sexual crime, then that has something to do with the rise in reporting."  <p>  <p>Rapes rose by 14 per cent and robberies by 15 per cent, largely accounted for by an increase in street muggings. The largest rises in crime were in Gwent, Cambridgeshire, Merseyside, and Sussex. Durham, Cheshire, and Gloucestershire had the largest falls.  <p>  <p>The rise in violent crime with a continuing small fall in property offences confirms Home Office research that, as the economy improves and personal disposable income increases, there is a rise in violent attacks, particularly those which are alcohol-related.  <p>  <p>The shadow home secretary, Jack Straw, said that in the past 12 months Tory ministers had dined out on modest falls in recorded crime yet the British Crime Survey had revealed that crime levels had continued to increase in the past two years.  <p>  <p>"The Government has failed to tackle the underlying causes of crime and deal with criminal anti-social behaviour in local neighbourhoods. It is no wonder [Tory MP] David Mellor said Labour is outflanking the Government on law and order," he said.  <p>  <p>For the Liberals, Alex Carlile said the Government had failed to stem rising crime and there were unprecedented levels of violent crime.  <p>  <p>Bill Taylor, chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers, agreed that the upward trend was "a cause for concern".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>British crime survey shows rise in violent crime of 10 per cent</b><br><br><br><b><h2>25 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Survey reveals rise in violence  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alan Travis</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The 1996 British Crime Survey published yesterday says crime rose by two per cent between 1993 and 1995 - the period when Michael Howard was hailing an eight per cent fall in police figures as the largest for 40 years. The BCS, carried out every two years and based on interviews with 16,500 adults, estimates that there were 19.1 million crimes last year. The two per cent rise is, however, the smallest increase since its inception in 1981 and the results also mirror the pattern in the police records in the last two years, with both showing small falls in burglary and car crime and a rise in violent crime. The BCS, however, estimates there has been a 17 per cent rise in violent crime as against 10 per cent in the police figures in the last year.  <p>  <p>A BCS finding which will also alarm Tory politicians is the discovery that only four per cent of the public believe crime has fallen in the past two years. Three quarters feel it has increased. The BCS, regarded by criminologists as more reliable than police figures, shows a growing amount of crime not being officially reported, with roughly four times as many crimes happening as are recorded by the police. Many crimes go unreported because victims do not feel they are serious enough.  <p>  <p>More comforting is the BCS finding that there has been a small decrease in people's fear of crime. The proportion of women who feel unsafe alone on the streets at night has dropped from 54 per cent in 1994 to 47 per cent now. Amongst other BCS findings are:  <p>  <p>More than one in 10 women and one in 20 men said they never went out after dark. A third of the women who stayed in cited fear of crime as the reason. The largest rise in violent crime has been in domestic attacks in the home, which have increased by 242 per cent since 1981. Acquaintance violence, by someone known to the victim, has doubled since 1981. Street muggings have increased at a slower rate (54 per cent) and stranger violence has shown the smallest rise (12 per cent) over the past 15 years.  <p>  <p><b>More Crime</b>  <p>  <p>England and Wales  <p>  <p>Violent crime:  <p>  <p>Percentage increase in violence from 1981-1995:  <p>  <p>domestic  242  <br>acquaintance 123  <br>mugging 54  <br>stranger 12  <p>  <p>Notifiable offences: number of offences (thousands) recorded by the police July 1995-July 1996   <p>  <p>violence against person 10.3  <br>sexual offences 1.5  <br>robbery 14.7  <br>vehicle crime -0.8  <br>burglary -1.3  <br>fraud and forgery -1.7  <br>criminal damage 4.7  <br>other notifiable offences 7.8  <p>  <p>source: home office  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Judge in Perry Southall stalking case calls for change in law  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>25 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Fury over stalking case - Judge calls for urgent change in law</h2> <h3>Defence lawyer criticised for "blaming victim"  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stuart Millar</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Pressure for an immediate change in the law on stalking intensified last night, when a judge called for it to be made a criminal offence after the conviction of an unemployed man who terrified a dental nurse for eight months.  <p>  <p>Perry Southall, aged 20, from east London, was forced to endure 200 incidents of harassment by Clarence Morris, a convicted rapist aged 37. Although he never laid a finger on her, Morris was found guilty on two assault charges.  <p>  <p>There was outrage at Southwark crown court when Morris's barrister, David Stanton, in effect accused Miss Southall of provoking her eight-month ordeal by her appearance. His conduct was referred to the Bar Council. Judge Gerald Butler, QC, adjourning sentence for a month for medical reports, warned Morris, with 45 previous convictions for sexual offences and assault, that he was considering sending him indefinitely to Rampton high security mental hospital.  <p>  <p>The jury took less than two hours to decide that Morris, a six-footer who has spent 15 years in prison, had psychologically scarred Miss Southall to such an extent that it was the equivalent of physical injury. Judge Butler said: "What this case clearly shows is that the legislature must move swiftly to create a separate offence for this kind of conduct." A conviction was possible only because prosecutors decided two years ago that, in the absence of an anti-stalking law, they would charge stalkers with causing actual or grievous bodily harm. The offences were intended to deal with physical assaults, but prosecutors argued they could cover psychological harm.  <p>  <p>Julie Bindel, of the International Conference on Violence, Abuse and Women's Citizenship, said: "This case, like many others, shows how crucial a change in the law is. It is high time that such a serious offence is placed firmly in the criminal arena."  <p>  <p>Anne Strahan, of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, said: "We are pleased that the judge has added his support to our calls. It is an indication of the severity of the need for stalking to be made a criminal offence, and we would like the Government to heed his call."  <p>  <p>But the row over Mr Stanton's remarks during his closing speech threatened to overshadow the judge's recommendation. He told the jury of six men and six women: "Miss Southall chooses to make herself to look, no doubt, as attractive as possible. She chooses to do that not only for her own satisfaction but because she likes the attention of others: men." Mr Stanton, who likened Miss Southall to Pamela Anderson, whom he described as "a sexually active actress", suggested it was Morris's right to find her attractive.  <p>  <p>"Is it fair that a young lady who dresses to attract, the queen bee attracting the drones, the queen bee that dresses to kill... cries foul because somebody finds her attractive?"  <p>  <p>Judge Butler criticised the remarks in court. "May I publicly and entirely dissociate myself from your comments as to that which I believe ought never to have been made." He stopped short of referring him to the Bar Council. Ms Bindel, who has complained to the barristers' governing body, said: "This kind of attitude is responsible for the victim being made to take the blame. It is not women who should censor how they dress or where they go, but men who attack women who should be censored."  <p>  <p>Leading criminal QCs condemned Mr Stanton's comments. Richard Ferguson, QC, described the remarks as "irrelevant and in poor taste".  <p>  <p>There has been mixed success in the use of assault charges to prosecute stalkers. Last March, a former naval petty officer, Anthony Burstow, was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm to a former colleague, against whom he had waged a three-year hate campaign.  <p>  <p>But last week, another jury was ordered to clear Dennis Chambers, a 37-year-old van driver who offered no defence to a charge of grievous bodily harm on Margaret Bent, aged 30, a restaurant manager. The judge told the court it was difficult to prove intent in cases of psychological harm. The Home Office issued a consultation paper in July promising new criminal offences to cover stalking and harassment, which could be law by next spring. Anyone who caused people to fear for their safety, or caused harassment, alarm or distress, would be guilty of an offence. Victims of stalkers would be able to apply for an injunction stopping them. Breach of the injunction would carry a penalty of up to five years' jail. The court heard that during Miss Southall's ordeal, Morris twice threatened her with a wallpaper scraper. Once, he approached her wearing a pair of Y-fronts over his trousers, blowing a whistle, and brandishing the implement as he screamed his love for her.  <p>  <p>He showered her with bottles of champagne, threw items of women's underwear into the dental practice in east London where she worked, and sent her 35 letters claiming he loved her.  <p>  <p>"I feared for my life. I was petrified," Miss Southall told the court. She has nightmares about Morris. She said she was unable to sleep properly and often burst into tears for no apparent reason. Her social life was in tatters.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Clashes between Israelis and Palestinians after tunnel opens in Jerusalem </b><br><br><br><b><h2>26 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>West Bank riots push Israel to brink of war  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Derek Brown</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Israel came to the brink of open war with the Palestinians yesterday. In scenes reminiscent of the worst of the intifada, Israeli troops shot at stone-throwers in the West Bank town of Ramallah. This time Palestinian police fired back with automatic weapons as the clash degenerated into a new and uglier conflict. Seven Palestinians were killed, including three Palestinian security men, and more than 300 wounded.  <p>  <p>The Israeli troops' intervention in Ramallah, one of the Palestinian self-rule enclaves, was the first big incursion since limited self-government by the Palestine Liberation Organisation was established more than two years ago.  <p>  <p>There were also clashes yesterday in the West Bank town of Bethlehem where Israeli troops and Palestinian police exchanged fire, witnesses said. The gun battle erupted near the Tomb of Rachel, wife of the biblical patriarch Jacob. It followed clashes at the site between Palestinians and Israeli troops, who opened fire with live ammunition and rubber bullets, wounding at least four Arabs, among them a Palestinian police colonel. Security forces sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip late last night to prevent further flare-ups.  <p>  <p>The worst clashes since the start of self-rule erupted after widespread protests about Israel's latest move to underline its exclusive control of Jerusalem: the reopening to tourists of an entrance to an ancient tunnel near the most revered mosque in the Holy Land. Palestinians say the tunnel could undermine the Haram al-Sharif, on which stand the Dome of the Rock and the al-Aqsa mosque.  <p>  <p>The arcane dispute has become the focus for Palestinian frustration with a peace process which has halted since the 29 May election of a rightwing Likud government under Binyamin Netanyahu.  <p>  <p>In Ramallah, seven miles north of Jerusalem, hundreds of stone-throwing youths attacked one of the Israeli checkpoints on the edge of the city. Israeli sources said troops used rubber bullets and tear gas, and resorted to live ammunition when they came under fire. Palestinian and other witnesses said PLO forces opened fire only when the Israeli troops started to shoot stone-throwers.  <p>  <p>One witness described how a man in civilian clothes, who described himself as a member of the Palestinian president Yasser Arafat's elite Force 17, pulled out a pistol and fired wildly in the direction of the Israelis. The vicious exchange lasted at least 90 minutes before new Palestinian forces pushed back the crowd. The Israeli forces were also apparently under orders to disengage.  <p>  <p>In Gaza, Mr Arafat talked of a "big crisis" between the Israelis and the Palestinians. The Palestinian cabinet minister, Hanan Ashrawi, speaking after visiting the wounded in hospital, was more blunt. "It's a massacre, there is no other word for it."  <p>  <p>At Mr Arafat's urging, the 22-nation Arab League will meet in Cairo today to discuss the implications of the Jerusalem tunnel. Many Arab governments have already indicated their outrage at Israel's latest unilateral action. Mr Netanyahu's government has blamed the self-rule Palestinian Authority for stirring up passions.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Diarmuid O'Neill shot dead in police raid on IRA arms cache in Hammersmith</b><br><br><br><b><h2>25 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Disgraced bank clerk who met a brutal end</h2><h3>The amiable youth who kept his double life hidden from those who were closest to him  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>He was a big fellow, always smiling, his red hair making him stand out in the busy summer bars of West Cork's Irish Riviera.  <p>  <p>In Maddens bar in Timoleague on the Carbery Coast, they are used to seeing famous people rub shoulders with the locals. Sir David Puttnam has a house nearby, just one of the many wealthy English people who spend their summers gorging on seafood and Guinness.  <p>  <p>Irish people with English accents are rarer, and ones who can afford their own holiday retreat are happy evidence that you can get on in the world and still never lose the love of your own country.  <p>  <p>Diarmuid O'Neill believed he loved his country so much he was willing to die, or even kill, for it. None of the regulars at Maddens, or the Pink Elephant overlooking the magnificent Bay of Kinsale, knew this. To them he was just another happy-go-lucky visitor, forever in the company of his father, Eoghan, and his mother, Teresa, a feisty Dubliner known as Terry. An IRA man? The news was met with shock by the people who live in these little villages of brightly painted cottages, where Marian shrines still display freshly cut flowers every day and the only trouble the police ever have to deal with is getting the pubs shut within licensed hours. "They were not big drinkers. They came here most nights for the company and were good fun, very nice people," said publican Charlie Madden yesterday of the family group, which often included Diarmuid's brother, Shane. "We never heard them say anything controversial. We don't believe they were involved in anything."  <p>  <p>Next to the O'Neills' pretty dormer cottage with its fine sea views lives Pat Joe O'Brien, a farmer who spoke with the dead man's parents a few hours before the news reached them on Monday. Eoghan and Terry had moved over permanently when she retired 18 months ago from her job as bursar in a London college.  <p>  <p>"Nobody around here ever associated anything like IRA activity with that family," he said. "They were very nice, quiet people, who fitted in very well with everyone around."  <p>  <p>A few days earlier the O'Neills had celebrated Mass with him and they were regular visitors to the local Roman Catholic chapel. Diarmuid had last been there on holiday in the summer. In July they had all celebrated Eoghan's 60th birthday.  <p>  <p>Johnny Keoghane, a postman, spoke to Diarmuid's parents shortly after the Irish police told them what had happened in London. "Eoghan rang me about 4.30pm. He was crying and in a terrible state. He just said something awful had happened in London, that Diarmuid had just been shot in some kind of IRA thing."  <p>  <p>The grieving parents left immediately. At Heathrow they were met by their daughter, Siobhan, a London nurse.  <p>  <p>Behind them they left disbelief among their friends. But Garda Special Branch knew a different 'big fellow'. According to police sources in Co Cork, Diarmuid had been suspected of being an IRA sympathiser or member for at least five years, when he was seen with local republicans. In 1988 he was convicted of stealing &#163;75,000 from the Bank of Ireland branch in Hammersmith, west London, where he had just begun work as a clerk. At his trial it was claimed that &#163;34,000 was channelled to the IRA via an account in Belfast. He served five months of a one-year sentence in a young offenders' institution.  <p>  <p>It was an inauspicious start to adulthood after education at the exclusive RC Brompton Oratory School in Knightsbridge. After leaving prison he went on to earn a living as a cabinet-maker. On his frequent visits to Ireland he was not kept under close surveillance, but Gardai knew of his movements, according to a senior officer in Cork. "Whether he was on IRA business during his visits or not is another question," he added.  <p>  <p>It seems likely that he was a politically aware young man, conscious of his family's past. A great uncle, Donal O'Buachala was elected to the first Dail in January 1919, the year British rule crumbled and Sinn Fein swept to victory, taking almost every seat in the island save for the north-east, where Unionism stood firm.  <p>  <p>He would have known the history of West Cork too, the heroic adventures of the IRA commander Tom Barry's Flying Column, 300 men who inflicted stinging defeats on the 12,500-strong British forces gathered in the county in the weeks before the 1921 truce.  <p>  <p>The county is steeped in republicanism, although there are nowadays only pockets of active members. For the vast majority, Cork's history is best left in the history books, for here there were pogroms against Protestant communities.  <p>  <p>In Kilbrittain itself, a Royal Irish Constabulary man was killed by the same IRA volunteers who took part in the killings of Protestants and who then went on to murder Michael Collins - the original Big Fellow - at Beal na Blath when pro and anti-treaty forces were fighting a civil war. Diarmuid would have known all this. Every summer there are republican commemoration ceremonies to remember their fallen. Collins this summer is once more emerging into the light as the IRA man turned statesman who might have changed the course of history had he lived. It is hard to imagine that the young red-headed boy with the English accent did not pay his own homage at the shrine.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Diarmuid O'Neill shot dead in police raid on IRA arms cache in Hammersmith </b><br><br><br><b><h2>26 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Death at dawn - the fatal gesture of an IRA man</h2><h3>Piecing together the final minutes in the life of an unarmed terrorist suspect  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chris Elliott</b><br><br>        <p>Diarmuid O'Neill, the 27-year-old IRA suspect, was shot dead through a gap in the doorway of a first floor flat in west London by police officers who believed he was making a threatening movement, the Guardian has been told. As an inquest into his death was opened and adjourned yesterday, more details of the events leading up to the shooting emerged. The unarmed man was shot six times by two officers from Scotland Yard's tactical firearms group, SO19.  <p>  <p>The policemen, armed with Heckler and Koch sub machine guns, fired from inside the building as they crouched in the hallway outside the flat in a house at Glenthorne Road, Hammersmith.  <p>  <p>Only evidence of identification was released during the 20-minute hearing at Hammersmith coroner's court yesterday. The official investigation into the death is being supervised by the Police Complaints Authority. However, witnesses and police sources say the raid, one of three carried out simultaneously just after 4am on Monday, was aimed at arresting three suspects.  <p>  <p>After armed police stormed the Victorian terraced house - a four-storey former bed and breakfast hostel known as The Lodge - using 30ft ladders, they successfully brought out two of the suspects, handcuffed but unharmed. As they were preparing to enter the rear first floor room where O'Neill was staying, just after 4.30am, it is understood that another occupant in the house came out of his flat and asked the officers what they were doing. This apparently brought O'Neill to the door of his room, which he opened and then immediately slammed shut when he saw the police.  <p>  <p>Officers called on him to come out with his hands up for some minutes before other policemen on a wall behind the end of the terraced house and on ladders placed up against the building outside fired CS gas through windows of the room. Some minutes later O'Neill opened the door partially and witnesses say they heard police calling: "Drop it! Drop it!". Around that time Carol Dalton and her mother Josie Crawley, whose home overlooks the rear of the house, heard officers shouting "armed police" and "come out with your arms up".  <p>  <p>"First of all they were kicking a door down at the back, then there was a lot of running and shouting," Ms Dalton said. "Then we saw officers wearing gas masks. We were looking out when we heard the shooting. None of the people we could see had fired." The shots, she thought, had come from inside the building. At this point, towards 5am, the two officers say O'Neill made a threatening movement and was shot six times.   <p>  <p>Paramedics from the London Ambulance Service, on standby at the scene, treated O'Neill, who was pronounced dead at 5.25am, whether at the scene or at Charing Cross hospital is not clear. There have been suggestions the body was carried out of the building on a stretcher. However, this seems to be contradicted by photographs showing a broad smearing of blood on the five steps and front path of the house, apparent evidence of the body having been dragged out.  <p>  <p>Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, yesterday alleged there had been an attempt to hide the facts about the shooting.  <p>  <p>"The media was briefed that this man was killed in a gunfight and now we are being told that this is not the case," he said. "That not only was there not a gunfight, not only did he not fire any shots, but it now appears that he didn't even have a weapon."  <p>  <p>John Bruton, the Irish prime minister, described O'Neill's death as "a matter of great sadness", but he added: "There would be a lot of other people dead if the IRA's objectives had been achieved."  <p>  <p>John O'Donoghue, justice spokesman for the opposition Fianna Fail party, claimed police may have been operating a 'shoot to kill' policy in the incident. "If he was shot dead by the British police and they knew he was unarmed," he said, "then it must be clear that there are very serious questions to be answered by the authorities. No man has the right to act as judge, jury and executioner."  <p>  <p>Last night it emerged that the five men arrested in the raids are being questioned about the Docklands bombing in February. Reports also suggested O'Neill was believed to have been involved in planting the massive bomb, which killed two people and marked the end of the IRA ceasefire. Intelligence sources in London insist O'Neill's links with the republican movement had been well established over the past five years. They also claim he was under surveillance for weeks in connection with the Hornsey Vale arms cache before they moved in. Hammersmith residents said O'Neill had been working in the basement of The Lodge in the week before his death. Mike Bennett of the Police Federation countered Mr Adams's remarks last night. "The death is to be totally regretted but officers didn't set out to kill this man," he said. "People should be proud that officers are prepared to undertake this kind of dangerous work."  <p>  <p>He said the two officers involved, who have had their firearms authorisation cards suspended as a matter of routine pending the investigation, were yesterday bearing up well. "They were seen by one of our lawyers within half an hour of it happening."  <p>  <p>Specialist firearms officers are trained to fire two shots quickly at the main trunk of a suspect if they believe their lives are in danger. They are trained to kill.  <p>  <p>The men would have been briefed some hours before on what to expect when they went to arrest the men.  <p>  <p>This is the first time an IRA suspect has been shot dead on the mainland. In the past the IRA have opened fire on police when stopped, notably at Stoke Newington, north-east London, when an officer was shot twice when he stopped a van carrying a one ton bomb three years ago and again at Warrington when shots were fired by an IRA gang during an attack on a gasholder.  <p>  <p>One senior officer said last night: "We aim to 'house' [contain and arrest them in a house] now, so the damage is either to them or to us."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Scotland Yard and Spanish anti-terrorist police have launched a new investigation into links between the IRA and ETA because of the relationship between Diarmuid O'Neill, the IRA suspect shot dead by police in west London, and a woman from the Basque country.  <p>  <p>The pro-ETA newspaper Egin, which wants an independent Basque country, this week published a death notice for O'Neill, whose killing is the subject of a police inquiry. Accompanied by an Irish tricolour, it read: "Ginger. Killed by the English police 23 September. From all your friends in Amorebieta." Amorebieta is a small industrial town close to Bilbao, where O'Neill's girlfriend Karmele Ereno lives.  <p>  <p>A relative yesterday denied reports that Ms Ereno was still living in London. Neighbours of her family in Spain said the family had no known links with ETA or its political wing Herri Batasuna. But they revealed that O'Neill spent time in the Basque Country with Ms Ereno this summer.  <p>  <p>Police sources in Madrid said the Comisaria General de Informacion - the anti-terrorist branch of the national police force - has been contacted in the past few days by Scotland Yard about Ms Ereno. It is likely that they will be looking for her to question her about her relationship with O'Neill. According to neighbours in Amorebieta, Ms Ereno, aged 27, travelled to London three years ago to live and learn English. O'Neill had made several visits to the area in the past few years and became a familiar figure. British and Spanish police have worked together before in tracing links between ETA and the IRA, which are believed to have first been established in 1972.  <p>  <p>In London, O'Neill's parents described him last night as an "unselfish and loving son". In a prepared statement, released several hours after their youngest son Shane was released from custody in Paddington Green police station, Eoghan and Theresa O'Neill claimed the police had taken the law into their own hands.  <p>  <p>Mr and Mrs O'Neill, who live in County Cork, returned to London after the pre-dawn police and MI5 raids in London and Sussex in the early hours of Monday. "We are relieved that our youngest son, Shane, has been released from custody and that we have him with us safely," their statement read. "Diarmuid was never arrested; he can never be tried, nor can he be acquitted or convicted other than by the press who have not waited to have a full and proper picture before judging him.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Clashes between Israelis and Palestinians after tunnel opens in Jerusalem </b><br><br><br><b><h2>26 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Too smart for his own fist</h2><h3>Mr Netanyahu is risking a reversal of the peace process  </h2></h2><b>Leading article</b><br><br><br>
  <p>Undermining the fragile peace process between Israel and the Palestinians is no longer just a figure of speech, with the completion of the 'tourist tunnel' on the edge of the Temple Mount and the lethal violence which has followed on the West Bank. Many Arabs believe Mr Netanyahu, who directly authorised its completion, wants to wreck the peace process. It certainly seems that he wants to redefine it on his own terms, and does not care too much if it goes wrong. If the Palestinians protest, the burden lies on their heads. This is the hard logic of a man who thinks he holds the high ground, but does he not realise that he may be digging it from under his feet? <p>  <p>Israel yesterday sought to present the Arab stone-throwing in Ramallah as a calculated provocation by the Palestinian Authority (PA), to which its troops had no alternative but to reply with force. The muddled events do not bear that interpretation; rather, they reflect the incoherent anger of Palestinians who regard the tunnel as one provocation too many from a hard-dealing Likud government. Israel will have a difficult job convincing anyone that Mr Arafat, regarded as an appeaser by many of his Arab critics, is responsible. <p>  <p>To claim that the new tunnel exit is merely a means of speeding up the tourist flow in the Old City ignores the political context. The senior Likud figure and mayor of Jerusalem Ehud Olmert did not conceal the deeper motive: it was to tell the Palestinians that "we are not playing games" and that the city will never be up for discussion "because we [the Israelis] are the sovereign..." <p>  <p>The incident follows other recent muscular steps, also authorised by Mr Netanyhau and including the accelerated construction of new Jewish housing, while there have been no corresponding steps to fulfil negotiated promises to the PA. As the more moderate mayor of Tel Aviv Roni Milo observes, it was at least foolish to force the issue of Temple Mount before withdrawing Israeli soldiers from Hebron, as required by treaty six months ago.  <p>  <p>In London yesterday, Mr Netanyahu continued to show his undoubted skill in packing hard facts between soft words. He presents his long-delayed meeting with Mr Arafat as an enormous concession. He calls for good faith on both sides, having shown bad faith in scrapping or postponing Israeli commitments. He argues that Israel's new objectives, once they are properly understood by the Palestinians, will be theirs too. He reproaches President Mubarak - another performer best known for leaning over backwards - because Egypt can no longer stifle its alarm at Israeli procrastination. <p>  <p>Mr Netanyahu is, as we all know, a very smart guy. But there is a real question now - shared by many worried Israelis - as to whether he may be too smart to see beyond his own fist. In the peace process, one thing has led to another. The same will be true in disastrous reverse if it continues to be undermined.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Former South Africa police death squad chief says Olof Palme was killed by SA agent </b><br><br><br><b><h2>27 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Palme "killed by SA agent"  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Beresford</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The self-confessed head of a police assassination squad, Colonel Eugene De Kock, told the supreme court in Pretoria yesterday he had evidence that South African security services were responsible for the murder of the Swedish prime minister, Olof Palme, in 1986.  <p>  <p>De Kock - who has been convicted of six murders and a string of other crimes - was testifying in mitigation of sentence. He claimed the killing had been carried out with the help of a notorious South African agent, Craig Williamson. "It was one of Craig Williamson's Operation Long Reach projects. I wanted it to be investigated before it was covered up," he said.  <p>  <p>Elsewhere in his evidence, testifying about the abuse of state funds by the security services, he said a British agent was once paid about &#163;100,000 after threatening to expose South African police involvement in a bomb attack on the London offices of the African National Congress. There has been speculation in the past about South African involvement in the murder of Palme, who was shot dead while walking home with his wife from a cinema in central Stockholm.  <p>  <p>Lars Jonsson, the deputy chief of the Swedish police panel investigating the murder, said yesterday: "A part of the De Kock information is new. I do not want to say what is new to us and what is not."  <p>  <p>A petty criminal, Christer Pettersson, was tried for the murder in 1989, but acquitted.  <p>  <p>Mr Williamson was one of South Africa's most successful spies until his cover was blown by the Guardian in 1980, when he held a key position as deputy director of an anti-apartheid funding agency in Geneva. Mr Williamson returned to South Africa and became a senior officer in the security services. He is known to have masterminded the bombing of the ANC's London offices in 1982, for which he and members of the sabotage team - including one Peter Caselton - were decorated by the South African government.  <p>  <p>In 1983 a Swedish man, Bertl Wedin, was charged with burgling the London offices of the second South African liberation movement, the Pan-Africanist Congress. He said he had been recruited by Mr Caselton and his 'handler' was Mr Williamson.  <p>  <p>South African security forces are known to have sent murder units to Europe in the 1980s to kill anti-apartheid figures. One victim, Dulcie September, the ANC's chief representative in France, was shot dead in Paris in 1988. Palme strongly opposed the apartheid regime and Sweden made substantial contributions to the ANC.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nick Varley</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Live Aid founder Bob Geldof last night launched a High Court custody battle against his ex-wife Paula Yates over the couple's three children. The rock star's application came after drugs squad officers raided the home in London that Ms Yates shares with her new partner, Michael Hutchence, lead singer of the group INXS.  <p>  <p>Reports suggested drugs squad officers had seized what they suspected was opium, but police would only confirm that 'substances' had been removed. Ms Yates, aged 34, and Mr Hutchence, 36, are in Australia with their two-month-old daughter, Heavenly Hiraani.  <p>  <p>Mr Geldof, 41, is thought to have made an application for Fifi Trixibelle, 13, Peaches, six, and Pixie, four, to live with him at his Kent home. The three children live with their mother and Mr Hutchence in Chelsea, but are staying with their father while the couple are away.  <p>  <p>Mr Geldof, now a millionaire through his television production company Planet 24, appeared before a judge in chambers, Mrs Justice Hale, at the High Court yesterday evening. He launched an emergency action in the Family Division after learning of the police raid. It is understood he won a temporary order, lasting one week.  <p>  <p>However, Mark Stephens, Ms Yates and Mr Hutchence's lawyer, said he was "mystified" by news of Mr Geldof's legal move and described any order as "unwarranted and inappropriate".  <p>  <p>He added: "It all seems to be happening while Paula and Michael are 10,000 miles away. I'm mystified by this and will be making inquiries of Mr Geldof's lawyers as to what is happening."  <p>  <p>Mr Stephens said Ms Yates and Mr Hutchence were in "complete surprise" following the raid on their home. The couple had received no contact of any kind from the police, he added.  <p>  <p>Their nanny, Anita Debney, was questioned by police following the raid. According to reports last night, she has resigned after 12 years. The couple are due to fly home today, and police have indicated they will interview them when they return.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br><br>Plans by Bob Geldof to campaign on behalf of divorced fathers' rights to their children received backing from pro-family groups yesterday. The Live Aid founder said he hoped to make the issue his next big project, following his acrimonious divorce and the continuing dispute with former wife Paula Yates over custody of their children.  <p>  <p>The move was welcomed by the pressure group Families Need Fathers, which said the star was just one of many men now getting involved in the cause. Campaigners believe the law is loaded in favour of the wife in custody battles.  <p>  <p>Geldof, aged 41, outlined his plans in an interview before he launched a custody battle for his three daughters.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>40 cancer victims to sue Imperial Tobacco in first British mass action case </b><br><br><br><b><h2>28 September 1996</h2></b><br><h2>UK cancer victims sue tobacco firms</h2><h3>No legal aid, but lawyers take case on 'no win, no fee' basis  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Clare Dyer</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Forty lung cancer victims are to sue the cigarette manufacturers, Imperial Tobacco and Gallahers, for millions of pounds, in the first mass action by smokers in the British courts.  <p>  <p>In a surprise move, lawyers have agreed to take the case on a 'no win, no fee' basis, with the risk that &#163;3m worth of work will go unpaid if they lose. The case looked set to be abandoned after a year of investigation when the Legal Aid Board refused funding to take it to court last July.  <p>  <p>But the London solicitors Leigh, Day & Co have agreed to take it on under a conditional fee agreement, together with Daniel Brennan QC, president of the Personal Injury Bar Association, and Mark Mildred, a professor at Nottingham Law School and an expert on group actions. The case is the first group action to be run on such a basis. Such deals, introduced a year ago, are seen by many solicitors as too risky for big cases, and are mainly used for one-off accident claims.  <p>  <p>In the US, despite two decades of litigation, no tobacco manufacturer has yet paid a penny in compensation. Law firms there have been bankrupted after trying to take on the tobacco giants. Now, 60 law firms and several state governments, looking to recoup billions of dollars spent on smoking-related illnesses, have formed a powerful alliance.  <p>  <p>Imperial and Gallahers together account for 80 per cent of the UK market. The British cancer victims have been warned that the manufacturers could pursue them for their legal costs if the case is unsuccessful, but have decided to press ahead.  <p>  <p>Martyn Day, a senior partner of Leigh, Day & Co, said: "It was clear that the only way for the tobacco victims to gain access to justice in the British courts was for lawyers to take on the cases through the 'no win, no fee' scheme."  <p>  <p>Mr Day, whose firm did &#163;150,000 worth of work investigating the case before the Legal Aid Board pulled the plug, added: "We know exactly what our case is."  <p>  <p>The lawyers will argue that the manufacturers knew the risks of tar by 1960 and should have taken steps to reduce the tar in their products. The case has the potential to be much bigger than past group actions over transport disasters or faulty drugs, because lung cancer claims 30,000 new victims each year.  <p>  <p>Mr Day hopes it will reach court around October 1998. "With the spectre of death hanging over so many of the lung cancer victims, I think we'll get it heard quickly."  <p>  <p>The legal action is expected to cast a cloud over next month's flotation of Imperial Tobacco, which is being spun off by the Hanson Group. Although Imperial said it would vigorously defend the claim, the case undermines the company's selling point as one of the few tobacco groups so far immune to legal action.  <p>  <p>Imperial sells largely to the UK market, where US-style litigation was seen as a distant threat. The value of the group could be undermined if potential investors reckon Britain will follow America into being an unsafe place to market tobacco.  <p>  <p>Gallaher declined to comment.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>The legacy of 60 a day</b>  <p>  <p>Joe Potter smoked 60 cigarettes a day from the age of 17 until cancer was diagnosed 11 years ago. "I was never without one," he recalls. Now 68, he had a lung removed and had to retire at 57. Once a Newmarket jockey weighing six stone seven, he has ballooned to 15 stones because he can no longer take exercise. "I can't even ride a horse."  <p>  <p>When he went down with lung cancer, he had to give up his job transporting racehorses. "I couldn't even drive a lorry. Tobacco has ruined my life. I get out of breath and I get a terrible pain in my side."  <p>  <p>Mr Potter, who lives with his wife in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, welcomes the news that the legal action is to go ahead. "All I want to do is get it over and done with - as long as they don't come on us for a lot of money after the case if they win. I've got a nice bungalow that's all paid for and we've just had a new conservatory put on it. I learnt too late in life about it all, but I would like to see this case come to court to help other people."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>New method of  contraception introduced</b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 October  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Green light for rhythm method  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chris  Mihill</b><br><br>      <p> <p>A hitech form of the rhythm method of contraception which is said to be  95 per cent reliable goes on sale today, allowing women more accurately to judge  when it is safe to have sex without the risk of pregnancy. A pocket-sized monitor  lights up green when it is safe to make love without contraception, and red when  it is not. An amber light means the user must carry out a simple urine test to  determine if she is near ovulation. To use the Persona system, a woman presses a  button on the first day of her period. The method is said to be as reliable as  the condom when used properly. Only five to seven out of 100 women using it for a  year are expected to become pregnant. <p> <p>Rhythm methods are popular among  Catholics, it being the one method of birth control which is sanctioned by their  church. However, it has often been criticised as unreliable. <p> <p>Persona has  been tested in some 1,200 women in Britain, Ireland and Germany over the past two  years.The manufacturers, Unipath, who make home pregnancy and ovulation  test kits, say that the method should allow couples to make love without a  contraceptive on most days of the month. <p> <p>The system works by measuring two  hormones, E3G and LH, which tell when the fertile period begins and ends. On average each woman will have six to 10 fertile days a month when she is at  risk of pregnancy. <p> <p>The volunteers in the trial were aged 18 to 45 and in  established relationships. More than 3,200 questionnaires found that 95  per cent of women found Persona easy to use. Sandra Pickerton, aged 28,  said: "There are no drawbacks to it at all. You soon get used to looking at the  monitor every morning. If you don't remember, and you should have done a  test, there's a leeway of three hours. And if you forget you'll just get more red  lights - usually you get six to 10 a month. It's great to dispense with  condoms except when you need them, and to know when you're ovulating and when  you're about to have your period, so that mood swings and bodily changes fall  into place." <p> <p>However the cost of Persona may put off some potential users.  The monitor and initial starter pack will retail at &#163;49.95, and monthly  supplies of urine testing equipment will cost &#163;9.95. The Family Planning  Association welcomed the method, saying it would give couples more choice. <p>  <p>However, it is not recommended for women who are not in committed  relationships because it encourages them to stop using condoms, which protect  against sexually transmitted diseases including HIV. The pill is still the most  popular form of contraception, but women have been frightened by recent health  scares. <p> <p>"Many women still have needless fears about taking the pill," says  Ann Furedi, director of the Birth Control Trust. There is a lot of  interest in natural family planning." <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400  border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Vivek Chaudhary</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Lawyers representing the Duchess of York are considering legal action to halt further publication of taped conversations in which she reveals details about her sex life, financial problems and her views on the royal family. Extracts from the tapes, which contain personal conversations between the duchess and psychic healer Vasso Kortesis, have been carried in tabloid newspapers over the past few days. The tapes are also being played on premium 0891 phone line numbers.  <p>  <p>Lawyers from Schilling and Lom, who represent the duchess, spent most of yesterday formulating their response. They are also planning legal action against the book 'The Duchess of York, Uncensored', written by Ms Kortesis. The book contains allegations that the duchess had sex with former lover Steve Wyatt while five months pregnant and that she first wondered if her marriage to Prince Andrew had been a mistake 24 hours after the wedding. The tapes also feature conversations between Ms Kortesis and Prince Andrew. In one extract he is recorded as saying that he hopes his marriage can be saved. Ms Kortesis tells him that the duchess has "never been with anybody else apart from you".  <p>  <p>In one of the tapes, the duchess reveals her desperate financial situation and that she wishes to see the whole Royal family die.  <p>  <p>The duchess also accuses former lover John Bryan of "ruining" her life and other former lover Steve Wyatt of being a "creep" and a "bastard", and she tells Ms Kortesis that her father, Major Ronald Ferguson is "a madman". The controversy surrounding the tapes comes at a time when the duchess is facing crippling financial problems and a legal battle over another book which threatens to further publicise her private life. The duchess has already spent &#163;150,000 fighting publication of a book by former friend Alan Starkie and could face a legal bill of more than &#163;1m if she loses.  <p>  <p>According to other reports, the duchess is still on the verge of bankruptcy with an alleged &#163;4m overdraft.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Hamilton libel case against the Guardian collapses spectacularly  </b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>A pattern of  corruption and deceit  </h2>
 <br><br>      <p>Seldom in the long and chequered history of the libel law can there have  been a more humiliating cave-in. For two years now Neil Hamilton and Ian  Greer have blustered vigorously and noisily about their utter innocence and  this paper's utter guilt. Mr Hamilton persuaded his fellow Conservative MPs  to overturn 300 years of constitutional history in order to let him have his  day in court. Possibly without the support of Sir James Goldsmith this time,  he went, cap-in-hand, to solicit backbench contributions to his cause.  Barely three weeks ago he issued a boastful press release revealing that he  would expose the Guardian's "corruption" and our peddling of "sensational  fantasy". Both Mr Hamilton and Mr Greer continued blustering all the way to  the court door - and then dropped out. <p> <p>Their backers in this heroic  fight for truth must be curious as to why such a crusade should have been so  mutely abandoned at the 11th hour. We can help them. Mr Hamilton and Mr  Greer are liars - and both knew they had been found out. The accumulation of  evidence that mounted against both men would have been utterly damning had  the case ever proceeded. Mr Hamilton, in particular, would have been shown  to have lied to virtually everybody who had ever had cause to inquire into  his affairs. The case would further have shown that the Guardian's original  claims about cash for questions were entirely true - though they represented  but the tip of an iceberg. Mr Hamilton was not an isolated bad apple -  though he has for many years been earning considerable sums on the back of  his parliamentary career via Ian Greer's lobbying firm. A nauseating  portrait would have emerged of MPs on the take and of how Mr Greer's  insidious spider's web caught up dozens of MPs, high and low. If there are  two men more relieved than Mr Hamilton and Mr Greer not to be in court this  week, they are surely John Major and Michael Heseltine, no longer required  to come and attempt on oath to defend the indefensible. <p> <p>The ways of  the law are curious. During the course of preparing for a libel trial each  side is obliged to surrender such papers, accounts and memorandums as may be  relevant. They may all be used in court: but if a plaintiff suffers from  cold feet at the last minute the papers must all be returned and  (presumably) forgotten. So the account of events in the Guardian today is,  inevitably, incomplete - a glimpse of a revealed pattern of greed and  deception which should be of grave concern to the Prime Minister and all  those concerned for parliamentary democracy. Today we urge Mr Major to call  in all the documents. We hope Sir Gordon Downey, the new man now responsible  for parliamentary standards, does likewise. The Inland Revenue would  certainly find much to interest them. It might even be fruitful for the  Director of Public Prosecutions to ask for a set. In any other democracy,  MPs who secretly take money from millionaires to advance their causes in  Parliament are put behind bars. In Britain, they stand for re-election. That  is the simple, staggering truth about a Parliament which connives at  corruption under the pretence of defending the privileges of its members.  <p> <p>The British position has been justified by the comfortable theory  that Parliament can punish its own miscreants, after an investigation by the  Privileges Committee and its report to the House. But the Privileges  Committee is a jurisprudential joke. It has no investigative procedures, no  legal methods (such as cross-examination) to test for truth. It is the  committee of a gentleman's club, with an in-built Government majority,  astute only to ensure that those who are caught not disclosing secret  payments should be thrashed with a feather. <p> <p>It is too early to judge  what difference the Nolan reforms will make. MPs now have more extensive  disclosure duties - a 'code of conduct' and a Parliamentary Commissioner to  investigate complaints. It is not too early to judge Mr Hamilton. Lord Nolan  specified seven qualities needed by an elected MP: selflessness, integrity,  objectivity, accountability, openness, honesty and leadership. Mr Hamilton  is without a single one. He is not fit to hold office. <p> <p> <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hencke, David Leigh and David Pallister</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Neil Hamilton, the disgraced former minister, yesterday walked away in  humiliation from a &#163;10m libel suit against the Guardian over the 'cash for  questions' scandal hours before the case was due to start today. <p> <p>The  former trade minister abandoned the case and agreed to pay some of the Guardian's  costs after a bitter two-year battle. He had recruited 421 Conservative MPs and  peers, including Lady Thatcher, Lord Archer and cabinet members' to change a  300-year-old law, which had prevented him, as an MP, bringing his action. <p>  <p>Ian Greer, the parliamentary lobbyist, also dropped his claim, part of the  same libel suit, just minutes before a legal deadline to do so. He, too, agreed  to pay some of the paper's costs. <p> <p>The Guardian stated on 20 October 1994 that Mr Hamilton had received thousands of pounds for asking  parliamentary questions for Mohamed Al Fayed's Harrods group. Mr Greer, who had  been retained by Mr Al Fayed, was identified as the middleman. <p> <p>Another MP,  Tim Smith, resigned his post as a Northern Ireland minister after he was accused  in the same article of taking undeclared cash. He immediately admitted the  Guardian story was true. Mr Hamilton, MP for Tatton, had instead tried to tough  it out before resigning under pressure from Mr Major. <p> <p>The settlement, on  the eve of what was labelled the libel trial of the century, came after a  dramatic weekend of legal developments. Those began when the Government disclosed  crucial documents to the Guardian. The papers led to Mr Greer and Mr Hamilton  falling out, and a conflict of interest developing. Mr Greer's accounts were also  in the newspaper's possession. employees of Mr Al Fayed. They said Mr Hamilton  and Mr Greer regularly called for envelopes stuffed with &#163;50 notes in return  for parliamentary lobbying. <p> <p>Alan Rusbridger, editor of the  Guardian, said: "The decision by Neil Hamilton and Ian Greer must be one of the  most astonishing legal cave-ins in the history of the law of libel." He  called for the trial papers to be examined by John Major, Sir Gordon Downey, the  Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, and the Inland Revenue. <p> <p>Although  hampered by the law on what evidence it can publish, the Guardian today reveals  the extent of Mr Hamilton's covert links with Mr Greer. It also details the  network of MPs linked to Mr Greer, including Mr Smith, Sir Michael Grylls,  chairman of the backbench trade and industry committee, Sir Peter Hordern, MP for  Horsham, and Sir Andrew Bowden, MP for Brighton Kemptown. <p> <p>It was because  the Guardian had subpoenaed Mr Major and Michael Heseltine to give evidence in  the case that the Government handed over key documents to the newspaper's  lawyers, Geoffrey Robertson, QC, and Geraldine Proudler. It would have been the  first time this century a serving Prime Minister had appeared in the libel  courts. <p> <p>The trial would have re-opened the vexed question of parliamentary  sleaze during the Tory party conference, and only a year after the Government had  made strenuous efforts to bury the issue. It implemented the Nolan Committee  report and appointed a new Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to handle  complaints about MPs. <p> <p>Of the embarrassing climb-down by both men, Mr  Rusbridger said: "Both Hamilton and Greer knew that the evidence the Guardian had  obtained would have blown their action out of the water and revealed a pattern of  parliamentary sleaze more far-reaching than anyone had ever imagined. have  produced damning evidence of Mr Hamilton and Mr Greer's lack of integrity if the  case had proceeded. No doubt that is why they dropped the action. <p> <p>"The  Greer accounts and the government documents tell an outrageous story of  corruption which the public should know but which we are prevented, for legal  reasons, from publishing." <p> <p>Mr Hamilton said he was "devastated" at having  to withdraw. He claimed he was innocent, but because of the conflict of interest  with Mr Greer, each had to instruct new solicitors and counsel. <p> <p>"The  consequence of this is that the trial would have had to have been postponed to  enable new sets of lawyers to go through the huge volume of papers and prepare  the case afresh at enormously increased cost." His costs were already  &#163;150,000, and he did not have the cash to continue. Mr Greer said: "I  would want to continue on a matter of principle, but I have had to take a  sensible commercial decision and I am happy a compromise has been reached." <p>  <p>A spokesman for Mr Al Fayed said: "He was looking forward to telling the court  of his experience of dealing with a number of Conservative MPs who describe  themselves as 'honourable members'. He will be sending his papers on the matter  to Sir Gordon Downey." <p> <p>Downing Street last night insisted that the end of  the libel action was purely a "matter between Mr Hamilton and the Guardian". <p>  <p> <p> <p><b>Questions for cash</b> <p> <p>"Sometimes he [Mr Greer] would ask me  bluntly whether Mr Al Fayed had his money ready." <br>"Mr Hamilton was as  persistent as Mr Greer, if not more so, in asking for his envelope." - Mohamed Al Fayed's ex-personal assistant <p> <p>"I remember on several occasions  that prior to a meeting with Mr Hamilton, Mr Al Fayed would make a remark...that he was coming to collect his money and would prepare an envelope for him  with a bundle of &#163;2,500 [in] notes in my presence.' - Mr Al Fayed's  secretary <p> <p>"On at least two occasions when I was sitting at the front desk,  an envelope was brought down to me from Mr Al Fayed's office and I was informed  that Mr Hamilton would be stopping by to collect the envelope." - Mr Al  Fayed's security man <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Hamilton libel case  against Guardian collapses spectacularly </b><br><br><br><b><h2>2 October  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Hamilton admits: 'I took money'</h2><h3>Disgraced former minister  confesses he took £10,000 and free holidays  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David  Leigh</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Neil Hamilton, the disgraced former trade minister, last night  sensationally admitted for the first time that he took money from parliamentary  lobbyist Ian Greer. <p> <p>Mr Hamilton, MP for Tatton, also conceded he had told  deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine that he did not have a financial  relationship with Mr Greer. <p> <p>But in an extraordinary development last  night, he told the BBC he did not believe that taking the money constituted a  financial relationship. Mr Hamilton changed his story after his one-time friend  Mr Greer, who also dropped a libel action against the Guardian yesterday, had  confirmed earlier that he had twice paid Mr Hamilton for what he described as  "introductions". Mr Hamilton had given the assurance to Mr Heseltine in October  1994 after the Guardian had outlined how he had taken cash from Mr Greer and  Mohamed Al Fayed, owner of Harrods, in return for asking parliamentary questions.  Although conceding he took money from Mr Greer, also named in the Guardian story  two years ago, Mr Hamilton still denied taking the money from Mr Al Fayed. <p>  <p>Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian, said: "This climbdown is the  second astonishing U-turn Mr Hamilton has made in the space of 24 hours. "Most  people would understand this as meaning he has lied to Michael Heseltine. It is  difficult to see how he can stay on as an MP after this." Central to Mr  Hamilton's altered argument is a reliance on the semantics of what he denies is a  "financial relationship". <p> <p>In his statement, Mr Hamilton said: "When the  media were baying for my resignation in 1994, and besieging me whilst on a visit  to a school in my constituency, I had a fraught telephone conversation with the  President of the Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine. "He asked me if I had  a 'financial relationship' with Ian Greer. I responded I had not. It was my view  - then - and now - that the receipt of two payments many years ago did not  constitute 'a financial relationship' which implies some form of continuing  obligation." <p> <p>On BBC TV last night, Mr Hamilton revealed one of the  payments he disclosed last night was for &#163;6,000. The other was for  &#163;4,000. <p> <p>Mr Hamilton refused to answer repeated questions on whether  he had taken other payments in kind, other than a week-long stay at Mr Al Fayed's  Ritz, already revealed by the Guardian. He also admitted last night he had taken  another holiday at Mr Al Fayed's castle in Scotland. <p> <p>In his statement, Mr  Hamilton said: "The commissions placed me under no obligation whatever, either to  Ian Greer or his company. They were wholly unconnected to my position as an MP,  and similar payments are frequently made throughout industry to people in all  walks of life." <p> <p>But evidence in the possession of the Guardian shows that  Mr Hamilton went on to ask parliamentary questions and write letters to ministers  on behalf of the companies he had introduced to Mr Greer for the &#163;6,000 and  &#163;4,000 payments. <p> <p>One of the Greer payments was made in respect of one  of Mr Hamilton's constituents. That meant he was being paid extra for doing his  constituency business. <p> <p>After Mr Hamilton's admissions, the affair  continued to gather momentum. Labour's campaigns spokesman, Brian Wilson, said:  "The allegations are of a devastating order for the Tory party and the idea that  they can suppress them simply by getting rid of this court case will just not be  acceptable to Parliament or indeed the electorate." <p> <p>With Sir Gordon  Downey, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, saying he was ready to  investigate, Mr Heseltine's office was indicating its reluctance to release a key  document which would prove Mr Hamilton had lied. Lord Nolan, who conducted the  original 'sleaze' inquiry which called for a tightening of MPs' standards  following the Guardian's investigations, said: "The continuing accusations and  counter-accusations are damaging the reputation of Parliament." <p> <p>Mr  Hamilton said he would not resign his Tatton seat: "In this country, a man is  innocent until proven guilty, except in the columns of the Guardian." <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tony Blair gives 'Age of  Achievement' speech</b><br><br><br><b><h2>2 October  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Trust me, trust my vows and pledges</h2><h3>From  football to New Jerusalem... three views of Blair's performance  </h2>
 <br>By 
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Catherine Bennett</b><br><br>      <p> <p>In his 1995 conference speech Tony Blair described himself as "my  brother's keeper", adding, with memorable awfulness, "I will not walk by on the  other side". As Blair was not, and is not, a qualified, paid-up parson, his stiff  little sermon was not much appreciated. For this year's appearance, Blair seemed  to be aiming for a looser, more ecumenical feel, more in tune with today's  Godless, but still sentimental, electorate. Instead of his brother's keeper, Blair  now aspires to be his brother's goalkeeper. Instead of being smothered in piety,  we are to be transferred into his 'team', 'Britain United', flattered in a  language, and with a text we can understand: the gospel according to Baddiel and  Skinner. "It's coming home," Blair chanted, remorselessly, "Labour's coming  home." <p> <p>Given the rich possibilities of this sporting metaphor, it was hard  to say whether the absence of the line 'you'll never walk alone' was an act of  commendable forbearance on the part of his speechwriters, or an astonishing  oversight. To Britain's football-haters, the Euro 96 recitation ran the risk of  being as offensive, or bewildering, as last year's homily was to floating  atheists, but on the day that Al Fayed's Harrods Party was revealed, once again,  in all its transcendent squalor, it hardly seemed to matter what Tony Blair  actually said. Whatever it was, he was saying it with fantastic intensity.  Actually, if you listened carefully, he seemed to be saying things that would  choke any traditional Labour supporter - mainly that New Labour would do  everything the Old Tories said they would do but had failed to manage. At times,  simply calling his party New Labour seemed hardly differentiation enough for its  new purpose. Towards the end, Blair said: "The glory days are not over, but the  Tory days are." Secretly, what he'd probably like to lead is the Glory Party. <p>  <p>Nevertheless, for pure performance skills and dramatic impact, Blair's  appearance could hardly be faulted. If Blair continues to develop like this, he  really should have a better setting next year (Albert Speer may have passed on,  but Leni Riefenstahl is alive, and probably still available). From the taut,  presidential salutes on podium-arrival, to the perfectly coordinated  head-swivelling, to the active, darting right hand - now an imploring little  claw, now a sweeping new broom, now a stabbing finger, now a fist clenched in  victory - it is time this fine actor received the director his style so richly  deserves. The trio of facial expressions and matching tones of voice - fierce  intent, broad good humour, throat-constricted contemplation - were no less  well-deployed. There were ruthlessly sentimental references to his Dad's stroke,  to an inspirational Christmas card from a 76-year-old pensioner, and to a red  ribbon given him at Sam McClusky's funeral, with the message, 'in your souls you  want the same thing'. <p> <p>The text of the speech, was also, in its way, a work  of art - considered more as a musical score, at least, than as a logical  argument. We began in the Age of Achievement. There was a Philip Glass style  repetition of the word 'new'. It's an adjective that can favourably be paired  with practically any noun apart from the word antique - new challenges, new  ideas, new world, new millennium. If a wizard could suddenly deprive Blair of it,  he'd look like a vehement goldfish. There was no end of strange talk about "1,000  days to prepare for the next 1,000 years", measurements of time previously  favoured by the Book of Revelations, millenarian lunatics and the Nazi Party -  "1,000 days! Yes! To prepare for 1,000 years!". A half-threatening,  half-invigorating, apocalyptic flavour crept into his pronouncements; you  expected at any moment to hear the hoofbeats of the four horsemen. So,  apparently, did Blair, since he talked ambitiously of our forthcoming "moment of  destiny", of "not just turning a page in history but writing a new book". A new  Book of Revelations? The Age of Apocalypse and Achievement alternated with  favourite phrases picked from the last year, from Labour's "new vision", to its  "radical mission", to "Britain United", and a promising new coinage, "The Decent  Society". In the closing phases of his speech, Blair seemed to be improvising a  national anthem for the new millennium, speaking entirely in exclamation marks:  "Britain comes alive... take on the world and win... heritage of hope...  call our nation to its destiny" What would that sound like translated into  German? <p> <p>"Imagine it," Blair kept inviting us. But imagine what? Have we  missed something? How do you imagine a whole, new decent society without some  help with specifics? There were few pointers, apart from the now-familiar "firm  pledges" from New Labour, New Life for Britain, and some well-aired policies  plucked from last year's speech. Only the proposed ban on hand-guns and remedial  summer schools were added to our somewhat short list of firm expectations. <p>  <p>The aim, apparently, was for us to trust Blair on everything else, from the  improved treatment of old people, to firmer handling of criminals, to the Age of  Achievement in general. To win that trust, Blair made his nine vows, to this, his  country. But by now, his variously-styled assurances were becoming confusing. Is  a vow the same as a firm pledge? Is it more, or less binding than a promise or a  performance contract? Does it really differ from a mission? And what's the  punishment for not fulfilling a vow? If it's not being re-elected next time  round, well, we already knew that. In fact, anyone who has read his speeches, or  his interviews, or his draft manifesto, would have been familiar with virtually  every practical aspect of the programme Blair presented yesterday. What was truly  new here was his demeanour. Who, in his heart, does Blair now believe himself to  be? Twice, he talked of his "covenant with the British people", most famously  used by a certain old party laying down the law for the people of Judah. It  sounds odd enough, interpreted in purely secular terms. But Blair, we know, and  saw yesterday, is not a secular man. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400  border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael  White</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Tony Blair yesterday delivered an evangelical appeal to the Labour Party  and the country to give him a 1,000-day opportunity - from election day to the  millennium - in which to start creating a new "Age of Achievement" for Britain.  <p> <p>The fervour of the Labour leader's commitment to a radical reform  programme - complete with 10 vows, a clutch of policy initiatives and the Euro  96 slogan 'Labour's Coming Home' - won over even leftwing critics in Blackpool's  Winter Gardens. <p> <p>But it prompted a savaging, unprecedented in its detail,  from ministers determined to neutralise Mr Blair's appeal to wavering voters to  "have the courage" to vote for a party which had revitalised itself - and could  do the same for the country. <p> <p>In addition to the 10-vow "performance  contract for Britain", to be completed within five years, Mr Blair said a Labour  government would ban private ownership and possession of handguns - whatever Lord  Cullen's Dunblane report proposes. <p> <p>One symbolic pledge promised to fight  for completion of the European Union's single market by mid-1998. Another  promised expansion of Mr Blair's idea last year for getting all schools and  colleges on the information superhighway - on which Labour is talking to BT. <p>  <p>The startling plea for national consensus - "We're on the same side, we're in  the same team" - reached its peak when Mr Blair invoked defectors from the Tory  camp. "I write back and say welcome... I don't care where you're coming from.  It's where your country's going that matters," he insisted. Time and again he  denounced a sleaze-encumbered government. "Has there ever been a government in  our history that has put itself before the British people with less to merit its  re-election? Just mouth the words 'five more Tory years' and feel your senses and  reason repulsed," he said. Constantly invoking the notion that - as in 1945 and  1964 - New Labour had caught the national mood, Mr Blair strove to outdo John  Major's conference speeches in evocation of patriotic images even as he hammered  away at his central theme: that words such as freedom, aspiration and ambition  had really been Labour words all along. <p> <p>With the election expected on 1  May 1997 - 1,000 days before the new millennium, "1,000 days to prepare for 1,000  years" Mr Blair pointed out - his audience was never going to be other than  enthusiastic. <p> <p>At one point he said: "I will not make pledges on money  until I know they can be kept." But the Labour leader managed to balance tough  passages on taxes and public spending - supervised by his 'Iron Chancellor' - as  well as a studied "fairness not favours" nod to the unions with sufficient  idealism to inspire his rank and file. <p> <p>In a significant gesture to  traditionalist feelings - "old members who stuck with it through thick and thin"  - he argued that Labour belonged to a movement wider than democratic socialism or  social democracy. "It stands in a tradition whose flame was alive in human hearts  long before the Labour Party was thought of, a tradition far above ideology, but  not beyond ideals." <p> <p>Michael Heseltine, the Deputy Prime Minister, led an  orchestrated denunciation of the 10-vow performance contract as "a con-trick, not  a contract". Other ministers attacked Labour's plans to redistribute Lottery  money and extend school computer networks to create 'a national grid for  learning'. Tory officials also claimed there were 20 spending pledges in the  speech. <p> <p>But with leftwingers calling the speech "almost flawless", an  ebullient Labour leadership took ministerial abuse as a tribute, not a threat.  <p> <p><b>I vow to thee...</b> Blair's 10 promises to conference <p> <p>I vow  we will have increased the proportion of our national income we spend on  education <br>I vow we will have reduced the proportion we spend on the  welfare bills of social failure <br>I vow we will have reduced the spending on  NHS bureaucracy and increased it on patient care <br>I vow we will have cut  the number of long-term unemployed and cut by over a half the number of young  people unemployed <br>I vow we will halve the time it takes young offenders to  get to court <br>I vow we will keep Government borrowing and inflation within our  targets <br>I vow the promises we make on tax, we will keep <br>I vow class sizes  will be down in primary schools, and standards up <br>I vow that with the consent of  the people we will have devolved power to Scotland, Wales and the regions of  England <br>I vow we will build a new relationship in Europe <p> <p> <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Jonathan Steele</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The rope is still there, trailing limply from a traffic post. Bloodstains disfigure the kerbstones beneath it. But the body of Mohammed Najibullah, Afghanistan's former president, has been cut down, handed over to the leaders of his tribe, and buried.  <p>  <p>As if to wipe away a little more of the shock of his execution, which was widely condemned around the world, the victorious Taliban movement sought yesterday to present a more moderate face.  <p>  <p>"We won't export fundamentalism. We won't support terrorism and we want good relations with all countries in the world," Sher Mohammed Stanakzai told a press conference. Described as deputy foreign minister in a government which has yet to be named, Mr Stanakzai is a 37-year-old graduate of Kabul University who became a field commander in the resistance to Soviet occupation in the 1980s. With electricity supplies restored and the first commercial flight arriving yesterday at the reopened international airport, he promised foreign relief agencies that they were welcome to stay, and said the city was back to normal.  <p>  <p>He also appeared to soften Taliban's harsh line on women, which has sent tremors of worry through Kabul, particularly among the estimated 30,000 war widows who are their families' only breadwinners.  <p>  <p>At the weekend they were told they had to stay at home. But Mr Stanakzai said: "We're drawing up regulations under which women will be able to work and girls will go to school." He did not say when the rules would be ready. He extended an olive branch to General Abdul Rashid Dostam, the army commander in northern Afghanistan who supported the previous government and has not yet stated his intentions. His forces now face Taliban at the Salang tunnel, the main gateway to the north.  <p>  <p>"Dostam has always been positive about us," Mr Stanakzai said. The general is seen as the only possible serious resistance to Taliban now that Commander Ahmed Shah Massoud, the defence minister in the overthrown government, has retreated to his traditional base in the Panjsher Valley. The other leaders of the old government, President Burhanuddin Rabbani and the prime minister, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, are reported to be in Kunduz, near the Tajikistan border.  <p>  <p>"We have decided to remove Massoud from the Panjsher," Mr Stanakzai said - a phrase noticeably different from his attitude towards Gen Dostam. He seemed to want to place distance between the Taliban leadership and the killing of Najibullah, the last Soviet-backed president, who lived under United Nations protection in a safe house in Kabul until last week. Taliban's six-man council was in the southern city of Kandahar at the time, he said.  <p>  <p>But he justified the killing on the grounds that Najibullah had "hanged many of our people". He said: "Under his leadership our country was destroyed. It was the anger of our people which killed him." Lynching was not part of Taliban policy, he added. Culprits would be brought before a court.  <p>  <p>Laurent Hamida of Reuters adds from the Panjsher Valley: Ethnic Tajik fighters supporting Cmdr Massoud were furiously at work yesterday preparing the defence of their Panjsher Valley against an expected Taliban attack. Throughout the 1980s Cmdr Massoud's men repulsed repeated Soviet attempts to capture the long valley, where green patches surrounding villages are separated by narrow rocky defiles.  <p>  <p>Aides at Cmdr Massoud's headquarters, whose location they asked not to be disclosed, said they were talking to Gen Dostam about an alliance against Taliban. They declined to say how far the talks had gone or give any further details.  <p>  <p>They said their retreat from Kabul had been rapid because former allies had turned against Cmdr Massoud and had been forced to fight their way north. Cmdr Massoud's men had been prepared to make a stand at Charikar, about 40 miles north of Kabul, but were attacked from behind before the Taliban forces arrived, the aides said.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mandy Allwood loses all eight babies</b><br><br><br><b><h2>4 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Who should be in charge of a woman's fertility?</h2><h3>Should the present authority be strengthened - or should it be aborted?   </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Linda Grant</b><br><br>      <p> <p>This week the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority told a woman that she could not use one of her late husband's  frozen sperm to give birth to a posthumous child on the grounds that he was no longer in this world to give his written  permission. Having delivered what most people considered a callous and pedantic judgment, the HFEA had nothing at all to say on  the subject of Mandy Allwood, who, despite her unconventional circumstances, had received fertility treatment, ignored her  doctor's advice on how to avoid a multiple pregnancy, conceived octuplets, refused to have a selective abortion and finally  lost all the foetuses. The authority had, it said, no remit to address fertility treatment administered by drugs. Is there,  then, something the matter with its remit? What do we have such a set-up for if it cannot adjudicate in as messy a case as this  one while stomping all over someone else's self-evident rights? <p> <p>The HFEA has now been in existence for five years, and  it is time to ask if it is doing any good or whether its powers should be strengthened. Britain is the only country in the  world to have set up a regulatory body to address the complex issues raised by technological intervention into fertility. To  some this is a necessary policing measure; for others the latest tiresome example of the nanny state poking its nose into  activities that really are none of its business. The former view is likely to be held by those who believe that the feckless,  unmarried poor should be given no help to start families they cannot properly support or parent. The latter group will believe  that the natural-born right of every woman to have a baby by any means is enshrined deep in biological urges, not some kind of  legal charter dreamed up in Whitehall. <p> <p>The HFEA's current brief is surprisingly limited. It has to license and monitor  clinics, provide advice and information to patients and donors, make sure that embryos used for research are treated with  'respect', and keep a register of information about donors so that children born from fertility treatments as a result of a  donated sperm or egg can find out about their genetic history. In addition, last year the HFEA did what science almost never  does, what it did not do in 1978 when the world's first 'test-tube' baby was born: stop for a moment to consider the  consequences. It conducted a mammoth consultation on what came to be known as the 'yuck' factor and found that most people were  intellectually ill-equipped to cope with the technological developments that await us. In effect, it delivered a verdict on its  own powers: that they were not strong enough. That experts were needed to guide us through the ethical forest that lay in wait.  This settles uncomfortably on the minds of those who 25 years ago marched through the streets of London demanding reproductive  rights. "Not the Church, not the State, women shall decide their fate," we chanted. "Free abortion on demand; a woman's right  to choose." <p> <p>A quarter of a century ago it was that simple. Limiting one's family (or when one started it) by birth  control and abortion was about all that one could demand; and what the hell did it have to do with anyone else? Now we find  that the womb has become public property again, at the centre of a bewildered attempt to resolve vast moral and ontological  questions. When does life begin? Whose life is it anyway? Who defines fertility, the body, or how we manipulate it with drugs?  Is the menopause an impassable barrier for our power to reproduce? How do we define the term 'mother' when it may be  practically possible to harvest eggs from the wombs of entities that were never actually born? <p> <p>The old slogans never  envisaged such dilemmas. To be honest, those who shouted them, in their confident teens and twenties, never bothered at all about  the rights of those who wanted children, only those who did not. They did not think of the 59-year-old British woman who wants  to have a baby and has to go abroad to get the treatment to do so. To most people it is common sense that women of this age  should not bear a child, because we believe that mothers should be around long enough to see their offspring into adulthood.  <p> <p>But should there be a law against it? Mandy Allwood was demonstrably unwise to have refused a selective abortion. She  was warned that the womb could not carry so many foetuses; whether out of sentiment or greed, she proceeded with the pregnancy  and lost all eight. Should the HFEA have forced her to have had a termination? The only word to describe countries that have  laws to make women have abortions is fascist. <p> <p>So should the HFEA have allowed Mandy to have fertility treatment at all?  Over the past few weeks she has cut a particularly unattractive figure. Supposing all eight babies could have been born? What  kind of a mother would she have made? On Newsnight earlier this week, even Dr Wendy Savage fudged her answer when the question  was directly posed. It was not her medical discipline, she said. A doctor may well turn down a request for a particular form of  treatment on the grounds, for example, of personal conscience. But should a legal authority be established to deny the Mandy  Allwoods of this world their fertility drugs on the grounds of their unsuitability for parenting? And if it were, would this  not come dangerously close to eugenics? <p> <p>Throughout the second half of this century the state has reluctantly, though  progressively, pulled back from its control over the bodies of its citizens - not just women's but those of gay men, most  recently in its lowering of the age of consent for homosexuality. Giving the HFEA more statutory power would be to reverse that  trend. In 1994 600,000 women gave birth; only 3,477 conceptions resulted from in vitro fertilisation. Of those only a handful  would not fulfil what most of us would agree to be the criteria of 'deserving cases'. Mandy Allwood, who abused and cheated the  system, is thought to be a one-off. Further empowering the HFEA would create very big laws for very small numbers of Mandy  Allwoods and geriatric wannabe mothers. So what should the HFEA do? Today Naomi Pfeffer, a medical historian at North London  University and author of 'The Stork and the Syringe' (Polity, 1993), will address a Royal Society of Medicine Conference on IVF  and denounce the authority. "Women are completely invisible," she says. "There is no sense that the HFEA is concerned about the  people who are receiving this treatment." And as she points out, it is infertile women who pay for the HFEA, for two-thirds of  its funding is creamed off the fees they give to the clinics. <p> <p>Its register of clinics is, she says, completely useless.  It does not tell the infertile woman if it provides the service she needs. It monitors complaints but fails to inform whether  the problem was dingy surroundings or being sexually assaulted by the doctor. Its collection of statistics, unlike those  gathered by the OPCS on abortion, gives no picture of who is receiving treatment, how old they are, what part of the country  they live in, whether they were covered by the NHS or went privately. In other words, in feeling that we should create stronger  laws over the bodies of women in case they make decisions we don't approve of, we don't even know what decisions they are  making and why. <p> <p>In the old days, what the HFEA does would have been handled by the Department of Health instead of this  quango, which has been given the power to decide questions with one consultative document which the combined forces of the  world's departments of philosophy have failed to resolve these 2,000 years. Perhaps we are not asking too little of the HFEA,  but too much - and too little of ourselves in surrendering control over the most personal of dilemmas to the state. <p> <p> <p>  <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right  valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Fred and Rosemary West's house demolished to deter souvenir hunters </b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Wests' house of horrors to bite the dust  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Duncan Campbell</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The most notorious house in Britain is to be obliterated. On Monday morning, builders will begin a two-week operation to destroy the last remnants of 25 Cromwell Street in Gloucester, where Fred and Rosemary West buried their victims.  <p>  <p>As the dust settles, a company will start interviewing relatives of the Wests' victims and Cromwell Street neighbours about what should happen to the site. One suggestion is that it should become a memorial garden. But last night Caroline Owens, one of the victims of the Wests to escape with her life, said that she was strongly opposed to any kind of memorial at the site.  <p>  <p>"I'd like to see it knocked down so that no sign of it is left at all," said Ms Owens, who in 1972 was attacked and raped by the Wests, for whom she had worked briefly as a nanny. Her evidence was a key factor in the conviction of Mrs West for 10 murders at her trial in Winchester crown court last year. "I don't think a memorial garden is a good idea, as I don't think people would respect it," said Ms Owens, of Cinderford, Gloucestershire, who recently married.  <p>  <p>She added that she felt a plaque or memorial stone in Gloucester Cathedral would be more appropriate: "Somewhere peaceful, a nicer place to remember the girls."  <p>  <p>A spokesman for Gloucester city council said yesterday that the council had paid the West estate &#163;40,000 to purchase the house. As yet no decision had been made as to what would be done with the empty site, he said. One possibility is a car park. Neighbours complain that sightseers still arrive in the street, looking for signs of the Wests. After the Wests were arrested, local criminals organised torch-lit tours of the house for up to &#163;500.  <p>  <p>The sign '25 Cromwell Street', which many newspapers used as a logo for the story, is now the subject of a legal argument between members of the West family, some of whom have laid claim to it.  <p>  <p>It was removed by Gloucester police within days of the arrests, because it was feared that a trophy-hunter would take it, and is still held by police. Police were guarding the house last night in case of fresh bounty-seekers. The decision to buy and demolish was supported by all 34 members of the city council. The council leader, Jon Holmes, said: "It is important to erase the physical reminder of these events."  <p>  <p>Councillor Roger Welshman, who has represented the Cromwell Street area for 10 years, said: "It will take some time for the scars to heal." The &#163;40,000 from the sale of the house will go through the Official Solicitor to the West estate, which benefits the surviving children. The four youngest are still in foster homes on the south coast.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Fred and Rosemary West's house demolished to deter souvenir hunters </b><br><br><br><b><h2>8 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The house of horror vanishes  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alex Bellos</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>They were among the first visitors to 25 Cromwell Street when the details of its gruesome past were first becoming known. Yesterday Teresa Perkins and Jane Smith went back for the last time to watch the beginning of the end for this most notorious address in recent British history.  <p>  <p>Mrs Perkins, aged 31, from Evesham, who admits to being obsessed with the house's former occupant, said: "It's part of (Fred West) coming down. He's going and that's that."  <p>  <p>The two women looked on as workmen put up a scaffold at the end-of-terrace house in the centre of Gloucester where Fred and Rose tortured and killed many of their victims.  "It's not bloody fair - they're up there getting a good view and we get nothing," remarked Miss Smith, aged 26, clasping an Instamatic camera. "Do you reckon that copper will let us go and have a look?"  <p>  <p>Attention turned yesterday to what will happen to the site once the bricks, rubble and masonry are ground to dust, the timbers are burned, the few remaining fittings are thrown into a furnace and a concrete cap is laid on top of the site.  <p>  <p>Gloucester city council announced a two-stage consultation exercise, costing &#163;15,000, which will seek the views, first of the relatives of the victims - including some of the West family - and then of the people who live in the area.  <p>  <p>It is even possible that Rosemary West may have a say. Council spokesman Mike McCabe said: "We have made it very clear that everyone within the city has a right to put their views forward. We will not be contacting Rosemary West, but if we receive any opinions via her solicitor then they will be looked at along with everything else that is put forward in this consultation process."  <p>  <p>Few people watching the first day of demolition work felt any ghoulish attachment to the three-storey Edwardian building, the so-called House of Horrors. Many residents feel their lives cannot return to normal until the last brick is removed.  <p>  <p>Michelle Sherwood, who grew up opposite number 25 and whose family knew the Wests well, was back to nurse her mother through this week's media coverage. "My mum's still affected by the whole thing. She has started getting visions again. She's on some kind of tablets. Only when all this is over will she get better."  <p>  <p>Two of the Wests' children visited the house yesterday. Stephen, aged 23, put a bouquet of flowers by the gate of the house for his sister Heather, who died there.  <p>  <p>He later told a radio station: "I think there should be some kind of memorial - a few flowers and pots and park benches, somewhere where me and other relatives can go and sit and think about our lost loved ones. Let's face it, that's where they were buried first and that's where they died." Anne-Marie Davis, Fred's daughter by his first wife, also visited the scene of her torture.  "I felt that I needed to visit the house for one last time to lay it to rest," she said.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>Addresses with a past</b>  <p>  <p>10 Rillington Place, west London: In 1952 the necrophile John Christie killed six women there. The street was renamed Rushton Mews before it was demolished.  <p>  <p>23 Cranley Gardens and 195 Melrose Avenue, north London: Dennis Nilsen murdered and dismembered 15 men at these addresses. Sold cheaply, renovated and turned into flats.  <p>  <p>2 Dalton Square, Lancaster: The site where, in 1935, Dr Buck Ruxton murdered his wife and maid in a jealous rage before dismembering them in the bath. Lay empty for 40 years, now HQ of the town's planning department.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Fred and Rosemary West's  house demolished to deter souvenir hunters </b><br><br><br><b><h2>12 October  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Ghouls' paradise</h2><h3>The Wests' house was razed this week to  thwart souvenir grabbers  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Duncan Campbell</b><br><br>      <p> <p>During the trial of Rosemary West at Winchester almost exactly a year ago,  the jury indicated that they would like to visit number 25 Cromwell Street, where  many of the bodies had been buried and where many of the murders may have taken  place. The judge agreed that the media were entitled to attend, too, but, because  there were 60 or 70 journalists present on average every day, it would clearly be  impossible for all to visit. We put our names in a metaphorical hat and a  representative of the Lord Chancellor's Department carried out the draw in the  sweaty and over-crowded press room that was our home for eight weeks. The Guardian 'won' the ballot for the national press.<p> <p>The following day we boarded a  bus for the trip to Gloucester, driving behind the jury, whose progress was being  filmed from a helicopter above. In the back garden of 25 Cromwell Street, we  donned our hardhats and trooped silently round the building. How tiny the rooms  were, how grim the cellar, how tacky the decorations. The agreement was that we  could not talk or take photographs. We were not allowed to pause as we walked  through, anyone dallying to make a note being nudged on by a police officer. It  became like Kim's Game: how much could you remember, what was the right number of  steps to the first floor, was the mural in the room with the bar of a Hawaiian or  Caribbean scene, were the walls cream or white? We wrote our pooled accounts and  rejoined our colleagues. <p> <p>This week, the workmen moved in to demolish the  house. Each brick will be ground to dust, all trace of the place wiped out.  Within weeks of the Wests being arrested and the house boarded up, local  criminals were offering journalists night-time tours of the house for &#163;500.  There will be no more such tours. <p> <p>Was I pleased that I had won the ballot  and been on the tour? I was. So why am I also pleased that the building is being  knocked down and that no one else will be able to walk through its rooms? <p>  <p>The reason for the destruction is simple: the neighbours are weary of the  tourists who come to take photos of themselves at the House of Horror, there are  fears that they will start picking pieces off as souvenirs, and there is a desire  in Gloucester to consign the house and the murders to history. Now there is to be  a survey of neighbours and the victims of the murdered women and girls to see  what should happen to the site. Some would like a park, some a simple memorial  stone, and some say wipe it out for ever. Behind all the coverage of the  demolition was the unspoken - and sometimes spoken - thought: who are these  ghouls who gawp at the house, who seek souvenirs from the rubble? Why are we so  fascinated by the evil deeds of others? Does it say something dark about us? <p>  <p>The former Chief Rabbi, Lord Jakobovits, wrote in the Daily Express this week  about Cromwell Street that "to take 'souvenirs', even to think of hoarding some  piece of rubble, is nothing less than a sacrilege... Every part of the charnel  house should be ground into nothingness." He quoted the Book of Deuteronomy on  what should be done to a city when the inhabitants have abandoned God to worship  idols: "And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street  thereof and shall burn with fire the city and all the spoil thereof every whit  for the Lord thy God: and it shall be a heap for ever, it shall not be built  again." <p> <p>Again, very understandable; and certainly Caroline Owens, one of  the Wests' victims who survived, is quite clear that there should be no trace  left of the building, except perhaps a simple memorial for the women - in  Gloucester Cathedral, away from the Instamatics and the gawps. <p> <p>We have an  ambivalent attitude towards the scenes of atrocities. As Lord Jakobovits noted,  we need to preserve the concentration camps to remind ourselves of the horrors we  can inflict upon each other. We visit battlefields where thousands were  slaughtered. The places where tortures and executions took place in London are  now on sight-seeing tours. Are there some horrors which should be recalled as a  tribute to the victims and a warning to resist their attackers, while other  atrocities should be landscaped from our memory? Can some people learn from being  in the presence of an evil site, while others are being merely voyeuristic? Is  one person's interest in crime an intellectual concern, while another's is  macabre tastlessness? Is a crime reporter, a detective, a lawyer merely doing  their job when they explore the dark side of life, while a member of the public  seeking the same access is a sick ghoul? <p> <p>I ask because I find the people  shuffling round 25 Cromwell Street as creepy as anyone else does, but I know that  many people who would never dream of making such a trip are just as curious about  the Wests. <p> <p>At Murder One, the bookshop in Charing Cross Road, London,  which sells books of crime and mystery, there is a box set of 'Great Crimes Shock  Cards' for sale. On one side of the card is a description of the crime, on  another the picture of its perpetrator or, occasionally, its victim. A sort of  Unhappy Families. Thirty-six cards are available in the set: Charles Manson, the  Boston Strangler, Leopold and Loeb, the Great Train Robbery, Butch Cassidy, the  St Valentine's Day Massacre, and so on. Each one of those crimes mentioned has  been the subject of a film. <p> <p>Now if we were to hear that some  undistinguished director was about to embark on the film of the Wests, what would  our reaction be? Distaste, probably. The events are still too clear in the minds  of the relatives and friends of the victims. What would the point of the film be  if not to appeal to the sightseers of Cromwell Street? <p> <p>Yet there are five  books already available about the case and a sixth, at least, to follow. There  have been questions about the morality of Fred West's own statements being  marketed, but there is no real suggestion that the books should not have been  written. It is as if there is a notion that it is acceptable to read about crime  in a book but not to watch the crime reconstructed in a film. Just because  reading is a more 'worthy' pursuit than sitting in the back stalls, should only  readers be allowed to indulge their interest in crime? <p> <p>The case of Leopold  and Loeb shocked America. These were two young men who had cold-bloodedly killed  a schoolboy because they believed they were clever enough to carry out the  perfect crime. The film about the case, 'Compulsion', starring Charles Laughton as  Clarence Darrow, the lawyer who saved the two young murderers from the death  penalty, was made when people concerned in the crime were still alive. But the  film is generally acclaimed as a sensitive and valuable work both about the death  penalty and about the strange depravity of the young men. <p> <p>Just as I am  pleased at the destruction of 25 Cromwell Street, I would be strongly opposed to  the idea of a feature film of the Wests. The relatives have had enough without  posters everywhere of films about the notorious perpetrators. But where is the  sliding scale of rationality here? Are some crimes fair game for a film, while  others are beyond bounds? Can the relatives of Jack 'The Hat' McVitie or George  Cornell be safely ignored when a film on the Krays is made? <p> <p>Our unease at  the ghouls of Gloucester is an unease at ourselves. They are expressing a gauche  and insensitive curiosity, but many people feel a curiosity about the  perpetrators of crime. I would not do the job I do if I did not feel that  curiosity. Is my curiosity - and that of crime authors, criminologists, criminal  lawyers, detectives, and all who read about crime - more noble? <p> <p>The day 25  Cromwell Street was destroyed was also the day of the Princess Diana video hoax.  It was just the latest sneaked shot or hidden tape of someone designated as a  justifiable target. I have heard the same people who find interest in the West  case ghoulish and highly suspect suggest that people like Princess Diana, the  Duchess of York and Paula Yates deserve all they get because they chose the  limelight. <p> <p>We are encouraged to turn away from the sightseers of Cromwell  Street with revulsion, yet condone the peep-shows and spying and bugging of  people who have never done us any harm. People who peeped through bedroom windows  used to end up in front of the magistrates and were seen as pathetic figures. Now  we are being encouraged to emulate them at the same time that we are encouraged  to see the souvenir-hunters of Cromwell Street as distasteful and degenerate. <p>  <p>It is a pity that demolition workers cannot take the wrecker's ball to  hypocrisy. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Seumas Milne</b><br><br>      <p> <p>The introduction of the job seeker's allowance, which today replaces  unemployment benefit and income support for the unemployed, marks the biggest  change to the dole system since 1948 and will deliver sharp cuts in benefits to  hundreds of thousands of claimants. <p> <p>The key change is the halving of  entitlement to unemployment benefit - paid regardless of savings or partner's  income - from 12 to six months. From today, everyone who signed on as unemployed  at the beginning of April and is still out of work will be switched to a  means-tested benefit. That is to be known as 'income-based JSA', instead of  income support. An estimated 250,000 claimants, with savings of over &#163;3,000  or a working partner, will now lose all or some of their dole money after six  months. The halving of the period of entitlement - a reversion to the pre-war  arrangements - is only one of a panoply of dole cuts and penalties introduced as  part of the JSA, a legacy of Michael Portillo's period as Employment Secretary.  Together they represent a rapid acceleration to a compulsory workfare system. <p>  <p>The Government presents the JSA as an attempt to streamline unemployment  benefits and their delivery at JobCentres and a way of securing "better value for  the taxpayer by more effective targeting of resources". Labour and the Liberal  Democrats have denounced the JSA as a "savage increase in means-testing", but  only the Lib Dems are now committed to abolishing it. Chris Smith, as Labour's  social security spokesman, fought unsuccessfully to keep the commitment to  restore a 12-month unemployment benefit and Labour says it will now only "review"  the JSA. <p> <p>The bureaucratic upheaval caused by the JSA has cost the  Government at least &#163;320m and led to a series of strikes by Employment  Service workers over lack of physical protection. It is eventually  expected to save &#163;240m a year. <p> <p><b>Among other changes introduced as part  of the JSA</b> <p> <p>Around 45,000 18-24-year-olds currently able to claim  contributory unemployment benefit will have their dole cut even during their  first six months out of work. <p> <p>Unlike unemployment benefit, the new  replacement 'contribution-based' JSA will not be uprated with inflation and  claimants with adult dependents will no longer be entitled to the current  supplement, worth up to &#163;70 a week. <p> <p>A quarter of a million people,  currently claiming invalidity benefit, will have to claim JSA because they are  not disabled enough to qualify for the new incapacity benefit. There are fears  many will fail the JSA's toughened 'availability for work' test. <p>  <p>Underlying all the benefit cuts are a range of new powers to compel the  unemployed to take low-paid work or join government schemes. <p> <p><b>The changes</b>  <p> <p>The job seeker's allowance: <p> <p>Replaces unemployment benefit and  income support <br>Halves non-means tested, contributory benefit from 12 to  six months <br>Cuts contributory benefit for 18-24-year-olds by 20 per cent <br>Slashes  contributory benefit for those with non-working partners<br>Introduces powers to  make claimants take low-paid jobs <br>Reduces the hours the long-term  unemployed can study from 21 to 16 a week<br>Ends the link between unemployment  benefit and inflation <br>Brings 250,000 disabled people under 'availability  for work' tests<br>Cuts availability of hardship payments <br>Reduces benefit for  childless couples <br>Lengthens time before dole payments are made <p> <p> <p>  <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Lisburn bombing brings  war back to Northern Ireland</b><br><br><br><b><h2>8 October  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Bombs shatter Ulster truce</h2><h3>Security measures questioned  after car bombs inside army HQ injure 31</h2>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Two large car bombs detonated inside the army's headquarters in Northern  Ireland yesterday, injuring 31 people. The blasts pointed to a full return to  violence in the province, and a massive republican propaganda success on the eve  of the Conservative Party conference. <p> <p>The bombs - assumed to be the work  of the IRA - exploded within 15 minutes of each other in Thiepval barracks at  Lisburn, a largely Protestant town eight miles south of Belfast. <p> <p>Of the 31  injured, 20 were soldiers and 10 were civilian workers employed at the base. An  eight-year-old girl was also injured. Last night the three most seriously  injured, all civilians, were in intensive care at Belfast's Royal Victoria  hospital. <p> <p>Questions were being asked last night about a hugely  embarrassing security breach for the army. An army spokesman said: "There were  two vehicle-borne explosions within Thiepval barracks. The first was in a car  park close to the administration building manned mainly by civilian staff. The  second appears to have been designed to catch casualties being taken to the  medical centre which was badly damaged." <p> <p>The bombs, with an estimated 250  to 500 kilos of explosives, were driven through the main entrance. <p> <p>A  nearby hospital neurone unit which looks after severely disabled adults was  caught up in the blast. A distraught nurse who ran the short distance from the  hospital to offer help said: "They are all terrified and they're sitting among  all the broken glass. What did those bastards think they could achieve by doing  this?" <p> <p>The blasts were clearly heard at the Maze prison three miles away,  where loyalist leaders met UDA and UFF prisoners. They have withdrawn their  support for the peace process and their UVF counterparts were expected to follow  suit, although according to senior sources this did not necessarily mean an  immediate end to the loyalist ceasefire. <p> <p>But a senior figure said last  night that the first attack by republicans on a military target in Northern  Ireland in more than two years would inevitably provoke retaliation. "IRA or  whoever, it would be fantasy to think that loyalists could or would be prepared  to sit idly by," the source said. <p> <p>The Prime Minister condemned the bombing  as "wicked beyond belief" and "barbaric". The action in planting two bombs was  "unspeakable... it is clearly a very serious development". Mr Major said it  was not yet known who was responsible for the attack, but added: "If it was  Provisional IRA, then clearly it is a very serious development indeed. If  anybody thinks, whether it is a splinter group or the Provisional IRA, that they  can bomb the British government out of the policy stance they think is right for  Northern Ireland they are making a very serious and fundamental mistake." <p>  <p>Labour leader Tony Blair described the bomb attack as "an act of appalling  unprovoked terrorism", and Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said it was "a  very grave day for Northern Ireland and the peace process". David Trimble, leader  of the Ulster Unionists, appealed to loyalist paramilitaries "not to join the IRA  in their wickedness" saying that they had occupied the moral high ground by  maintaining their own ceasefire. He asked of the Prime Minister: "How much more  evidence do you need that the IRA ceasefire is over, and how long will it be  before there's an adequate security response?" Republicans are likely to view the  strike as a show of defiance after the security forces' recent successes against  the IRA on the mainland. <p> <p>Two weeks ago, the Metropolitan Police arrested  five IRA suspects and shot dead one man in dawn raids in west London and West  Sussex. Police also recovered a massive haul of arms - including 10 tonnes of  homemade explosives - which they said would probably have been used within days  in massive lorry bomb attacks on the capital. <p> <p><p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Lisburn bombing brings  war back to Northern Ireland</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 October  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Exploding the peace</h2><h3>Is there an  alternative to the slide back to war?  </h2>
<br><b>Leading article</b><br><br><br>      <p>Every bombing in Northern Ireland is a political act and the Lisburn barracks  car bombs on Monday night were more than usually calculated acts of violence. The  timing, on the eve of the Conservative Party conference, was too precise to be  misunderstood. The placement, especially given the security system around  Lisburn, of two 800lb bombs timed to explode within 15 minutes of one another and  designed to cause maximum carnage in the confusion, was never likely to be a  stunt by a breakaway group of dissatisfied republicans. <p> <p>And so it proved  last night when the IRA finally laid claim to the attack, saying that the target  was soldiers and "regretting" injuries to civilians. It is partly designed as a  provocation to loyalist paramilitaries to abandon their increasingly precarious  ceasefire. The Lisburn explosions took place literally within earshot of a  meeting at the Maze between loyalist prisoners and their political allies. All  voices have rightly urged the loyalists not to respond, but there can be little  doubt that this is becoming an increasingly vain exercise. <p> <p>This was by far  the most important act of violence to have taken place in Northern Ireland since  at least 1994. It marks, on a large scale, the resumption of lethal assaults on  the Army. It means that all Army and police activity in Northern Ireland - and  possibly elsewhere - must now proceed on the basis that the IRA will kill  soldiers and police officers if they can. It is a return to the operational  methods of the Eighties. It is a profoundly retrogressive step, and no one should  delude themselves that any aspect of the Northern Ireland situation will now be  anything except more difficult than it was before. <p> <p>Some republicans may  still believe that such bombings will have the perverse effect of forcing the  British government to bring Sinn Fein into the Northern Ireland talks process. If  so, they are doomed to disappointment. Even in the unlikely event that the IRA  now promptly announces a fresh ceasefire - an outcome for which there is barely  an ounce of evidence - it is simply not politically possible for Sinn Fein to be  admitted to the talks at the moment. There is no basis of trust upon which that  can happen. It would not be realistic to expect Unionist parties to remain in the  talks in that event. In any case, the Conservatives could not persuade their MPs  to support such a move. <p> <p>This is therefore a politically pointless act. The  republican movement gains nothing by it, and loses yet another slice of its  already very thin credibility. <p> <p>This does not mean that Sinn Fein will  necessarily be displeased by this outcome, since its priority now seems  increasingly to be focused on defeating the SDLP to become the primary political  force in Catholic Northern Ireland. Since events like Lisburn mock the SDLP's  strategy of participating in the political talks, they will doubtless be  repeated. It is necessary to ask, therefore, whether there is any alternative at  present to this gradual descent back into armed conflict in Northern Ireland. It  is genuinely hard to see one that any British government of whatever party could  honourably follow. It would, of course, be desirable to strike a compromise deal  in Northern Ireland within which, with public consent, a pluralist Ulster could  prosper in a three-stranded system of reform. But there wasn't much evidence that  this was ever seriously on the republican agenda. And what has happened in  Lisburn only confirms the grim conclusion that, for the IRA, the struggle is  preferable to any possible outcome. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400  border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Lisburn bombing brings  war back to Northern Ireland</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 October  1996</h2></b><br><h2>IRA claims army HQ bombs</h2><h3>First big attack in Northern  Ireland for more than two years raises fears of full-scale return to violence   </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Sharrock</b><br><br>      <p> <p>The IRA last night admitted responsibility for the double bomb attack on  the army's headquarters in Northern Ireland, which left a soldier fighting for  his life. <p> <p>It was the first major attack by the IRA in Northern Ireland  since it declared a ceasefire more than two years ago, raising fears of a  full-scale return to violence in the province. <p> <p>A telephone caller using a  recognised codeword told the Dublin newsroom at RTE, the Irish republic's  broadcasting network, that two 800lb bombs had been planted and detonated at the  army complex in Lisburn, Co Antrim, on Monday night by IRA volunteers. <p> <p>The  IRA statement said injuries to any civilians were regretted. Earlier, the  Northern Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew and security sources on both sides  of the Irish border had pointed the finger of blame at the Provisionals. <p>  <p>An earlier claim made to RTE by the Continuity Army Council, a shadowy  republican splinter group, had been treated with scepticism. A male caller  claiming to represent the council gave no codeword but said the attack had been  in retaliation for the death of Diarmuid O'Neill, shot by police in London a  fortnight ago as they made several arrests and seized 10 tonnes of homemade  explosive. <p> <p>Michael Portillo, the Defence Secretary, said the Army GOC, Sir  Rupert Smith, was leading the inquiry into how the bomber managed to penetrate  what should have been its most secure base. It is understood that the army  regards the attack as the most damaging breach of its security since it  established its headquarters. <p> <p>On the streets of Northern Ireland, the  security profile was rising last night, with joint police and army patrols once  again manning vehicle checkpoints. Loyalist paramilitary leaders were also  meeting to consider their response to the outrage. <p> <p>A soldier, in his thirties or forties, is the most seriously injured of the blast victims and was the last to be  identified. He was in a critical condition in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital  with more than 50 per cent burns. He also has head injuries and wounds to his  left arm, which may have to be amputated. <p> <p>Three other people, two men and  a woman aged 20-30, are being treated at the hospital. They are all described as  being in a serious but stable condition with shrapnel wounds. The woman, an army  employee in her thirties, also has head injuries and burns and one of the men has a  broken thigh. <p> <p>Twelve injured soldiers were also still being treated in  Musgrave Park Hospital, in Belfast. Three were said to be seriously ill. <p>  <p>Consultant surgeon Laurence Rocke, who is treating the victims in the Royal  Victoria, said their injuries were typical of those inflicted by bomb blasts and  suggested they were all within 10-20 metres of the explosions. Sir Patrick, who  returned early from a business conference in the United States aimed at bringing  investment to Northern Ireland, said before the IRA's claim that the attack was  "entirely consistent with a terrorist organisation that declared an end to the  ceasefire which it had proclaimed in August 1994". <p> <p>The Sinn Fein president  Gerry Adams expressed his sympathy towards the injured and said he was prepared  to meet the Government, other politicians or Church leaders to rebuild the peace  process. "There has been a political vacuum here for some time. If we  don't fill the political vacuum with real talks then it's going to be filled with  the type of incident we saw yesterday," he said. <p> <p><p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Joint appeal by Blair and  Ashdown over sleaze </b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The  Blair and Ashdown letter</h2><h3>Ashdown and Blair plead with PM to restore confidence   </h2>
 <br><br>      <p>Dear Prime Minister, <p> <p>We are writing to you about the cash-for-questions  affair. We are doing so because of the widespread public concern at the damage  being done to our democratic system. <p> <p>We are of course aware that Sir  Gordon Downey is investigating the allegations against Mr Hamilton made by Mr Al  Fayed following the collapse of the libel trial. There is absolutely no question  about Sir Gordon's integrity or competence. He does not, however, have the powers  of a Statutory Inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 to get  at the truth. <p> <p>Only an inquiry sitting in public, headed by a distinguished  judge, would attract the public confidence which the situation requires. Such  tribunals have traditionally been appointed where there are serious allegations  of corruption or misconduct in public life, which require thorough, impartial and  public investigation. They offer procedures and powers ideally suited to this  case. <p> <p>A new factor has risen as a result of a memo, a copy of which we  have seen, which purports to be a minute of discussions involving David Willetts  MP, then a Government Whip, and now a Minister. <p> <p>This document suggests an  attempt was made in 1994 to undermine the investigation into allegations against  Neil Hamilton. Specifically, it suggests that Mr Willetts was asked for advice on  whether the Tory members of the Committee should argue that the Hamilton affair  was sub judice, or whether to conduct the investigation exploiting the good Tory  majority at present on the Committee. <p> <p>The clear implication was that the  end product of the second option would be a decision convenient for Government.  <p> <p>The document suggests political interference in a Committee which had a  quasi-judicial role. It will raise in the public mind fears that there may be  attempts to bring similar pressures to bear on the Committee on Standards and  Privileges. <p> <p>The existence of the memo makes it even more essential that  such fears be laid to rest by a Statutory Inquiry. <p> <p>As you know, we  supported the reference of the allegations against Mr Hamilton to Sir Gordon  following the collapse of the libel action against the Guardian. <p> <p>The  appearance of this memo, however, adds a new and worrying dimension to the case.  Great public concern has been expressed, and calls made for the establishment of  a tribunal under the 1921 Act. <p> <p>It would clearly be wrong to ask Sir Gordon  to investigate a matter relating to political interference. <p> <p>If such  interference did indeed take place, it is not narrowly a matter of Members'  Interests, or the financial propriety of an individual MP's conduct. It is a  constitutional question outwith Sir Gordon's remit. We believe that the public  interest demands a totally impartial inquiry which is seen to be independent. <p>  <p>There is a powerful case for encompassing in one inquiry the memo apparently  in Mr Willetts' own hand, and all the circumstances surrounding Mr Al Fayed's  dealings with Mr Hamilton. His alleged actions lie at the heart of public concern  and must be dealt with by a proper and public examination of the facts. <p> <p>We  therefore call for a Statutory Inquiry under the 1921 Act. You were quite rightly  categorical when you said on television that you wanted the matter 'settled'. <p>  <p>We hope you agree that this matter will only be settled if the allegations  that the Committee was unduly influenced are addressed by a tribunal with  adequate powers, sitting in public. <p> <p>Yours sincerely, <p> <p>Tony Blair,  Paddy Ashdown <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Joint appeal by Blair and  Ashdown over sleaze </b><br><br><br><b><h2>10 October  1996</h2></b><br><h2>An utter lack of understanding</h2><h3>The letter  to Mr Major was not a stunt, but a serious appeal  </h2>
 <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br>      <p>The joint appeal by Tony Blair and Paddy Ashdown for the issues surrounding  the Hamilton case to be heard by a Tribunal of Inquiry rather than Sir Gordon  Downey was a serious one deserving a considered response by the Prime Minister.  It is a view that has now been supported by a diverse range of voices, including  Geoffrey Robertson QC; The Times; Vernon Bogdanor, the Oxford Professor of  Government; Andrew Neil, the former editor of the Sunday Times; and Doug Hoyle,  who is a member of the very body in which Mr Major still has such faith. But Mr  Major did not give a considered response. He instantly rejected the idea while  Central Office dismissed the Ashdown/Blair letter as "a stunt". <p> <p> <p>Sir  Gordon's committee must themselves wonder whether they are now up to the task in  hand. Here are just some of the areas they should consider: the conduct of the  Tory Trade and Industry Committee between 1985 and 1990; the conduct of Tim Smith  and Hamilton in accepting cash for questions; the extent to which Smith and  Hamilton were vetted before being appointed to sensitive ministerial posts;  Hamilton's conduct as a minister; the extra-parliamentary income of Hamilton  dating back nearly 10 years; all payments made by Ian Greer to any MPs over the  past 15 years; the relationship between Prime Minister and Mr Greer; the  relationship between five named Tory MPs and Greer; the nature of the Lord  Chancellor's assurances to the House of Lords; whether Hamilton lied to Mr  Heseltine; the ethics of MPs accepting secret payment for acting on behalf of  constituents; why Mr Major did not demand Smith's resignation as soon as he knew  of his cash from Mr Fayed. <p> <p>This list is by no means exhaustive. But it  does indicate why a call for a Tribunal of Inquiry is no mere 'stunt'. And it  does indicate why the Prime Minister's contemptuous dismissal of it is itself  beneath contempt. <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sir Harry Kroto wins  Nobel prize for chemistry</b><br><br><br><b><h2>10 October  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Scientist's just dessert is Nobel prize for chemistry</h2><h3>Sir  Harry Kroto had his eye on the ball when he won the chemistry award  </h2>
 <br>By 
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Tim Radford</b><br><br>      <p> <p>The British scientist who won a Nobel award missed the announcement in  Stockholm yesterday because he had gone for lunch. <p> <p>Sir Harry Kroto, a  professor of chemistry at Sussex University, was one of three to share the  &#163;710,000 Nobel award for chemistry for the discovery of  buckminsterfullerenes - the third form of carbon, in soccer ball-shaped molecules  of 60 atoms each. <p> <p>Ironically, it came only hours after he was turned down  for government funding for new research into the same subject. Yesterday the  Engineering and Physical Science Research Council rejected his request for  &#163;100,000 over the next three years. <p> <p>Sir Harry, aged 57, said he was  depressed by Government funding cuts which had led to the decision. <p> <p>Sir  Harry, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, made his discovery in 1985 with his  co-winners Robert Curl and Richard Smalley of Rice University, Houston, Texas.  <p> <p>They named the new form of carbon after the architect Buckminster Fuller,  designer of the geodesic dome, which the molecule resembles. Sir Harry had been  told that he might be a winner but gave up waiting 15 minutes before the  announcement. <p> <p>The discovery has opened new fields for chemistry and  materials science. Sir Harry had originally worked with a colleague at Sussex on  long chains of carbon, and this led him to radioastronomy in Canada, which ended  in the discovery of unusual carbon molecules in space. <p> <p>This led to  experiments at Rice University with Rick Smalley and Bob Curl which showed they  could form in carbon stars, "and all hell has broken loose ever since," he said.  Buckminsterfullerenes had been proposed in 1966 - as a joke, by Dr David Jones of  Newcastle, who for many years wrote the Guardian's Daedalus column. <p> <p>"What  David Jones had done was to say maybe you could stimulate the formation of these  things. But they formed spontaneously: that was the biggest surprise of all." <p>  <p>Fullerenes or buckyballs could be the basis of a scientific revolution - the  elongated forms are 200 times stronger than steel - but no one yet has a use for  them. <p> <p>"Why should there be a use?" Sir Harry said. "We are talking about  major shifts in our understanding of nature. We have added a third form of carbon  to diamond and graphite. There are huge areas of organic chemistry now opened up  which are quite different from anything before." <p> <p>Some of the prize money  will go to the public understanding of science. He is the first Briton to win a  Nobel chemistry prize since 1982. "The Government should be very wary of assuming  that fundamental science is healthy because of this," he said. <p> <p>"The  experiments were done at Rice University.

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Ezard</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A few yards from the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, the Queen yesterday unveiled a civilian counterpart outside Westminster Abbey, enshrining a multiplicity of worldwide anguish.  The circle of green slate is a Memorial to Innocent Victims of Oppression, Violence and War, a testament to uncountable millions of people, living and dead.  <p>  <p>The unknown soldier's tomb holds the remains of an anonymous serviceman buried symbolically after the 1914-18 war, but no individual body is buried under the new plaque, because the war it marks continues daily. It embodies suffering on a scale before which "language stumbles and falls silent in the face of the horror and the pity", said the Dean of Westminster, Michael Mayne, in his speech of dedication.  <p>  <p>It is expected to become a site of pilgrimage, meditation and wreath-laying after great tragedies like Dunblane. It has been placed in the abbey courtyard so visitors of other faiths can use it.  <p>  <p>Its diversity was reflected in the make-up of the procession of 12 representative victims with whom the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh walked to the plaque.  <p>  <p>They included a Dunblane teacher; a blind, handless Bosnian youth; a former Belsen inmate; a Palestinian; the widow of a jailed Burmese MP; survivors of the 1915 Armenian massacre and the 1994 Rwanda genocide; Irina Ratushinskaya, the poet imprisoned in the Soviet Union; and Joan Wilson, mother of Marie, who was killed in the Enniskillen bombing.  <p>  <p>Traffic came to a halt and passers-by thronged as the grieving cavalcade emerged into the abbey courtyard.  <p>  <p>The Dean said that the soldier's tomb was the abbey's most potent grave, but the new stone was no less eloquent.  <p>  <p>"It seeks to broaden our understanding of what has been done - and is being done daily - in this bloodiest of centuries to those who are our brothers and our sisters and whose blood, like that of Abel, cries out to us from the ground.  <p>  <p>"This new stone speaks for those who have been in the way of invading armies, pawns in a thousand messy wars."  <p>  <p>The plaque has been a long-nurtured project for the Dean, who is on the verge of retirement. In yesterday's address, he said he had no easy answers to civilian suffering. But the service he drafted was forthright in two ways. It included British street children in its definition of victims. And one of its prayers made the 600-strong congregation promise to "strive to resist the wilful - or thoughtless - creation of poverty".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alan  Henry</b><br><br>      <p> <p>British bookmakers rate Damon Hill a 100-1 chance to retain the Formula  One title he took in such masterly fashion yesterday, but nothing could cloud the  massive sense of mission accomplished with which he left the Williams paddock  here in Japan after what was surely both his last and his greatest Grand Prix  victory. <p> <p>The Briton assured himself of a place in motor-sport history  alongside his late father Graham with a dominant performance that was as  important for his personal prestige as a racing driver as it was in making him  F1's first champion son of a champion father. <p> <p>"The race went like  clockwork, like a full-distance test session really - an ordinary day but a  perfect ending to one," he said afterwards. Hill could hardly have improved on  his display before the 37th lap when his team-mate and only rival Jacques  Villeneuve had to retire, but thereafter his focus was supreme. "I got a message  on the radio telling me Jacques was out," he said. "If I had reacted to that then  I would have taken my mind off the ball. You have to try and concentrate on the  race while realising you are world champion. It is a matter of trying to put it  out of your mind." Now, discarded by Williams, Hill moves to the TWR Arrows  Yamaha team at the age of 36 in an effort to build a new future from F1's second  division. The Brazilian Pedro Diniz, who will be his number two there next year,  had to leave yesterday's race in his Ligier after only 13 laps. <p> <p>Hill will  take to TWR Arrows a renewed self-belief after rediscovering the confidence and  edge he had in the season's opening races. Here he produced the goods under  maximum pressure, casting aside the increasingly erratic form of the previous  four races that had enabled Villeneuve to mount his barnstorming challenge. <p>  <p>Although the Canadian qualified on pole position on Saturday, 0.4sec ahead of  Hill, he made a poor start to complete the opening lap in sixth place. Hill  surged away in the lead, never to be headed even during his two routine  refuelling stops throughout the 53-lap race. <p> <p>Hill pressed on relentlessly  after Villeneuve had spun off when a loose rear wheel came adrift, determined to  depart Williams in style as a winner. "I never took the view that this  championship was going to be a walkover," he said. "Right from the start I knew  it was going to be close and I had to take as much of an advantage as I could  before Jacques got up to speed and got into the swing of things. <p> <p>"But it  could have gone the other way, Jacques could have been champion and I would have  been feeling pretty sick. But I know Jacques is going to get another chance. He  is still very young and quick. To be honest, it had to be this year for me and  I'm really, really delighted. Jacques was a match for me by the end of  the season but my motivation was to keep ahead and win the championship. I had  the added pressure of having to finish races, whereas he was coming from behind  and could take more risks." <p> <p>Hill's candid acknowledgement that it was now  or never for him in championship terms reflects an acceptance that the future  will be an uphill struggle and that the F1 baton may have passed to a younger  generation. Next year Michael Schumacher, a close second for Ferrari yesterday,  believes he will have the car and equipment to win back his title. Villeneuve  will be his main opposition, together with his new Williams team-mate  Heinz-Harald Frentzen, plus young chargers such as Mika Hakkinen and David  Coulthard in their McLarens. <p> <p>The Japanese race also left question marks  hanging over the long-term future of Benetton's Gerhard Berger and Jean Alesi.  Although the veteran Berger finished fourth, he only narrowly avoided an early  collision with Hill and later rammed Eddie Irvine's Ferrari into retirement. <p>  <p>Alesi, meanwhile, blotted his copybook by writing off his car in a massive  accident as he came out of the first corner. Since losing Schumacher to Ferrari  12 months ago Benetton have failed to win another race and neither of their  drivers emerged from this one with much credit. <p> <p>As for Hill, there were  times this season when he did not drive like a world champion in waiting but  equally there were moments when he harnessed the performance advantage of his  Williams-Renault to brilliant effect. The bottom line is that he took the title  by winning eight of the 16 races, becoming the eighth British champion since the  series' inception in 1951 but only the second in the past 20 years following  Nigel Mansell's runaway victory in 1992. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400  border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>France distributes iodine  pills to people near nuclear power stations </b><br><br><br><b><h2>15 October  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Paris puts faith in 'nuclear pill'  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alex  Duval</b><br><br>      <p> <p>France began distributing iodine tablets yesterday to tens of thousands of  people living within three miles of nuclear power stations - to a mixed  reception. <p> <p>Iodine taken immediately before or after exposure to radiation  reduces the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly in children, but is no  protection against other effects. <p> <p>Jean-Louis Demareis of Crii-Rad, a  research institute specialising in radioactivity, welcomed the distribution, but  said: "This scheme does not appear to have been thought through. It could lull  people into a false sense of security. We have attempted to obtain  details of the degree of exposure required before mayors will advise people to  take the tablets but the health ministry has not responded." <p> <p>The five  kilometre (just over three miles) radius was insufficient, he said. "Half an hour  after a serious accident, contamination can spread beyond 10 kilometres." <p>  <p>Penelope Komites, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace, hoped the scheme would raise  awareness of the risks of nuclear power, but added: "After years of telling us  that nuclear power is absolutely safe, it is surprising that the government  suddenly wants to distribute iodine tablets." <p> <p>Anti-nuclear protests are  rare in France, even though it generates more than 75 per cent of its electricity  from nuclear power - one of the highest rates in the world. <p> <p>The health  minister, Herve Gaymard, announced the iodine campaign in April, on the 10th  anniversary of the Chernobyl accident. Until now, tablets have been stocked only  at nuclear power stations and in hospitals. The distribution began yesterday at  two south-eastern towns, Saint Maurice L'Exil and Saint Alban, whose residents  were invited to collect the tablets from their town halls, and advised to keep  them to hand in case of a nuclear accident. <p> <p>The mayor of Saint Maurice  L'Exil, Francis Charvet, said more than 6,000 people in the two communities had  received vouchers for tablets. The towns are near a 10-year-old nuclear power  station. <p> <p>"Twenty households have collected tablets at the town hall today.  Everyone is taking this in their stride - there is no panic," he said. "The  tablets will continue to be available for a month in local pharmacies and through  doctors." <p> <p>The campaign, the first of its type in France, is modelled on an  Austrian scheme. <p> <p>Scientists say that taking benign iodine saturates the  thyroid gland, which is situated in the throat, and so prevents the gland from  absorbing radioactive iodine. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400  border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Recluse  leaves £1.3m</b><br><br><br><b><h2>15 October  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Ragged-trousered philanthropist bequeaths &#163;1.3m  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nick Varley</b><br><br>      <p> <p>A recluse nicknamed Compo after the scruff in the TV series, 'Last of the  Summer Wine', has stunned his neighbours by leaving &#163;1.3m in his will to  charity. <p> <p>Arthur McCullagh, aged 74, dressed like a tramp - with a piece of  rope for a belt - and lived alone in a house described as "very basic indeed" in  the village of Wool, Dorset. <p> <p>He once sewed up a gash above his eye rather  than visit hospital. But he saved his greatest surprise until after his death of  heart failure in June. He left &#163;20,000 to the parish council - the  equivalent of an entire year's local tax levy - and the remainder of his estate,  &#163;1,295,399, to four national charities. <p> <p>Neighbours could not believe  that the familar figure in Wellington boots and an old jacket with the pockets  torn off had been a millionaire. One, Alan Brown, said: "He was a very kind and  gentle chap, and everyone liked him, but we all assumed he was really poor. <p>  <p>"He created cars by putting fibreglass shells over old engines and chassis  because it was cheaper. His wealth has come as a shock to people. They thought he  was poverty-stricken. By the way he dressed most people thought he was a  gardener." Joan Dominy, aged 64, who knew Mr McCullagh for 14 years, added: "He  was an amazing character - a real eccentric - but he had a wonderful sense of  humour.

 <br><br><br>      <p>Full name: Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon. <p> <p>Age: One day. <p> <p>Appearance:  Heavenly. <p> <p>Conception: Immaculate. <p> <p>Birthplace: Bethlehem. <p> <p>You  jest: Of course. It was the Good Samaritan Hospital, Los Angeles. Weight: 6lb  9oz. <p> <p>Gory details: Three-hour labour, followed by Caesarean section.  Mother: A well-known Catholic. <p> <p>Father: A fit young fellow co-opted for the  purpose. The couple are not married. <p> <p>Why has the birth caused such  consternation? Something to do with a star. Followers of the star: Wise men from  media organisations around the world who reckon they can cash in on the birth of  the decade. Tabloid editors said they had "stormtroopers" in place ready to  pierce the high-level security at the hospital. <p> <p>And did they? No, Madonna  is one smart cookie. <p> <p>Who played Gabriel? The unlikely figure of Heidi  Fleiss's father, Dr Paul Fleiss, Hollywood's guardian angel, who oversaw the  birth. <p> <p>And God? Charlton Heston is auditioning. <p> <p>An impromptu carol  to mark the occasion: While shepherds watched MTV by night, etc, etc <p>  <p>Useful gifts for the mother: Gold, frankincense, myrrh (or platinum) and a  pointy maternity bra, preferably made by Christian Lacroix. <p> <p>Madonna's  poetic description of seeing the babe during pregnancy: "I was stunned when I saw  on the ultrasound a tiny, living creature spinning around in my womb.  Tap-dancing, I think. Waving its tiny arms around and trying to suck its thumb. I  could have sworn I heard it laughing." <p> <p>Why should it be laughing? Have you  seen Madonna's bank balance? Peculiar admission by a spokesperson: "Madonna was  closely involved during her pregnancy." <p> <p>Not to be confused with: Lord's  cricket ground (a holy place). Not under any circumstances to be confused with:  Heavenly Hiraani Tigerlily, Fifi Trixibelle, Peaches Honeyblossom or Little  Pixie. <p> <p>Do say: "Ring out you crystal spheres / Once bless our human ears /  (If ye have powers to touch our senses so) / And let your silver chime / Move in  melodious time" (Milton, 'On the Morning of Christ's Nativity'). Don't say: "What  do you do for an encore?" <p> <p>Oh, by the way, why have you used such a useless  picture? Pix of the pregnant Madonna were free; bidding for snaps of the baby  started at $1m. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Katz</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Madonna, who has devoted most of her adult life to shocking the rest of  us, managed to spring one more surprise as she gave birth to her first child on  Monday afternoon. <p> <p>The singer and actress, who has been re-christened the  Maternal Girl by almost every newspaper in America, chose Dr Paul Fleiss, a  paediatrician best known as the father of the Hollywood Madam Heidi Fleiss, to  care for her baby. <p> <p>In the morally gymnastic, incestuous world of  Hollywood, it seemed oddly appropriate that the child of America's modern madonna  should be looked after by the father of its most famous madam. <p> <p>Madonna  provided a lesser surprise by giving birth at the relatively unsalubrious Good  Samaritan Hospital in downtown Los Angeles rather than the smarter Cedars Sinai  Hospital across town. <p> <p>Admitted to the hospital under the name of Victoria  Fernandez, the singer gave birth to a 6lb 9oz girl at 4.01pm. There were reports  that the singer underwent a Caesarean, but the hospital did not release any  information. Ending months of speculation, Madonna's spokeswoman said the child  would be christened Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon. That's Loor-dez, rather than the  single syllable pronunciation ofthe French town where the Virgin Mary was  supposedly sighted in 1858. <p> <p>The child's father, so far little more than a  bit player in the Lourdes Ciccone Leon nativity story, is Carlos Leon, a former  bicycle messenger hired as Madonna's personal trainer after she met him while  jogging in Central Park. <p> <p>"Mother Madonna Ciccone, father Carlos Leon and  their daughter are all resting comfortably," said Ms Rosenburg. "We would like to  thank everyone for their kind wishes." <p> <p>News of the birth was broken to  reporters by Dr Fleiss, who this year pleaded guilty to charges of tax evasion  arising from his efforts to conceal the earnings from his daughter's prostitution  operation. <p> <p><p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400  border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Handguns  banned</b><br><br><br><b><h2>16 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Handguns outlawed</h2><h3>Public outrage forces late decision to ban all weapons except .22 pistols </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ewen  Macaskill</b><br><br>      <p> <p>The Government will today bow to public anger over the private ownership  of guns in the wake of the Dunblane massacre by announcing a ban on almost all  handguns. <p> <p>In an extraordinary move decided yesterday at a two-hour Downing  Street meeting to discuss Lord Cullen's public inquiry into the massacre, the  Government will outlaw the vast majority of handguns, and say they must be handed  in. Owners will be compensated. <p> <p>The exception will be .22 single-shot  pistols, which account for less than 10 per cent of legally held handguns in  Britain, and which can be used for sporting purposes. But they will have to be  kept in secure gun clubs. Only the police and military will be allowed to retain  other handguns. The move goes further than Lord Cullen's recommendations,  expected to say guns should no longer be held at home but could be stored in  clubs. The Government had previously been thought ready to back the Cullen  report, published today. <p> <p>The ban, which will leave Britain with one of the  tightest sets of gun regulations in the world, will outrage shooting  organisations which have lobbied hard to protect the rights of their members. But  it will not satisfy Snowdrop, the anti-gun pressure group set up after Dunblane,  which will argue that .22s can also kill. <p> <p>Michael Forsyth, the Scottish  Secretary, will make the first of two Commons statements this afternoon, setting  out the Government's general response to Lord Cullen, such as tightening school  security. He will be followed by Michael Howard, the Home Secretary, who will  announce the changes to the gun laws, which are to be included in the Queen's  Speech. <p> <p>The Government's U-turn is a victory for Mr Forsyth, whose  Stirling constituency includes Dunblane, and who was pressing for the ban, while  Mr Howard favoured a less stringent approach. Mr Forsyth was prepared to resign  from the Cabinet if tough action was not taken. In the event, he had the support  of Mr Major, who chaired yesterday's meeting and who is believed to have been  disappointed that Lord Cullen did not propose a wider ban. The .22 single-shot  pistols exempted are the kind used for Olympic shooting. Twenty thousand are  legally held. <p> <p>The Government will find itself outflanked by Labour, which  moved yesterday to demand a blanket ban, including .22 pistols. The Labour  leader, Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, Jack Straw, and the shadow  Scottish secretary, George Robertson, met yesterday to discuss the party's  response to Lord Cullen's report, which will not be made available to them until  today. <p> <p>Labour, which may force a Commons vote, will claim the Government  is panicking because it does not want to be seen to be out of step with public  opinion. But government sources insist the deciding factor was the simple  argument that a disturbed individual should not have been able to keep powerful  handguns in his home in Dunblane. <p> <p>The ban will create trouble with  sections of the Tory party, which is traditionally the party of the shooting  lobby. Many gun clubs will have to close. <p> <p>A Commons motion calling for a  complete ban on handguns was gaining cross-party support. The Conservative MP  Hugh Dykes said it had been tabled to make sure ministers knew the depth of  feeling before making a final decision. <p> <p>"It is really to focus the debate  very strongly on this growing perception amongst the public that nothing less  than the complete prohibition on the private ownership and use of handguns will  do," he told BBC Radio 4's 'World at One'. <p> <p>"This is obviously a free vote  and will be a matter for the whole of Parliament and I would guess that there is  a very large majority in the House of Commons for an outright prohibition. This  is an unrivalled opportunity for us in Britain to get away from the menace of the  American gun culture which is beginning to take a grip." <p> <p>Ann Pearston, of  the Dunblane Snowdrop petition, whose address to the Labour Party conference  appears to have been crucial in pushing Mr Blair to demand a total ban, welcomed  the Government's shift but demanded a complete ban. The gun lobby, which claims  up to four million guns are illegally held in Britain, doubted whether the  Government's proposals would work. Michael Yardley, a firearms expert, claimed a  ban "would be simply scapegoating the shooting community". He added: "It doesn't  take much imagination to see that banning handguns but not shotguns is  pointless." <p> <p> <p> <p><b>Gun factfile </b><p> <p>Handgun: a small gun (pistol  or revolver) which is designed to be capable of being held and fired using one  hand only (though marksmen often use double-handed grip in practice). <br>0.22  inch calibre: diameter of the ammunition used - Olympic games and  many other international target shooting disciplines are restricted to 0.22  calibre guns <br>Number of people holding firearm certificates for handguns in  Britain: 57,510 <br>Number of legally owned handguns: 200,490 - of which 10 per cent  are 0.22 inch calibre <br>Number of offences in Britain in which firearms used  (1994): 14,755 <p> <p> <p>  <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Handguns banned</b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>A victory for people</h2>
<h3>So far so good on guns - but there is more to do  </h2><br><b>Leading article</b><br><br> <br>


<p>People still count. Yesterday they scored a spectacular victory. The gun
controls announced in Parliament by the Home Secretary were a triumph for
ordinary citizens over the organised lobby. The new controls are far more
stringent than this Government, with its umbilical links to the gun lobby, would
ever have countenanced but for the nationwide anger over the massacre of 16
Dunblane children and their teacher in March. The true Tory position was revealed
in August in the contemptible report produced by the Conservative majority on the
Home Affairs select committee: not just the rejection of a ban on handguns but
the repudiation of a host of other more modest ideas. But in the end, numbers
mattered. There may be 57,000 people with handgun certificates, but 750,000
people signed the anti-handgun Snowdrop petition. Unlike the gun lobby, they did
not employ professional lobbyists. Instead, they made their voices heard through
every news outlet. Having come this far, they must not stop now. Yesterday was an
important battle, but the war isn't over yet. <p> <p>Michael Howard's package
would ban all handguns from being held in private homes, ban all handguns larger
than .22 calibre even from shooting clubs, and impose such stringent new security
regulations on shooting clubs that, according to the Home Secretary, virtually
all clubs would currently fall short. It would mean 80 per cent of the existing
200,000 legally-held handguns in the country would have to be destroyed. There
would no longer be any high calibre pistols or revolvers available to the public.
No multi-shot or self-loading handguns could be held. Mail order sales of guns
would be ended and so would the sale of expanding ammunition, used in Dunblane
and designed to cause maximum injury. Britain would not have gone as far as
Ireland or Japan but would have one of the toughest gun laws in the world. Pushed
by the rising public anger over guns, Michael Howard has already gone
considerably further than the Cullen inquiry suggested. <p> <p>Sensibly, Dunblane
parents are saying this is not enough. The Howard proposal would still permit
40,000 handguns to be held in clubs. Forensic experts say these single-shot guns
could be converted into multi-shot weapons. Worse still, this political fudge is
going to be far more difficult to police than a total ban. Some of the
difficulties emerged as MPs cross-examined the Home Secretary yesterday. The
handguns could be transported from one club to another but only under the escort
of a third party. A .22 handgun can still kill. It remains more dangerous than a
shotgun to the extent that it is more easily carried - and more easily concealed
or camouflaged. The parents of the 16 murdered Dunblane children are right to
talk about this "unacceptable compromise". They are right, too, to talk about the
need to combat and reverse the growing gun culture in the UK. <p> <p>The culture
will not be reversed by just a handgun ban. There are two million registered
shotguns and even more millions of air rifles. There is neither a licensing
system nor an age limit on airguns. Chris Mullin, the Labour MP who drafted the
minority report on gun control for the Home Affairs select committee, is right to
want more controls on these weapons. Of course farmers and country people have a
right - and a need - to shoot foxes, rabbits and other pests. But if handguns are
to be banned from all homes, why cannot shotguns be banned from urban homes? This
is for the future. A complete handgun ban is the immediate goal. One more push by
the Snowdrop campaigners could produce an inspiring victory for flower power. <p>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Clare Short reunited with  son</b><br><br><br><b><h2>17 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Clare Short and son  reunited</h2><h3>Blair delighted as frontbencher announces she and the boy she gave for  adoption 31 years ago now "both feel complete"  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael  White</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Clare Short, the Labour front bencher, last night astonished and delighted  her colleagues by announcing that she had been reunited with the son she gave  away when she was a young student 31 years ago. <p> <p>Ms Short and her son, City  lawyer Toby Graham, said in a statement issued through the Labour Party  yesterday: "We are at the moment happier than we have been in our lives. It is  more wonderful than anyone can imagine and makes us both feel complete. It is  like falling in love, but less complicated. And it is guaranteed to last forever." <p> <p>To add party political stardust to a genuine, tear-jerking story,  it emerged that Mr Graham was raised in what was described as a Tory background.  "He says he was a One Nation Tory and that he was already being won over to the  ideas of Tony Blair before he knew about Clare," the statement said. The shadow  overseas aid spokesman, better known as the passionate leftwing conscience within  Mr Blair's shadow cabinet, revealed what had not been known to the Labour  hierarchy until recently: that when she married as an 18-year-old student in 1964  she was pregnant - and soon decided it would be best to have her baby adopted.  <p> <p>As the Labour leader, who this week extolled the virtues of traditional  family values, expressed his delight at the reunion - "I wish them the very best  of happiness" - Labour officials explained that 50-year-old Ms Short, descendant  of staunch Irish republicans from Crossmaglen, had acted as a Catholic teenager  would easily have done in the early Sixties. Soon she and her then-husband, Andy  Moss, who were divorced in 1974, "deeply regretted what they had done". The  decision made it difficult for the marriage to work. "Since that time, Clare has  lived with a sense of pain and loss at the centre of her life." <p> <p>Mother and  son appealed for privacy, though they will appear for photographers at  Westminster this morning. <p> <p>Mr Graham was said to have started a search for  his real mother after the birth of his own daughters, now aged 18 months and 2  and three quarters, and learned a year ago who she was. He did not initially realise Ms Short  was a well-known MP. <p> <p>Mr Blair has known for some time of the relationship.  The MP decided to go public with it because knowledge of her son was becoming  widely known. It was first reported on ITN last night. <p> <p>In 1981 Ms Short,  then a civil servant, married Alex Lyon, a radical Labour MP who had been sacked  as a Home Office minister. He died after a long illness last year. The couple had  no children, but Ms Short's career flourished. <p> <p>She won Birmingham Ladywood  in 1983, the year Mr Lyon lost York. She rose to NEC and shadow cabinet rank -  although her progress was punctuated by rows and resignations. <p> <p>This summer  she complained that Mr Blair was surrounded by "people who live in the dark", a  typically blunt assessment of the leader's entourage. But Mr Blair last night put  bygones behind him. He declared: "I am thrilled for Clare that she has met her  son and that they have been able to form such a warm relationship... Clare  will be a marvellous grandmother to his children." <p> <p>The nearest comparable  revalation for a high-flying woman MP was the discovery that Virginia Bottomley,  was pregnant with her eldest child when she married her husband, Peter, when she  was 19. <p> <p>The emergence of more women into prominent positions in public  life since the Sixties makes it inevitable that such family traumas will emerge.  Until recently many women who chose to make politics a career remained unmarried  or childless unless - like Margaret Thatcher - they were married to wealthy men  who could support them and pay for child care. Even that option exacted a price  and Lady Thatcher's daughter, Carol, recently wrote a memoir of her father, in  which she revealed the future prime minister to be a self-absorbed career woman  who devoted what parental energy she had to her son, Carol's twin, Mark. <p>  <p>In his statement, Mr Blair said: "Clare first told me of their situation some  time ago, after her son approached her. I fully accept that Clare is a well-known  public figure, but I hope the media will be sensitive in their approaches to the  other people involved." <p> <p>Ms Short and Mr Graham, now 31, revealed that she  gave birth while she was a student, but gave her son up for adoption after six  weeks. The baby was adopted by John Graham, director of a public company, and his  wife, who brought him up in a comfortably-off Conservative family. <p> <p>He was  sent to a boarding school, studied law at the University of East Anglia and is  now a solicitor in the City. <p> <p>When the adoption law allowing children to  trace their real mothers changed, Ms Short had said that if her son tried to  trace her, she was willing to meet him. <p> <p>Four weeks ago, the pair met for  the first time in 30 years. In an interview in the Independent newspaper the MP  said: "It was just that this big thing at the centre of my life was painful. Of  course now I feel fabulous. It isn't painful any more." <p> <p>She adds: "I found  out I was pregnant just after my 18th birthday. My first thought was my parents -  you know I come from a Catholic family. It was different times back them.  Everyone was more innocent." <p> <p>A student in Birmingham at the time, she  married the child's father and then contacted an adoption agency. <p> <p>"I just  thought I would never go back to university, that it would be terrible all round,  terrible for the baby, there would be no money, so what I was doing was best for  everyone. When they came to take him it was terrible. It's been terrible  ever since." Mr Graham told the newspaper: "Officially I've been looking for  about a year, but in my mind I always wanted to know and always intended to do  this." <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Clare Short reunited with son</b><br><br><br><b><h2>18 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The eternal joy of motherhood</h2>
<h3>Clare Short's reunion is bliss for her and a model for others  </h2> 
<br><b>Leading article</b><br><br><br>


<p>Clare Short did more than just a good turn to herself in placing her name on
the register where adopted people can look for their birth parents. Her joy at
her reunion with her son - whom she gave up for adoption in 1964 when he was six
weeks old and she was an 18-year-old student - will have brought pleasure to all
those who read the exuberant accounts yesterday. Mother and refound son hugged
each other for the press but even cynical Fleet Street photographers recognised
this was not confected. The couple have enjoyed a euphoric reunion. But in
addition to helping herself - and her son - Ms Short has helped two other groups:
the thousands of women who gave up babies in the 1960s who may want to search for
their children but feel ashamed at having given a baby away; and the thousands of
people who were adopted who are searching for their birth parents. <p> <p>Ms
Short rightly feels no shame - only pain for what happened in the Sixties. It may
only have been three decades ago but it was another world where women were not
counselled before they gave up babies and respectable single girls did not become
pregnant before they got married. Over 12,000 gave up babies for adoption every
year in the Sixties compared to 350 in the Nineties. The 1967 Abortion Act, the
introduction of the contraceptive pill, and changing social attitudes towards
single parents have transformed the scene but still left hundreds of thousands of
women feeling loss and pain. Now they may be less wary about a reunion with their
children. Not all reunions will be as successful. Even euphoric reunions can get
tougher later on. But few adopted people, even those with an unsuccessful
reunion, regret searching for their roots. Everyone has a right to know who they
are. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A

 <br>By 
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Alan Watkins</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Two young women jailed for contempt of court after refusing to give  evidence against a man accused of grievous bodily harm, because they feared  reprisals if they did so, are to have an appeal heard in the High Court next  week. Sarah Holt, aged 20, from Waltham Abbey, Essex, was jailed for three months  at Chelmsford crown court for refusing to go into the witness box against her  former boyfriend Alex Fryatt. Her friend Sophie Bird, 22, was jailed for two  months after she too told the court she no longer wished to give evidence. <p>  <p>As a result the case against Mr Fryatt collapsed and proceedings were dropped.  <p> <p>The judge, Mr Justice Benjamin Pearson, refused an immediate appeal  certificate but yesterday solicitors acting for the girls said they were  confident that the High Court would soon hear their appeal. <p> <p>Both women  were sent to Holloway prison and were said yesterday by angry relatives to be  "deeply distressed and upset" at the sentence. Both claim that after Mr Fryatt  was arrested for allegedly attacking Sarah and causing a broken jaw and other  injuries, threats were made of reprisals if they went into the witness box. <p>  <p>Sarah's father, David, said yesterday that to jail girls who were simply  scared was "complete and utter madness". <p> <p>He said it must have been obvious  to the judge that the pair were frightened for their lives as a result of a  campaign of threats. <p> <p>Mr Holt said last night that the appeal of the two  women could be heard as soon as Monday. <p> <p>He also revealed that Sarah had  been transferred to Drake Hall open prison, Staffordshire, although Sophie  remains in Holloway. <p> <p>Julie Bindel, of the International Conference on  Violence, Abuse and Women's Citizenship, said yesterday that she believed a  "dreadful miscarriage of justice" had taken place. <p> <p>She said both women  were clearly trying to protect themselves. They should be released immediately  and given the support that they need. "This is a subject which everyone, from  police to judges, needs to understand much more about. To put these girls into  prison because of their own fear is an outrage," she said. <p> <p> <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Sarah Boseley</b><br><br>      <p> <p>There they were, long blonde tresses tossed off their faces, red lips  parted in a shriek of joy, clutching each other for the cameras - kneeling on a  bed, of course, and with plenty of thigh showing. 'Freed By The Sun - EXCLUSIVE',  crowed the headline. <p> <p>This was the first morning of freedom for Sarah Holt,  20, and Sophie Bird, 22, the friends who had spent a week behind bars for  contempt of court. What had they done to deserve it? They had refused to give  evidence in court against Holt's former boyfriend, Alex Fryatt, who had beaten  her to unconsciousness. They were afraid of what he might do to them, they said.  The pair would not tell the court about Fryatt, who was formally acquitted of  grievous bodily harm with intent as a result - but they spoke to the Sun, which  bought the story. "Shaken Sarah told how obsessed Fryatt beat her up throughout  their three-year affair - and once pinned her photo to a wall with a knife  through the face," the story ran yesterday morning. Of the attack which put her  in hospital for six days, she said: "I thought I'd die, the pain was  indescribable. The last thing I remember is him lifting his foot and stamping on  my face. Then I passed out." <p> <p>Had she said that in court, Fryatt would now  be behind bars instead of being, as Mr Justice Benjamin Pearson said at  Chelmsford Crown Court, "free to behave as he will, perhaps not to beat up you  two, but probably beat up someone else". At the Appeal hearing, which reduced  their sentences from three and two months to one week, Holt was described as "a  rather empty-headed, unsophisticated 20-year-old" by her QC, Alun Jones. Her  silliness, he seemed to be saying, was her excuse - what more could you expect  from a girl like that? <p> <p>After Fryatt had been freed, the pair were given  Legal Aid by the judge and told to get representation in the contempt  proceedings, because they could be jailed. Bird paid one visit to a solicitor,  but failed to keep a second appointment. <p> <p>Holt, said Mr Jones, "hadn't  bothered. She is too feckless, too unsophisticated, to go to a solicitor to get  the matter sorted out." They did not take the judge seriously. "They spoke to  family and friends and the general reaction was that the judge is just trying to  frighten you," said Mr Jones. He was not - and they should have known that. So  should their elders. They are not stupid, but if ever two women embodied the  black hole that is civic awareness and social responsibility today, it is Holt  and Bird. Their behaviour displays an extraordinary lack of respect for the legal  system - contempt indeed. They were afraid of Fryatt - of course they were - and  had been intimidated by him and by his friends. But they did not tell that to the  judge when he asked why they would not testify. Holt claimed she could not  remember what happened - although she obviously regained her memory for the  reporters from the Sun - and Bird said she was not sure it was Fryatt she had  seen. "If the true reasons had been given, the trial might have gone ahead," said  Lord Justice Roch at the appeal. The women might not have had to give evidence -  their statements could have stood alone. <p> <p>The Crown Prosecution Service was  criticised for failing to realise that the women were scared, but Holt and Bird  behaved as if they could just close their eyes and the whole thing would go away.  They went to see Fryatt in the cells, to do a deal. If he promised to leave them  alone, they would not testify. <p> <p>Never mind the legalistic wheels which were  already grinding; never mind a wider duty to society to try to put a violent man  out of harm's way. These two had an entirely self-centred view of the case, with  fear to spur them on. It concerned them and him and nobody else. They are  Thatcher's generation - they had no duty to society and they would not rely on it  to protect them. <p> <p>It would be very wrong to suggest that terrified women  must always testify against the men who beat them up. Many, such as Gazza's wife  Sheryl, choose for their own reasons not even to bring a complaint against their  abuser. But if parents no longer tell their children that they have a duty to  tell the truth before the law, then perhaps it really is time for education in  citizenship. <p> <p>Or should we just appoint the Sun as the highest court in the  land? <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Katz</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Wallace and Gromit were missing in New York yesterday after being  accidentally left in the boot of a taxi. <p> <p>The original plasticine models of  the characters that won Nick Park three Academy Awards were lost shortly after  the film-maker arrived on Saturday for a promotional tour. <p> <p>Yesterday a  distraught Mr Park was appealing on local radio stations for help in finding  them. "He feels like he's lost two pals," said his publicist, Arthur Sheriff.  "These are the only ones, it's not as if there's a duplicate set." <p> <p>He said  Wallace and Gromit, together with their motorcycle and sidecar, were put in the  boot of a taxi for the journey from JFK airport to a Manhattan hotel. Because it  was raining heavily, Mr Sheriff and Mr Park took cover under the hotel canopy  while a porter unloaded their bags. <p> <p>"Nick then realised the porter hadn't  taken Wallace and Gromit out - but by then the cab had left," he said. Mr Park  gave chase but "by then every cab had turned into 100 cabs". <p> <p>The models  were used in Mr Park's most recent film, 'Close Shave'. The motorcycle and sidecar  cost &#163;4,000 to build, but Mr Sheriff said the value of Wallace and Gromit  was "incalculable". <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian Katz</b><br><br>      <p> <p>A national cultural disaster was narrowly averted yesterday morning when  an apologetic New York taxi driver returned Britain's most famous Plasticine film  stars to their Oscar-winning creator, Nick Park. <p> <p>The British film-maker  had been distraught since being parted from his beloved Wallace and Gromit as  they arrived in New York during a fierce storm on Saturday evening. The original  models of the cheese-loving inventor and his cerebral pooch, along with their  &#163;6,000 motorcycle and side-car, were left in the boot of a taxi after a  hotel porter unloaded Mr Park's bags. <p> <p>Mr Park gave chase but lost the taxi  in heavy traffic on 54th street. He and publicist Arthur Sheriff spent the  weekend contacting local radio stations, police and companies and producing a  'photofit' of the missing duo. Mr Park said the taxi driver walked into the Rihga  Royal hotel carrying the black box containing Wallace and Gromit yesterday  morning. "I couldn't believe it because I had sort of resigned myself to not  seeing them again." Mr Park said he offered the cabbie money, but he would not  accept it. Wallace and Gromit were both fine. Mr Park recalled Wallace's remark  at the end of 'The Wrong Trousers': "All's well that ends well." <p> <p> <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Matthew Harding dies in  helicopter crash</b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>'Goodbye,  Mr Chelsea'</h2><h3>Matthew Harding's legacy will live on in football  </h2>
 <br>By 
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Duncan</b><br><br>      <p> <p>He wasn't a politician, a world leader, or even a great sportsman. He was  a businessman, a large investor in a football club and a supporter. But the  fanfare to the Chelsea vice-chairman, Matthew Harding, killed in a helicopter  crash in Cheshire late on Tuesday as he returned from watching his team play,  straddled all those worlds. Tributes flowed at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea's  stadium. <p> <p>"I was shocked by the news of Matthew's tragic death," said the  Prime Minister, John Major, a fellow Chelsea fan. "Chelsea was his passion and he  did a huge amount to help the club he loved." <p> <p>Chelsea said its north  stand, which Mr Harding's money helped build, will be named after him. There will  be a minute's silence before Premier League matches this weekend. <p> <p>"He was  so full of life and vigour and someone deeply committed to his country," said the  Labour leader Tony Blair. Last month, Mr Harding announced he was donating  &#163;1m to Labour. But it is thought only about half the money had already been  paid. <p> <p>The England coach, Glenn Hoddle, said: "It is unbelievable the game  should lose somebody who had so much to offer so young and in such  circumstances." Chelsea's manager, Ruud Gullit, said: "He was a guy who wanted to  be a player also, one of us. He was more like a supporter really than a  director." <p> <p>Mr Harding's death, at 42, touched the high and the low among  Chelsea's support: yesterday's impromptu memorial at Stamford Bridge contained  one floral tribute from the notorious hooligan gang the Headhunters, as well as  hundreds of touching wreaths. "Goodbye, Mr Chelsea," said one. The accident,  which claimed five lives, occurred in Middlewich at around 11pm on Tuesday as the  helicopter carried Mr Harding's party back from Chelsea's game at Bolton. Mr  Blair had used the same aircraft after last month's Blackpool conference. <p>  <p>Witnesses suggested engine failure. The wreckage of the French-built  helicopter will be examined by the Civil Aviation Authority. "It was the dead of  night and I could hear it very well," said Josephine Horrocks, aged 43, who lives  half a mile from the crash site. "The engine was faltering. All of a sudden there  was a massive bang." <p> <p>The first clue to the identity of those who died came  when rescue workers found the burned remnants of a match programme. <p> <p>Mr  Harding, estranged from his wife, Ruth, with whom he had four children, had a  two-year-old daughter, Ella, to his girlfriend, Vicky Jaramillo, aged 25. <p>  <p>He made his fortune in insurance, rising from office junior to chairman of the  profitable Benfield Group, and amassing &#163;170m. He ploughed &#163;25m into  Chelsea. <p> <p>"Mr Harding's financial commitment to the club is in place and  will not be jeopardised by his death," said Chelsea's chairman, Ken Bates. "His  memory is best served by achieving the objectives that he set for the club - in  achieving his dream of a world-class team in a world-class stadium." The other  victims of the crash were the pilot, Michael Goss, aged 38, journalist John  Bauldie, aged 47, and two executives of Benfield companies, Tony Burridge, aged  39, and Raymond Deane, aged 43. Kate Alderson, 28, a Times journalist attending  the scene, died in a car crash. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400  border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Ward</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Air accident investigators are to examine the wreckage of the helicopter in which the vice-chairman of Chelsea Football Club, Matthew Harding, and four others died on Tuesday night.  <p>  <p>The debris from the Cheshire crash site will be analysed in a hangar at Farnborough, the Hampshire headquarters of the Department of Transport's Air Accidents Investigation Branch. A report is expected within about six months.  <p>  <p>The Twin Squirrel helicopter took off for Heathrow from a Bolton car park following Chelsea's 2-1 defeat by Bolton Wanderers in a Coca-Cola Cup game. It plunged into a field near Middlewich about half an hour later and burst into flames.  <p>  <p>Two investigators have been in Cheshire since the crash but they have given no indication of possible causes. One problem they face is that small helicopters do not carry black box voice recorders.  <p>  <p>The Cheshire coroner, John Hibbert, yesterday formally opened and adjourned inquests on Mr Harding, aged 42, his three friends Tony Burridge, aged 39, Raymond Deane, 43, and John Bauldie, 47, and the pilot, Michael Goss, aged 38. All five died of multiple injuries.  <p>  <p>He is expected to await the findings of the accident investigation team before holding a full hearing. The men's bodies have now been released to their families.  <p>  <p>At Stamford Bridge, Chelsea's ground, grieving fans continued to arrive to lay flowers, shirts and scarves in memory of Mr Harding. A memorial wall stretched for more than 100ft inside the main gates of the ground. There were also tributes from supporters of many other clubs including Liverpool, West Ham, Manchester United, Queens Park Rangers, Sheffield United and Tottenham, who Chelsea play on Saturday.  <p>  <p>Richard Lewington, one of a family of seven from Carshalton, Surrey, said: "We have brought tributes of flowers, scarves and shirts to pay our respects to Matthew Harding, who was Mr Chelsea, a great bloke, a true fan and one of us."  <p>  <p>Chelsea players arriving for training drove straight into their training ground at the Imperial College sports ground in Harlington, west London, without speaking to waiting journalists.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Major does U-turn on  Queen's speech</b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Queen's  Speech - Major bows to pressure on abusers and stalkers </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rebecca  Smithers</b><br><br>      <p> <p>Tony Blair yesterday dismissed the Queen's Speech as the product of a  drifting government acting as if it had "just landed from Mars" and which refused  to take responsibility for the "fractured society" it had created over 17 years  in office. <p> <p>Launching the Commons debate on the speech, the Labour leader  branded it a thin and largely irrelevant programme of legislation, and said the  country needed and wanted an immediate general election instead. <p> <p>But John  Major firmly rejected the criticism and insisted that his legislative programme  was "by any yardstick... a meaty Queen's Speech that we intend to carry  through in the period between now and the election". He pledged that the  Government would deliver a "prudent" Budget next month, adding: "If we can safely  cut taxes, we will. If we cannot, we will not." Denouncing Mr Blair's  "sanctimonious" response, he warned that "any politician should be very cautious  about cloaking himself in righteousness". The debate - which will be followed by  separate debates on different policy areas over the next few days - prompted  numerous angry exchanges and interventions, and included some surprises. <p>  <p>Mr Major stunned MPs in his own speech by agreeing to accept the "unequivocal"  offer of support from Opposition parties to get Government legislation on  stalking and a paedophiles' register through Parliament. The measures were  controversially not included in the Queen's Speech. But departing from his  prepared text, Mr Major said: "I accept that. I accept that deal." Mr Blair  welcomed the move, and said: "It shows the country what we can achieve in  opposition." <p> <p>Mr Major was also faced with an embarrassing rebuttal after  earlier claiming during an intervention in Mr Blair's speech that the Labour peer  and fertility expert Lord Winston strongly supported the Tories' NHS reforms,  which had led to improvements in the service. <p> <p>Mr Blair said he looked  forward to the day when a new government could introduce a bill to "end the Tory  internal market in the NHS and return it to its rightful place as a proper public  service". Mr Major intervened to claim that Lord Winston had said there was "no  doubt" that the reforms had led to improvements in the NHS. <p> <p>Mr Blair  challenged the accuracy of the claims and said he had never heard such a  "ridiculous" intervention. "Lord Winston has vigorously attacked the Tories over  the internal market," he said. Later Lord Winston himself rebutted Mr Major's  assertion. "I am firmly against the internal market in virtually every respect  and I believe it has been counter-productive to having a good and fair National  Health Service." <p> <p>Mr Blair opened his speech by telling MPs that, instead  of debating the Queen's Speech, MPs should be having an election. "The country  wants to make a judgement," he said. "Every element is there bar one. The election  itself. And that is absent for one reason only. The Tories dare not call a  general election." <p> <p>Mr Blair said the speech had "received more publicity  for what has been left out of it than what is in it" in an undisguised attempt to  "embarrass Labour". He warned that the Government's drift meant "that decisions  that used to be taken aren't taken. Drift on beef, drift on crime, drift on  Europe... , everything just swept under the carpet". <p> <p>Taking up the  current morality theme, he asked MPs: "If our society is as torn and fractured as  it is, I ask, who... fractured it? They did! The Government cannot escape  responsibility." He attacked the Tories' failure to tackle beef, crime, Europe,  the NHS, where "drift means decisions that used to be taken aren't taken...  everything just swept under the carpet". The Tories' last hope lay in an outbreak  of "national amnesia" to ensure that people forgot about the 22 tax rises, VAT on  fuel, the poll tax, cash for questions, business failures, the Scott Report. But  Mr Major accused Mr Blair of being "evasive and misleading" about his own  policies, insisting that Conservative measures had brought about low inflation,  falling unemployment and "new hope and new investment" to the inner cities.  Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown later branded the Queen's Speech "a rag bag  of irrelevant measures from a government in its tormented twilight days". <p>  <p>He complained that too much of politics was now in the hands of spin doctors  and soundbites, which meant that people were lied to about tax, kept in the dark  about the true state of the economy and left out of the debate on the future of  Europe. <p> <p>He warned: "If the Chancellor does cut taxes this autumn, he will  be doing so for purely political purposes and the British people will see right  through it." <p> <p>Mr Ashdown said, despite billions from North Sea oil and  privatisation, the NHS was in crisis and class sizes increasing. The most glaring  bungling of all was over the BSE crisis. "This Government seems to believe that  BSE stands for Blame Somebody Else. But farmers are not fooled, they know where  the blame lies - with the Government." <p> <p><p> <p> <p> <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Major does U-turn on  Queen's speech</b><br><br><br><b><h2>24 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Major  buckles as Labour calls his bluff</h2><h3>Stalking and paedophile measures reinstated   </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p> <p>John Major's impromptu and unprecedented decision to reinstate bills on  stalkers and paedophiles in the Government's legislative programme after Tony  Blair promised co-operation last night threw into disarray government hopes of a  fresh start to the election campaign. <p> <p>Mr Major's about-turn came during  the Commons debate following the Queen's Speech, which had confirmed the  Government's refusal to address the two issues. <p> <p>Michael Heseltine led  senior colleagues in a damage-limitation exercise when it became clear that  ministers were open to charges that they had talked tough on anti-crime measures  but had their bluff called, live on TV. Paddy Ashdown called it "the fastest  U-turn in history". <p> <p>Labour was jubilant over a propaganda coup, though it  overshadowed Mr Blair's call for an immediate election to mend "the fractured  society" - divided by 17 years of irresponsible government. <p> <p>After 24 hours  of skirmishing over the Cabinet's unexpected decision to confine the two measures  - arising from high profile court cases - to the hazardous private member's bill  procedure, Mr Blair had challenged Mr Major across the dispatch box. <p>  <p>"Bring forward those bills as government bills, on stalking, on paedophiles,  and we will co-operate to put them through this House without delay. And you  should stop playing the politics and the point-scoring. It can be done." In an  'impromptu' cabinet meeting in the Commons chamber, Mr Major consulted Michael  Howard, Mr Heseltine and Tony Newton, Leader of the Commons, before telling MPs  he accepted the offer. <p> <p>Later, in ill-tempered exchanges with John  Prescott, Mr Heseltine insisted ministers had exposed Mr Blair's 'hypocrisy' on  crime and extracted a categorical pledge of co-operation from him. <p> <p>Tory  MPs seemed less than delighted at what was bound to be presented as further proof  of government drift. But it is unlikely to be the last such manoeuvre before 1  May, the expected election date. Both sides are braced for an increasingly  populist bidding war between the parties on the main themes in the Queen's Speech  debate - crime, education, and health. "It's not leadership, it's followership,"  one Tory protested privately. Mr Blair's allies said Mr Major had been "panicked  in mid-speech into conceding Labour's case" by the dramatic offer in a crowded  Commons. <p> <p>But some opposition MPs last night feared the Government might be  tempted to strengthen the two bills in the hope of provoking party political  confrontation that could be exploited in the election. <p> <p>Labour said it  would not be bullied into rubber-stamping unjustifiable changes. <p> <p>Old  Westminster hands could not remember an occasion in 30 years when ministers had  decided at the 13th hour to reverse a decision to leave two bills to the  'lottery' of the private members' ballot. Ministers had claimed that, as  "non-controversial" measures, they would stand a better chance of becoming law  quickly as private member's bills, despite the vulnerability to filibuster. <p>  <p>On Tuesday key ministers had said on radio and TV that the alternative option,  to include the register of paedophiles and the anti-stalking bill in Mr Howard's  new Crime Bill, would jeopardise them as the short 13-bill session ends, probably  in April. <p> <p>Harassed by Labour's Jack Straw and Peter Mandelson on  paedophilia, the Home Secretary told Radio 4's 'World at One' on Tuesday: "The  Government (has) been drafting a bill. It will be made available to a private  member and I want to see it on the statute book as soon as possible." <p> <p>Mr  Straw last night upped the stakes by demanding action against combat knives and  the promised government bill on sex tourism, thwarted in the last session. He  called the U-turn proof of "weak and indecisive government". The speech by the  Lib Dem leader, Mr Ashdown, echoed Mr Blair's complaint that the main thrust of  the Queen's Speech was "a ragbag of irrelevant measures from a government in its  tormented twilight days". <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>London revival in full  swing</b><br><br><br><b><h2>29 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Booming London is the  capital of cool</h2><h3>After the swinging Sixties comes the Nineties renaissance   </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Vivek Chaudhary</b><br><br>      <p> <p>It was swinging in the Sixties, plagued by punks in the Seventies and had  to endure Thatcher's pin-striped yuppies in the Eighties. Now the city is once  again hogging the world stage as the capital of cool. From fashion to  music to bars and restaurants, London is enjoying a cultural renaissance that  some say has never been witnessed before - not even during the Sixties. <p>  <p>"Although there was all this free love around in the Sixties, people were  quite inhibited," said Tuppy Owens, who was part of the scene then. Ms Owens, who  now organises a club night called the Sex Maniacs Ball, added: "The city is much  more vibrant and exciting now. You've got a greater mix of people, from different  races and backgrounds. You've got more choice of where to go and things go on  much later." <p> <p>Author Jonathon Green, who wrote 'Days in the Life', a  history of the Sixties, said: "I think it must be awfully fun to be young now."  <p> <p>London-born models have become a permanent feature of the international  catwalk, while Alexander McQueen and John Galliano, two London-based designers,  are to head top French couture houses Givenchy and Christian Dior. <p> <p>Gucci  yesterday unveiled plans to build its largest European store in Chelsea, west  London, at a cost of &#163;3m, while Calvin Klein is also planning to open a  fashion superstore in the same area next year. London's clubs attract an  estimated 500,000 every Saturday, producing a vibrant mix of music that reflects  the capital's cosmpolitan population. Kathryn Willgress, co-editor of Straight  No Chaser magazine, which specialises in jazz and soul music, said: "People are  visiting from all over the world and there is a tremendous variety of music and  talent coming through." <p> <p>Even business is booming. The London Chamber of  Commerce estimates that the capital's economy is set to grow by 4.3 per cent,  compared to 2.3 per cent nationally. "The success of the fashion and club scene  is all part of London's revival," a spokesman said. <p> <p>Even previously  run-down areas are benefiting. Inner city areas like Hoxton, in east London, and  Stoke Newington, in north London, are said to be home to more artists per square  mile than any other city in Europe. <p> <p>Rick Williams, editor of D'Tour  magazine, which focuses specifically on art and music in north and east London,  said: "Areas like Hoxton are the real heart of London. The British, and London in  particular, have always been known for individuality in music and fashion and I  think that suits the Nineties." At Jimmy Beez, a bar-cum-restaurant in Portobello  Road, west London, Simon Heppner, the 26-year-old manager, was in no doubt that  the city is booming. "London is pukka. There's a really good vibe, and people  are expressing their individuality. It's ethnically diverse, and people mix quite  well. In other places they all bind together and look inward. That makes for a  good Chinatown or Spanish quarter, but it doesn't create something new in the way  London has." The evolution of Jimmy Beez mirrors that of London. Founded  originally as post-club cafe-bar, it now offers a full evening menu. For Mr  Heppner, these developments would have been unthinkable only three years ago.  "Then, the number of people who appreciated good food could not support the  number of good restaurants. Now business is good because people are prepared to  opt for something new." <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Manton school closed because of unruly pupils</b><br><br><br><b><h2>29 October  1996</h2></b><br><h2>Head closes pupil-row school</h2><h3>"If boy stays I can't guarantee safety"  </h2>
 <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Donald Macleod</b><br><br>      <p> <p>The discipline crisis in schools took another twist yesterday as the headteacher at a Nottinghamshire junior school announced he was  closing it indefinitely in a row over a 10-year-old pupil accused of assaulting other pupils. <p> <p>As members of the National Association of  Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers threatened to strike over the unruly pupil, Matthew Wilson, his headteacher, Bill Skelley, cited  health and safety grounds in closing Manton junior school, near Worksop. He wrote to parents, saying he was unable to guarantee the safety of  the 200 children if the boy attended. The school is closed from today. <p> <p>The long-running dispute over the boy has set ministers, local  authorities, teachers and governors at odds. Mr Skelley has twice been overruled by governors in his attempts to expel the boy. <p> <p>The  confrontation has fuelled fears of increasingly chaotic school management and discipline, after a crisis inspection at the Ridings school in  Halifax, and a national debate over morality and behaviour following the murder of the London headteacher Philip Lawrence. Parents are also at  odds with a Luton primary teacher who allowed a boy to punish classmates with a ruler after they bullied him. She faces disciplinary action.  Graham Lane, Labour education chairman of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, said the Manton teachers' action was outrageous. "We  cannot have a situation where teachers are the sole arbiters of who they teach. They are setting the most incredible example to young people  because they are bullyboy tactics." <p> <p>Gillian Shephard, the Education Secretary, the local education authority, teachers' unions and  school governors yesterday blamed each other for the failure to relieve the impasse over Matthew Wilson, whose mother insists he should be  taught in normal lessons at Manton and not sent to a special school. <p> <p>When the eight staff voted to strike if the boy returned to  lessons, Fred Riddell, who chairs Nottinghamshire's education committee, intervened and the governors agreed six weeks ago to individual  tuition. <p> <p>The governing body, which has twice overruled the headteacher when he recommended that Matthew be expelled, is to meet  tomorrow. The governors have decided he should return to classes, after spending &#163;3,068 on a supply teacher for the boy. <p> <p>Eileen  Bennett, chairwoman of the governors, accompanied Matthew and his mother, Pamela Cliffe, into school yesterday despite a warning from the  council. "He has got a legal right to be in that school," she said. "The lad has done magnificently. It was a lot of money but it has been  worthwhile. But I do not think it is a good idea to criminalise a 10-year-old by teaching him in isolation. Teachers have got powerful unions  but children have nobody to speak up for them." <p> <p>Matthew's father had died and his mother had been treated for cancer. "They [teachers]  have picked on someone they could batten on. Without the governors supporting her she would have been on her knees." <p> <p>Nigel de Gruchy,  general secretary of the union, said Mrs Bennett had been irresponsible in acting as a counsellor for one family and relinquishing her  responsibility for the school. "If she wants to play power politics with the youngsters, she has picked the wrong union." <p> <p>Mrs Shephard  called on the county council to intervene but Mr Riddell said it had no legal powers to do so. Under the Government's policy of local  management, governors were responsible for spending and excluding pupils. <p> <p><b>School crisis: what they say</b> <p> <p>"He has a legal right to be in  that school. The lad has done magnificently... I do not think it is a good idea to criminalise a 10-year-old by teaching him in isolation.  Teachers have got powerful unions but children have nobody to speak up for them." - Eileen Bennett, chairwoman of governors <p> <p>"If  she wants to play power politics with the youngsters, she has picked the wrong union... Governors are not capable of running schools  successfully." - Nigel de Gruchy, teachers' union leader <p> <p>"This is entirely the responsibility of Nottinghamshire county council. I  call on the chair of the education committee to announce how he proposes to ensure that pupils at Manton school get the uninterrupted education  to which they are entitled." - Gillian Shephard, Education Secretary <p> <p>"This is a dispute between the headteacher, who wanted to  permanently exclude a child on two occasions, and the governing body... We have no legal rights to be interfering with this school." - Fred Riddell, Nottinghamshire education chairman <p> <p>"As I am not in a position to guarantee the appropriate health and safety of all  the children in the school, I have to tell you that school will be closed tomorrow.' - Bill Skelley, headteacher, Manton Junior School <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30  width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Manton school closed  because of unruly pupils</b><br><br><br><b><h2>30 October  1996</h2></b><br><h2>We can raise standards</h2><h3>Prevention is a  far better policy than exclusion  </h2>
 <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br>      <p>The election auction moved from the courthouse to the classroom yesterday -  with equally dire results. The Secondary Heads Association was right to condemn  both major parties for their readiness to indulge in "political leapfrogging"  over school discipline. Which is worse: corporal punishment or compulsory school  contracts? Yesterday dawned with the Education Secretary raising the prospect on  the BBC 'Today' programme of a return to caning in state schools. <p> <p>The normally  rational Gillian Shephard confessed she had never been opposed to corporal  punishment and still regarded it as "a very useful deterrent". Within two hours,  she had been slapped down by the Prime Minister who made it clear that a practice  which was banned in prisons and the military services decades ago was certainly  not being reintroduced against children. Then Mrs Shephard's shadow, David  Blunkett, who has been equally rational about raising standards and improving  discipline, went over the top with the suggestion that home-school contracts  should be made compulsory for seven million pupils in 25,000 schools. Roll on  election day and a calmer period of policy-making. <p> <p>Yesterday's debate  coincided with dramatic disciplinary events in two separate schools: the closure  of Manton juniors near Worksop in Nottinghamshire by its headteacher after  governors insisted on a disruptive 10-year-old boy returning to mainstream  classes; and the threatened strike by teachers at the Riding secondary school in  Halifax who want 60 children to be excluded or expelled. <p> <p>It is time to  remind ministers, education administrators and school governors of the limits of  teachers' influence. Typical pupils spend more time in front of the television  than in front of their teachers. Only 15 per cent of a pupil's waking time is  spent in class. Schools alone cannot be expected to restore the disintegrated  life which an increasing number of urban communities are suffering or solve the  serious emotional problems of a growing number of disruptive children. The causes  - and solutions - lie far wider than the education system, as the feature on the  decline in civic responsibility in our Society section documents today. Indeed, a  recent Gallup poll showed this was widely understood by the public with 83 per  cent believing moral values and behaviour were learned in the home compared to  just 13 per cent who thought it was at school. <p> <p>Even so, schools can still  make a significant difference. Every pupil supposedly spends 15,000 hours in  class. Just as there are unacceptably wide gaps in educational achievement  between schools with similar catchment areas, so too there are insupportably deep  differences in managerial competence. The two issues should not be separated:  Michael Rutter demonstrated a decade ago that good management (punctuality,  coherent goals, well-defined discipline) can and does raise standards. Something  was seriously wrong with the management of the Riding School. Teachers who want  to exclude 60 pupils have lost control and need to examine their own  professionalism. <p> <p>The long-running Manton dispute is different. No one should be  surprised that local parents have aligned themselves with teachers: they have a  shared interest in ensuring one disruptive pupil does not interrupt the education  of other pupils. Labour has been right to push home-school contracts. Prevention  is far better than exclusion. But such contracts are unnecessary for the vast  majority of parents. Far better to concentrate on specific contracts for  difficult children than waste hours drawing up bland generalised contracts for  the multitude. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td  align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG  border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Manton school closed because of unruly  pupils</b><br><br><br><b><h2>30 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Mother of unruly  pupil may sue head</h2><h3>The latest attempt to end impasse over excluded boy  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Vivek Chaudhary</b><br><br>      <p> <p>A crisis meeting will be held tonight at the junior school in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, which  has closed because staff say they cannot control a 10-year-old boy, in an attempt to break the  impasse surrounding the issue. Yesterday the mother of Matthew Wilson threatened legal action  against the headmaster of Manton junior school. Pamela Cliffe said she did not want to send her son  to another school, although the local education authority has promised to find him a place. <p>  <p>Steven Williams, her solicitor, said: "The obligation rests with the headmaster to ensure that  Matthew is provided with a proper education." He added that action would be also considered against  Nottinghamshire education authority and other parties in the dispute. "We are not seeking damages.  We are just trying to enforce the obligation to teach Matthew, and for the refusal to teach him to  be reviewed by the court." <p> <p>The problem over Matthew had turned into a crisis, said Fred  Riddell, Nottinghamshire's education chairman, because of a long history of "very bad relationships  between the governing body and the headteacher and the staff". He ordered an inspection of the  school to examine the breakdown in relations. It will take place next month. <p> <p>The gates at  Manton school are set to be closed again today as members of the National Association of  Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers (NASUWT) strike. The local education authority said  yesterday it was confident of reaching a settlement at tonight's meeting. It could involve Matthew,  who has been accused of assaulting other pupils, being transferred to another school. <p> <p>The  dispute dates back to early summer when Manton's head teacher, Bill Skelley, permanently excluded  Matthew because he was said to be violent and disruptive. The school's governors twice overruled  his decision. Individual tuition arrangements for Matthew, which had averted teachers' threats of  industrial action, collapsed after the governors said last week that they could not continue to pay  for a supply teacher for Matthew, at an annual cost of &#163;14,000, and Mr Skelley refused to  continue teaching Matthew himself. <p> <p>In the absence of alternative arrangements, members of the  NASUWT served notice that they would strike from today. Mr Skelley said he was closing the school  because he could not guarantee the health and safety of his pupils. Parents are angry at being  excluded from tonight's meeting and say their opinions are being ignored. Parent governor Caroline  Morrison said: "Matthew has been portrayed as a monster but he's a 10-year-old child who accepts  that he can be difficult. We should be a little more understanding." Another parent governor, Fran  Lawrence, said: "We want to bring in supply teachers to reopen the school as soon as possible.  Matthew should be allowed back in his usual class. The special tuition may have worked. He should at  least be given the chance." <p> <p>Mr Riddell, who will attend tonight's meeting, criticised the  Education Secretary, Gillian Shephard, for saying that the local education authority should settle  the dispute. He said: "The Secretary of State must be aware of her own government's legislation  which removed the powers to settle such disputes from LEAs in 1988." <p> <p>* Five inspectors moved  into the troubled Ridings school in Halifax, West Yorkshire, yesterday to begin a two-day  investigation ordered by Mrs Shephard, writes David Ward. <p> <p>The emergency inspection follows a  strike ballot by teachers who say that 60 of the comprehensive's 620 pupils should be excluded. <p>  <p><p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td  width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif"  ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE  height=30 width=400 border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td  align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Rikki Neave's mother sentenced to seven years but cleared of murder</b><br><br><br><b><h2>31 October 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Mother cleared of Rikki's murder  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Christopher Elliott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Ministers last night ordered a team of social service inspectors to carry out a thorough review of Cambridgeshire's child protection practice following the death of Rikki Neave, whose mother Ruth was yesterday cleared of his murder. Two social workers in Peterborough were also suspended last night.  <p>  <p>Neave, aged 28, was unanimously acquitted yesterday of her six-year-old son's murder and manslaughter, but was jailed for seven years after admitting cruelty to three of her four children, including Rikki, who was on the at-risk register when his body was found in a wood near his Peterborough home in November 1994. Because Neave has spent 18 months locked up on remand she could be released within two years.  <p>  <p>Her children were beaten, burned with cigarettes and thrown across rooms over a period of six years.  <p>  <p>Simon Burns, the health minister, said last night that he was very concerned at the case. While Cambridgeshire had carried out its own internal review, and had commissioned an independent report from the Bridge Child Care Development Service, he was sending in inspectors to be doubly sure. Trevor Harvey, Rikki's father, and former partner of Ruth, last night called for a public inquiry. In a statement with other members of the family, he criticised Cambridgeshire social workers' care of his son.  <p>  <p>Sandra Chesney, Rikki's aunt, said: "This terrible tragedy could have been avoided if the professionals involved carried out their duties to the standards expected of them."  <p>  <p>Since Rikki's death, evidence has emerged of a social services department riven with disputes between staff and management, and with poor morale and a heavy caseload. It is understood that the investigation by the social services' inspectorate will focus on management failures to gather evidence of the childrens' ordeal and act decisively.  <p>  <p>The county council last night admitted in a statement that mistakes had been made.  <p>  <p>Ted Unsworth, director designate of the county's social services department, said that with hindsight the department had persisted far too long in trying to keep the family together: "We didn't establish a comprehensive picture of what life was like in the Neave household."  <p>  <p>Sentencing Neave, Mr Justice Popplewell said she was inadequate and wholly unfit to be a mother. "I have rarely come across a case of such systematic and persistent cruelty to young children."  <p>  <p>Outlining the cruelty charges, Christopher Metcalfe said that examples of the brutality included Mrs Neave stubbing cigarettes out in the palms of two of the children's hands, repeatedly kicking one of the daughters in the spine and often locking them out late at night. She pulled one child's hair so hard the scalp bled, then hit the child over the head with a hairbrush and broke it in two. On another occasion, Neave squeezed a washing up liquid bottle into Rikki's mouth.  <p>  <p>Neave's pleas of guilty to five specimen charges of cruelty spanning six years, as well as to one of burglary and another of supplying amphetamines, were kept from the jury during the four week trial at Northampton crown court.  <p>  <p>The prosecution had alleged that Neave had murdered Rikki as a human sacrifice to win back her husband Dean, who was not Rikki's father and did not get on with the boy.  <p>  <p>On the morning of Rikki's death, Neave said he had gone off to school and she never saw him again. She reported him missing at 6pm.  <p>  <p>The prosecution alleged he had gone home to tea, after playing truant, and Neave strangled him, washed the body and laid him out in a copse in a manner similar to that of Leonardo da Vinci's drawing of the 'Vitruvian Man'.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Millennium to be celebrated with a dome at Greenwich</b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>World's biggest dome marks millennium  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Dan Glaister</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Plans for the centrepiece of the millennium celebrations, a huge dome described by one of its architects as a "friendly, flexible carcass", were unveiled yesterday, ending months of speculation.  <p>  <p>Details of the project, the largest domed structure of its kind in the world, were revealed as the Millennium Exhibition operating company applied for planning permission to build on the 130-acre Greenwich Peninsula site in south-east London.  <p>  <p>The Dome, designed by architects the Richard Rogers Partnership, will be 50 metres high, matching Nelson's Column, and 320 metres in diameter - big enough to hold two Wembley stadiums or 13 Albert halls.  <p>  <p>The structure will consist of a strengthened industrial fabric, similar to PVC, stretched between a dozen 100 metre high steel masts. This will provide an all-weather cover for 12 segments, each containing a separate exhibition space devoted to a particular aspect of time.  <p>  <p>Barry Hartop, chief executive of the Millennium Exhibition, said: "Today is a milestone. We've come out and said this is what the Millennium Exhibition will look like. It's a significant statement to the world that there is pride in the past and the future and in the achievements of the UK. The scale of the building establishes this as a major world landmark." Organisers hope the scheme will receive planning permission by the end of January, paving the way for a detailed announcement of plans for the interior of the exhibition, which is being designed by the Imagination group.  <p>  <p>Nick Raynsford, Labour MP for Greenwich, said: "The main structure is reminiscent of the Dome of Discovery in the Festival of Britain in 1951. The concept is very attractive and the design solutions are very appropriate for the setting. It will be a major crowd-puller."  <p>  <p>The scheme will create 2,000 jobs for the construction period, followed by 5,000 jobs once the exhibition opens. It will be served by the extension to the Jubilee underground line, and a new riverboat service. The exhibition will be able to receive 100,000 visitors a day, at a peak rate of 35,000 an hour.  <p>  <p>Organisers claimed the planning application would involve the largest consultation exercise in London since Heathrow airport was built. Seven thousand leaflets will be sent to local residents this week, with a further 80,000 over the next month. A public exhibition opens next week. Yesterday's announcement was the first piece of good news for the organisers since Greenwich was chosen as the exhibition site. Nevertheless, doubts still surround the scheme. Partnership funding has yet to be found for the &#163;350m exhibition - &#163;200m has been pledged by the Millennium Commission, but &#163;150m from the private sector is still being sought. A leaked letter from the Imagination group to the Millennium Commission suggested costs may reach &#163;800m.  <p>  <p>Mr Hartop, who has been seconded on a three-month contract from the Welsh Development Office to oversee the project, insisted yesterday "'the project will go ahead. It will open on 31 December, 1999". He revealed a further five companies had expressed an interest in participating.  <p>  <p>It is unclear what will become of the site after the year-long celebrations. The structure, its designers say, will last for at least a decade, but there are no firm plans for its use.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Four police officers traumatised by Hillsborough win appeal for compensation </b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Fury at Hillsborough ruling</h2><h3>Police officers who rescued victims of football disaster win battle for compensation in appeal court  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Clare Dyer</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Four police officers who were mentally traumatised rescuing victims of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster won their battle for compensation in the Court of Appeal yesterday.  <p>  <p>By a two-one majority, the court overturned a High Court ruling 18 months ago that the men were not entitled to damages for post-traumatic stress disorder because they were 'bystanders', not rescuers, and were not acting beyond the call of duty.  <p>  <p>Yesterday's decision angered the victims' families, most of whom had compensation claims turned down because they were not on the scene or were not related closely enough to the victim. Ninety-six fans were killed in the football ground disaster.  <p>  <p>The ruling will rekindle demands for reform of the law on psychiatric injury, criticised as 'unnecessarily restrictive' by the Law Commission. The law lords rejected compensation claims by 15 out of 16 families in a test case in 1992, ruling that only rescuers or those with a close family tie who saw the disaster could claim damages.  <p>  <p>In a consultation paper last year, the commission provisionally recommended that compensation for close relatives should no longer be limited to cases where they witnessed the disaster.  <p>  <p>The appeal court judges said Inspector Henry White and PCs Anthony Bevis, Edward Bairstow and Geoffrey Glave were exposed, by the admitted negligence of South Yorkshire police, to "excessively horrific events likely to cause psychiatric illness even in a police officer". An appeal by Sergeant Janet Smith, who was not at the ground but dealt with bodies at a hospital mortuary, was dismissed.  <p>  <p>Actions brought by the five were seen as test cases for 17 other officers who dealt with victims on the pitch and with bodies in mortuaries. Another 14 officers who were on the terraces have received a total of &#163;1.2m agreed damages from insurers for South Yorkshire police, Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, and the club's engineers. Damages for the four who won yesterday are likely to be agreed in the same way.  <p>  <p>Their claims were initially rejected because they dealt with fans on the pitch, not inside the spectator pens where many were crushed. Only Mr Bairstow is still in the force. The others have been retired on medical grounds.  <p>  <p>The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, the club, and its engineers were refused leave to appeal to the House of Lords. But Assistant Chief Constable Martin Davies said the police would ask the law lords for leave to appeal. The officers' solicitor, Simon Allen, said the decision "shows the courts recognise that members of the emergency services deserve the same protection from the law as members of the public. They are not cannon fodder". Lord Justice Rose, sitting with Lords Justices Henry and Judge, said PC Glave, who was on duty at the ground and stayed until 1.30am helping to move bodies and obtain first aid, was affected by the enormity of the tragedy. Inspector White pulled people out of the crush and saw blue faces at the perimeter fencing. Two were obviously dead. Another victim was a 15-year-old boy whose airways he tried to keep open.  <p>  <p>PCs Bairstow and Bevis were called to the scene to help and were entitled to compensation as rescuers. PC Bairstow assisted in giving a boy heart massage. PC Bevis tried to resuscitate a man and a boy, but both were dead. Trevor Hicks, chairman of the Hillsborough Families' Support Group, described the ruling as "very disturbing" for victims' relatives. Mr Hicks, who was at the stadium and lost his two daughters, told BBC Radio 5 Live's 'Magazine' programme that the ruling opened the floodgates for "everybody in a uniform being a victim".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Four police officers traumatised by Hillsborough win appeal for compensation </b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>"There's one rule for police and another for fans"  </h2>
<br>By <b>Peter Hetherington</b><br><br>


<p>
<p>Seven years after the Hillsborough disaster, Phil Hammond is still haunted by unanswered questions surrounding the death of his 14-year-old son, Philip junior.
<p>
<p>"He was one of the first in an ambulance that day, they found him in a tunnel," Mr Hammond recalled. "At first they couldn't open the door and they had to find the driver. Once they got inside, there was no mask for the oxygen but they put a tube down his throat and eventually he started to 'pink up'."
<p>
<p>About half an hour later, his son died in hospital and Mr Hammond, secretary of the Hillsborough Families Support Group, had to identify the body. That awful event put the Appeal Court's decision in perspective: "The police might have a hard job, but it was twice as hard for us to identify our children."
<p>
<p>He said he felt sickened by the decision. "Gutted, you could say. I did not think they could win it. When we tried to take legal action we had to prove we had suffered psychological illness... It seems there is one rule for the police and another for the rest. Fans in football shirts were doing exactly the same job as policemen in uniform - some were doing more. They helped the injured. "The cause of all this was lack of police control and yet they are getting compensation. That is just not right."
<p>
<p>Mr Hammond, a Post Office supervisor, was yesterday receiving messages of outrage from some of the families involved.
<p>
<p>One father was at the match with his 14-year-old son. "He was pleading with a policeman to open the gates and he just wouldn't take any notice, just ignored him. I am not saying all the police were like that. Some did well on the day, and I've spoken to the two policemen who helped Philip... I don't have anything against them."
<p>
<p>The support group will consider what further action to take. But many are disillusioned with the legal process, and convinced that the rescue services were ill prepared. Mr Hammond said: "The grieving will go on for us until we get the answers."

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Assaults on staff force closure of Ridings School in Halifax </b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Ridings closes as control is lost  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Wainwright</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The efforts of the Education Secretary, inspectors, the local education authority and teachers to restore order at the Ridings in Halifax blew up in their faces yesterday as the school was closed after a near-riot and assaults on two teachers.  <p>  <p>In the first shutdown of its kind for 20 years, Calderdale education officials abruptly closed the 600-pupil comprehensive to secure the safety of the children and staff and began talks on installing a tougher headteacher and management team.  <p>  <p>The decision came only an hour before the National Association of Schoolmasters and Union of Women Teachers announced a unanimous strike vote by their 31 Ridings members, who claim that 60 violently disruptive pupils have made their job impossible. As the school drifted towards closure, they met in the staffroom after the alleged assaults. Nigel de Gruchy, the union's general secretary, said he would give notice of strike unless disruptive pupils were expelled. He and officials are now combing dossiers on the 60 children to see which they will demand to be permanently excluded. "A number of youngsters must go in order for basic order to be restored. If we don't get that, any teaching is impossible."  <p>  <p>Two days of concentrated disruption led by a core of 12 pupils had coincided with an emergency inspection by the Office for Standards in Education, ordered by Gillian Shephard, the Education Secretary. Damage, verbal abuse and refusal to obey teachers' instructions culminated in the flinging of books at a male staff member and the pinching of a female teacher's bottom. During the emergency union meeting there were further disturbances at the 11-16 school, which is an unhappy two-year-old merger of two rival comprehensives serving three council estates. Children were summoned to an assembly at 2.15pm and given letters from Calderdale education department explaining that an 'unacceptable situation' had taken hold at the school and the safety of pupils and staff could no longer be guaranteed. Headmistress Karen Stansfield and her deputy resigned a month ago following a long-running row over teaching and expulsions.  <p>  <p>Inspectors from the Office for Standards in Education had warned her, the governors and Ian Jennings, Calderdale's chief education officer, that the school was "in danger of getting out of control". Mrs Shephard yesterday demanded action to secure the safety of the children and checks to enable staff to know the whereabouts of all pupils.  <p>  <p>The Ridings' closure is the first of its kind since 1976, when the Inner London Education Authority shut William Tyndale primary school to regain control. Mr Jennings said he had asked councillors to convene the education special sub-committee after receiving news of a series of incidents at the school and a demand from the teachers for immediate action.  <p>  <p>Linda McDermott, whose sons Dennis, aged 13, and Steven, 15, are excluded from the Ridings, condemned the closure as ridiculous. "The teachers are being pathetic - they just don't seem to be able to cope," she said. Governors were last night meeting at Rastrick high school, near Brighouse, whose headteacher Peter Clark has been approached to take over at the Ridings.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Fighting breaks out in Zaire</b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Nation on verge of break-up</h2><h3>Tutsi rebels take Bukavu as Zairean troops flee  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Chris McGreal</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Government soldiers are fleeing eastern Zaire in disarray after losing control of much of the region. One provincial capital has fallen to Tutsi rebels and another, Goma, is on the brink of collapse in the face of a renewed onslaught.  <p>  <p>Tutsi fighters now occupy thousands of square miles, or have at least denied control to the Zairean government, potentially heralding the break-up of one of the largest countries in Africa.  <p>  <p>Banyamulenge rebels have finally seized control of Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province, in less than two weeks of all-out fighting. In neighbouring North Kivu, another group of Tutsi rebels is bearing down on Goma. Heavy machine gun fire and mortars reverberated across the city yesterday. Zairean troops were fighting around the airport about three miles from the city centre.  <p>  <p>The spokesman in Goma for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Panos Moumtzis, told Reuters: "The airport has been taken over. It is confirmed from the Zairean side. Right now there is no movement in town. It is completely deserted." He said aid workers remained inside their offices after heavy fighting since yesterday morning.  <p>  <p>"There is a general feeling of law and order breaking down, with two UNHCR vehicles hijacked this morning. Some aid agency compounds and offices have been attacked by Zairean soldiers and looting is under way," Mr Moumtzis said.  <p>  <p>Reports said shells also landed around Goma from across the border in Rwanda, as happened shortly before the final rebel push on Bukavu. Although Rwanda admits its troops raided Bukavu earlier this week, it continues to insist it is not directly supporting the rebellion.  <p>  <p>Members of the Rwandan Hutu army and extremist militias defeated in 1994, who fled into Zaire after leading the genocide of Tutsis, are fighting alongside local Zairean government troops, but it is unclear how much resistance they are putting up.  <p>  <p>Rebels in both provinces have advanced rapidly over the past fortnight as Zairean soldiers frequently turned and ran, putting up token resistance at best.  <p>  <p>About 100,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees have fled ahead of the rebel advance on Goma, further swelling Mugunga refugee camp to the west of the city. It is already the largest in the world, with about 500,000 people. The UN said 80 per cent of its occupants were women and children. Many others are thought to be caught behind rebel lines.  <p>  <p>With Goma airport closed, and other routes into the city severed by fighting, the UN said it could not provide aid to the refugees. To the south, Banyamulenge rebels have rounded up several thousand refugees and have forced some women and children back to Rwanda.  <p>  <p>The fate of the men is uncertain, but bloated corpses have floated down the Ruzizi River into Lake Tanganyika. Fishermen in neighbouring Burundi say they have buried about 50 bodies, but have seen dozens more float by, some with their hands tied behind their backs, suggesting executions. Goma and Bukavu - with the town of Uvira - were the principal targets of the Tutsi rebels. With two of the three occupied, and the third on the verge of falling, the rebels are close to achieving their initial objectives. But their long-term goals are no clearer.  <p>  <p>* The international tribunal charged with meting out justice for the 500,000 victims of Rwanda's 1994 genocide suffered a setback yesterday when the first defendant sacked his lawyer and appointed another. The new lawyer demanded a six-month postponement, but got only until January. The manoeuvre by Jean-Paul Akayesu, charged with 12 counts of genocide, murder and torture, was seen as another delaying tactic.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Fighting breaks out in Zaire</b><br><br><br><b><h2>9 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>A minefield beneath the UN's boots  </h2>
  <br>Commentary by
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Woollacott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Congo operation in the early Sixties almost destroyed the United Nations. It killed the most formidable Secretary General the organisation has had, pushed the UN into a financial crisis, split the Western powers which had previously consistently supported the world body and almost brought peacekeeping efforts to a permanent end. And, although secession was averted, it helped create the conditions in which one of the worst of Africa's regimes took root and one of the most corrupt dictators took power in what became Zaire.  <p>  <p>The Congo was an object lesson in how international forces can be used and abused by local actors as well as destructively manipulated by outside powers. Three decades later, the UN can be said to be still recovering from the Congo failure. No wonder, then, that the UN and most countries capable of doing so are reluctant to rush troops to Central Africa.  <p>  <p>The deployment of an international force to the region threatens to involve the troops, their commanders, the civilian aid workers and the UN itself in not one, not two, not even three, but in four wars. The first is the Rwanda war whose original spilling over into Zaire, in the shape of hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees, began this crisis. The second is the Burundi war, which has overlapped with the Rwanda fight from the beginning but which has intensified since the coup there earlier this year. The third is the local war in eastern Zaire between Zairean troops and Hutu extremists from the camps and local people of Tutsi ethnicity. The fourth is the potential fight in Zaire itself, with a range of opposition groups based inside and outside the country contending for the succession to President Mobutu Sese Seko. The most substantial are represented in the capital and pursue a legal path, but one group, of indeterminate strength, is trying to exploit the vacuum in the eastern borderlands and is looking for an alliance of convenience with the Rwandan regime.  <p>  <p>How serious such armed seekers of power are is not yet clear. But, in the substantial lifetime of a UN military operation, and given Mobutu's state of health, they might become serious, even if they are not so today. The eagerness with which the parties are signalling their readiness for an international force is an index of the difficulties that may arise. For all concerned see the establishment of a UN force in eastern Zaire as a development they could use to their advantage. Mobutu was saved from virtually complete international isolation when Hutu refugees crossed his border in huge numbers two years ago. He underwent a quasi-rehabilitation as UN agencies and Western governments were forced to seek his co-operation. Now his troops have been pushed out of parts of eastern Zaire by forces marginally better organised than his are. It might be better for him if UN troops were in charge rather than his enemies. Mobutu's main opposition, significantly, is against a UN force, portraying him as a man selling the country out to foreigners and allowing the establishment of a 'Hutuland' in the north-east.  <p>  <p>The Rwandan government remains hostile to a force led by France, the power keenest to intervene, because of its experience in 1994 when the action of French forces, whether by design or inadvertence, led to the escape of most of the Hutu leadership and its military forces. It now says it will accept a force if it is 'neutral'. The interest of the Rwandan leaders lies in any development which will help them destroy armed Hutu opponents and to deprive those opponents of a population base of refugees, which they can tax, recruit and propagandise. It would be served either by the repatriation of the refugees or by the flight of the refugees into the interior of Zaire, out of effective range of the Rwandan border, or by a combination of the two. A buffer force of UN troops which either kept the refugees distant from the border or effectively filtered out armed elements before returning refugees to Zaire would be in their best hope.  <p>  <p>What would not be in their interests would be a restoration of the situation in which the aid agencies were keeping one million or more Hutu refugees alive but were also subsidising and assisting the extremists who dominated the camps, raided into both Rwanda and Burundi and nursed long-term ambitions of reversing their defeats in both of those countries. What followed was a covert Rwandan campaign to disrupt the extremists. This disruption, it ought to be said, should, in the broadest view, be welcomed, because the prospect of an endless ethnic war across the international borders is a horrific one and the prospect of an extremist re-entry in force into Rwanda even more so. But it has already led to great suffering and could lead to more. The question is how to relieve that suffering without recreating a safe haven for killers as well as for kids.  <p>  <p>The tangle of ambitions and interests - life-and-death matters to those concerned - means that the despatch of an international force to Zaire is a truly difficult undertaking. It would have to be a determined, sophisticated effort, aimed at humanitarian relief but with the wariest of eyes cocked on the local actors who, within hours of the first troops flying in, would begin to exert pressures, some crude and some subtle, to bend the new arrivals to their purposes.  <p>  <p>In everything from the siting of a refugee camp or a military base to the choice of interpreters or food suppliers, such a force can so easily be subverted or infiltrated, as Somalia showed. Its political advisors would be more important than its military directors. Above all it would have to bear in mind that it might well find itself embroiled not only in the affairs of Hutus and Tutsis in three countries but in the future of Zaire, the second-biggest country in sub-Saharan Africa and arguably the most politically devastated state in the continent.  <p>  <p>Hundreds of thousands of people are on the move. Some have already died. Just one or two days without water or proper food or shelter, as dismal experience in many countries shows, begins the process of culling children and the old or ailing. The Red Cross president, Cornelio Sommaruga, said yesterday that there was "no other option" to the despatch of an international force which could create the secure conditions to enable relief to again reach the refugees. The French continue to push. John Major, after his meeting with Jacques Chirac, allows that the despatch of British troops is a possibility. The US administration must now consider its choices, because no African operation of this size is conceivable without at least US logistical support.  <p>  <p>The balance is shifting toward the despatch of some kind of UN force. Given the human need, that can hardly be opposed. But let it be done with care, with skill and with political sophistication. For the UN, Zaire, of all countries, is not a place in which to repeat the mistakes of the past.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Fighting breaks out in Zaire</b><br><br><br><b><h2>13 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Cholera epidemic "could wipe out 250,000"  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Buchizya Mseteka</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Cholera has broken out at a hillside settlement of about 250,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees near Bukavu in eastern Zaire and could kill many within days, a doctor said yesterday.  <p>  <p>Walter Bonifazio, a member of the UN-funded Doctors in Catastrophic Situations, said the refugees were trapped in Mwenga, 120 miles west of rebel-held Bukavu, east Zaire.  <p>  <p>"Cholera broke out at Mwenga on Saturday night, but there is also dysentery and malnutrition. This, put together with the conditions of the 250,000 people, is like putting fuel on fire," Dr Bonifazio said in Kigali. "The human loss will be impossible to calculate, it is a bomb, a very big bomb, and the people will die like flies unless help reaches them soon." He said the 250,000 people at Mwenga were being held hostage by the former Rwandan Hutu militia and troops of Rwanda's ousted Hutu army and the Zairean army.  <p>  <p>Dr Bonifazio was evacuated from Bukavu last month. His information is based on radio reports reaching colleagues still working at Bukavu hospital. Cholera killed at least 30,000 refugees within weeks when more than a million Hutus fled from Rwanda into eastern Zaire in 1994 after the genocide by Hutu extremists of up to a million Tutsis and others.  <p>  <p>Aid workers say thousands of refugees have already died in eastern Zaire, and even if a UN force brought aid today many more would be too sick to be saved.  <p>  <p>The aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres estimated that 1,000 were dying every day.  <p>  <p>* A fourth Spanish missionary has been presumed murdered in the Bukavu area of Zaire, where they were aiding refugees fleeing fighting in eastern Africa, the Spanish foreign ministry said.  <p>  <p>Although the body had not been found he was believed to be dead, said Adolfo Varas Garcia of the Marist order in Madrid.  <p>  <p>After the announcement, the foreign ministry asked the 39 Spanish missionaries working in the North Kivu and South Kivu areas of Zaire to return to Spain.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>GDN 14 Nov 96 Mission to save million lives: Clinton agrees to send US troops into Zaire as part of multinational force. Britain may send 3,500 soldiers to join relief drive (946)   <p>  <p>By Martin Walker in Washington, Ian Black in London and John Palmer in Brussels  <p>  <p>President Bill Clinton yesterday agreed, under intense international pressure, to send United States troops to Zaire as part of a multinational force under overall Canadian command, with neither its precise objectives nor rules of engagement clearly defined.  <p>  <p>Britain followed suit by saying it was ready to contribute "constructively" to the international effort, "providing a satisfactory plan can be worked out" for dealing with an unprecedented humanitarian relief mission to more than a million refugees caught up in fighting by Tutsi rebels in Zaire. John Major said later: "We will contribute, we will definitely send troops." But he said their number, the scope of the mission and its "exit strategy" were yet to be decided.  <p>  <p>The Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, said: "The United Kingdom is prepared to play its part, including a military contribution, to help deal with the humanitarian aid, to get food, medical aid and shelter to the refugees."  <p>  <p>If crucial issues can be resolved at a meeting of potential contributors at the United Nations in New York today, thousands of troops from north America, Europe and African countries could be heading for the Great Lakes region of central Africa by the end of this week.  <p>  <p>The rapid deterioration of conditions in Zaire has led to chaotic military planning. As the standby orders went out last night from the Pentagon, which is to send up to 5,000 troops - 1,000 into Zaire and the rest in logistical and support roles - commanders were still uncertain of their brief. The defence department said the mission would not exceed four months. The Defence Secretary, William Perry, said: "Our mission will be to secure Goma airport [in eastern Zaire], and then open and secure a [three-mile] land corridor to the main refugee area, to bring food and medical relief to this terrible humanitarian tragedy."  <p>  <p>The White House spokesman, Mike McCurry, insisted yesterday: "The mission is not to disarm militants, nor to conduct any forced entry into the area, nor to police refugee camps."  <p>  <p>But commanders wondered whether they would have to impose a local ceasefire and establish and police a humanitarian zone. Some basic aims of the mission are not yet agreed, such as whether the troops will shepherd refugees back into Rwanda, or deeper into Zaire.  <p>  <p>Rwanda's president, Pasteur Bizimungu, warned yesterday that intervention would get "messy" unless rebels in control of eastern Zaire were consulted. US ambivalence about the UN and multinational operations means Mr Clinton's decision carries huge political risks. It could end the post-election honeymoon with the Republican Congress. Haunted by the humanitarian mission to Somalia, which veered out of control in his first months in office, Mr Clinton was talked into the mission by Canada's prime minister, Jean Chretien.  <p>  <p>After a long night of negotiations in the Pentagon, General Maurice Baril, the commander of Canadian ground forces, secured a rare agreement by Washington early yesterday to put its forces under Canadian operational command. They will remain under US tactical command.  <p>  <p>But the US insisted on 'robust' rules of engagement. They will be allowed not only to defend themselves, but to patrol aggressively to ensure they are not attacked.  <p>  <p>The logistical challenge of flying in troops and equipment, and food and medicine for a million refugees, into an area with few roads and dilapidated airfields - where cholera vies with Aids as a health hazard for the troops - "will make Somalia look like a tea party", one Pentagon officer told the Guardian yesterday. "We are looking at literally hundreds of C-5 [cargo plane] airlifts," he added.  <p>  <p>"Every second counts," Emma Bonino, the European Union's humanitarian aid commissioner, told the European Parliament yesterday. "If it [the mission] arrives in three weeks, it will have a lot of work burying corpses, but not much else."  <p>  <p>The mission is to be tripartite. There will be a north American contingent of some 1,500 Canadian troops and two US logistics and communications battalions, protected by US paratroops.  <p>  <p>The European contingent is expected to have British, French and Spanish troops, with the Netherlands and Belgium providing logistical support. Although no British units have yet been placed on standby, the most likely option is a light brigade of about 3,500 troops, drawn primarily from 45 Commando Royal Marines and the 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment. France said yesterday it was prepared to send 600 paratroopers to Zaire within 24 hours of UN approval of the mission, and 600 more a day later. It is also making available its bases in west and central Africa. The WEU, still embryonic as the eventual European pillar of Nato, will undergo its first big test when officials meet in Belgium on Monday to co-ordinate.  <p>  <p>European countries are expected to foot the bulk of the bill and provide equipment and training for the African contingent, whose participation is seen as essential politically. The main local contingent will be South African, with token units expected from Mali, Ethiopia, Cameroon, Senegal, Eritrea and Congo.  <p>  <p>The UN Security Council was planning a special session last night to give a formal mandate to the effort, not as a Nato mission, but as an unprecedented "multinational force under Canadian command".  <p>  <p>US officials told the Guardian they expected their part of the mission to be "very limited in time, to establish the conditions in which the African countries will be able to take over on the ground and create the space for a longer-term political settlement."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Glenn Hoddle includes Gazza in the England squad</b><br><br><br><b><h2>1 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Hoddle sticks by Gascoigne  </h2>
  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Thorpe</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Glenn Hoddle will this morning risk the wrath of women's groups and some football critics by including Paul Gascoigne in his squad for England's World Cup qualifier in Georgia.  <p>  <p>Questions have been raised about the appropriateness of allowing Gascoigne to represent his country, especially abroad, following allegations that he had beaten up his wife Sheryl two weeks ago.  <p>  <p>But after lengthy discussions, including a final meeting yesterday between Hoddle, the Football Association's chairman Keith Wiseman and its chief executive Graham Kelly, it was agreed to back the England coach's decision to pick the errant Rangers midfielder for the game on 9 November. Several factors are said to have persuaded Hoddle not to allow Gascoigne's private affairs to influence what is considered to be a footballing decision. Sources close to Hoddle say that the coach's main concern has always been for Gascoigne and his family, and he had noted that no one, not even Sheryl Gascoigne, had complained to the police about the alleged incident.  <p>  <p>Second, it is understood that Hoddle's discussions with Gascoigne and others close to him have presented a more complicated picture surrounding the allegations than originally surfaced. Third, Gascoigne is reported to be seeking professional help.  <p>  <p>However, even an explanation of all these factors when the squad is announced in London this morning is unlikely to silence critics of the decision to include Gascoigne.  <p>  <p>Julie Bindel, spokeswoman for an international conference on violence and abuse against women, said yesterday: "I would very much object to him being given any elevated public position after this. Glenn Hoddle would be giving a message out to other players that he doesn't take it seriously. To take this attitude to domestic violence is to minimise the effect it has on women and deny the fact that it's a criminal act by someone who is a public figure and a role model for boys and young men."  <p>  <p>Sandra Horley, chief executive of the women's rights campaigners Refuge, agreed. "He doesn't seem to have a genuine desire to alter his behaviour or publicly acknowledge that it's wrong for any man to hit his wife under any circumstances," she said.  <p>  <p>"He's a national hero and a role model for youngsters and, if it is true that Gazza beat up his wife, then sending him to represent England overseas can only give the impression that wife-beating is acceptable in the UK." The decision to include Gascoigne was taken after lengthy talks between the parties concerned, with Hoddle speaking on numerous occasions to the player, his Rangers manager Walter Smith and other close associates. It was never a case of the FA imposing a decision on Hoddle even though it possesses that ultimate power. As Hoddle conducted his detailed investigations into Gascoigne's form, fitness, state of mind and the allegations against the player, he liaised regularly with Wiseman. It might also be argued that the critics are once again picking on Gascoigne. Nobody is condemning any inclusion in the England squad of Arsenal's Paul Merson. His wife Lorraine recently revealed that the day after England's last game against Poland she had a blazing row with the reforming alcoholic.  <p>  <p>"He said he'd kill me," she claimed. "I went cold with shock because I realised he could be like this when he was sober. I couldn't believe the old monster was back. I can't cope with the fear of him hitting me again."   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>John Duncan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>For years Paul Gascoigne's talents on the football field have allowed him to shrug off the image of foul-mouthed boozer and ill-disciplined clown prone to wild binges. But few have been prepared to forgive and forget the recent allegations that he beat up his wife in a Scottish hotel last month - except born-again Christian and England manager Glen Hoddle.  <p>  <p>Hoddle's decision to include Gascoigne in the England squad for their next World Cup qualifying game in Georgia has outraged women's groups. "Hoddle has clearly shown that football and winning a match is more important than the safety of women," said Julie Bindel, spokeswoman for an international conference on violence and abuse of women. "It is an outrage that he is to be made a national hero in this way, and that he will be even more of a role model for many boys and young men."  <p>  <p>"Allowing Gascoigne to represent England can only give the impression that it is all right to beat your wife," said Sandra Horley, chief executive of Refuge.  <p>  <p>Gascoigne - who has confessed previously to violence against his wife Sheryl before their marriage - is reported to have headbutted her and dislocated three of her fingers in an attack at a Gleneagles hotel on 13 October. But Hoddle, who also called up Tony Adams (a recovering alcoholic who once went to prison for drunk driving) and Paul Merson (who has battled against gambling, cocaine and alcohol addiction) defended the decision. "My assessment is that Paul should be in my squad for the Georgia game on merit," he said. "At no time have I - or would I - condone what Paul has done. I expect high standards. I also accept that people are human. Paul knows he has to change in the long term. My aim is to do nothing in the short term that might turn out to be unhelpful in the future. One of the prime examples that Jesus spoke about was forgiveness in the long term, not just the short term."  <p>  <p>But straw polls taken yesterday suggest people have turned against Gascoigne. Almost two thirds (64 per cent) of 2,000 callers to a Radio Five Live poll said Hoddle was wrong to include Gascoigne. In a similar poll of 1,000 people for Teletext, 71 per cent said Hoddle should not have picked Gascoigne.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Glenn Hoddle includes Gazza in the England squad</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>The greater glory game</h2><h3>What are the implications when the holder of an important national post feels guided by God?   </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Mark Lawson</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Faced with the question of whether a controversial player should continue to be selected for the team, football managers generally take the precaution of consulting a higher authority. Most speak to the Football Association. Glenn Hoddle - almost certainly - spoke to God.  <p>  <p>The deep religious beliefs of the England football coach have added an extra dimension to the debate over whether Hoddle was right to include Paul Gascoigne - who has admitted physically assaulting his wife, Sheryl - in the squad for England's World Cup qualifying match against Georgia next Saturday. What are the implications when the holder of an important national post believes himself guided by a higher being? Does a declared Christian have an obligation to impose high moral standards on those with whom he works? And - given these questions - might the Gascoigne row be a foretaste of a problem soon to be presented in British politics?  <p>  <p>I recently interviewed Hoddle about his religious beliefs and their application to his job for a BBC1 series, 'The Big Question'. A clear sense emerged of the relationship between Hod and God, in the context of which the manager's controversial decision to stand by Gazza may be easier to understand.  <p>  <p>In his final years as a player, Hoddle became known as the only footballer likely to suffer knee injuries as result of sustained prayer rather than ill-timed tackles. Raised in an averagely apathethic Anglican household, he came to serious religious belief only at the age of 28.  <p>  <p>The England team - for whom Hoddle won 50 caps as an exceptionally elegant and inventive midfielder - was playing Israel in Jerusalem. In the months before this fixture, the footballer, by now a millionaire with all the material rewards offered by a modern sporting career, had been feeling restless and empty. In Israel, between training sessions, there was an excursion to Bethlehem, where, as Hoddle tells it, he "felt, all I can say, a real spiritual feeling inside of me and it was exhilarating and I came back from that trip and I really searched myself and searched different books: the Bible, Eastern philosophies, the whole lot really." The circumstances of this conversion - a sudden flash in adulthood - precisely fit the usual profile of born-again Christianity and Hoddle, soon after joining the God squad, appeared in a video for the evangelical outfit Christians in Sport. However, he now rejects the label 'born-again'. He thinks "Jesus is very important, the best example we have of how to lead our lives" but he refuses to accept, as evangelicals do, that only those who turn to Jesus can be saved. There are 'many paths'. He attends church only every three or four months. Prayer and reflection are more important than ritual.  <p>  <p>Hoddle's spirituality is most concerned with the relationship between mind and body. The revelation before the Israel game in 1986 connected with experiences Hoddle had been having as a footballer. While most players treated the numerous injuries of a professional career with ice-packs, physiotherapy and ultrasound, Hoddle, since the age of 18, had been consulting faith-healers, with what he believes to have been success. It began when he limped round to see an early girlfriend, Michelle. He was suffering from a torn hamstring which had been diagnosed to require a seven-week rest. Michelle's mum, Eileen, offered him the laying on of hands. A sceptical Glenn declined but Eileen promised 'absent healing' instead. Next morning, he claims, "I was digging my fingers into the hamstring injury as far as I could and there was nothing there. I couldn't believe it and I phoned up and said: 'What happened?' And she said she'd done absent healing for me. I found it difficult going into the ground because they must have thought I'd been conning them."  <p>  <p>Hoddle admits that, as manager at Swindon, Chelsea and now England, he recommends Eileen and other faith-healers to injured players. The late great philosopher Sir Alfred Ayer was a well-known football fan and it is perhaps a good thing that the celebrated rationalist was spared the advent of an England manager who believed in this kind of thing.  <p>  <p>There is little intellectual reasoning behind his beliefs. Asked why God would intervene - through faith-healing - in order to heal a midfield player's groin strain before Saturday's big match, while neglecting to prevent famine, earthquakes or plane crashes, he can only resort to New Age vagueness: "If we all lived very close to God, if we all had a spiritual life, every single person on this planet, I am pretty well sure that there'd be no such thing as earthquakes, there would be no such thing as people blowing people out of the sky, would there? There wouldn't be any war." His convictions are instinctive, rather than cerebral. They are, however, deep and central to his character. Last week, a former team-mate of Hoddle described him as a "special, lovely person". It is easy to cringe at this - to feel that the language of theatre has been improbably transported to the playing fields - but it is possible to understand what was meant. There is an air of serenity about Hoddle, a sense of quiet strength; a quality, even, of goodness. Unlike some public Christians, he has nothing sanctimonious about him. Of the 13 people I have interviewed during two series of The Big Question, Hoddle and Bishop Desmond Tutu were the two who - at quite different levels of theological reasoning - gave a real sense of spiritual strength and a sincere personal apprehension of a higher power. There are two areas in which the religious faith of a football manager might matter: one trivial, one fundamental. The trifling question of soccer theology concerns the matter of whether God knows or affects the score. Yet this is not entirely a minor matter. The cricketer Imran Khan told me in an earlier interview that he believed Allah had intervened directly to give Pakistan victory in the 1992 cricket World Cup, even to the extent of manipulating rainfall.  <p>  <p>Hoddle believes he was 'guided' by God to take the England job. So the obvious question arises of whether it would be theologically proper to pray during a penalty shoot-out - the sporting torment on which the careers of two of his predecessors as England manager, Bobby Robson and Terry Venables, came to depend. Here, I'm afraid, there is bad news if the FA appointed Hoddle on the basis that only divine assistance could revive England's footballing fortunes.  <p>  <p>"I don't think God cares too much about who's going to win the World Cup," he said. "I think, if there's something behind it, there might be a lesson there for a nation or whatever..."  <p>  <p>"But the lesson might be failure?"  <p>  <p>"Well, of course."  <p>  <p>"But, if you have a faith, as you do, there must be a temptation, when the next Gareth Southgate steps up to the penalty spot, to say: 'Go on, give me this one' ."  <p>  <p>"No. I tell you what I'd do there. I would give the player every good thought, or prayer if you like. But human mistakes come in to it. And that's what makes it so intriguing, not just in football but in life. What I wouldn't do is to put out a negative thought to the goalkeeper. I think that's wrong."  <p>  <p>This kind of speculation is merely amusing: how many wingers can dribble on the end of a pin? The far more serious implications of a Christian presiding over the national side have been seen in recent days. If Hoddle so publicly espouses a creed of decency and good behaviour, should he not also demand such standards of his players?  <p>  <p>Our conversation took place before the wife-beating allegations against Paul Gascoigne, but I asked the question in the context of the England team's alleged violent and drunken behaviour on a tour of the Far East and the confessed addictions - to drugs, alcohol or gambling - of many players, including Paul Merson and Tony Adams.  <p>  <p>"Christianity isn't all about being nicey-nicey," Hoddle replied. "There's a time when you have to let people know what you're thinking, and if it's not particularly good then you have to tell them and they have to become a better player or a better person. I've said it already to the England players that there's a line to be drawn. So we'll see how we go. But that line's pretty flexible. Every individual circumstance would have to be taken into consideration. The reasons why it was done, if there was a problem there... If a manager has a faith, he might be able to help other people face their problems, he might send someone on a new way of life, a new path."  <p>  <p>Women who have suffered domestic violence or campaign against it assume that Hoddle is cynically ignoring the fact that a man is a wife-beater because he might be a sporting world-beater. In fact, it is more likely that the coach has set himself to save Gazza's soul. This may be a naive or hopeless or religiose ambition but it is the polar opposite of cynicism. It is possible, though, that the debate over the possible conflict between Hoddle's beliefs and the company he keeps may have wider implications. Some time within the next six months, it is highly possible that another high-profile Christian, Tony Blair, will take charge of another important national team: the Cabinet.  <p>  <p>There is no evidence that the higher levels of the Labour Party contain any alcoholic wife-beaters but it is nearly certain that, at some point, a senior colleague of Blair would fall from grace, because of some private or public irregularity. And the Prime Minister would find, as the English coach has found in recent days, the boss's professed religious beliefs being quoted against the miscreant. How, the newspapers will ask, can a man of God stand by such a person?  <p>  <p>Blair, who will be judged by opinion polls, might well decide in such circumstances to put earthly power before heavenly glory and drop the wrongdoer. Hoddle, who is judged only be results, has opted to be the Good Samaritan.  <p>  <p>He would see this as one of Christianity's hard choices but the risk is being seen - by those who fall victim to his players' demons and by the press - as a soft touch or a hypocrite.  <p>  <p>Glenn Hoddle, incidentally, also believes strongly in reincarnation. He must wonder what a certain soul did wrong to deserve being sent back to Earth this time round as Paul Gascoigne.  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

George VI's Coronation gave the nation its first taste of a shared TV experience.   <p>  <p>1938 Reception was confined to London and just 5,000 sets had been sold. <p>  <p>1939 Television service was suspended for defence reasons, bowing out, without explanation, midway through a Mickey Mouse cartoon. It was thought the mast at Alexandra Palace would attract enemy bombers.  <p>  <p>1946 Leslie Mitchell reopened television with the words "As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted." Introduction of a &#163;2 TV and radio licence. Regular children's programmes began with 'For The Children' and 'Muffin The Mule'.  <p>  <p>1947 Government closed down TV for a month because of a fuel crisis in the severe winter.  <p>  <p>1948 There were more than 17 hours of live coverage of the Olympics from London (there were more than 300 from Atlanta '96).  <p>  <p>1950 First live television from Europe. 'Watch With Mother' began with the arrival of 'Andy Pandy'.  <p>  <p>1951 'What's My Line?' began with Gilbert Harding in the chair - a survey revealed 90 per cent of those with sets watched it.  <p>  <p>1952 'Bill And Ben, The Flowerpot Men', were accused of imparing children's speech development.  <p>  <p>1953 20 million viewers watched seven hours of live coverage of the Coronation.  <p>  <p>1954 Richard Baker, out of vision, read the first BBC TV news bulletin. Until then cinema newsreels or recordings of radio bulletins had been used. <p>  <p>1955 ITV was launched and dismissed by Sir Winston Churchill as "this tuppenny Punch and Judy show".  <p>  <p>1956 'Hancock's Half-Hour' was transferred from radio.  <p>  <p>1957 The Toddler's Truce - the hour when TV went off the air at 6pm so parents could get children to bed - came to an end.  <p>  <p>1958 'Blue Peter' set sail, initially once a week.  <p>  <p>1960 Television Centre, at White City, west London, was opened. Ten million people now had TV licences.  <p>  <p>1962 Television satire was born with 'That Was The Week That Was'.   <p>  <p>1963 BBC ended ban on mentioning politics, royalty, religion and sex in its comedy programmes.  <p>  <p>1964 BBC2 was launched after being blacked out by a power cut on its opening night.  <p>  <p>1965 Kenneth Tynan became the first person to use the word "fuck" on television.  <p>  <p>1966 'The War Game', featuring a dramatised nuclear attack, was banned by the BBC - and not screened for a further 19 years.  <p>  <p>1967 Colour transmissions began on BBC2, coming to BBC1 two years later. <p>  <p>1969 The fly-on-the-wall documentary on the royal family irreversibly changed the relationship between monarchy and media.  <p>  <p>1971 The Open University was born.  <p>  <p>1972 The slow growth of cable television began in Greenwich, covering 9,000 homes.  <p>  <p>1973 The fuel crisis took TV off the air each night at 10.20pm.   <p>  <p>1974 Modern documentary methods were born in 'The Family', which made a working-class Reading family the subject of a 12-part series.   <p>  <p>1977 Televisions capable of receiving Ceefax and Oracle went on sale for &#163;500.  <p>  <p>1979 BBC dominated ratings during the 11-week ITV strike.  <p>  <p>1981 39 million people watched the wedding of Charles and Diana, and sales of video recorders doubled.  <p>  <p>1982 The launch of Channel 4 increased terrestrial competition.   <p>  <p>1983 BBC won the breakfast television race, launching 'Breakfast Time' with Frank Bough and Selina Scott, two weeks before TV-am.  <p>  <p>1985 'EastEnders' provided the BBC with a popular soap to rival ITV's long-running 'Coronation Street'.  <p>  <p>1987 Upheaval with the sacking of Alasdair Milne, BBC director general, after the Real Lives and Maggie's Militant Tendency embarrassments. 1989 Rupert Murdoch's Sky Television and the ill-fated British Satellite Broadcasting transformed the TV landscape.  <p>  <p>1991 A revolution came to listings magazines, with the ending of the Radio Times/TV Times duopoly.  <p>  <p>1992 The BBC launched 'Eldorado', its most disastrous soap.  <p>  <p>1993 John Birt became director-general with a radical shake-up of the BBC's management and a row over his tax affairs.  <p>  <p>1994 BBC signed a strategic alliance with Pearson to develop global commercial ventures.  <p>  <p>1995 'Panorama' discarded its staid image to deliver a sensationally frank interview with the Princess of Wales.  <p>  <p>1996 John Birt announced a revolution in programme-making, putting TV and radio together in bi-media Broadcast and Production directorates.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Andrew Culf</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Viewers last night snubbed the golden age of television and voted for modern day favourites in a national poll to mark the BBC's 60th anniversary. Situation comedies, including 'Fawlty Towers' and 'Dad's Army', were eclipsed by the laddish series 'Men Behaving Badly' in the vote by more than half a million viewers.  <p>  <p>Names from television history, such as Richard Dimbleby, lost out to Desmond Lynam in the favourite presenter category.  <p>  <p>Viewers chose last year's adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' in preference to classic serials including 'The Forsyte Saga', 'I Claudius' and 'Pennies from Heaven'.  <p>  <p>The favourite actor award was picked up by Colin Firth, who played Mr Darcy in 'Pride and Prejudice', beating off competition from Alan Bates and Sir Alec Guinness.  <p>  <p>Auntie's All Time Greats, a gala awards ceremony screened on BBC1 last night, was organised to celebrate 60 years of British television. Viewers were invited to vote by telephone in 11 categories, choosing from shortlists drawn up by television writers and senior industry figures. The surprising bias against classics of yesteryear will have delighted BBC executives, battling to convince the Government of the case for an above-inflation increase in the licence fee.  <p>  <p>However, eyebrows will be raised at many of the results. There were suggestions that well-organised 'Doctor Who' fan clubs helped propel the time traveller into the winning position for favourite popular drama, ahead of 'Casualty' and 'EastEnders'. 'Doctor Who', revived for a one-off film this year, was exterminated by the BBC in 1989.  <p>  <p>The comedy partnership of 'Morecambe and Wise', which ended with Eric Morecambe's death in 1984, did, however, receive two awards. The programme - which attracted 20 million-plus audiences for its Christmas specials in the 1970s - was voted favourite light entertainment series. The pair were also favourite light entertainment performers.  <p>  <p>Joan Morecambe, Eric's widow, who was presented with one of the 'Auntie' awards - a bronze sculpture modelled on the statue of Helios, the Greek sun god, which stands at the centre of Television Centre - said: "He would have been chuffed. He had great affection for the BBC."  <p>  <p>Ronnie Barker, star of 'Porridge' and 'Open All Hours', was given a special lifetime achievement in comedy award.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>Favourite situation comedy performer  <br>Winner: David Jason  <br>Losers: John Cleese, Tony Hancock, Arthur Lowe, Eric Sykes  <p>  <p>Favourite comedy performer  <br>Winner: Victoria Wood  <br>Losers: John Cleese, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore, Spike Milligan   <p>  <p>Favourite light entertainment series  <br>Winner: 'Morecambe and Wise'  <br>Losers: 'Dave Allen at Large', 'Mike Yarwood in Persons'  <p>  <p>Favourite actor  <br>Winner: Colin Firth  <br>Losers: Alan Bates, Alec Guinness, Robert Hardy, Derek Jacobi   <p>  <p>Favourite drama serial  <br>Winner: 'Pride and Prejudice'  <br>Losers: 'Edge of Darkness', 'I Claudius', 'Pennies from Heaven', 'The Forsyte Saga', 'Six Wives of Henry VIII'  <p>  <p>Favourite comedy series  <br>Winner: 'Victoria Wood As Seen on TV'  <br>Losers: 'Monty Python', 'Not The Nine O'Clock News', 'That Was The Week That Was' <p>  <p>Favourite actress  <br>Winner: Patricia Routledge  <br>Losers: Judi Dench, Thora Hird, Glenda Jackson, Juliet Stevenson   <p>  <p>Favourite situation comedy  <br>Winner: 'Men Behaving Badly'  <br>Losers: 'Dad's Army', 'Fawlty Towers', 'Only Fools and Horses', 'Steptoe and Son', 'Till Death Us Do Part', 'Whatever Happened to the Likely Lads', 'Yes Minister' <p>  <p>Favourite presenter  <br>Winner: Desmond Lynam  <br>Losers: David Attenborough, Robin Day, Richard Dimbleby  <p>  <p>Favourite popular drama  <br>Winner: 'Doctor Who'  <br>Losers: 'Casualty', 'Colditz', 'EastEnders', 'The Onedin Line', 'When the Boat Comes In', 'Z Cars'  <p>  <p>Favourite light entertainment performer  <br>Winner: 'Morecambe and Wise'  <br>Losers: 'Dave Allen', 'The Two Ronnies', 'Les Dawson'  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Owen Bowcott</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The furore over the Duchess of York's tangled private life flared up again yesterday amid claims she would have committed suicide but for her young daughters.  <p>  <p>The claims are contained in 'Fergie: Her Secret Life' by the former confidant of the duchess Dr Allan Starkie. Extracts are published in the Daily Mail this week.  <p>  <p>Dr Starkie, a friend of her former 'financial adviser' John Bryan, recalls her comment: "If it weren't for the children the only answer would be to kill myself."  <p>  <p>The duchess was reported to have been distraught over her soaring overdraft and the emotional struggle between Mr Bryan and her husband, Prince Andrew. The book describes how she turned into "a woman no longer quite in control" and became "driven by fear and lust".  <p>  <p>The Daily Mail says Dr Starkie kept a copious diary, and the duchess once told him: "One day you'll write such a marvellous book about it." Earlier this year the duchess attempted to halt the book's publication with an injunction. Four weeks ago she dropped the action after she was ordered to pay &#163;500,000 into court in case she lost the case.  <p>  <p>After her lawsuit collapsed, the duchess was said to have telephoned the New York Times to deny 'vicious rumours' that the Queen considered her a suicide risk.  <p>  <p>Her spokesman, Howard Rubinstein, said yesterday: "I don't think the Duchess of York ever said anything about killing herself. It was patently the last thing on her mind. It's ridiculous."  <p>  <p>The Duchess of York's own autobiography 'My Story', is due out on 14 November . Hello! magazine yesterday confirmed it had bought serialisation rights and would run extracts next week.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Kamal Ahmed</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Duchess of York has admitted that she was unfit to be a member of the royal family and that the "barely veiled" hostility of Buckingham Palace courtiers hastened the end of her marriage to Prince Andrew. The duchess's claims, in part similar to those made by Diana, the Princess of Wales, have thrown more light on the power of the royal family when faced by an 'unsuitable' member.  <p>  <p>The duchess, in an extract from her autobiography 'My Story' serialised in Hello! magazine today, says she always saw herself as the 'Cinderella' of the family and that pictures of her cavorting naked with John Bryan, her financial adviser, ruined any chances of cementing her role in the monarchy. "Even at my dizzy height of popularity I knew the clock would strike 12 and I'd be seen for what I was; unworthy, unattractive, unaccomplished," she says.  <p>  <p>"From early on that year [1992] Andrew and I had been discussing separation, not because we stopped caring for one another but because I had reached the end of my royal rope. "For six years I had endured the constant scrutiny of the British press and the barely veiled hostility of the royal household, the courtiers who run the show. Gradually, relentlessly they had beaten me down. They were killing me by inches."  <p>  <p>The duchess says the Queen gave her a furious dressing down because of the damage the Bryan pictures did to the monarchy. "The clock was chiming, nine, 10, 11. My coach was reverting to pumpkinhood before my eyes." After she heard that the pictures were going to be published, she spent a sleepless night sipping brandy before the newspapers were delivered to Balmoral where the royal family was on holiday. She describes Prince Charles, the Princess Royal and Prince Edward "eyes wide and mouths ajar" flipping through the tabloid newspapers over breakfast "until they saw Andrew and stopped, as it never feels quite right to be gazing at your brother's wife when she hasn't all her clothes on".  <p>  <p>"I had been exposed for what I truly was. Worthless. Unfit. A national disgrace."  <p>  <p>Buckingham Palace declined to comment, but Ben Pimlott, author of a recent biography of the Queen, said: "A period of silence would probably be greatly appreciated. Buckingham Palace would prefer her to vanish."  <p>  <p>The duchess's book comes as 'Fergie: Her Secret Life', by Allan Starkie, a former friend, is published, on Friday. The duchess attempted to have the book, which details her affairs with Mr Bryan and Steve Wyatt, the son of an American oil-tycoon, withdrawn but had to drop her legal action when she was asked to lodge &#163;500,000 as security in case she lost. The duchess is reported to have debts totalling &#163;4.8m.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Furore over Allan Starkie's book about the Duchess of York</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Fergie's final chapter</h2><h3>After the lurid revelations of former friends and lovers, it is now the Duchess of York's turn to tell all about her fraught life at the palace  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Kamal Ahmed</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Sheila Penrose was queuing patiently, her &#163;1.35 clutched in her hand. Under her arm was Hello! magazine and the soft focus cover-picture of the Duchess of York, all green imploring eyes and coiffured, though still stylishly messy hair. "I just wanted to hear what she had to say for a change," Mrs Penrose said as the queue at the King's Cross newsagents in London shuffled forward. "Everyone else has had a go. Why not give her a chance?"  <p>  <p>After Madame Vasso, Dr Allan Starkie. After Starkie, the duchess herself. After stories of wishing death upon the royal family, sex and debt, new revelations of battered women, farcical domestic arrangements and, of course, more sex. And lurking there in the background is Buckingham Palace, staffed by overbearing courtiers who rid themselves of Diana and have meted out the same treatment to the duchess. That, at least, is how the wives of Windsor see it.  <p>  <p>The duchess is back in the thick of it - if she has ever been away. This week Hello! began serialising her autobiography in which the duchess admits she was unfit to be a member of the royal family and that the mighty power of the palace drove her away from Prince Andrew.  <p>  <p>This week also, and it is no coincidence, Starkie, one-time confidante and close friend of John Bryan, her former lover, revealed himself as the duchess's latest colleague-turned-tormentor. Starkie claims in his book, 'Fergie: Her Secret Life', serialised in the Daily Mail, that the duchess lived a life punctuated by tears and tantrums, depression and depravity. To some it may not matter that the duchess has lived a life where she is known not as Sarah Ferguson but as Frumpy Fergie or Freebie Fergie or the Duchess of Pork. It may not matter that millions of people know intimate details of the duchess's life that even a close friend might balk at. It may not matter that we now know she was hit by one of her lovers, that she is millions of pounds in debt and suffers from crushing self-doubt. But to anyone who has read her story, with the fascination reserved for tales of the royal family, it is important. It is a story of persecution and power; of onetime friends turned against each other in a desperate scramble for cash and justification; of the power of Buckingham Palace. It is a right royal story.  <p>  <p>As the rain came down on a wet day in June 1987 the Duchess of York, resplendent in a bright blue smock and medieval bonnet, was bellowing orders to her team. "Give us a B," she shouted. "Give us an L." She was the captain of the Blue Bandits and was exhorting her team to greater effort. The Grand Royal It's A Knockout was a disaster, in which she played an important role. She horsed around, she fell about. The Princess Royal and Prince Andrew retained a modicum of decorum. The duchess did not. For royal commentators it was a key moment. The duchess was a good-time girl, a podgy youngster who may have been good for a laugh but in the end was a joke herself.  <p>  <p>"It was a critical turning point," says Ben Pimlott, author of the recent biography of the Queen. "The duchess was whisked into a showbusiness world. Nobody was prepared for it and she was not prepared for it." The duchess admits that the "public relations debacle... would be analysed as my first great blunder".  <p>  <p>From there a line can be drawn, through Freebie Fergie and her famous holidays, through her supposed neglect of her daughters (she extended a holiday without her children by a few days), through the row over her &#163;5m mansion, through the revelations of affairs with Steve Wyatt and John Bryan, through Vasso and Starkie, right up to the publication yesterday of the first extracts from her book: 'My Story'.  <p>  <p>This week was not originally billed as being the war of the books. But some nifty footwork by the duchess's publishers, Simon and Schuster, and Hello! magazine has ensured that it is the duchess's words that are the royal story of the moment rather than Starkie's more lurid account of her life. The Daily Mail had to virtually scrap yesterday's Starkie extract, crunching the piece down from four pages a day since Saturday to less than half a page and giving three pages to the duchess's book. The headlines said it all: 'Life in The Firm by the most reviled woman in Britain' over the duchess's piece; 'The great Windsor Castle plate fiasco' for Starkie's more pedestrian insights.  <p>  <p>The duchess's book, written with the 'help' of Jeff Coplon, an American sports writer, is an odd mixture of brutal, sometimes pathetic, honesty, revealing insight and horribly awkward humour. She writes that "'it would be accurate to say that the porridge was getting cold" as Prince Charles, the Princess Royal and Prince Edward pored over the Daily Mirror's 'toe-sucking' pictures during breakfast at Balmoral.  <p>  <p>But mostly it is simply sad. She writes that "what hurt most by far was when they [the press] wrote that I was fat, the hobgoblin I had fought since puberty" (she tried to keep slim on a diet of meat, oranges and vitamins), that "I had been given the rope to hang myself and had tied the knot like a good scout", that "everyone had a rulebook but me and when I finally got my copy it read in Pig Latin" and that "I had left a trail of destruction that stretched longer than the train of my supernaturally fabulous wedding gown". At one point she took valium to calm herself, a duchess who was not dignified but rather disgusting.  <p>  <p>And just as Diana complained that palace officials were out to get her, so the duchess bemoans the role of the 'courtiers', that secret group the duchess says are the real purveyors of power in the palace. "As yet unwritten is the tale of how some of the most trusted people at Buckingham Palace have undermined the monarchy itself," she writes. "Gradually, relentlessly, they had beaten me down."  <p>  <p>In a taster for next week's Hello! extract she goes on to say: "I asked the Queen why she had sent her three men to rebuke me - why she hadn't voiced her concerns to my face? My story surprised her; she did not know about my pumelling."  <p>  <p>In sharp contrast the story as told by Starkie, described as a "fast talking American who has acted in an appalling manner" by Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine and a friend of the duchess, is shot through with salacious gossip. Not so much fly on the wall as fly in the dung heap. One part will suffice: "He [Bryan] used to tell Sarah: 'You're a tart, you're a slut' and she would become extremely stimulated. On one occasion John slapped her very hard across the face. As he related it: 'There was a second of stunned silence and then it was if a fountain was gushing where her eyes should have been'. Her response was out of all proportion to the blow he had dealt her."  <p>  <p>He says the duchess's home life "was like an episode from Fawlty Towers", a confusion of mystics, fortune tellers and brutish men. The duchess was asked to order her own toilet paper because staff were so tied up in their own domestic turmoil. Friends of the duchess say her book marks the end of the whole sordid process. There are no more works to mine from the duchess's tattered palace; the sewers have already been reached.  <p>  <p>They say the duchess is a new person, one who has spurned the advice of psychics and turned instead to the writings of Shakespeare, John Donne and Walpole, which she quotes in letters to friends. After this "unreal month" as her father, Major Ron Ferguson, described it, the duchess will concentrate on charity work, the usual route, as Prince Edward found more than 100 years ago, with a series of hospital visits to atone for sexual waywardness, for disgraced royals.  <p>  <p>Good works, though, will not be sufficient and with debts of more than &#163;4m, the duchess will also soon be embarking on her celebrity interviews for Paris Match magazine. If she is really reading Horace Walpole to "improve her understanding of human emotions", as one friend said, she should remember two of his better known phrases: "This world is a comedy for those that think but a tragedy for those that feel" and "when men write for profit they are not very delicate".  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>BT launches takeover of US telecommunications company MCI</b><br><br><br><b><h2>2 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>BT launches huge takeover</h2><h3>US company target in £14bn pioneer deal  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Ian King</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>British Telecom last night launched the biggest takeover bid in British corporate history when it announced that it was in talks with MCI, the American communications giant, to seal a &#163;14bn deal.  <p>  <p>The takeover, which would be the second biggest in world history, would create a rival for American group AT&T as the world's biggest telecommunications group.  <p>  <p>Sources close to the deal said last night that BT was "supremely confident" the deal would go through.  <p>  <p>News of the proposed takeover, 12 years after BT was privatised by Margaret Thatcher's government, would cement its status as a world power in the telecommunications industry.  <p>  <p>A combined BT, whose stock market value is more than &#163;22bn, and MCI, which is worth &#163;10.6bn, would easily rival AT&T's market value of &#163;34bn.  <p>  <p>BT, which already owns a fifth of MCI, is expected to pay around $40 a share - valuing MCI at around $27.5bn (&#163;16.8bn) - for the remaining 80 per cent of the American group with a mixture of cash and shares.  <p>  <p>Shares in MCI, which had earlier raced ahead in frantic trading, were suspended on the New York stock exchange yesterday afternoon after MCI - the second biggest long distance carrier in America - confirmed it was in talks with BT. Trading in BT shares, which closed down 4p at 351 1/2 p, had closed before rumours of the takeover broke.  <p>  <p>News of the deal comes as BT seeks to establish itself as one of the biggest players in the world telecommunications market, which industry experts say will be dominated by just two or three companies by the turn of the century. Like AT&T, BT already has strategic alliances with European operators, including German utilities group Viag, and earlier this year failed in attempts to merge with British rival Cable & Wireless in an attempt to secure its future in the Far East.  <p>  <p>Last night BT executives, led by chairman Sir Iain Vallance and chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield, were locked in talks at the company's headquarters near St Paul's Cathedral.  <p>  <p>A BT spokesman said: "BT is considering a possible strategic merger with MCI. BT's board will meet over the weekend to consider an anticipated proposal from MCI. "BT anticipates that it will be able to make an announcement prior to the opening of the London markets on Monday."  <p>  <p>Meanwhile, Washington-based MCI's spokesman Frank Walter confirmed that MCI's board of directors was considering a strategic merger with BT. However, as details of the proposed tie-up became clearer last night, there were indications that AT&T - which already has a full licence in the UK - or another US rival might launch a legal challenge to the deal. Under US regulations, monitored by the Federal Communications Commission, foreign carriers may only take a stake of over 25 per cent in a US carrier if its home market is open to competition from US companies. But analysts suggested last night that the British market, which is regarded as the second most open in the world, would comply with FCC requirements. BT and MCI already own Concert, a &#163;3.5bn joint venture signed when BT bought its MCI stake in 1993, which took just over a year to win clearance from American authorities.  <p>  <p>BT also looks clear to complete the deal on the home front. A DTI spokesman said last night it was "a matter for the companies", adding that the structure of any agreement reached would determine its treatment under the competition regimes of Europe, the UK and the US.    <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>BT launches takeover of US telecommunications company MCI</b><br><br><br><b><h2>4 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Opening salvos in a global communications war</h2><h3>US telecoms leader urges regulators to block MCI takeover deal  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Nicholas Bannister</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>America's most powerful telecommunications group, AT&T, yesterday said it would challenge British Telecom's planned &#163;12bn takeover of MCI, the second largest long-distance carrier in the United States. AT&T believes that the regulatory authorities in the US should block the deal on the grounds that BT would enjoy a competitive freedom in the US not available to American companies in Britain.  <p>  <p>Robert Allen, the US group's chairman, said yesterday: "We believe this proposed merger must get the scrutiny it deserves from the US Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission and the appropriate regulatory authorities in the UK and Europe.  <p>  <p>"We would expect our government would condition any such approval on the complete and unqualified opening of the UK telecom market."  <p>  <p>BT and the British Government claim that the UK has probably the most open telecoms market in the world, and that there are no barriers to foreign companies wanting to compete here.  <p>  <p>However, Mr Roberts rejected that view. "New entrants and carriers who want to serve customers still face significant barriers. BT still controls more than 90 per cent of all local telephone connections, and equal access to customers and telephone providers simply does not exist."  <p>  <p>He added that the relative openness of telecoms markets was not just a UK issue. "The ability of a company with this kind of market power to negatively impact competition and reduce customer choice makes the evaluation of this proposed merger a global priority of the highest order." Sir Peter Bonfield, BT's chief executive, said that the regulatory climate in the US had changed recently, providing BT with "a window of opportunity" to acquire full control of MCI.  <p>  <p>He was confident that regulatory approval would be forthcoming, though it might take up to a year of detailed negotiations. He admitted that BT would probably be running up some hefty legal bills as rivals sought to block the deal.  <p>  <p>US regulation prevents foreign companies acquiring more than 25 per cent of an American telecom company if their home market is less open that that in the US. BT, which purchased its 20 per cent in MCI for $4.3bn in June 1993, was recently given FCC approval to raise its MCI stake to 35 per cent, but has not bought any further shares.  <p>  <p>Sir Peter said that the merged BT and MCI - to be named Concert - aimed to cut costs by about &#163;1.5bn over five years, although the impact on jobs would not be significant because there was little overlap between the two companies.  <p>  <p>The new group would continue to support MCI's policy of expanding its long-distance operations and taking advantage of recent changes in US telecoms legislation to build local phone networks, either alone or with partners.  <p>  <p>Gerald Taylor, MCI's president and chief executive, said his group already had local networks in 13 US cities, and would be able to offer local services for 53 per cent of its business customers by the first quarter of next year.  <p>  <p>"To give local coverage to all our customers would involve capital investment of about $2bn, half of which we have already made," he said.  <p>  <p>MCI also wants to attack the residential market, until now the almost exclusive preserve of the Baby Bell regional phone groups. Mr Taylor said MCI was already running residential trials in California and other states.   <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>BT launches takeover of  US telecommunications company MCI</b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 November  1996</h2></b><br><h2>BT - the new global force</h2>
<h3>It has got to try, but the  pitfalls are enormous  </h3> <br><b>Leading article</b><br><br>      <p>BT's proposed merger with the US telecommunications group, MCI, is absolutely  riddled with potential pitfalls - financial, political, cultural and electronic.  But that's no reason not to welcome such a bold bid for a big stake in the  exploding world of global communications. This is a war on several fronts in  which timidity won't be the winner. The world's telephone, wireless and cable  companies are battling it out to become the dominant conveyors of information  (whether in the form of voice, data or moving pictures) while media giants like  Disney, Viacom, Microsoft and Rupert Murdoch's empire are themselves  restructuring to become the dominant suppliers of entertainment and software.  This is happening against a world-wide push - led by the US and the UK - to  deregulate domestic markets. In the background the internet - the worldwide  computer network - is growing strongly and becoming so versatile that it is no  longer fanciful to think that it may one day become the main medium for  television and (voice) telephone calls as well as computer-led communications.  <p> <p>One of the ironies of the information revolution is that while in the  long-run it offers unprecedented empowerment of the individual, in the short run  it is a battle between the national telecommunications giants for control of  international traffic. In the immediate future this war will be dominated by  globally positioned 'triad' players with strong bases in the US, European and  Asian markets. If BT and MCI merge to form Concert they will be two thirds of the  way towards this ideal. What remains to be seen is whether such a company fades  into second division status (like British Leyland) or whether it develops into a  Glaxo, the UK-owned pharmaceutical company, now the biggest in the world. BT  comes from an interesting new genre of companies like British Airways and British  Steel that have used a strong (and, interestingly, nationalised) home base to  convert into successful global players (Glaxo also had a strong domestic base  through its links with the NHS). <p> <p>But BT first has to disprove the academic  research showing that mergers are rarely successful (including some made by BT in  North America). One study concluded, alarmingly, that the net long-run effect of  takeover bids was to reduce (by 1.5 percentage points) the return on capital of  the companies making the bids. <p> <p>A merged BT/MCI will also have to face  unexpected technological changes (most likely from the internet) and a potential  clash of corporate cultures between the go-getting nouveau riche Americans and  the ancien regime of BT executives who, though learning fast, were reared in a  protected domestic market. BT has worked with MCI for the past three years since  it purchased a 20 per cent stake in it - but this doesn't mean that the American  culture won't emerge supreme in a decade or so if the merger is approved by the  regulatory authorities. <p> <p>One likely winner from all this (apart from  shareholders who have been looked after rather too comfortably by means of a  merger bonus) is the consumer who faces falling prices as the cartelisation of  international tariffs - particularly on the continent of Europe - is shattered by  the onward march of deregulation and globalisation. But if we are to ensure that  prices really do fall and that taxes don't get conjured away Murdoch-like into  offshore tax havens, we must think how national regulators can be turned into  international ones. If Cyberspace turns into a virtual tax haven dominated by  international monopolies then the information revolution will have failed even  before it has seriously got underway. <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><br><center><TABLE  border=0><tr> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG  SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td> <td width=40><A  HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT  BORDER="0"></A></td> </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400  border=0><tr> <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A  HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=center valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td> <td align=right valign=middle  width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0   SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td> </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>All Welsh pubs to open on Sunday</b><br><br><br><b><h2>4 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>History's tide turns against the Welsh dry sabbath</h2>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Matthew Engel</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The landlords of the Lleyn Peninsula surveyed their silent, shuttered bars and saloons yesterday and then retired for their traditional early Sunday night. As they did so, a piece of the Welsh heritage retreated into history. Almost certainly, one of Wales's longest-standing jokes is henceforth out of date. It is the story of the man who jumps out of an aeroplane and finds his parachute fails to work. As he hurtles towards oblivion, a man on the ground looks up and says "Bloody fool. He should know nothing round here opens on a Sunday."  <p>  <p>From the passage in 1881 of the Sunday Closing (Wales) Act in the heyday of the Victorian Nonconformist revival, every pub in Wales closed on a Sunday until 1961. From that point on - in a rare example of British local democracy - each area was given the choice in referendums held every seven years. Gradually, every district has voted to go wet except one: Dwyfor, the remote, lovely and very Welsh spit of North Wales that juts out into the Irish Sea.  <p>  <p>On Wednesday, Dwyfor votes again, for the last time - because the Welsh Office has decreed that the referendums will cease, and this week's vote will now stand for ever. Leaders of the anti-drinking campaign have conceded that the vote will go against them, and that next Sunday - for the first time in 115 years - every pub in Wales will be allowed to open. The odds are stacked against the dry lobby because of the latest changes to Welsh local government which come along more regularly than rural buses. In April the district of Dwyfor was merged with the already wet areas of Arfon and Meirionnyd to form the new authority of Caernafonshire and Merionethshire.  <p>  <p>This then changed its name to Gwynedd - not to be confused with the former county of Gwynedd, which had completely different borders. In these circumstances, it is not surprising that people need a drink. The whole of new Gwynedd will vote together, and the Rev Aled Davies, Baptist minister and secretary of the pro-dry Dwyfor Referendum Campaign, says this makes defeat inevitable. "I still feel that if Dwyfor had been left on its own, we could have done it. The people of Dwyfor see themselves as different and want to be different. But there aren't even campaign groups in the other areas. We did meet up with some people but they said no. We've lost the battle, and so be it."  <p>  <p>The poll has been characterised by confusion. The wet supporters failed to get their act together in time to get a maildrop to every house. The dries did - but told people to go out and vote on the wrong date. Some extreme wets claim this was deliberate disinformation, which may be the drink talking.  <p>  <p>But not all the wets are confident. "We know the dry lobbyists have been round the old people's homes and the nursing homes and got proxy votes," said Edna Williams, wife of the licensee at the Coach Inn, Clynnog Fawr. "And there's a lot of apathy because people think it's a certainty. The vote could very well go dry. If it happens, there'll be a lot of unemployment and a lot more people killed drinking and driving because of the distances they have to travel.  <p>  <p>"Foreigners get really irate because they just can't believe it. They think this sort of law went out with the Ark."  <p>  <p>No one who lives in the towns and villages of Dwyfor - Porthmadog and Pwllheli, Aberdaron and Abersoch - ever goes short of a drink. The rugby, golf and yacht clubs are unaffected and do a roaring trade. So do the pubs just over the border like the Griffin at Penrhyndeudraeth, which was jammed solid yesterday lunchtime.  <p>  <p>Even Mr Davies says he will welcome the end of the unseemly Sunday rush eastwards. "People should not have to put up with that. This is a very traditional area and the Sunday is still a very special day. A high percentage of the population think that even if they don't go to church. And they worry about the problems caused by alcohol."  <p>  <p>"Yes, Sunday is special," says Mrs Williams. "Most mums work all week and go shopping on Saturday. They want to go out with their family on Sunday and have some quality time."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Company buys Carnaby Street for &#163;90m</b><br><br><br><b><h2>4 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Hip London all arts and no trousers</h2><h3>So Newsweek thinks London is the hippest place on the planet  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Caroline Sullivan</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>London, believe it or not, is swinging again. Just check out last week's issue of listings magazine Time Out. A cover story on micro-starlet Chloe Sevigny, star of the docu-flick 'Kids', was entirely angled around one throwaway remark: "London's my favourite city, and British boys are my favourite, too." If she says so, it must be true. But in the same issue are more substantial tributes to the capital, which is experiencing its greatest surge in three decades.  <p>  <p>In the past year, Londoners such as Alexander McQueen, Damien Hirst and the relocated Oasis have come to define their era just as Mary Quant, David Bailey and the Beatles did the Sixties. This isn't just wild style-mag puffery; foreign publications are also devoting long analyses to the capital. The consensus is that London is once again the hippest place on the planet.  <p>  <p>That's good news if you're young, delectable and within easy reach of Soho, Camden or Notting Hill. The bad news is that many people are turning these delightfully tawdry districts into boutique heaven. In Notting Hill's Ledbury Road, for example, residents of a council estate are forced to live yards from a posh handbag shop and a restaurant, Beach Blanket Babylon, serving kangaroo fillet in red wine. "Patsy and Liam and Kate Moss come here a lot," says Beach Blanket's manager over the sound of haunches of Skippy being chomped by celebutantes. But if you can overcome resistance to the idea that there are prettier people having a better time than you, London is indeed the place to be.  <p>  <p>There's evidence everywhere of a renaissance. It's in the record sales of London-based acts such as the Bluetones and Goldie, in the super-shops opened by Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein, in the well-attended readings at Covent Garden's Poetry Cafe. Not since the Sixties has there been such a confluence of fashion and art.  <p>  <p>As in the Sixties, London has become a mecca for people seeking new lives. But what few are prepared for is how unwelcoming it is to outsiders. A whole school of Sixties film and literature was inspired by the hordes who came south and failed to find the London of popular myth. The isolated heroine of the Beatles' 'She's Leaving Home' was heading for the capital and, you sensed, heading for disappointment. 'Georgy Girl', who with high hopes had left a decaying provincial town, found herself overwhelmed by the loneliness of London.  <p>  <p>Still, it was the Sixties and jobs grew on trees. It's a different story now. Unemployment and the dismantling of social services mean the place can be wretchedly depressing, as a fledgling model called Michelle is learning. A month ago she left Los Angeles for Britain, believing her Chinese-Filipino looks would create interest here. She quickly signed with an agency, but things haven't taken off as she had hoped. Work has been slow to materialise and most of her cash was stolen from her rucksack within days of arrival. Broke, she took a live-in job cleaning a homeless hostel in impoverished Peckham, a part of the city most visitors never see. At night fights spill over from the nearby Gloucester Grove estate.  <p>  <p>"It's like East LA, except here you live like a pauper and have to spend much more doing it. Living in this hostel has given me an insight into real poverty. And someone else's room was robbed last night, which is really disheartening. I'm starting to wonder what kind of place this is." I met her in Soho's boutique du jour, Shop, a Wardour Street basement where apparently sane women pay £80 for crunchy nylon slips. Skinny and fashionably rumpled in anorak and men's trousers, Michelle looked like Shop's sort of girl. But she admitted: "I'm just looking. I can't afford anything here."  <p>  <p>So what attracted a UCLA anthropology graduate here? "It's where models come to do pictures when they're starting out. But it's hard getting started." Her sweet voice brightens. "I wasn't expecting it to be perfect. Creativity needs poverty and deterioration to thrive."  <p>  <p>Max Karie, Shop's proprietor, agrees. "Britain was the first country to have had a major recession. Brits have always had a talent for making do on not much money. We learned to prune, and that strengthened our aesthetic. We invented street culture, which is why you find Jean-Paul Gaultier going through the rails at markets. Coupled with the Britpop explosion, where bands are doing iconographic music again, the spotlight is on us again." There's a undeniable buzz on the streets. Newburgh Street, yards from the Sixties' ground zero, Carnaby Street, is cluttered with joints selling expensive knick-knacks. And Carnaby Street... well, more on Carnaby Street later.  <p>  <p>They require money, all these designer doodads. "I don't know where they get their money," says Karie of his young customers, but got it they have. He won't even speculate how. It could be that eight years of rave culture, with its &#163;30 admission tickets and &#163;2 bottles of water, has accustomed people to that once-a-month indulgence. But that doesn't explain the &#163;3,000 leather coats walking out of the big designer shops. Drug-dealing money? There are certainly so many drugs around - ecstasy, cocaine, a heroin glut - that someone is getting rich from them, and with a paucity of legitimate jobs around it's not unknown for rave kids to do a little dealing.  <p>  <p>Tourism, most of it from Japan and America, also accounts for the upturn. These aren't the middle-aged tourists of the past, though. London's new prominence has created the phenomenon of stylish Japanese girls who come in search of London men and clothes, which they find irresistible. Girls such as Tokyo-born Takane, who's lazily pawing through a rack of thirties dresses at Portobello market. Her opinion that "London is much better than Paris now because it's so exciting and cheap" is echoed a couple of miles east in Camden market by Yasuko from Kyoto. She stands out because of her black-rimmed glasses, a tribute to Spud from Trainspotting (which several Japanese girls cite as a reason for visiting London, though the film is set in Edinburgh).  <p>  <p>"I came to Camden because Pulp mentioned it in a song. I'd love to live here, but my father's spent so much sending me to school in Switzerland that I can't ask him for more. But I love English guys, the accents." The English pop stars she idolises are ambivalent about being the centre of such attention. While some bask in it - Liam Gallagher comes to mind - others are bemused. At least the Brit of Yasuko's dreams, Crispin Hunt of the highly-rated Longpigs, is. His look is much in demand by British fashion designers, as evinced by the number of skinny male models all over the place. Yet he protests. "I've never thought English guys were sexy at all. If other people think we are, it must be to do with our facade of manners. Maybe taste is just coming around to us floppy-haired, louche types." Jonathan, a Cockney wheeler-dealer who sells the Big Issue in Carnaby Street, is less modest about his charms. He approaches your investigator with "Can I interest you in a Big Issue, gorgeous?" and is persuaded to sit and talk in a doorway across from a blockful of cheapo leather shops. "I say that to all the girls," he admits crushingly, "and loads of 'em fall for it, expecially the tourists. Some of them are really excited, like, 'Wow, an English guy is talking to me!' It's done wonders for my sex life, being English right now."  <p>  <p>He watches the flow of neon-rucksacked Continentals aimlessly wandering from one tatmonger's to the next. Carnaby Street has long since been defrocked of its Sixties glamour, if it ever existed at all. Despite an image-building initiative by the local traders' association, it's best avoided by all but fans of plastic policemen's helmets. Yet tourists are legion, looking for swinging London.  <p>  <p>"They're so sad," Jonathan says of three French teenagers standing in the middle of the street, taking turns to spray purple dye on their hair. Tres branche (really cool), they're obviously thinking.  <p>  <p>They are sad, but not because they believe purple hair equals street style. It's their faith that hip London is out there somewhere, if only they could find it.  <p>  <p>The place probably hasn't changed much since the Sixties, still promising more than it delivers. For some, the promise is fulfilled; the hedonistic children raised on techno and E are finding London very much to their liking. It's gradually turning into a 24-hour city to meet the demands of people who party all night with no job to go to in the morning. Phill Savidge of pop publicists Savage & Best perceives "a city celebrating itself, and an arrogance that can be very attractive".  <p>  <p>"No future," said Johnny Rotten the last time London celebrated itself with hedonism 20 years ago. There seems to be even less future now other than McJobs and short-term contracts. For the 20-year-olds of swinging London '96, that's reason enough to party till they're sick.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Luke Harding</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Dickens once described it as a "bygone, faded, and tumbledown street". By the Sixties it had come to symbolise the spirit of the age, and the revolutionary counter-culture of swinging London.  <p>  <p>But yesterday, Carnaby Street, once a fashion and music mecca but now little more than a dingy tourist ghetto, was sold to a property company &#163;90m. The Shaftesbury company bought the properties in the central London street from the Dutch company, Wereldhave, with a view to restoring the street to its former glory. Shaftesbury already owns large parts of the capital's historic Chinatown and Covent Garden.  <p>  <p>The 93 buildings on and around Carnaby Street house an eclectic mix of shops, studios and leisure attractions. In the 1960s the street was home to men's fashion boutiques in an era when acceptable dress included three-button mohair suits and candy-striped jackets.  <p>  <p>Regular customers of the shops, mostly run by the millionaire John Stephen, included such cultural icons as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, the Who and Cliff Richard.  <p>  <p>One of the Kinks' most famous songs, 'Dedicated Follower of Fashion', was inspired by Carnaby Street.  <p>  <p>Nowadays just 18 of the 50 shops on the street sell clothes, while the modern tenants include shops which could be found on any suburban high street - Boots, Body Shop and Holland & Barratt.  <p>  <p>Brian Bickell, finance director of Shaftesbury, said the firm hoped to transform Carnaby Street back into a fashion mecca.  <p>  <p>"We need to get young people back, which will take a year or two," he said. "Ideally, we would like to remove some of the high street names and replace them with young designers.  <p>  <p>"We are looking at the 18 to 30 age range - people with high disposable incomes who want something special, something fashionable.  <p>  <p>"London is increasingly recognised as the place to be for fashion retailers. Designers from abroad are desperate to move here."  <p>  <p>The vital statistics of the street are no longer the size of lapels and the width of the bell-bottomed trousers, but the financial returns - &#163;5.8m a year rental income. Shaftesbury, which describes itself as a specialist investor in retail and tourist locations, already owns 120 shops and restaurants in central London.   <p>  <p><b>1960s</b>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>Clients: The Beatles; the Rolling Stones; Sonny and Cher; the Yardbirds; Frankie Vaughan; Cliff Richard; George Melly; Pete Townsend; others who were there but can no longer remember  <p>  <p>Shops: Mary Quant; Lord John  <p>  <p>Average purchase: Pair of velvet cerise trousers with 14in bell bottoms <p>  <p>Clothes: Regency jackets; crushed velvet flares; kaftans in upholstery fabric; sealskin jackets; hipster trousers; shirts in mauves and scarlets; old Hussar tunics  <p>  <p>Cars: Burgundy Cadillacs; white Rolls Royces; Lamborghinis  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>1990s</b>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>Clients: German and Swedish tourists; afternoon strollers; truanting schoolchildren; nostalgic balding swingers  <p>  <p>Shops: Holland & Barratt; Boots; Body Shop; Whittards  <p>  <p>Average purchase: A box of English tea; camomile shampoo  <p>  <p>Clothes: Denim jackets, leather mini-skirts, Doc Marten boots   <p>  <p>Cars: There aren't any, pedestrians only  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Oxford dons reject &#163;20m Said gift for business school in order to protect sports ground</b><br><br><br><b><h2>5 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Why Oxford should take the money  </h2>
<br>By <b>John Micklethwait</b><br><br>


<p>
<p>Academics are no more inclined than anyone else to look a gift horse in the mouth. So Wafic Said, the Middle-Eastern financier who wants to give &#163;20m to Oxford University to found a management school, might well have expected that he would soon be decked out in purple and reincarnated as Dr Said. Yet today, when Oxford University holds a vote about whether to accept his money, the result is likely to be extremely tight. In part this reflects suspicions about where Mr Said's money comes from; in part, the fact that the proposed new building will replace much-loved playing fields. Yet it also reveals the near universal odium that 'normal' academics feel for the study of management and business. Left-wing dons and tweedy paternalists alike have complained that Mr Said is trying to set up a modern equivalent of an academy of thieves. A medieval-history don has even implored Mr Said as a Muslim not to allow a business school to defile Oxford's sacred turf.
<p>
<p>Oxford is not alone. No matter how many gleaming new buildings management-education institutions throw up around the world (Harvard Business School is currently spending $5m spare change on a new computer system), the crumbling ivory towers still contrive to look down their nose at them. On balance the common rooms are right to be suspicious about this new discipline, wrong to be dismissive.
<p>
<p>One reason for the opposition is academic jealousy. What underfunded Russian-literature professor, toiling away in an ancient library for an audience of a dozen and a bus conductor's salary, could fail to be annoyed by the corporate-jet-and-speaking-tour lifestyle of a 'human-resources management expert'? But management theory is also a decidedly mixed bag. Step into any bookshop, and alongside heavyweight texts such as Michael Porter's Competitive Advantage Of Nations you will find works such as Make It So: Leadership Lessons From Star Trek: The Next Generation. Worse, management theorists have a passion for permanent revolution that would have made Trotsky or Mao green with envy. Business academics are forever unveiling ideas, christened with some acronym and dressed up in scientific language, which are supposed to 'guarantee competitive success'. Many in academia would add that even the best management theory is blindingly obvious. Many theories look like applied common sense ('the customer is king'); many catch phrases ('total quality management') seem trite. But this overstates the case. Toyota and Honda destroyed much of the West's car industry precisely because the Japanese did take total quality management seriously.
<p>
<p>Indeed, ignoring management theory is even worse than embracing it completely. That is partly because it is so influential. Never having heard of 'business process re-engineering' probably suited the Treasury mandarins - until many of them were re-engineered out of their jobs in a recent exercise. In Oxford's case, many of the education reforms introduced by this government, from performance-related funding to league tables, spring from management theory. Tony Blair's only big new idea, stakeholding, was borrowed from John Kay, the head of Oxford's new business school. If you dig through the waffle of management theory, you discover that a fair chunk of it does work. Industry leaders such as Motorola, Merck and 3M take management theory seriously. Even in the public sector, where it has been applied with stunning ineptness, the net effect has usually (just) been beneficial. Nobody at New Labour talks about reversing the NHS reforms. The best way to look at management theory is as a young discipline, in which the canonical texts and defining methodologies are still being developed. This teenage period is likely to go on for some time - not least because of its enormous success. But it has a point nonetheless. Oxford deserves a business school.
<p>
<p>The writers work for the Economist. They are the authors of 'The Witch Doctors: What The Management Gurus Are Saying, Why It Matters And How To Make Sense Of It' (Heinemann)

<br>By <b>John Carvel</b><br><br>


<p>
<p>Oxford University's ambitious fundraising plans were thrown into confusion last night when 1,000 excited dons decided that a patch of grass on a city centre sports field mattered more to their academic honour than a &#163;20m donation for a new international business school.
<p>
<p>They threw out proposals from the university authorities to build a world class business school on land acquired 30 years ago on condition that it would remain undeveloped in perpetuity.
<p>
<p>By doing so they were in effect rejecting a &#163;20m benefaction from Wafic Said, the Middle Eastern financier whose advice helped Britain clinch the multi-million pound al-Yamamah arms deal with Saudi Arabia. Mr Said offered the money on condition that it would be used to establish a prestigious management studies department on the two acre site on Mansfield Road in the centre of Oxford, requiring the demolition of the sports pavilion and loss of about half the university playing area. Last night Mr Said said the vote "calls into question the commitment to developing a world class business school. I shall obviously need to consider my benefaction.
<p>
<p>"I shall consult with the vice chancellors and my fellow trustees and reflect carefully before reaching a decision," he said.
<p>
<p>The university authorities had insisted on the sportsground site because the management studies department would only succeed if it was central to the university's life. "I agree with them," he said.
<p>
<p>After two hours of heated debate, the congregation (parliament of dons) rejected the deal by 259 votes to 214. A spokeswoman said the university authorities remained fully committed to the project and the Hebdomadal Council (an inner cabinet of senior academics) will decide next week whether to put it to a postal ballot of 3,200 dons and senior administrators. During the debate it was revealed that another backer was pledging a further huge donation if the sports ground site was chosen.
<p>
<p>The dons, in ceremonial gowns, ran a gauntlet of protesters on their way into the Sheldonian theatre. Banners included slogans warning Mr Said: 'We don't want your bloody money' and 'Sports fields not killing fields'. Alexander Murray, a University College ancient history don who led the No campaign, said he was trying to defend the values inherited from the past. "This plan was developed in the strictest secrecy. Those behind the scheme crept into the city in the dead of night so that when dawn breaks the banner was already hoisted over our green land. We are losing a playing field in return for a big city building."
<p>
<p>Anthony Hopwood, director of the School of Management Studies, said: "I got the impression most people were very positive about a business school - just not on this site."
<p>
<p>* Cambridge University has been warned that it may lose funding from cancer research organisations after its decision to take &#163;1.6m from British American Tobacco to fund a chair in international relations.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Oxford dons reject &#163;20m Said gift for business school in order to protect sports ground</b><br><br><br><b><h2>12 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Ultimatum on business school  </h2>
<br>By <b>John Carvel</b><br><br>


<p>
<p>Oxford university was last night given a 12-week ultimatum to agree an acceptable site for a &#163;40m business school or face the loss of a &#163;20m benefaction from Wafic Said, the Middle Eastern businessman who helped Britain clinch the al-Yamamah arms deal with Saudi Arabia.
<p>
<p>The university's executive decided to try harder to find an alternative location after its unexpected defeat last week when dons voted by 259 to 241 against plans to build on a supposedly protected city centre sports field. But the 24-member Hebdomadal Council said it was not abandoning its proposal to establish a world class management studies department on playing fields in Mansfield Road, which were acquired 30 years ago on condition that they remained undeveloped.
<p>
<p>It agreed a formal resolution to call for a postal vote of the university's 3,200 dons on whether the project should go ahead on the sports ground site, which Mr Said has said he favours.
<p>
<p>The ballot will be deferred until next term and the council will "redouble its efforts to find an alternative and central site, acceptable to both the university and the benefactor," a spokeswoman said.
<p>
<p>Mr Said said: "I have decided for the moment to maintain the offer of my benefaction because I believe in the importance of the project. If the university is able to produce agreement on an acceptable site for the business school by 1 February, my benefaction will stand." The Hebdomadal Council includes Lord Jenkins, the university's chancellor, and Peter North, the vice-chancellor, who argued last week that the sports ground would be the only central site to meet Mr Said's requirements. The decision to try harder to find an alternative came after warnings from the city planning authorities that they would not be bounced into giving permission for building on the land, sold to the university in the 1960s on condition it would never be developed.
<p>
<p>John Kay, director-designate of the new school, said he would withdraw his acceptance of the post if the school's future was not decided well before April.
<p>
<p>"The objective for many was simply to give the university a bloody nose. They had forgotten that they themselves were the university, and the nose they bloodied was their own," Professor Kay said.

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Stephen Dorrell wins extra cash for NHS</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Dorrell wins £1.3bn to stave off looming health cash crisis</h2><h3>Hospitals get bulk of extra cash as union dismisses "hollow victory"  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Michael White</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>The Health Secretary, Stephen Dorrell, will be able to direct an extra &#163;1bn in cash towards the NHS's struggling hospitals next year, as a result of the 1997-98 public spending package which the Cabinet agreed yesterday.  <p>  <p>"Substantial agreement has been reached on all programmes," a Downing Street spokesman said after the two-and-a-half hour session.  <p>  <p>But celebrations at the Department of Health were muted last night as ministers braced themselves for critical dissection of what the public sector union Unison called Mr Dorrell's "pretty hollow victory" in last-minute negotiations with the Treasury ahead of Kenneth Clarke's 26 November Budget.  <p>  <p>Hopes of dramatic tax cuts in the Budget also look doomed to disappointment. Despite talk of &#163;4bn worth of tax cuts, matched by equal spending cuts to avoid alarming the City, supporters of the Chancellor were again massaging expectations downward to say that &#163;2bn - roughly 1p off income tax - is a more realistic hope.  <p>  <p>Analysis of the NHS settlement looks likely to confirm that its position is little or no better than last year's deal which has contributed to this winter's cash crisis - the subject of bitter Commons clashes between the three party leaders yesterday.  <p>  <p>On top of the &#163;33.8bn currently being spent on the NHS, some &#163;800m extra is being allocated to cover inflation and a further &#163;500m 'real' increase - gained over the past week of intense negotiations - to ease the shortages already hitting hospital services. Unlike 1996-97 when primary care got a generous settlement, designed to boost GP services, the bulk of the &#163;1.3bn - around &#163;1bn - will go to hospitals and community health services. Though it will not be available until 1 April the theory is that health managers will now feel able to juggle their way through, unless it proves a harsh winter. Gillian Shephard's friends were also saying she is happy with a quiet success in the public spending round from which she emerged as one of the three biggest winners, along with health and law and order. There were no precise figures from her department, but the Education and Employment Secretary was said to have gained "hundreds of millions" extra after battling hard over the weekend.  <p>  <p>Mrs Shephard played this year's round less visibly than before, when she was suspected of leaking her own warnings to the Treasury last year about the unacceptable increase in class sizes which would occur if she did not get her way.  <p>  <p>The full Cabinet is now unlikely to be recalled for a further special meeting on public spending, so straightforward was the progress made yesterday.  <p>  <p>It did not stop Tony Blair accusing John Major of providing merely "a sticking plaster" for the NHS in its mounting cash crisis, at question time in the Commons yesterday.  <p>  <p>Mr Major rattled off familiar figures about extra resources for the NHS provided by the Tories, while Paddy Ashdown insisted the money is needed now, not next year. His health spokesman, Simon Hughes, later said: "In the last Budget the Government committed less to NHS growth than at any time since the oil price shock in the late 1970s. It is no wonder that they are now having to scrape around for extra cash. Unfortunately the money announced today may be too late for many areas."  <p>  <p>Bob Abberley, health organiser for Unison, said: "This is just a cynical public relations gimmick. It does nothing to secure more money for this financial year - and it will be this winter that the crisis hits, not after 1 April."  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Brindle</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>More than half all NHS trusts last year failed in their duty to achieve their financial targets and almost one in five returned a deficit, figures released today show.  <p>  <p>The number of trust chief executives paid more than &#163;100,000 nevertheless rose from 10 to 19. Their average remuneration was &#163;71,400, an increase of 3.5 per cent on the 1994/95 financial year. The figures, from the Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA), part of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, follow more evidence of NHS funding problems. Doctors in Exeter said yesterday that 2,700 patients due operations before next April would have to wait until the new financial year because the Royal Devon and Exeter hospital had to cancel 20 weekly operating lists.  <p>  <p>Stephen Dorrell, the Health Secretary, yesterday told a meeting organised by the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts that despite the &#163;500m rumoured to be won for the NHS in the Budget, 'the problems won't go away'.  <p>  <p>The HFMA figures, from more than 90 per cent of trusts in England, show that 210 of 372 supplying figures for 1995/96 failed to meet the requirement that they achieve a 6 per cent rate of return on their assets.  <p>  <p>Of 386 trusts supplying profit-and-loss figures, 71 (18 per cent) recorded a deficit in breach a further requirement to break even.  <p>  <p>In 1994/95, 77 per cent of trusts achieved the six per cent rate of return and only eight per cent reported a deficit.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Boris Yeltsin undergoes heart bypass operation</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Chernomyrdin tastes power</h2><h3>Yeltsin hands over to low-profile prime minister  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hearst</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Russia got a new president at 7am yesterday. His powers last only as long as Boris Yeltsin judges himself to be unfit for office, but while they last the prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, is certain to savour them to the full. The handover took place just before Mr Yeltsin went into the operating theatre for a heart bypass. He signed a decree to activate another prepared in December giving Mr Chernomyrdin all presidential powers, including control of the nuclear button. It will be ended by a further decree signed by Mr Yeltsin if and when he recovers.  <p>  <p>In an address before the operation, Mr Yeltsin declared that "not for a minute" would Russia be without a leader. "He [Mr Chernomyrdin] and my other colleagues are tested and reliable people. They will have great responsibility in the time to come," he said.  <p>  <p>In reality, Mr Yeltsin has done everything he can to limit the time that Mr Chernomyrdin is in control. During this period Anatoly Chubais, chief of the presidential administration and one of the "other colleagues", is supposed to take orders from Mr Chernomyrdin, his rival.  <p>  <p>The two men were invited to sit on a body called "the union of four". It has not met, but has already become a union of three after Gennady Selezynov, the Communist leader of the Duma, walked out in protest at the appointment of controversial tycoon Boris Berezovsky, a Chubais man, as deputy chairman of the security council. It was never clear what powers the union had, or who was meant to be responsible to whom.  <p>  <p>The Chernomyrdin-Chubais rivalry is intense. Mr Chubais has seized control of economic policy and is attempting to do the same with the security council. He has launched an attack on the regions to get federal spending under control.  <p>  <p>In contrast, Mr Chernomyrdin is a compromiser at heart who took a softer line than Mr Chubais with Mr Yeltsin's defeated opponents after this year's elections.  <p>  <p>The Communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, replied with statements supporting the prime minister, and the impression has grown that an alliance could be in the offing. It could include General Alexander Kulikov, the minister of the interior, and the mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov.  <p>  <p>Their targets would be Mr Chubais and the ousted populist security chief General Alexander Lebed.  <p>  <p>As rumours of an alliance grew, the press published a series of leaks about multi-million dollar dachas Mr Chernomyrdin was building for himself and his sons, and warnings that a revenue crisis would leave 85 per cent of state workers' wages and the army unpaid last month.  <p>  <p>These leaks sought to stop Mr Chernomyrdin's alliance-building. He replied with his own campaign: a rare interview at home presented him as a home-loving man, cooking, playing the accordion, and even talking wistfully about women he fancied.  <p>  <p>Mr Chernomyrdin needs time as acting president. Mr Chubais and his go-between - Mr Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana Dyachenko - need her father to recover quickly.  <p>  <p>No definition of an 'active' president exists. Mr Yeltsin has refused to countenance the creation of a medical commission to adjudicate on his fitness to govern.  <p>  <p>As the president recovers, from a multiple heart bypass known to have a treacherous recovery period, intense pressure will be applied to talk up his fitness, and for him to appear in public to prove it. It could be a short and bumpy ride for Mr Chernomyrdin.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Boris Yeltsin undergoes heart bypass operation</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Meanwhile in Moscow, Yeltsin lies in intensive care</h2><h3>Five bypasses reveal more serious damage to president's heart  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>David Hearst</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>A critical 48 hours will decide the success of President Boris Yeltsin's bypass operation as doctors monitor his progress after seven hours of surgery constructing five heart bypasses.  <p>  <p>Later today his international team of surgeons will decide whether to take the 65-year-old off an artificial respirator to see if he can breathe unaided. The surgery uncovered a much more badly diseased heart than had previously been thought.  <p>  <p>Renat Akchurin, the surgeon who led the medical team, said yesterday's operation was a success. After grafting a number of veins on to the arteries around the heart, he said all indications were that the heart was getting enough blood to function normally.  <p>  <p>"I was trying to forget that it was the president of Russia and think this is an ordinary patient."  <p>  <p>George Noon, an American surgeon and one of the advisers to the Russian team, said Mr Yeltsin had five bypasses which should not affect his chances of a full recovery.  <p>  <p>"It was very standard and everything went in a very routine manner without complications," he said. He added that a couple of Mr Yeltsin's arteries had sections which were completely blocked.  <p>  <p>Mr Yeltsin regained consciousness clearing one of the hurdles on his path to recovery. His doctors, helped by specialists from Germany, will have a clearer picture when the artificial ventilation is turned off this morning. Tony Rickard, a cardiologist at London's Royal Brompton Hospital, said: "There are a number of key milestones President Yeltsin has got to pass. He has passed one of them - and that is that his own heart has taken over from the artificial heart that was used during the operation."  <p>  <p>Michael DeBakey, the pioneering American heart surgeon, said the operation was a complete success. "President Yeltsin will be able to return to his office and carry out his duties in normal fashion," he said. Yevgeny Chazov, who kept three Soviet leaders alive in the 1970s and 1980s, said: "The operation went better than I expected." He said Mr Yeltsin's heart had been stopped for 68 minutes while surgeons grafted veins. However, some medical experts said the greater than expected number of bypasses showed Mr Yeltsin's heart was more badly diseased than previously thought. "If you say you're going to do three or four bypasses and you do more, you've found more problems than you expected," said John Wright, head of cardiac services at the London Chest Hospital.  <p>  <p>It started in tight secrecy yesterday when Russia woke up to the news that Mr Yeltsin had formally handed over all his powers, including control of the nuclear button, to the prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.  <p>  <p>Mr Yeltsin said in an address read out by his press secretary, Sergei Yastrzhembsky: "Not for a minute will the country be without a leader with full powers."  <p>  <p>All attention will focus on how long Mr Yeltsin leaves power in Mr Chernomyrdin's hands. The powers he transferred to his prime minister will be resumed by the signing of a another decree. But only Mr Yeltsin will decide when.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>GDN 11 Nov 96 Yeltsin is 'out of the woods' (170)   <p>  <p>President Boris Yeltsin is likely to be discharged in about 10 days from the hospital where he is recovering from quintuple heart bypass surgery, the Kremlin doctor, Sergei Mironov, said yesterday. He told Russian television that Mr Yeltsin would finish recuperating at his country residence in Barvikha, outside Moscow.  <p>  <p>The president's daughters, Tatyana Dyachenko and Yelena Okulov, told the independent station NTV last night that Mr Yeltsin was doing well, but had little appetite and was still in some pain. Dr Mironov said Mr Yeltsin was spending several hours a day sitting up, and was walking around his suite at the Kremlin hospital.  <p>  <p>Michael DeBakey, the eminent American cardiologist advising the Russian medical team, said he was flying home to Houston and that Mr Yeltsin was "out of the woods".  <p>  <p>From Bonn, the Itar-Tass news agency reported that one of the German consultants, Axel Haverich, told reporters that the medical team at one point considered a transplant.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

<!--INFOLINE--><b>Clinton wins US presidential elections</b><br><br><br><b><h2>6 November 1996</h2></b><br><h2>Clinton surges to victory</h2><h3>South saves Dole from humiliation  </h3>  <br>By
<!--INFOLINE--><b>Martin Walker</b><br><br>      <p>  <p>Victory came shortly after 2am British time, and Republican opponent Bob Dole's spokesman conceded defeat shortly afterwards, even before polls closed in the West.  <p>  <p>Mr Clinton, the first Democratic President to win re-election since Franklin D Roosevelt in 1944, was sweeping towards a comfortable majority of close to 400 seats in the 538-strong electoral college.  But he was in danger of falling just short of his desired moral mandate of 50 per cent or more of the popular vote.  <p>  <p>As voting continued in the West, Mr Dole was running at 42 per cent of the national popular vote to Mr Clinton's 49. The Republican appeared likely to carry at least 10 states, a far better performance than the wipeouts inflicted on the Democrats in the last landslide elections of 1972 and 1984. Mr Clinton took pride in the marked improvement on his 43 per cent of the vote in 1992. Mr Dole also did far better than the 37 per cent of the vote for George Bush.  <p>  <p>The big loser of the night was the Reform Party candidate Ross Perot, who saw his 1992 vote of 19 per cent cut by nearly two-thirds.  <p>  <p>His character and his fund-raising ethics mercilessly battered in the campaign, Mr Clinton appeared to face yet again a vengeful Senate controlled by a narrow Republican majority.  <p>  <p>The House was too close to call, but Democratic officials told the Guardian that their projections showed them winning a razor-thin margin after the east coast polls closed.  <p>  <p>The uncertain fate of Congress cast a slight shadow on the celebrations in Little Rock, Arkansas, where Mr Clinton was already making preparations for his second term, with strong hints that the expected retirement of secretary of state Warren Christopher was imminent.  <p>  <p>The Democrats held Georgia, one of four Senate marginal seats in the South, but were struggling to hold another in Mr Clinton's native Arkansas. But Democrats were well-placed to win open Republican Senate seats in Maine and Oregon, and they gained a Senate seat in New Hampshire.  <p>  <p>As the first polls closed, Mr Clinton was winning overwhelmingly in New England. He was declared the winner in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois, and easily won the bellwether state of Ohio. He also won Florida, the first Democrat to do so in 20 years, thanks to heavy support among the elderly, fearing for their Medicare.  <p>  <p>Strong margins for Mr Clinton in California, where he was 14 points ahead, and New York, where he led by 20 points, offered his best hope of just reaching 50 per cent of the popular vote as the night wore on. Mr Dole was holding most of the Republican strongholds of the South and West, winning Alabama and Indiana and carrying Texas by 10 points, thanks to an unusually heavy male turnout. But Mr Clinton was three points up in Virginia, and Colorado was too tight to predict.  <p>  <p>A spirited Republican recovery in the South, and the strenuous Get Out The Vote efforts on their behalf by the Christian Coalition, appeared to have forestalled a Clinton landslide and saved his exhausted Republican opponent from humiliation.  <p>  <p>Both party machines strained every nerve to get out the evening vote, which traditionally favours Democrats as their voters leave work and mothers with younger children can finally get to the polling booths.  <p>  <p>Mr Perot appeared to be winning about seven per cent of the vote, far less than his 1992 showing. Few undecided voters appeared to have made a last-minute decision to cast an essentially protest vote for the Texan billionaire. This was despite Mr Perot's 'saturation bombing' of the election-eve airwaves, buying 30 minutes of television time on the four biggest networks to warn that the Clinton scandals promised "a constitutional crisis of Watergate proportions".  <p>  <p>Mr Clinton cast his vote in Little Rock, joining the thousands of Arkansans who confounded the predictions of low turnout to queue round the block at polling stations.  <p>  <p>Lacking any home in Little Rock, the First Family then retreated to the Excelsior Hotel's presidential suite to watch the election returns. In a mark of Democratic confidence, parties in the city started long before any results were in, the biggest on the steps of the Old State House where Mr Clinton claimed his victory four years ago.  <p>  <p>Mr Dole hauled his weary 73-year-old body across the finish line in his home town of Russell, Kansas, where he voted, after a last stop at the grave of President Harry Truman, who defied the polls to snatch an upset victory in 1948.  <p>  <p>Calling himself "the marathon man" after his last non-stop 96 hours of campaigning, Mr Dole could hardly have done more.  <p>  <p>The expected Republican retention of the Senate, albeit with a reduced majority, threatens big upheavals in each party. Many Republicans blame the strident House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, for the Democratic campaigns which labelled them 'extremist'.  <p>  <p>This was the first presidential election since 1928 with America at peace worldwide and enjoying genuine prosperity at home.  <p>  <p>The rare combination was the key to Mr Clinton's re-election strategy, despite the concern of many voters with his character, ethics and the latest fund-raising scandals.  <p>  <p>These problems presage a difficult second term, which could be made more difficult by the growing signs that the five-year economic recovery is drawing to an end.  <p>  <p>One of the first to offer his congratulations was the Labour leader, Tony Blair.  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p><b>How America voted</b>  <p>  <p>Bill Clinton 49 per cent  <br>Bob Dole 42 per cent  <br>Ross Perot 7 per cent  <p>  <p>  <p>  <p>  <br><br><center><TABLE border=0><tr>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jan.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jandot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/feb.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/febdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/mar.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/mardot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/apr.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/aprdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/may.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/maydot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jun.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/jundot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/jul.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/juldot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/aug.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/augdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/sep.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/sepdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/oct.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/octdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/nov.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/novdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  <td width=40><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/dec.html"><IMG SRC="/g96/pix/decdot.gif" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER="0"></A></td>  </tr></TABLE></center><center><TABLE height=30 width=400 border=0><tr>  <td align=left valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/byauthor/autha.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/b2auth.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=center valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/index.html"><IMG border=0 SRC="/g96/pix/g96.gif"></A></h2></td>  <td align=right valign=middle width=200><h2><A HREF="/g96/bymonth/Obitjan.html"><IMG border=0  SRC="/g96/pix/b2obit.gif"></A></h2></td>  </tr></table></center></BODY></HTML>

	<!--TEXT--> The Guardian Weekly, read and enjoyed each week by hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world, offers a weekly digest of the best of the Guardian as well as a selection of news, comment and features from the Washington Post and Le Monde.
<P>
This unique mix from three of the world's great newspapers gives depth and perspective to the often confused events of the week. Thanks to a global spread of foreign correspondents, the Guardian Weekly provides news coverage that is second to none. Graphic eyewitness accounts of the Balkans war by Maggie O'Kane and Ed Vulliamy, a weekly Washington diary by Martin Walker, and the clear-sighted analysis of Martin Woollacott are just three of the reasons the Guardian Weekly is appreciated by academics, business people, diplomats and opinion-formers throughout the world.
<P>
Outside Britain the Guardian Weekly is printed in Australia and Canada to ensure speedy delivery to subscribers and to the news-stands of the world's major cities. In addition, four Latin American partner papers - in Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Santiago and Caracas - carry a special edition of the Guardian Weekly every weekend. And those who live in South Africa will recognise the Weekly's stamp on the Johannesburg-based <A HREF="http://www.mg.co.za/mg/">Mail & Guardian</A>.
<P>
With its judicious mix of news, views, culture and sport, the Guardian Weekly offers a vital link to the world and to the community of ideas.
<P>


This week: Forget the lavender and olives. The new Provence is a crowded, xenophobic zone that keeps voting the National Front into local power. If the economy fails to pick up, Le Pen could be president of France by 2002, warns <a href="lepen.html">Alex Duval Smith</a>

Fascism has arrived through the servants' entrance and has designs on the seat of honour on the right of its hostess, Marianne, the mother of the Republic.<p><p>The gangrene, made apparently respectable by the ballot-box, took hold last week when the National Front won control of Vitrolles, an ugly new town of 40,000 people near Marseille. Vitrolles is significant because it is the party's fourth conquest in southern France and was not won thanks to a protest vote. When the people of Toulon, Orange and Marignane voted for the racist party in municipal elections in June 1995, no one knew what to expect. <p><p>Now, with the National Front's candidate, Catherine M&#233gret, installed in Vitrolles, people know just what is coming. And 52.4 per cent of them are crying out for the measures that already characterise National Front rule: pork on the menu in mixed-religion schools (Marignane), leftwing town-hall employees transferred to street-cleaning duties (Toulon), and water bills plummeting because the utility company needs no longer maintain mains and sewers (Orange).<p><p>Forget the beautiful colours, the olive trees and the sound of crickets. This Provence - the hideous, densely populated part including France's second city, Marseille - is where the National Front is launching its takeover bid for France. It also has designs on Nice and Cannes.<p><p>The area is a xenophobe's dream because it has ingredients that amount to all spice and no social fabric: mass tourism, immigration, wealthy pensioners moving down from northern Europe, unemployment, years of corruption and a large population of pieds-noir (French ex-colonials thrown out of Algeria after independence in 1962). Such things do not make a social fabric.<p><p>As if these were not enough, the area is as rudderless as the rest of France in the face of globalisation - that seemingly unstoppable phenomenon which is the antithesis of savoir-vivre and regional variety. France is not a country that wants flexible working or believes that there is any quality of life on the Internet.<p><p>The country's leaders have not come up with answers. The politicians are "all the same" because they have caught that dangerous illness, conciliation politics. The intellectuals are "all the same" because their leftwing idealism was exhausted by the 14-year rule of President Fran&#231ois Mitterrand.<p><p>Vitrolles, Orange, Marignane and Toulon are just the beginning of a political trend built on that streak of fear, bitterness and greed which can be exploited in so many of us. From there, it is not a big step to locking up Aids patients, expelling immigrants and imposing nationality tests on earlier generations.<p><p>There is no longer any taboo attached to voting for the National Front in the south of France. Next year, the country holds elections to the National Assembly and the party will almost certainly consolidate its grip in the region. <p><p>The real gloom merchants warn that Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front founder and leader, stands a good chance of becoming president of France in 2002. Their scenario has the Socialists gaining a majority of seats in next year's parliamentary elections but failing to create the 700,000 jobs they pledge. Then, they argue, if the single currency does not create the boom we are promised, Mr Le Pen will be pushing at an open door.<p><p>Much could happen to prove them wrong. The mainstream right wing is divided over how to proceed. President Jacques Chirac, a fervent anti-racist, does not want to flirt with the National Front. But influential men close to the government believe intercourse with the National Front is the only solution.<p><p>The party itself is divided as a power struggle emerges between those supporting the cunning strategist, Bruno M&#233gret, and those who like the loudmouth approach of Mr Le Pen. At the moment, Mr M&#233gret - slick and able to win votes without being explicitly racist - seems to be winning. But if the far less subtle Mr Le Pen hangs on to the leadership, the party could begin to look increasingly old and anachronistic.<p><p>That, however, is a slim hope to hang on to in a country so overcome with inertia and confusion in the face of decline that more and more people think the solution lies with the party waving the tricolore flag.<p><p>

	<!--TEXT--> The Guardian Weekly, read and enjoyed each week by hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world, offers a weekly digest of the best of the Guardian as well as a selection of news, comment and features from the Washington Post and Le Monde.
<P>
This unique mix from three of the world's great newspapers gives depth and perspective to the often confused events of the week. Thanks to a global spread of foreign correspondents, the Guardian Weekly provides news coverage that is second to none. Graphic eyewitness accounts of the Balkans war by Maggie O'Kane and Ed Vulliamy, a weekly Washington diary by Martin Walker, and the clear-sighted analysis of Martin Woollacott are just three of the reasons the Guardian Weekly is appreciated by academics, business people, diplomats and opinion-formers throughout the world.
<P>
Outside Britain the Guardian Weekly is printed in Australia and Canada to ensure speedy delivery to subscribers and to the news-stands of the world's major cities. In addition, four Latin American partner papers - in Mexico City, Buenos Aires, Santiago and Caracas - carry a special edition of the Guardian Weekly every weekend. And those who live in South Africa will recognise the Weekly's stamp on the Johannesburg-based <A HREF="http://www.mg.co.za/mg/">Mail & Guardian</A>.
<P>
With its judicious mix of news, views, culture and sport, the Guardian Weekly offers a vital link to the world and to the community of ideas.
<P>


This week: Forget the lavender and olives. The new Provence is a crowded, xenophobic zone that keeps voting the National Front into local power. If the economy fails to pick up, Le Pen could be president of France by 2002, warns <a href="lepen.html">Alex Duval Smith</a>

<img width=20 height=1000 src="pix/invdot.gif" align=left> <font size=7><b>Willetts to get &#163;8,000 pay-off
</b></font><br><font size="-1">David Hencke</font><p> <font size=3>






The disgraced minister David Willetts, who resigned his job as paymaster general after being savaged by a powerful committee of MPs for his role in the cash-for-questions affair, is to receive an &#163;8,000 tax free pay-off.<p>

His former employer, the Cabinet Office, confirmed yesterday the former minister will receive a quarter of his ministerial salary - &#163;31,125 - in three weeks. He will still draw his MP&#146;s pay of &#163;43,000.<p>

Labour&#146;s deputy leader, John Prescott, who yesterday called on Mr Willetts to resign his parliamentary seat in Havant, Hampshire, said he was shocked that ministers who quit would be paid.<p>

"I have no doubt as he is an honourable man he will be donating this to charity," he said.
The disclosure of Mr Willetts&#146;s payment came as the minister, who had been attacked by the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee for dissembling - or effectively lying - to a parliamentary inquiry over his role in the affair, insisted he had no intention of quitting politics. Cabinet Office rules say that a minister is entitled to a quarter of his salary if he resigns.<p>

Mr Willetts&#146;s involvement was revealed after the libel case brought by the former minister Neil Hamilton and lobbyist Ian Greer against the Guardian collapsed in October.
Mr Willetts, who was a junior whip at the time, had written a memorandum to fellow whips on the day in October 1994 that the Guardian exposed Mr Hamilton and Tim Smith for accepting cash from Mohamed Al Fayed, the owner of Harrods, for asking parliamentary questions in a lobbying campaign which was orchestrated by Mr Greer.<p>

In the memo Mr Willetts tried to smother a parliamentary inquiry being set up to investigate the matter by Sir Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, then chairman of the now defunct Members&#146; Interests Committee.<p>

Mr Willetts&#146;s explanation to MPs investigating the affair over the last two months was unanimously dismissed by the committee as largely inaccurate.<p>

Dismissing Mr Prescott&#146;s call to resign his seat, Mr Willetts said yesterday: "I hope to represent Havant for many years to come. I am very pleased and very touched by their loyalty and their confidence.<p>

"There&#146;s more to life than politics, and an episode like this reminds you of the importance of the rest of life. But it hasn&#146;t affected my appetite for political argument.<p>

"I am looking forward to a family Christmas and then in the new year I will be an active backbencher. I will think and take stock."<p>

Next week the Commons committee investigating the affair will meet to discuss its next move.<p>

The meeting, which will be held in private, will decide whether to call Andrew Mitchell, a second minister who is implicated in the affair and who sat on Sir Geoffrey&#146;s committee as a government whip.<p>

Dale Campbell-Savours, a Labour member of the Standards and Privileges Committee, attacked Mr Mitchell for his involvement in the affair, suggesting that he was part of an organised attempt to suppress the inquiry into whether Mr Hamilton had broken the rules in accepting cash and not registering a stay at the Ritz Hotel, Paris, which is also owned by Mr Al Fayed.<p>

Since the committee has decided to take future evidence under oath, Mr Mitchell could be the first minister to have to do this since Reginald Maudling, the former chancellor, appeared before the Privileges Committee in the Poulson inquiry in 1976.<p>

THE threat of closure was removed from BBC World Service foreign language services last night.<p>

The Foreign Office increased its grant to cover the &#163;5m funding shortfall the service faced in 1997/98. The operating budget has been increased to &#163;152.4m.
Sam Younger, the service&#146;s managing director, said: "Against a background of tight public spending this represents a considerable vote of confidence by the Foreign Secretary in the World Service. <A HREF="saved.html"><IMG SRC="pix/arrow.gif" ALT="" VALIGN=BOTTOM border=0></A> <B>Full story</B><br>

<center><font size=2>Last Update: February 19th 1996</font size></center>
<font size=4> Tony Blair's now famous "stakeholder" <A HREF="speech/sing1.html">
speech</A> in Singapore has, according to <A
HREF="articles/hezza.html#water">Michael Heseltine</A>,  opened <A
HREF="articles/water.html">clear blue water</A> between Labour and the
Conservatives. <P>


The idea of stakeholding, that the individual can have a stake - or make an
investment - in all aspects of society, whether it is financial or not, isn't
new. Its history can be traced back to the <A
HREF="articles/hist.html">1930s</A>. However, it may be the Big Idea that wins
the next election for Labour. But could stakeholding go the way of the <A
HREF="articles/stake1.html">Citizen's Charter</A> or "<A
HREF="articles/basics.html">Back to Basics</A>"?<P> One thing is certain: the
debate sets up a political dogfight between left and right; between those who
believe that "stakeholder capitalism" leads to a better society, and those who
believe in individual empowerment through "<A
HREF="articles/thous.html">shareholder capitalism</A>".<P> The following pages introduce stakeholding. How
people - including the <A HREF="articles/chasl.html">Prince of Wales</A> - define
it, how Tony Blair<IMG SRC="pix/map1.gif"
height=150 align=right vspace=10> understands it, how various interest groups  responded to his
speech, and how it could affect every area of society. There is also the
opportunity to join the stakeholding debate: just <A
HREF="feedback/letter.html">e-mail</A> your views. The most
interesting <A HREF="feedback/letters.html">letters</A> will become part of the
site.<P>



The Guardian Stakeholder site will grow with the debate. It will be constantly
updated as politicians, the media, trade unions, business and the academic world
begin to define the implications of stakeholding for Britain, its economy and its
people. </font>

	<TD VALIGN=TOP WIDTH=270>
	War means loss for children. In the last 10 years, more than two million
children have died in wars, many others have lost their families, homes and
schools and 4.5 million children have suffered terrible injuries. Now the war
between Chechenia and Russia is over, lives must be rebuilt.<p></TD>

<B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="-1">Twelve-year-old Niyonsaba, a Rwandan boy, had not seen his family for two
years. His grandfather laid eyes on him first: "I am so happy, I didn't think I
would ever see him again. His parents are still alive, he has younger brothers
and sisters, the whole family had given him up for dead." Niyonsaba said: "When
I get home I will talk to my family for a week with my story. I have so much to
tell them."</FONT></B></TD>

<TABLE WIDTH=550 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=10>
<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"> <B><I>Where is Chechenia, and what happened there?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>Chechenia is in the Caucasus, the mountain range between Europe
and Asia. Chechenia had been part of Russia since the 19th century. In 1991,
the Chechens declared their independence from Russia. Russia's president, Boris
Yeltsin, was against this and sent troops into Chechenia in 1991. But the
conflict was not resolved. In December 1994, he sent his troops in again and a
bloody war followed. Russia has now largely pulled out of Chechenia. In January
1997 Chechen elections were held and Aslan Maskhadov was elected president.
Peace now looks more likely.<p></TD>

</TR>



<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>How are children affected by war?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>One of the most painful aspects of war for a child is losing his
or her family. When there is a war, people flee from danger and try to escape
to safer areas. But in the panic it is easy to be parted from your loved ones.
In the last 10 years more than one million children have been separated from
their families.<p>

Sometimes people in danger flee to other countries: they are called refugees.
There are over 20 million refugees in the world and over half of them are
children. People may also flee to other areas of their country -- this is known
as internal displacement. There are 30 million internally displaced people.<p>

Children often lose their homes and schools in wars, either because they have
to leave them or because they are destroyed.<p>
</TD>
</TR>


<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Is it possible for children to find their families after a war?</I></FONT></B></TD>
	<TD>Yes it is, and reuniting families is one of the most important
steps back to normality after a war - it is a real starting point. If you have
ever lost your parents in a public place, you know how scary that feels. Now
imagine losing your family for weeks or even years and not knowing if they are
alive. Many charities spend a lot of time helping children find their parents
and relatives - this work is called "tracing". Charities work together to
register lone children and find them temporary homes with foster parents or in
special centres. They then try to trace their families.<p>

Often parents come to charities to try to find their children. Photographs of
"lost" children are displayed on posters in food distribution centres, meeting
halls or on TV or newspapers.<p>

Because families provide the best environment for helping children to recover
from war, substitute families are looked for if real parents or relatives
cannot be traced or are dead. The charity Save the Children runs tracing
programmes in Mozambique, Angola, Liberia, Uganda, Rwanda and the former
Yugoslavia. It registered 7,000 unaccompanied children who came across the
border from Zaire back to Rwanda in 1996 and managed to find the families of 95
per cent of them.<p>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>What about schools?</I></FONT></B></TD>
	<TD>Going to school brings back a sense of normality. Routine and
stability are important if children are to start being children again, and
having fun. Any type of school is helpful - even if "school" means sitting on
the ground under a tree with a teacher, with no books - maybe just a slate and
some chalk.<p>

In the former Yugoslavia lessons were often held in cellars of people's houses
by candlelight. The United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) has developed a
"school in a box" pack, an emergency kit for teachers. Over 11,500 teachers
have used this pack in Rwanda.<P>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>What will happen in Chechenia?</I></FONT></B></TD>
	<TD>The Red Cross was the main charity working in Chechenia. They had
been reopening schools, feeding people and providing medical care. But
something terrible happened before Christmas. On 17 December 1996 six Red Cross
workers were killed in the hospital where they worked. It is now too dangerous
for charity workers to be in Chechenia and international aid agencies have
pulled out of the country. They want to go back when their safety can be
guaranteed.<p>

<B>Should taxpayers' money be spent on a new royal yacht? Emily Moore looks at
the arguments<p></TD></B>

	<TR>
	<TD>The Government has announced that it plans to build a new royal yacht and pay
for it with public - ie tax-payers' - money. It will cost around &#163;60m to
build. In 1994 it was discovered that the present royal yacht, Britannia,
needed &#163;20m worth of repairs. This is so much money that the Government
has been trying to decide whether to replace the royal yacht using private
funding or with public money, or not to have one at all. The Tories hoped the
announcement, coming just before the general election, would win them votes.
Labour have not committed themselves to building the yacht if they win the
election.<p></TD>

	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"> <B><I>What is a royal yacht?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>At 125m long and weighing 4,715 tonnes, Britannia, the present royal yacht, is
not a yacht in the usual sense of the word - more a small passenger liner.<p>
<p>
The first royal yacht was built in 1661. Britannia was planned for King George
V1 (1892-1952) in the hope that sailing around in warm seas might be good for
his health. But he died before the ship was built. The project was taken over
by our Queen, Elizabeth II, and her husband Prince Philip. Britannia was
launched in 1953.<p>
<p>
Britannia has a crew of 275, including 27 members of a royal marines band who
only join the crew for overseas official visits. The crew are equipped with
white Plimsoles to cut down on noise.<p></TD>

</TR>



<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>What does the royal yacht do?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>Britannia takes the royal family on trips and acts as a showcase for Britain's
design and engineering skills. It has been claimed that the Britannia has
brought more than &#163;2bn worth of export business to Britain over the last
10 years. But people point out that the Emperor of Japan does not have a royal
yacht and Japan is a country which exports far more than we do.<p>
<p>
The royal yacht left Portsmouth for its last trip on 20 January this year. It
will end the trip in Hong Kong in June, when the colony, which was part of the
British Empire, will be handed back to the Chinese.<p>
</TD>
</TR>


<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Does Britain need a new royal yacht?</I></FONT></B></TD>
	<TD>Michael Portillo, the Defence Secretary, said we need a new yacht because it
symbolises the nation's pride. But others see a new yacht as a pointless
extravagance which Britain really cannot afford. &#163;60m could build two new
hospitals, six new secondary schools, or immunise six million children in the
developing world. Some say, if we are to have a royal yacht then why not build
one that is smaller and cheaper. For example, the Spanish royal yacht, Fortuna,
is 40m long and cost just &#163;3m to build.<p>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Should taxpayers pay for a new royal yacht?</I></FONT></B></TD>

yacht.

Troubles. Emily Moore looks at some of the issues<p></TD></B>
</TR>

 


	<TR>
	<TD COLSPAN=2>Last weekend, it was the 25th anniversary of Bloody Sunday. On Sunday 30
January 1972, 13 unarmed people were shot and killed by British paratroopers;
13 others were wounded. It happened in Derry, Northern Ireland, at a Catholic
march against internment (the imprisonment of people without a trial). The Army
feared the IRA would be among the marchers. But the organisers of the march,
worried about violence, had obtained a promise from the IRA that they wouldn't
cause trouble. The British paratroopers crossed into Free Derry. The
Paratroopers say they were fired at, that they shot in self-defence. But people
on the Catholic side say that nobody fired at the soldiers. No guns were found
on the victims. Nor was there any evidence that the paratroopers had been shot
at. Nobody has ever been tried for the killings.</TD>

	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"> <B><I>The Downing Street Declaration, December 1993</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>This declared that the British government's main interest was to
see peace in Northern Ireland. But talks between all the political parties in
Northern Ireland, as well as the Irish and British governments, could not take
place as long as some parties used violence to make their political point.
There are parties on both sides which have links with terrorist groups. Sinn
Fein is linked to the IRA, the Ulster Democratic Party is linked to the Ulster
Defence Association (UDA) and the Progressive Unionist Party is linked to the
Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF).<p></TD>

	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>The ceasefire, 31 August 1994</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>
In August 1994, the IRA agreed to a ceasefire, and six weeks
later so did the UDA and the UVF.<p></TD>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Ceasefire ends, 9 February 1996</I></B></FONT></TD>
<TD>
The IRA ceasefire lasted until February 1996, when the IRA bombed
the Isle of Dogs in London. Since then there have been other IRA attacks. Now
the Unionist ceasefire is thought to be disintegrating. There have been attacks
on Catholics and leading Republicans which are likely to have been by the UDA,
but the terrorists have not admitted responsibility.<p>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>What happens now?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>It is unlikely that anything will happen within the next six
months as the British general election is only months away. The Conservative
party relies on the nine Ulster Unionists in the House of Commons for votes
(Ulster Unionists tend to support Conservative policies) and so can't afford to
upset them. Neither the British and Irish governments nor the Unionists will
talk to Sinn Fein until the IRA agrees to another ceasefire. Many agree with
John Hume, leader of the SDLP, that without Sinn Fein at the peace talks there
won't be any progress towards peace. So it seems unless the IRA agrees to
another ceasefire, nothing can be achieved.<p>

	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"> <B><I>What is a landmine?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>Landmines are bombs. They are sometimes called "anti-personnel
mines" (APMs). There are three main types: blast mines, fragmentation mines and
directional mines. Blast mines are scattered randomly from the air, and explode
when they are stepped on. Fragmentation mines are laid on the ground and are
often set off by trip-wire; when they explode, they can kill people up to 50
metres away. Directional mines are like fragmentation mines but are designed to
send the fragments in a particular direction after exploding.<p>
There are new mines called "smart mines". Some of them turn themselves off
after a certain time and others explode.<p></TD>

</TR>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Why are landmines more dangerous than other bombs?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>
Landmines explode regardless of what activates them - it could be
a soldier's boot or the foot of a small child. At the end of a war, people stop
fighting but the landmines remain. Years later landmines can still maim and
kill. Eighty per cent of landmine victims are not soldiers but civilians; 20
per cent are children.<p>
Landmines are cheap and easy to make and lay - they can be bought for as little
as &#163;2. They are often scattered haphazardly by soldiers. In mine-infested
countries, even the simplest activity, such as gathering firewood or going for
a walk, can be threatening.<p>
</TD>
</TR>


<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Which countries are most affected by landmines?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>War-torn countries such as Afghanistan, Cambodia, Angola,
Mozambique and the former Yugoslavia are among the worst hit. In Bosnia and
Croatia, between four and six million landmines have been laid and nobody knows
where half of them are.<p>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>What is it like living with landmines?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>Most mines are in rural areas, where the local people farm the
land. They have three choices: either to leave the area, grow fewer crops, or
literally risk life and limb each day as they go into the fields. Most people
choose a combination of the last two.<p>
In Afghanistan and Cambodia, 35 per cent more land could be cultivated if it
were not for the threat of mines. The blast from an exploding mine often kills
people outright or leaves them to bleed to death in the fields. If they survive
they often have to have a damaged arm or leg amputated and may die later from
infection. In Cambodia one in every 236 people has lost at least one limb
through landmine injuries.<p>
Landmines also have less direct effects. The medical costs of treating victims
are high. Victims are normally unable to work and produce as much as an
able-bodied member of society and often need regular medical check-ups.
Landmines also stop refugees from returning safely to their mother country,
prevent aid workers from coming in to help, and so stop countries recovering
from war and conflict.<p> 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>What is being done to reduce the danger?</I></FONT></B></TD>
	<TD>Bomb experts, often funded by charities, are sent to the affected
countries to help local people find and disarm landmines. But this work is
expensive. On average it costs &#163;650, including the costs of training, to
disarm and remove one mine. What is really needed is for landmines to be
banned.<p>
Fifty-three countries, including the UK, say they support a global ban on the
production, export and use of landmines. But only 20 countries have completely
banned landmines, including Germany, Ireland, Jamaica and Mexico. The British
government has reserved the right to use landmines in "exceptional"
circumstances. It says it will ban landmines when everyone else does. If every
country had this attitude, landmines would never be banned.<p>

<TABLE WIDTH=550 BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=10>
<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"> <B><I>What is E. coli?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>E. coli's full name is Escherichia coli. It is a bacterium which
has always lived in the gut of most warm-blooded animals, including humans.
Most types of E. coli are harmless but some, such as E. coli 0157, can cause
severe food poisoning.<p>
E. coli seems a simple organism - we have three billion genes, but it has only
5,000. It is made of single cells, 10 times smaller than ours, with wispy hairs
called flagella. But it carries out complicated actions. The bacteria takes in
nutrients, grows and reproduces.  The E. coli rotate their flagella so they can
travel around the intestine.<p>
In 1982, the first E. coli 0157 food poisoning outbreak happened in the US.
Other types of E. coli had caused problems before but none as severe as 0157.
Most E. coli live in harmony with their host. Our intestines provide shelter
and nutrients and the E. coli helps us make vitamins to keep us healthy.
Research on the E. coli from 1950 onwards led to the discovery of genes.<p></TD>

</TR>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Why is E. coli 0157 so nasty?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>
E. coli 0157 can be very dangerous. This is because it makes two poisons (often
called toxins) which are similar to those made by the dysentery bacteria.
Scientists don't yet know how E. coli 0157 produced these toxins but think they
may have got the relevant genes to make them from other bacteria.<p>
</TD>

</TR>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>How can we be poisoned by E. coli 0157?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>E. coli 0157 has been found in water, milk, yoghurt, cheese and apple juice.
But it is most common in undercooked meat, particularly meat products from
cows. E. coli 0157 lives mainly in cattle's intestines; cows are not poisoned
by E. coli 0157 themselves but they shed it in their dung (faeces). Poor
hygiene in slaughterhouses can contaminate meat. Other meat may be infected at
the butcher's shop, and is then eaten. The E. coli will double its numbers
every 20 minutes in warm conditions.<p>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>

	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>What does E. coli 0157 actually do to us to make us so ill?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>Once inside us, the bacteria stick to the walls of the colon, and
then start to multiply. They give off toxins which attack the lining of the
gut, affecting its ability to absorb water. Blood vessels can be damaged. In
bad cases, the toxins, carried by the blood, will go to the kidneys. They will
harm the kidneys' ability to both purify the blood and make sure we have the
right amount of water and salt in our body. In severe cases, this can lead to
kidney failure and death.<p> 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>What are the symptoms of E.  coli 0157 food poisoning?</I></FONT></B></TD>
	<TD>Diarrhoea, often with blood in the faeces, severe stomach cramps,
vomiting - and in some cases even death. A severe attack can lead to long-term
problems with kidneys and blood pressure.<p>
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>What is the treatment?</I></FONT></B></TD>

<TD>There is no special drug cure. Most sufferers recover naturally,
but the old, young or weak can be killed by E. coli 0157.<p>
</TD>
</TR>


<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>How can we stop it spreading?</I></FONT></B></TD>

<TD>The following rules should be followed at all times:
<UL TYPE=SQUARE>
 	<LI>No suspected infected food should be eaten. 
	<LI>Strict hygiene is important in farms, slaughterhouses, factories, butchers' shops, restaurants, in the kitchen and after using the toilet. 
 	<LI>Meat must be cooked properly until no pink flesh remains. The bacteria wil be killed by two minutes' cooking at 70&#176;. 
 	<LI>Washing hands after using the lavatory is vital. Under your fingernails is a great breeding ground for E. coli.
	<LI>E. coli 0157 can be passed on directly from live animals, especially calves - so take special care to wash your hands thoroughly after stroking animals at a zoo or farm.

<B>We may be eating genetically engineered food without knowing it, reports Emily Moore<p></TD></B>
</TR>

 


	<TR>
	<TD> If you go to the supermarket today and buy bread, cakes or margarine, you will probably be buying food that contains soya products made from soya beans. In fact, 60 per cent of processed food contains soya. So far, two per cent of the American soya bean crop (which is where we get most of our soya from) has been genetically engineered by scientists.<p>

 
In the UK, food labels do not have to tell us when food has been genetically engineered. Many people and organisations all over the world are worried by this and believe we have a right to know  if we are eating genetically engineered foods, or gene foods, as they are often called.<p></TD>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"> <B><I>What is genetic engineering?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>All living creatures are made up of cells. The DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in the cells contains genes, which are the coded instructions which make things develop in a particular way.  New techniques mean scientists can now pick out a specific gene responsible for a particular characteristic and copy it into another life form. This is known as genetic engineering.<p></TD>

</TR>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>How have the soya beans been changed?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>
Scientists who work for the chemical company Monsanto have discovered a bacterium that can survive a heavy dose of their chemical herbicide  Roundup. The word &#147;herbicide&#148; means plant-killer. <p>
Farmers rely on herbicides to control weeds before planting and after harvesting. They can&#146;t use them while the crops are growing because that would kill the crops as well as the weeds. Monsanto scientists took a gene from the Roundup-resistant bacteria and added it to the soya plant. Now all genetically changed soya plants will not be killed by Roundup, so farmers who grow the beans will be able to use the herbicide while the crops are growing and in theory will be able to grow stronger and bigger crops.<p>
</TD>

</TR>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Have other foods been changed by scientists?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>Yes. Supermarkets in Britain already sell tomato paste from genetically altered tomatoes, called FlavrSavr, which are designed to ripen slowly, cutting out waste. Soon to come onto the market are maize (corn), rapeseed oil and potatoes. Many have been re-engineered to improve growth by making them more resistant to pests and disease or to certain herbicides.<p>
</TD>
</TR>
<TR>

	<TD VALIGN=TOP><FONT SIZE="+1"><B><I>Doesn&#146;t genetic engineering mean we can produce more food to feed the hungry?</I></B></FONT></TD>
	<TD>Some people say yes. For example, much of the soil in India and Pakistan is too salty to grow good crops. Halophytes are plants that do survive well in salty environments. If scientists could take the right gene from a halophyte and put it into a basic food crop such as wheat, maybe these crops could survive in salty soils. But many organisations, such as Greenpeace, campaign against gene foods as the new answer. They point out that the reason why there are so many hungry people is poverty - not because of a lack of food being grown in the world. So far, genetic engineering has been used to help big businesses rather than small-scale farmers or you or I, the consumers.<p> 
</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
	<TD VALIGN=TOP><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><I>Are gene foods harmful?</I></FONT></B></TD>
	<TD>Nobody knows. There could be all sorts of problems but we won&#146;t know until the damage has been done. At the moment there is no international agreement about what safety controls should apply. Some gene foods could cause allergic reactions in certain people.<p>  
There are also fears that gene foods could spread resistance to antibiotics in animal and human populations.  One of the most worrying possibilities is that a genetically changed species, such as the soya bean bred to be immune to Roundup, will breed with its wild relatives to produce &#147;superweeds&#148; - plants which are immune to herbicides. Or the new crop could become a weed itself. This could cause long-term changes to the plant world, as fragile and rare plants could be driven out of their habitat by invasive weeds. One thing we do know is that small changes in the environment can have dramatic and huge results<p>

	The Guardian's education site provides an extra dimension
to the paper's daily news coverage and the background features in our Education
and Higher Education supplements on Tuesdays. It hosts electronic debates on
the big issues affecting schools and universities. It gives a platform for the
best student writers. It provides parents and teachers with resource material
to help explain the stories behind the news. And it offers an accessible
presentation of key data on the performance of secondary schools and
universities. Read the arguments. Join the debates.

<TD><h1>The mark of true genius</h1><p>
<B>There's only one thing more challenging than writing an exam, and that's
composing the question<br>

When it comes to exams, the deal between students and lecturers is a simple
one. We the students must revise the subject and complete the subsequent
examination. Our lecturers must compose the all-important exam questions and
then grade our papers.<p>

Students should not suppose that theirs is the harder part of the bargain.
Revision requires discipline - the exam is a straightforward matter of
interpretation and application. For the hard-pressed lecturer, however, the
challenge is stark. Not in the marking of the papers, which simply requires a
high boredom threshold and the ability to decipher illegible scrawl, but in the
composition of the exam questions themselves.<p>

</TABLE>




<p>
Writing the exam question is to a lecturer what the party conference speech is
to a political leader. It is an opportunity to demonstrate what they are made
of; a showcase for their talents and reassurance of their continuing ability to
lead and inspire. The prose must be baroque yet retentive. The use of wit
serves a dual purpose: it imbues the students with a sense of warmth, and
reassures the lecturer of his/her ability to carve out an alternative career in
comedy should the short-term contract be terminated.<p>

However, humour alone is insufficient. The question must also possess a certain
literary quality before its author can be truly considered a genuine
all-rounder. The text must exude a fascinating, intricate spirit, it must
demonstrate an ineffable vocabulary and an indubitable creativity - indeed, it
must be the exam question that Ted Hughes would have written!<p>

This year we were treated to a classical feast in our law exam. We were asked
to "advise" and "discuss the liability of" Apollo, Zeus, Diomedes, Pedasos and
Laertes. Although fascinating in their Homeric milieu, they take on renewed
significance when used in questions about equal pay legislation.<p>

The exam question has become a work of art. A concomitant of the art form is
artistic pressure. Students would do well to be aware of this come the summer
exams. We are truly all in it together.</TD>

Camille, my eight-month-old daughter, is sitting bolt upright, earnestly
engrossed in the touching and tasting of the various objects within her orbit.
Two-year-old Holly is seemingly over her Christmas-induced confusion between
wrapping paper and ripping books - she scrutinises a page. What matter that it
is upside-down? I'm not going to correct her now. I've an oasis of calm in
which to study my course reader.<p>

Next instant I am leaping across the room to wrestle a piece of poo from her
lips which I'd imagined for a mistaken second was a Malteser. It must have
rolled across the room just 10 minutes earlier when Holly had proudly, but alas
clumsily, picked up her laden potty in a gesture of triumph.<p>

Such is my lot as combined 'house-husband' and Open University student. I find
that I literally have to "think on my feet", and have learnt the skill of
studying in short sprints.<p>

And, to add to the surreality of my situation, I find myself applying my
current intellectual concerns to what Nigel Planer has termed the "marshmallow
land" of baby culture. Postman Pat harks back to some profoundly reactionary
fantasy about organic community and hierarchical social relations - in the
'grown-up' world, Pat, with his cost-inefficient tendency to stand and chat,
would have been 'rationalised' long ago.<p>

</TABLE>

Several years ago, when studying at a 'terrestrial university', I could not
have imagined the strange days that lay ahead. Then I could scatter books
around my room and leave them there without a thought. A stray pen did not
constitute a lethal weapon to be jabbed up a younger sister's nostril. I could
stay up meeting deadlines with impunity. The difference now, of course, comes
in the form of two human alarm clocks who, when they wake up, are astonishingly
awake - whatever the time.<p>


And what a difference parenthood has made to me. Whereas in my life before
babies, my use of time was leisurely, sometimes lazy, now my approach as a
student is resourceful and I gain satisfaction from carving out a distinct
'space' that I claim as my own.<p>


Camille's bottom lip is beginning to tremble, Holly is poised to cack-handedly
attack my course reader with a crayon, Mrs Goggins and Postman Pat discuss the
construction of homogeneity within dominant ideological discourses, and...
Maltesers don't normally stick to your shoe, do they?

Last year I was working for Top Man in central Manchester. On the morning of 15
June, I got into work later than usual, due to a hangover. I fed Richard, my
manager, the usual "roads were busy" excuse. He didn't even raise his customary
disbelieving eyebrow as his attention was distracted by the unusual amount of
activity in the city centre. Time was dragging when suddenly we were
evacuated.<p>
<p>
I'm working in Bolton now. It's not too bad here, but it's not the same as the
city. There was a bomb scare last week at Marks and Spencer. It was petrifying,
even though I should have known what to expect. Once again, the stores in the
surrounding area were evacuated, but not ours - I couldn't understand why
not.<p>
<p>
I couldn't concentrate on work. The air felt thick and heavy in my throat and
my stomach was tight. A girl I work with said it would be a hoax. I wanted to
agree with her, but all I could reply was: "You'll be sorry." I thought about
it snowing ashes again.<p>






Sirens called people outside. They were told to get far away. I hunted for a
safe shelter somewhere in the shop, but I couldn't find one. I imagined the
flying glass that would be thrown at me.<p>

I stood in the kids' corner, sickened by the attracted onlookers, and waited
for the echoing boom to send a shuddering, shattering shower of glass through
the town. It never happened.<p>

I went into the centre of Manchester today. Seven months on and the area is
still in tatters. An eerie atmosphere cloaks the Arndale Centre; much of it
remains deserted. Most of the office windows have boards over them. The scale
of the devastation is still powerfully shocking. <p>

Each time I go into town the echoes seem to shake me a little less, but the
memories will remain strong.<p</TD>

<b>Comment by Martin Woollacott</b><P>

        <!--TEXT-->
THE illusion that there can be security without justice, with which Binyamin Netanyahu seduced Israelis in the last election, lies shattered in the streets of Gaza and Ramallah. Netanyahu promised Israelis that they could have security, the physical safety they naturally crave after generations in the firing line, and yet pay no price for it either in land or in changes in the political status of Palestinians.<p>
His mendacity or self-delusion is now clear for all to see. But the failure is not his alone. It is ironic that in the centennial year of Zionism - Theodor Herzl's The Jewish State was published in February 1896 - Zionism in its Likud variant should persist so blindly in the denial to Palestinians of the human and political rights which Jews in Israel have so vigorously demanded for themselves. Where Herzl once saw his imagined Israelis chatting in German in Viennese-style caf&#233s, with grateful Arabs in the background, their sons grapple in combat with Palestinian enemies. What Netanyahu and his government refuse to see, with not a shred of the excuses that can be offered for the early Zionists, is that one state evoked another, and until the Palestinian state is as much a reality as the Jewish one, there can be no guarantee of security. Perhaps not even then, but not until then.<p>

</TR> </TABLE>

<P>

When Netanyahu made it clear, during the campaign and after his victory, that he had not changed his absolutely negative position on Palestinian statehood, he all but pulled out the keystone from the arch of peace. If he does not soon radically change that policy, the arch will fall, with ruinous consequences for the Middle East and all who live there.<p>
This would not be a resumption of the old occupation, or even of the intifada. Neither the practical co-operation which marked the one nor the relative restraint which marked the other are recoverable now. Full-scale fighting between Israeli forces and some or all of Yasser Arafat's armed units, with or without his approval, is entirely possible now, or later, if after some temporary patching up, there is no change of Israeli policy. It would be an unequal war, no doubt, but one terrifying in its results, because, once that kind of blood has been spilt, all the structures and leaders upon which peace could be based would have been swept away.<p>
Netanyahu's churlish refusal to see Arafat, then a hasty meeting, under American pressure, dressed up as a success, the faltering of the day-to-day contacts on which the peace process as a practical matter depended, the failure to move Israeli troops, as promised, out of Hebron, the announcement of new settlements, the closing of Palestinian offices and a youth centre in Jerusalem - these were deliberate signals intended to convey one thing and one thing only: that there would be no state and no Palestinian capital in East Jerusalem. Only idiots or amateurs could have supposed that this would not lead, and lead pretty swiftly, to a Palestinian explosion. Unfortunately, both are present among Netanyahu's circle of advisers.<p>
His own reponsibility is great. The bankruptcy of the Likud tradition, only incipient under Begin and Shamir and masked by military adventures and diplomatic stonewalling, is now full-blown under Netanyahu. Vladmir Jabotinsky, father of what became the Likud tradition, famously spoke of the "iron wall". This was the idea that after throwing themselves endlessly at the ramparts of Israeli strength, the Arabs would eventually recognise that they were in a position of permanent weakness and would negotiate accordingly.<p>
In a way that has proved correct. The Arabs, including the Palestinians, have negotiated from a position of weakness. But the sting in the tail has been that, in the end, the Palestinians are still there, still angry, and still dangerous.<p>
It was Netanyahu who was the prophet of the "easy" version of the iron wall. He sold a fable to the more gullible among the Israeli people, distressed that, in spite of peace, Israelis were still dying. This was that "security" could be had, with no price to be paid and no dangers to be endured. The settlements could stay and be expanded, the Palestinians could be denied a state. Seeing the Palestinian Authority essentially as nothing more than a defective instrument of Israeli security, he naturally proposed that nothing more be conceded to it, and demanded that it come up to scratch, as if it were a mercenary police force falling down on the job.<p>
What emerged then, at the tail end of the Likud tradition, was a bastard version which held that security could be had without costs or casualties. It did not envisage the full-scale re-occupation of the territories. That would be too expensive in lives and money and there would also be diplomatic costs. But, by some magic, the Palestinians would go along with not getting a state and would take no revenge. What was this magic? The answer is pitiful. It was "peace with security". Having virtually nothing to give to the Palestinians, except some economic crumbs, all that could be promised was to trade off Israeli security for Palestinian security. If you don't hurt us, we won't hurt you, also known as We will hurt you if you hurt us. If wars could be ended like this, there would not be a violent spot on the globe.<p>
What is so mindless about this approach is its asymmetry. Jews of course need land, a state, self-esteem and pride. But Palestinians - they, of course, can make do with physical safety alone.<p>
Israel still has the possibility, even under Netanyahu to take up the Palestinian offer. The Palestinians are ready to make peace on the basis of a minimal restitution of what was taken from them.<p>
Less than half, perhaps less than a third, of the land that was once Palestinian, and the possibility of erecting on this restricted basis a small state. It is symptomatic of the cast of mind of too many Israelis, Labour as well as Likud, that such an offer cannot been seen for what it is - amazing, unprecedented, almost incredible.<p>
Do all Palestinians subscribe to it? Of course not. Do even those who do nevertheless see it as a first step toward other objectives, such as securing a right of return to Israel, or cherish inward hopes that over time demography may change the balance of power in the Holy Land? Of course they do. Yet what is on offer is still astonishing. It is madness for the Israelis to refuse it.

<TR><TD>	<B>Peace protesters who made their point: <BR>from left, Andrea Needham, Joanna Wilson, <BR>Lotta Kronlid and Angie Zelter</B></TD>
</TR>


</TABLE>FOUR women peace campaigners left Liverpool crown court in triumph last week after a jury cleared them of charges relating to £1.5 million worth of damage to a military jet which they attacked with hammers. <P>
The women had freely admitted the attack on the Hawk fighter at British Aerospace's huge plant at Warton, near Preston, where it was one of 24 similar aircraft due for export to the military government in Indonesia.
<P>The majority verdict vindicated the protesters' largely home-made defence: that the jet's export would flout repeated United Nations condemnations of Indonesian repression of the population of East Timor. Indonesia's military invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975, since when 200,000 people - more than a third of the province's population - have died.<P>

The jury's decision was greeted with passionate approval by civil rights and church groups as a rare example of the "higher cause" outweighing the ordinary considerations of criminal law.
The women argued that they "had lawful excuse to disarm Hawk ZH955 because they were using reasonable force to prevent a crime". They cited international and British legislation against genocide.
 <P>
Joanna Wilson, aged 33, and Andrea Needham, 29, of Liverpool, Lotta Kronlid, 28, of Oxford, and Angie Zelter, 44, of Cromer, Norfolk, were cleared of plotting to damage the aircraft and causing actual damage by wrecking its equipment. The verdict was greeted with sobs of disbelief in the courtroom and cheers outside, where supporters had demonstrated throughout the five-day trial.

The women told a jubilant throng of supporters that they were "delighted and grateful" at the verdict.
The four women promised to continue their campaign and revealed how easy it was to breach BAe's security and how much damage could be done to a sophisticated aircraft with a hammer.
"Aircraft are very fragile things," said Ms Needham, who gave up her job as a nurse to prepare for the direct action campaign. "We hammered on the weapons control system in the cockpit and on the wings and fuselage."
<P>
When the case came to trial, three of the campaigners opted to defend themselves. "We wanted to say in our own words why we had done it and not have it translated by some barrister into legalese . . . We could appeal to the jury on an emotional level, which a barrister could not do . . . We were allowed to say quite a lot about East Timor and about our motives.
"We were not just appealing to the jury on a moral or emotional level. In law, you can use reasonable force to prevent crimes. We felt we had a very strong case.
<P>
"It's both a moral and a legal victory. Ordinary people can see that it's wrong to sell weapons to a genocidal regime. It's so clear - and yet the Government and British Aerospace continue to think that it's right and acceptable."  <P>

        <!--TEXT-->
BRITAIN is squeezing cash out of the world&#44s poorest countries by demanding levels of debt repayment which far outweigh new loans or aid, according to aid agency figures.
As representatives of the world&#44s richest creditor nations met in Paris this week to discuss initiatives to reduce the debt burden on the developing world, aid agencies say the first comprehensive analysis of lender countries undermines the British government&#44s claim to be at the forefront of the campaign to help the world&#44s poor.

A spokesperson for Christian Aid said: &#147It is quite simply morally wrong that one of the world's richest countries should be getting more money out of the world&#44s poorest than it puts in. The very last thing these countries need is to be shelling out like this.&#148
The European Network on Debt and Development (Eurodad) &#150 a Brussels-based umbrella group including Christian Aid, Cafod and Oxfam &#151 has undertaken the first country-by-country survey of the main creditor nations.
A copy of the research, obtained by the Guardian, shows Britain has been a net recipient of cash from the Third World since 1981. The paper shows that, of the nations in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), only the US has a longer record of taking more money from the developing world than it gives out.
The figures will add to pressure on the OECD member states to relax repayment schedules. The World Bank is trying to squeeze a commitment to more generous debt relief before the bank&#44s annual meeting in Washington next week, where a British-backed package to help &#147heavily indebted poor countries&#148(HIPCs) will be on the table.
The Christian Aid spokesperson said: &#147This study throws into stark relief just how much needs to be achieved in the next 10 days. Britain has a good record of taking the lead in negotiations, but in the end we have to put our money where our mouth is.&#148
An official at the Overseas Development Agency declined to comment on the Eurodad report before publication this week, but insisted Britain had a good record on aid.
Britain&#44s Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, is prepared to increase the slice of outstanding loans which can be written off from 67 per cent to 80 or 90 per cent. But several lenders, in particular Japan, have refused to offer anything more than the possibility of more generous relief on a case-by-case basis.
An announcement on the HIPC initiative involving a trust fund to pay off debts is expected in Washington next week. The World Bank is lobbying the OECD nations for a more concrete commitment on cuts in bilateral debt. The bank has pledged $2 billion to the HIPC initiative. But officials point out that the eligibility criteria stipulate that only debt accumulated before any loan rescheduling is eligible for relief. This would rule out many of the world&#44s poorest nations from significant assistance.
An internal World Bank paper issued this month estimates that even with an 80 per cent cut-off, the eligibility rules mean that in practice only 17 per cent of bilateral debt could be written off.
Christian Aid said that because many loans to poor countries were conditional on the purchase of British goods, Britain gained doubly. &#147We benefit from the increased exports, and then again from the interest on the loans given to buy these exports.&#148<P>

Much of the most<br>productive land in Africa is now turned<br>over to growing cash crops for export<br> <B>Photograph: Joe Alexander</B></TD></TR> </TABLE><p>Cheap grain aid distorts local markets. In India, Mari Marcel Thekaekara, a worker for Accord, which encourages self-help, describes a &#147;deep burning anger&#148; caused by aid which undercuts the price of local foods and cripples their efforts.<p>Writing in the New Internationalist, she says: &#147;Under the new economic regime, we are encouraged to produce cash crops. Special subsidies and soft loans - aid by another name - are being floated to encourage change. So the Thanjuvar rice belt is being transformed into a giant prawn pond to export shrimps to Japan. In the Nilgiris, people are being exhorted to change from food crops to flowers for export. Farmers grow orchids while vegetables rot in the fields because farmers cannot even get back the picking price. As a result, food production has dropped alarmingly in these areas.&#148;<p>In the name of free trade and to make money to pay off national debts or for &#147;development&#148;, food is no longer something grown locally to be eaten locally. It is a cash crop for consumers in a rich foreign country. Farm land anywhere is now a resource to be used by the industrialised world. Much of the most productive land in Africa and other poorer regions is now turned over to growing cocoa, coffee, tea and cut flowers for Western markets. The old subsistence crops have been swept away to more marginal lands, where farming is more difficult because all available water for irrigation is poured into keeping up the quality of the cash crops.<p>Barry Coates, director of the World Development Movement, believes that the dominance of the idea of free trade masks what is really happening. Food control through multinational companies means that world prices are fixed and the poorest countries are made vulnerable. He points to Cargill Incorporated, the US giant that controls much of the world seed and grain trade; it has 140 affiliates, 800 plants and 300 offices in 60 countries; its sales of $23 billion make its income equal to the nine sub-Saharan African countries.<p>He says: &#147;It is disgraceful that the interests of a handful of greedy multinationals have been put before the needs of the world&#146;s hungry.&#148;<p> The free marketeers argue that with markets that operate properly the world food surplus would be translated into reasonable rations for all. Aid and development agencies say that is bunk - and anyway the arguments about who controls food distribution and exploitation may be overtaken by events. The Worldwatch Institute points out that there are 90 million extra mouths to feed each year, and a growing demand for grain from China and the &#147;tiger&#148; economies of southeast Asia.<p>Take just one ancient source of food. Worldwatch president Lester Brown says that from 1950 to 1990 world fish catches increased dramatically, but since then have remained static, because the 17 major world fisheries are at maximum capacity and some have been over-fished. Catches have declined 9 per cent since 1990, and fish is more expensive than meat in many countries. Western purchasing power and catching technology are depriving poorer countries of their most important source of protein.<p>The world&#146;s grain harvest increased from 631 million tonnes in 1950 to 1,780 million tonnes in 1990, a gain of 182 per cent, or 3 per cent a year. But since 1990 it has only risen by a total of 3 per cent. Because of world population growth in the same period, the grain harvest per head has effectively fallen by 6 per cent. Much of the big increase came from irrigation and over-use of fertiliser. So the future does not look good. Aquifer depletion, diversion of irrigation water to cities, and the waterlogging and salting of irrigation systems has reduced the land available for growing crops.<p>Brown adds that China&#146;s 1.2 billion people are getting more affluent and demanding more meat, eggs and beer in their diet: anything multiplied by 1.2 billion is a lot of consumption - all these new additions to diet consume grain. When China buys all the surplus grain at world market prices then the poor elsewhere will starve.<p>The British Government believes free trade and environmental protection are compatible, but it does state: &#147;The conditions of international trade should not encourage producers and investors to ignore legitimate local environmental concerns.&#148;<p>Professor David Hall, a plant biologist from King&#146;s College, London, says there are scientists who believe it is possible to feed 8 billion people; if grain were used to feed chicken rather than beef it would free millions of acres of land to grow more grain - and technology to improve grain harvests 30-fold already exists. All we need are the correct political and economic policies.<p><p><br><br><P><I>If you wish to subscribe to the Guardian Weekly, <A HREF="mailto:gwwwsubs@guardian.co.uk">click here</A> and ask for details.</I> </tr></TABLE></center><BR clear=all><P><!--NAVAGATION BAR--><CENTER><TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING="2" CELLSPACING="10" WIDTH="500">	<TR>	<TD WIDTH=250 align=center>	<B><A HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/gweekly/index.html">Guardian Weekly</A></B>	</TD>		<TD WIDTH=250 align=center>	<A HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/"><B>The Guardian</B></A>	</TD> 		<TD WIDTH=250 align=center> <B><A  	HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/cgi-bin/wwwwais/wwwwais">Search</A></B>	</TD>		<TD WIDTH=250 align=center>	<A HREF="http://www.observer.co.uk/"><B>The Observer</B></A>	</TD></TR><TR> <TD colspan=5 align=center><A HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/gweekly/archive.html"><B>Archive Guardian Weekly stories</B></A> </TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><P><center>&copy; Guardian Media Group plc 1996.

<font size="5"><b>The data you can't ignore</b></font><br>


<font size="3"><b>The Government's league tables won't tell parents everything they need 
to know about a school. But they do provide a solid basis for choice, 
writes John Carvel</b></font><P>
<font size=3>
Love them or hate them, the Government's league tables of secondary school exam performance have become a high point of the education year. Teachers may dislike the attempt to categorise their effectiveness by ranking raw exam results without taking account of the social, economic and educational background of the children with whom they work. Parents may know that there is more to education than a school's ability to get a certain percentage of its pupils above the particular benchmarks chosen by ministers to measure success.
<p>

But, rightly or wrongly, the tables fix the world's interpretation of a school's performance. They provide at least some basis of information to help parents choose a child's secondary school or decide on a move to college for A levels or vocational qualifications. They cannot be ignored. Any single set of statistics is arbitrary and the most popular indicator - the percentage of pupils getting at least five GCSEs at grade C or above - does not say everything there is to know about the quality of education provided.
<p>

There are dangers that over-concentration on this measure may encourage teachers to devote too much attention to raising the performance of middle-rankers above that key threshold at the expense of low-achievers for whom a clutch of lower grades may be essential for later development. That is why the Guardian provides as full a set of figures as possible. In a special supplement in the paper on November 20 and on this website, we have provided three measures of schools' performance at GCSE, so readers can assess performance throughout the range of achievement. We also include two columns of information on A level performance and four on vocational qualifications. This is backed up by data on school size and numbers of pupils with special needs.
<p>

The figures do not yet give information about how well schools are achieving, given the academic quality of their intake. A middle-ranking school in a deprived area may be doing a much better job than a high-ranker with socially privileged pupils. But the raw data still counts as one of the factors parents need to assess alongside a school's ethos, non-academic achievement and the quality of its staff.

<b>Richard Norton-Taylor</b><P>

        <!--TEXT-->
THE Swiss government this week responded to growing international pressure by agreeing to an official inquiry into the whereabouts of Nazi gold and Jewish assets deposited in Swiss bank accounts.
It backed a bill that would set up a commission of historians, lawyers, and financial experts told to penetrate the country's bank secrecy laws. "The investigation will cover the lost or stolen assets of victims of National Socialism [Nazism] as well as Nazi assets brought into Switzerland," a cabinet statement said.

Flavio Cotti, the Swiss foreign minister - who was due to meet the UK Foreign Secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, in Zurich on Wednesday - said Switzerland was prepared to investigate what he called "this chapter in its recent history".
He added that the Swiss authorities had already "dealt intensively with the issue of assets of Nazi victims" - a reference to a 1946 agreement between Switzerland, Britain, France and the United States.
The British Foreign Office last week published a report showing that the Allies received only $58 million -just 12 per cent of the total amount of looted Nazi gold estimated to have been deposited in Swiss banks. The Foreign Office report suggested that Nazi gold worth nearly 
$6 billion at today's prices was deposited in Swiss banks.
Greville Janner, British Labour MP and chairman of the Holocaust Educational Trust, who met Robert Reich, charg&#233; d'affaires at the Swiss embassy in London on Monday, said it seemed that "the glacier of immorality is starting to melt through the heat of international pressure". Mr Janner asked the Swiss government to set up an agency to help survivors of the Holocaust trace their assests.
A group of relatives of Auschwitz victims gathered outside the Swiss embassy during the meeting. 
An international committee, headed by Paul Volcker, former chairman of the US Federal Reserve, is separately investigating dormant accounts belonging to Jewish victims of the Holocaust.
Newly released US documents include 1944 intelligence intercepts suggesting that Swiss banks "gave tremendous assistance to the enemy" in operations dictated "solely by the profit motive of Swiss banks".

<b>Ken Wiwa</B><P>

        <!--TEXT-->






<P><P>A YEAR ago, I drove myself to breakdown trying to draw the attention of politicians to a tragedy unfolding before the world&#146;s eyes. It was in vain. My father, Ken Saro-Wiwa, and eight other Ogoni environmentalists were, as John Major put it, &#147;judicially murdered&#148;.</TD></TR></TABLE></center>

<B>Photograph: Tim Stockhill/Rex</B></TD>
</TR> </TABLE>

<p>
The Prime Minister was just one of the voices fast to condemn the execution but slow to intervene to prevent it. They, along with the Shell company, had pressed us to mind their &#147;quiet diplomacy&#148; when those who knew, like Wole Soyinka, were saying that only tough, direct action would impress the military junta.<p>

In the days that followed I had many messages of condolence from Commonwealth and European leaders. I was even received by the Secretary General of the United Nations. Many promises were made. My father&#146;s death would not be in vain. Serious questions would be asked of Shell&#146;s role in the Ogoni saga. Resolutions were passed by parliaments around the world, including the UN General Assembly. Many fine words, but little action, followed.<p>
Today, our families are still in mourning. But our thoughts are also with the 19 Ogoni men still held in a Port Harcourt prison where they saw my father&#146;s execution. Their crime is the same as his - standing up for the social and environmental justice that in Britain we take for granted. It is too late for my father. But not for them or for the people of Ogoni.<p>

Meanwhile, in Ogoni, the military road-blocks are again in place. The people are still subject to arbitrary justice by a regime which has declared itself judge and jury and proved itself no respecter of the international community, public opinion, the laws and moral imperatives of economics and common decency.<p>

In the face of worldwide pressure, the Nigerian dictatorship pleads for time, citing its timetable for a return to democracy. So much for the pious promises of a year ago. Time will tell whether the General is sincere, whether the measures that Shell claims to have put in place will be maintained.<p>

For us, our requests are simple. As a son, I would like my father&#146;s body returned for burial. The dictators still deny us that. As an Ogoni, I would like my people and our land to be treated by Shell with the same respect as they afford communities in Britain. As a democrat, I would like Nigeria freed from military dictatorship. As a citizen, I would like democratic politicians to recognise that they must hold accountable people who perpetrate crimes such as the murder of my father.<p>

In the next year, I hope the silent elements within Shell who prefer constructive engagement rather than sly cussedness will examine their consciences and stand up. It is not enough, as my father pointed out, &#147;to hide under the claim that they are only doing their duty&#148;.<p>

Some, like Shell&#146;s former environmentalist Bopp van Dessel who resigned in protest at the company&#146;s record in the Delta, have shown great courage. There are many others who have misgivings, but whose apprehensions are for the general good. It is shameful that Shell preaches against &#147;emotive reaction&#148;.<p>

Thus far it has chosen to carry on as usual and hire expensive image-launderers to wipe the stain of blood from its conscience. The fact that Shell and the Nigerian government have spent millions only fills me with contempt. But as my father said: &#147;I and my colleagues are not the only ones on trial. Shell is here on trial . . . the company has ducked this particular trial, but its day will surely come . . . the ecological war that the company has waged in Delta will be called into question and the crimes of that war will be punished. The crime of the company&#146;s dirty wars against the Ogoni people will also be punished.&#148; <p>

The debate moved into a new sphere with my father&#146;s death, but Shell and the Nigerian authorities remain two steps behind. It is only a matter of time before their crimes catch up with them. How many Shell executives would be prepared to walk the gallows to defend their beliefs? This past year has, for me, been one of recovery. The future offers the tantalising prospect of reconciliation. I have always tried to maintain an equilibrium and dignity in the face of great insensitivity, provocation and even hostility.<p>
I have my father&#146;s legacy to uphold and his example to follow.<p>

<P>Perus post-modern guerrillas draw their inspiration from history but ignore contemporary facts</TD></TR></TABLE></center>

</TR> </TABLE>

<p>There is a long and honourable tradition of guerrilla activity in Latin America that has ebbed and flowed over decades and centuries. Independence from Spain in the early 1800s would never have been successful without the innumerable guerrilla armies that helped to put in place a new world order. Oligarchic, unrepresentative and authoritarian regimes have run most of the continent ever since.

<p>More than a century later, in the 1960s and 1970s, guerrilla groups sprang up everywhere in the (usually) vain hope of repeating the success of the Cuban revolution.

<p>So the Peruvian rebels who have reappeared in Lima with such a dramatic sense of theatre have plenty of forerunners. Indeed for long-term observers of the continent, there is a sense of having seen all this before: the seizure of hostages, the kidnapping of foreign diplomats, the ransom demands, the reading-out of obscure political manifestos. From Uruguay to El Salvador, from Argentina to Nicaragua, these were the steady spectaculars of the 1970s. Embassies strengthened their security, the CIA sent in their counter-insurgency and torture teams, and military dictatorships were installed to kill off a generation of young revolutionaries.

<p>In one sense, the actions of the Peruvian group Tupac Amaru are a simple post-modern replay of the past. Today's rebels reinforce their revolutionary credentials by their willingness to refer back to the triumphs of their predecessors. Tupac Amaru himself sparked off a rebellion in 1780 that reached from the countryside into every Spanish town in the Andes. In the 1960s, Cuban-backed guerrillas invoking the image of Che Guevara tried to do the same, not just in Peru but all over the continent.

<p>Yet today's revolutionaries seem to owe more to current abstruse theories about culture than to a detailed consideration of historical example. In the 1990s in Peru, and also in Mexico, we have been seeing the emergence of post-modern guerrilla movements that are rather different from those that appeared before. The iconography may look the same - the masks, the weapons, the red flags - but the ideology is different.

<p>The aim of these armed bands is not to seize power and effect a revolution in society through armed struggle, defeating regular armies through guerrilla warfare. That would be a hopeless task. Their more simple purpose, using the weapons of imitation, parody and pastiche, is to cast doubt on the viability of the current neo-conservative ideology that spread its suffocating blanket over the entire continent. They hope to destabilise the governments of their countries and, from the ensuing chaos, to set them off on a new path.

<p>These guerrillas use the same words and rhetoric as their forerunners, but their slogans have mostly lost their meaning. They still invoke the Cuban example, yet everyone knows that it is many years since Fidel Castro's regime gave anyone a helping hand. They claim to be fighting imperialism, yet in the absence of the Soviet Union, which was once able to provide a counter-weight to the regional superpower, there is no possibility that local resistance movements will be allowed to survive.

<p>Counter-insurgency techniques are infinitely more developed than they were 30 years ago. Much of Latin America's rural hinterland has been drained of population, and small anti-government armed groups can survive as local irritants only in obscure areas. While immense shanty towns can spawn endless recruits for rebel groups, there is no common culture of the kind that Islam provides for the revolutionaries of the Middle East. Even Peru's Sendero Luminoso has been hammered into the ground.

<p>Nor is there now much opportunity to conduct the classic revolutionary war in which a guerrilla outburst sparks off a larger conflagration. In the case of Mexico, the localised guerrilla movement in the rural areas of Chiapas, on Mexico's border with Guatemala, failed to ignite much activity elsewhere.

<p>The Zapatistas have been using the 20th century peasant leader Emiliano Zapata as their emblematic figurehead, in much the same way that the Peruvians have been iconising the 18th century rebel Tupac Amaru, but these talismanic invocations have had little effect. The notoriously compromised Mexican left has not been able to use the guerrilla challenge to unite its own political forces against the government. When the old and creaking political system in Mexico does break down it will be to the benefit of the right rather than the left.

<p>

<p>The outlook in Peru is equally pessimistic. Peru in the 1990s has been emerging from a 25-year period of crisis in which its traditions, its political institutions and society itself, have been dramatically transformed. The country in the process has tried every kind of political recipe, including socialism imposed by military fiat and populism enforced through charismatic corruption.

<p>Springing from nowhere, and without party label or baggage, President Alberto Fujimori has imposed the standard economic programme of the new global world order. As everyone now recognises, this makes the rich richer and the poor poorer.

<p>The grounds for dissatisfaction are legion, and groups such as Tupac Amaru have no difficulty in finding recruits. But the cards are stacked against them. Fujimori may get a bad press for closing down the country's congress, but he has received firm international support and remains popular at home.

<p>The rebels' only real hope of securing change is through martyrdom, and the Japanese government - still uncomfortable with its role as a global political player - has been moving heaven and earth to prevent this. The original rebellion of Tupac Amaru was drowned by the Spaniards in blood. Hundreds of Indians were executed in the towns of the Andes, both in the morning and in the afternoon. It was a terrible warning, and there was silence for a generation. But then the Spaniards were gone.

</TR> </TABLE>

<p>Zaire's cancer-ridden president, Mobutu Sese Seko, was carried to his latest television interview on a stretcher. Propped up in a chair in the plush villa he may never leave, Zaire's despot was prodded into bursts of lucidity in a futile attempt to pretend that he is still in control of his war-ravaged nation and will one day go home.
<p>Last week President Jacques Chirac of France was in Africa, making an equally vain effort to persuade his country's former colonies that its influence on the continent is not withering with Mr Mobutu.
<p>France has stood by powerless as one of the nations central to what Paris considers its domain in Africa has imploded. Rwandan soldiers, Zairean rebels and Ugandan troops have driven Mr Mobutu's army from large swaths of eastern Zaire.
<p>The rebels  a mixture of resuscitated, post-independence guerrilla movements and persecuted Zairean Tutsis  claim to be within striking distance of Kisangani, the country's third largest city, and the rich diamond fields of Kasai province.
<p>It is not that Paris does not wish to intervene. It did all it could to try to engineer international approval for a force similar to the one it led into Rwanda in 1994 in an attempt to keep that tragic nation under Paris's wing. That move backfired badly, not only producing a government in Kigali deeply hostile to France, but also laying the ground for the civil war in Zaire.
<p>But this time France was forced to confront new limits to its neo-colonial adventurism in Africa. The US ambassador to Zaire, Daniel Simpson, put succinctly the new realities. France is no longer capable of imposing itself in Africa, he said in an interview with a Zairean newspaper. Neo-colonialism is no longer tolerated. The French attitude no longer reflects the reality of the situation.
<p>Paris spluttered its protest, but its former African colonies took note at a francophone summit in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, last week. Although they went along with Mr Chirac's call for a multinational force to protect civilians in eastern Zaire, it was a token demonstration amid an unusual air of defiance.
<p>France, more than any former colonial power, has maintained ties that bind Africa. It props up regional currencies and economies in return for markets and investment. But the relationship also helps France to maintain its self-perception as a major power, especially at the United Nations.
<p>Underscoring French resolve that its former colonies should remain loyal is a deep-seated fear of the spread of Anglo-Saxon culture. But Mr Chirac appears to have recognised that the days of French unilateral intervention in Africa are over.
<p>Last week he told Zaire's prime minister, Kengo Wa Dondo, that France would help to drive out foreign forces, but only when Zaire had restructured its army, an unrealistic hope according to rueful French diplomats.
<p>Three years ago President Mobutu would only have had to ask, and French troops, advisers and equipment would have been defending his cities. The naked self-interest of French intervention in Rwanda in 1994 put paid to all that. Paris was not alone in standing by while hundreds of thousands of Tutsis were murdered. But it continued to support the extremist Hutu regime which oversaw the genocide.
<p>Three months after the slaughter started, Paris persuaded the UN Security Council to authorise it to occupy western Rwanda, ostensibly to save Tutsis. But it was far too late. Almost all the Tutsis in the region were dead or gone. In reality, France was making a last bid to prop up the defeated Hutu regime against Rwandan Tutsi rebels whom Paris viewed as little more than an anglophone front because the bulk of the leadership had been raised in English-speaking Uganda.
<p>Paris was not only unable to prevent the collapse of the former government, but it also laid the groundwork for the present crisis in eastern Zaire and the undermining of France's influence in Africa.
<p>French soldiers helped to provide an escape route for soldiers of the defeated Hutu army and extremist militias into Zaire, where they used the refugee camps to attack and threaten the new Rwandan government. The Tutsi-led government responded with the recent invasion.
<p>If eastern Zaire has demonstrated the new limits on French adventurism in Africa, it was the US that willingly drew the line. The US orbit in Africa has grown since the end of the Cold War.
<p>In October, Washington and Paris got into a spat over sarcastic remarks by a junior French minister about the first trip to Africa by the then US secretary of state, Warren Christopher, shortly before the American election.
<p>But the real tension lay elsewhere. A few days earlier, France had frustrated US plans for a standing African intervention force, saying it was ill thought out.
<p>By the time Rwanda invaded eastern Zaire, the US was more than willing to block French adventurism. Paris pushed to lead an intervention force, again claiming it was only motivated to save civilian lives. But Mr Chirac recognised that the political climate would not permit France to act on its own, and to others, including Britain, it smacked too much of 1994.
<p>The French foreign minister, Hervé de Charette, accused the Americans and the British of being spineless and, by extension, racist for failing to want to help Africans. But Washington was buying time for its Rwandan allies finally to whip their opponents in Zaire and, in the process, lay to rest French aspirations.

<p><b>The results of the Research Assessment Exercise are the most important announcement of the decade for universities and research institutes in the UK, writes Donald MacLeod. The Guardian has compiled two league tables that rank the research prowess of all 192 rated institutions</b>

<p>The research assessment determines funding for universities, institutes and colleges for the rest of the century and beyond. For many departments the verdict spells the end of research activity altogether - their staff will have to concentrate on teaching from now on.

<p>Ratings for 2,896 departments in 192 universities, institutes and colleges across the UK were announced on Thursday 19 December by four funding councils - the Higher Education Funding Council for England, the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council, the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales and the Department of Education Northern Ireland.

<p>The work of 55,893 academics was assessed by 60 subject panels in an exercise costing £2m. Work over the past four years (six years in humanities) was judged on a seven-point scale from 1 (virtually no research of national excellence) to 5* (research of international excellence in a majority of areas of activity).

<p>No single league table tells the whole story, so The Guardian has compiled two tables listing institution ratings and university ratings. Each table has two sections: one for researchers and one for staff members. Based on the average score for each researcher entered for consideration by the 60 subject panels, the results favour the institutions that have been more ruthlessly selective. Based on the average score per member of staff, the results favour those with strength in depth but show new universities with a handful of good research departments in an unflattering light.

<b>Hugo Young</b><P>

        <!--TEXT-->
THIS year's Nobel Peace Prize is the most arresting award for many years. It's the first one I can recall that defeats the smootheries of international acquiescence. When Aung San Suu Kyi was nobelled she was reviled by the Burmese military, but the world at large wasn't running such extravagantly pro-Burma policies that it felt obliged to regard the laureate as an alien spirit. Desmond Tutu, the Irish Peace Women, even Henry Kissinger had records that weren't an open challenge to governments.<p> 
Bishop Carlos Belo and Jose Ramos-Horta, who have been honoured for their defence of East Timor against the vile and illegal occupation by Indonesia, are rather different. They stand for something that can only arouse collective embarrassment.<p>

They have sustained a cause to which the international community pays lip-service but little else. Self-determination for East Timor, while attracting the mild approval of the United Nations and the European Union, has elicited hardly a single meaningful action from either body. Indonesia, buyer of arms, focus of trade and source of oil, rules. On the trade-off between trade and human rights, the Nobel committee gives an answer which rejects the answer given by the powers of the world. This is a resonant challenge, long scorned by the British Tories, among others, but surely addressed also to the party offering itself as their more sensitive and principled successor. When, outside the Nobel committee, should human rights take precedence over self-interest?<p>

The appalling condition of East Timor is not in dispute. Anyone who wants to know the details can get an up-to-the-minute pamphlet from the Catholic Institute for International Relations (190a New North Road, London N1), which is known for its accurate history and research. In 11 years of illegal occupation, Indonesia has brought about the deaths of about 200,000 East Timorese, and seeded the Catholic country with about 100,000 settlers, mostly Islamic and often forced, from Java. Its military government has starved the people and tried to break their language and culture. It has jailed resisters, abolished free speech, but not so far succeeded in crushing Bishop Belo's Church.<p>

The bishop is one of those who have, surprisingly, been able to keep this small and distant place on the radar screen. Courageous journalism has helped. The massacre of Santa Cruz five years ago was caught on camera, and the work of John Pilger and Hugh O'Shaughnessy has played a great part in disorienting the Jakarta government, which never expected that its Timorese adventure would still be in contention 20 years later. The people of East Timor themselves are their own, indefatigable heroes.<p>

But what of the world? The UN has passed some empty resolutions, and the EU has agreed a pious text. Behind a rhetoric of concern stands the inertia of submission. The lure of trade has been the unguent of tolerance. Britain sold $200 million of weaponry to Indonesia between 1988 and 1992, and more than doubled that in a single deal for 24 Hawk fighter/trainer jets in November 1995. Foreign Office denials that aid, which has marched in close step with arms deals, has anything to do with commerce have to be read in the context of similar denials over the Malaysian Pergau Dam, which the courts did not uphold.
The Government has concerns about all this. But as the Scott report copiously revealed, its preferred way of dealing with them, in the complex greyness of arms trading, is by non-disclosure. The Foreign Office seldom looks further than the location of power.<p> 

In 1993, Douglas Hurd went so far as explicitly to sympathise with Indonesia's separatist problems, referring with disdain to "some theoretical people in the West talking about the purity of self-determination". As Foreign Secretary, he always showed a coldly sceptical attitude to the role of human rights in determining foreign policy decisions. In connection with aid to Indonesia, he again said in 1993 that insisting on a link with human rights was not a "sensible and fruitful thing to do".<p>

Such thinking will condition the real reaction of power-brokers to East Timor's new eminence, whatever bromides they feel obliged to utter. The Nobel disturbs their policy of quiet indifference. Perhaps it will even elevate East Timor, for a while, into a popular cause. There was evidence of this even before the Nobel, when a British jury, to universal astonishment, acquitted four women who admitted sabotaging fighter jets bound for Indonesia. Their defence, that they had a higher duty to prevent genocide in East Timor, struck the populist conscience in a way that previously only South Africa might have done.<p>

For a future Labour government, South Africa in fact offers a pointed antecedent. In the late sixties, more than half the Wilson Cabinet wanted to sell arms to South Africa, but the minority mobilised party and popular opinion against the deal. The conscience vote won the argument. It was a position which even a passionate arms seller like Denis Healey, when he wrote his memoirs, admitted had been correct. Whether a similar kind of conscience will be exhibited by New Labour, in respect of East Timor or anywhere else, remains for the moment decidedly moot.<p>

The party's line on the arms trade is studiously unthreatening. It says it won't grant licences for weapons that might be used for internal repression or external aggression, for abusing human rights or perpetrating torture. But it won't interfere with existing licences, and has no intention of defining which customers for the biggest of all UK export industries might fall within its notional ban. It states, in short, purposes that are almost identical with the present government's.<p>

Does East Timor merit any support, even at the expense of British jobs? As it happens, Tony Blair was this week well-placed to address it, at the Commonwealth Press Union in South Africa. There couldn't have been a better forum in which to venture some indicative thoughts about New Labour's global values. Instead it was the same old stuff, of New Labour Britain, about which the world has little reason to care a jot.<p>

<b>Jonathan Steele in Kabul</b><P>

        <!--TEXT-->
AS thousands of women doctors, teachers and other professionals in Kabul, the Afghan capital, started a second week at home, Western aid agencies have decided not to confront the Taliban authorities over the ban on working women and its closure of girls&#146; schools.<P>
After two long and agonised meetings, the non&#150;governmental organisations operating in Afghanistan are taking a softly&#150;softly approach in a joint statement which was handed this week to Mullah Mohammad Ghaus, acting foreign minister in the new caretaker government.<P>
Mullah Ghaus, who also belongs to the Taliban&#146;s all&#150;powerful six&#150;man ruling council, gave the first press conference since the fundamentalist militia captured Kabul on September 27. <p>

</TR> </TABLE><P>

He repeatedly pleaded for aid, saying it had been wrong for the outside world to &#147;neglect&#148; Afghanistan after the Soviet Union was forced to withdraw. Although he implied that Afghanistan could not accept conditions for aid, since this would be interference in the country&#146;s internal affairs, his insistent calls for help showed he understood the country was in a weak position.<P> 
The United Nations secretary&#150;general, Boutros Boutros&#150;Ghali, has warned the Taliban that discrimination against women in employment and education could seriously affect relief programmes.<P>
He also told UN agencies to adhere to the UN Charter on equal rights for women and speak with one voice.<P>
The United States also warned the new Islamist rulers that they risked forfeiting reconstruction aid for Afghanistan if they continued to restrict women&#146;s rights. The US State Department said it had seen &#147;some very disturbing signs&#148; since the Taliban captured Kabul and clamped down on women working and girls going to school.<P>
Nevertheless the dominant mood among the international aid community in Kabul is to give the Taliban time and not turn the issue of the veil into a clash of principle. The NGOs&#146; joint statement to the authorities is understood to say the agencies &#147;respect the local cultures of Afghanistan&#148;.<P>
It contains no hint of withdrawal of aid if the Taliban&#146;s position on women is not changed. Privately, however, agency officials say aid is the international community&#146;s only leverage.<P>
For the time being, all agencies have told their women staff not to come to work. This has meant the collapse of almost every aid project. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees runs programmes for women in tailoring, carpet&#150;weaving and jewellery&#150;making. They are paid in cash or food. But programmes for young men in car repairs and masonry have also stopped because women help to monitor them.<P>
Despite the crisis, the big agencies claim the gentle approach is best. &#147;We&#146;re not a human rights organisation, we&#146;re a human assistance programme,&#148; said Thomas Gurtner, deputy head of the International Committee of the Red Cross.<P>

<b>John Vidal</B><P>

        <!--TEXT-->






<P>John Vidal urges Princess Diana to help us fill the moral vacuum in society, and offers some ethically challenged dragons for her to slay</TD></TR></TABLE></center>  



         <TABLE width=205 align=right BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=10 cellspacing=1>
        <TR><TD valign=top>
<IMG SRC="pix/diana.gif" alt="Diana cartoon" ALIGN=right> </TD>

</TR> </TABLE>

<p>I defy anyone to see children being blown up by anti-personnel mines and not want to shout about the immense cruelty nor  want to throttle the politicians who have argued consistently that they are necessary evils.<p><p>So when the establishment argues that Princess Diana is "ill-advised", that "she should not meddle in politics", or that "things are not so straightforward", it is hard not to retch. Clearly, what hurts the Government is that when Diana speaks from the gut and calls for a worldwide ban on mines she is not just exposing the awfulness of the weapon, but also the amorality of the people who have spent years protecting the interests of the dealers and the corporations who cynically make them and sell them. The Government.<p><p>Ah, but things are not straightforward: you can't just address these things so shallowly, the politicians whinge. And they are dead right. It is impossible to change anything unless there is the political will and a real appetite for change-which there axiomatically cannot be while politicians are so compromised by having their snouts in the trough and their heads in the clouds.<p><p>In the case of anti-personnel mines, the only reason that the Conservative party favours their long phase-out at all is that it has been heavily lobbied by the arms-makers who see a whopping new market for expensive hi-tech self-detonating mines, which, they argue, will keep Britain's lead in weapon technology and be in the "national interest". It is the morality of the slaughterhouse.<p><p>But "I-only-want-to-help" Diana is entering uncharted waters, going way beyond her previous concern for Aids and leprosy sufferers. To be cynical, her Angolan trip can be seen as a way to reposition herself as a living saint. She has picked an easy-to-understand, black-and-white issue that she knows will improve her moral standing.<p><p>And why should she not be political, her advisers will be asking today? The mine row has not hurt her; indeed, it has left her looking more spotless than Mother Teresa and as PC as the Body Shop's Anita Roddick. Given the political moral vacuum, confusion in the churches, reluctance in business and the dreadful absence of international responsibility in Britain today, there is plenty of room for someone, however expensive their clothes, to star in the moral firmament.<p><p>Moreover Diana has a clear run in royal circles, too. Prince Charles is consumed with his own affairs and is in danger of being reinvented by committee as a safe, value-free business ambassador of the corporate establishment. Don't expect too many pronouncements about difficult political and social issues like the environment from Highgrove these days. Diana could easily take on the pure green mantle.<p><p>Her way is clear in every direction. So what issue should she address next? A straw poll at the Guardian suggests that she should first bolster her image as a champion of morality, and move smartly to condemn child slavery in any one of a dozen countries. It can't fail to appeal everywhere in the old world, and will offend a few notable British commercial interests. When the political dust has settled, she could usefully expose British government shilly-shallying on sex tourism. With the right people embarrassed and the populace impressed, she could then undertake a world tour to address the scandal of overseas aid and the way it has been cut to ribbons yet is still being abused by corporations. A Schumacher Lecture broadside at the World Bank and the IMF for perpetuating Third World debt would earn her points, as would well-timed outrage at the tobacco companies, the baby-milk makers and some of the mining companies. Indeed, the quickest way to sainthood might be to say something outrageous and precipitate a massive show-trial libel case.<p><p>But it's early days. The princess could throw caution to the immediate wind and form an alliance with Lynda Chalker, the formidable minister for overseas development, to campaign for a huge increase in Third World contraception availability and primary health care. If that's not controversial enough, she could join Amnesty International, International Pen and Victims of Torture. If she visited Nicaraguan coffee plantations to see how "fair trade" improved the life of campesinos for next to no cost, she would stack up the points in heaven.<p><p>But a proto-saint will not be able to help treading on Charles's old environment agenda. This she could hijack in a trice by visiting Brazil, joining for a week the army of landless peasants and taking on Brazilian and Malaysian corporations for their rainforest destruction. She could swing back across the Far East, smash up a Hawk jet to prevent more genocide, and invest her fortune in ethical stock.<p><p>A well-orchestrated swim in the Euphrates or the Nile might graphically illustrate the coming reality of water wars. If she then declared herself a vegetarian, her way would be clear to champion animal-rights issues, and campaign against hunting, the new bio-technologies and the patenting of life. Street cred would improve if she got herself arrested in a protest at Newbury or Manchester Airport.<p><p>And if she found a taste for social equality, Diana could run riot in Britain, for a start condemning policies that make one-third of all children born in the UK officially poor by European Union definition. Her views on beggars, bicycles, servants would be courted. War heroes, social workers, pensioners, children and all the creatures without voice would queue to touch her garments. Were she to sell the Big Issue magazine and campaign for free buses, the Government might fall.<p><p>But before embarking on such a moral crusade, though, she should know that "volunteering" is now no longer seen as purely altruistic. The greatest gains are thought to accrue to the volunteer, who gains deep self-knowledge. For example, someone who wears &#163;10,000 dresses yet who has experienced real poverty may be expected no longer to be so committed to the material world.<p><p>

<b> Ian Katz.</b><P>

	<!--TEXT--> THIS time it was very different. After the World Trade Centre bombing, Americans shuddered with the realisation that international terrorism had arrived on US soil. After Oklahoma City, they were horrified to discover that their own country's wide open spaces harboured a threat just as chilling and indiscriminate. But after the weekend bombing in Atlanta, the shock had been replaced by dismay. Everywhere, the conversations were the same: oh no, not again. <P>
There are plenty of reasons why the Olympic attack surprised few. The attractiveness of the Games as a terrorist target has been so widely reported that Americans might have been surprised if no one had tried to breach the event's $50 million defences. At the same time the boasts of organisers that Atlanta would be for two weeks ³the safest place in the world² seemed almost to throw down the gauntlet to the men of terror.

</TABLE>
On top of that, Americans have terror on the brain. The Atlanta bombing came barely 10 days after TWA flight 800 mysteriously burst into flame and plummeted into the ocean off Long Island, and just weeks after a car bomb ripped through a US barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, killing 19 American soldiers. Crash investigators insist they have not established the cause of the Flight 800 disaster but most Americans had reached their own conclusion long before the first pieces of wreckage had been fished from the Atlantic. <P>
The readiness of Americans to accept that a US airliner might be bombed out of the sky, or, even more strikingly, shot down by a missile less than 100 miles from New York, showed emphatically that the penny of terrorism had finally dropped in the United States. People no longer react to news of the latest outrage with the bemused admission that they thought such things happened only in London or Jerusalem. Terrorism is now an American problem, too. <P>
In fact, however, America's terrorist problem is very different to the one faced by the Israelis or the British. In the US and in Israel, the threat comes largely from known, highly organised groups with political agendas and rational, if irrationally pursued, objectives. It is possible, if difficult, to wage a war against Hamas or the IRA. Informers can be planted, intelligence gathered. The same applied to terror groups of the seventies such as the Red Brigades in Italy and the Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany. <P>
But the terrorist threat facing the US is at once less coherent and more difficult to combat. It comes from without, and within, from hitherto unknown Islamic groups such as the self-styled Movement for Islamic Change, which claimed responsibility for last November's bomb attack on an American barracks in Riyadh, and from ingenious psychopaths such as the Unabomber, willing to wage an 18-year terror campaign in the name of a screwball ideology. <P>
In the past, Americans were quick to point fingers abroad when terror struck. The World Trade Centre bombing showed them there was no shortage of Islamic fanatics willing to take massive risks to spill the blood of their imperialist nemesis. <P>
But the reaction of officials and the public after the Atlanta bombing showed the lesson of Oklahoma City had stuck. The FBI said it was working on the assumption that the culprits were American. The caller, who had telephoned a warning shortly before the blast, sounded like ³a white American male². The explosive device had been primitive, if deadly. <P>
The chilling truth which the Atlanta bombing may come to confirm is that the US is now a nation of amateur terrorists. Massive, lethal bombings of the kind we are familiar with in Britain may be rare, but smaller, often botched, attacks have become commonplace. Just days after the TWA explosion, a pipe-bomb was found on the runway at Chicago's O'Hare airport. Barely a month passes without some small explosion outside a public building in Nevada, Arizona or Washington. <P>
The number of terrorist plots thwarted by good police work or, more often, happenstance is just as chilling. Early last month it was the Viper Militia, a suitably menacing-sounding crew of rightwing fanatics which, the FBI claims, planned to mount a massive bombing campaign against government buildings. A few weeks earlier it was Kelly Sean Spencer, discovered with four pipe-bombs after an explosion in his Oklahoma motel room. <P>
Back in April it was two militia men near Macon, Georgia, hoarding bomb-making equipment that may or may not have been ear-marked for the Olympics. At the same time police routinely happen on arms caches that would equip an entire guerrilla army.
Most of America's new breed of home-grown terrorists are linked to the Patriot movement, a loose alliance of more than 800 extreme rightwing groups. The groups, as many as 400 of which characterise themselves as militias, are bound together by their loathing for the federal government and opposition to gun control. At the wilder shores of the movement, adherents believe the US government is trying to disarm ordinary Americans as part of a United Nations plot to take over the world. <P>
Some believe merely that the US government has overstepped its authority, that it interferes in parts of people's lives that it was never mandated to regulate. After the botched FBI raids on Ruby Ridge and Waco, anger and suspicion hardened into hatred and paranoia. <P>
But the FBI's list of domestic suspects will by no means be confined to members of the militia movement. The technology of terror is so cheap and readily available that almost any kook or criminal can set himself up as a one-man Baader-Meinhof gang. In December 1994 an out of work computer programmer planned to hold the New York subway hostage by threatening to detonate a series of firebombs on it. (His plan backfired, literally, when a device went off on his lap.) <P>
Even as the FBI was celebrating the capture of the man they claim is the Unabomber, New York detectives were pressing on with their hunt for another serial bomber who has terrorised the city for more than a decade.
The pipe-bomb, the type of device  reportedly used in the Atlanta attack, is the weapon of choice for this new breed of amateur terrorist. Made from household materials, the most basic of them are as easy to put together as a DIY bookcase. Almost every week there are reports of pipe-bombs being found by police. When detectives caught up with Herberto Seda, the so-called Zodiac killer, last month, they found a cache of them. Earlier this year one was found in the locker of a high school student in Providence, Rhode Island. <P>
They may lack the organisation and know-how of the kind of terror groups we are more familiar with but America's freelance terrorists may be even tougher to fight. The US has always placed great faith in technology. Terrorism, Americans believed, could be beaten with more satellite pictures and fancier bomb- sniffing gizmos. But Atlanta had the biggest security force ever assembled on US soil and the most hi-tech equipment. They practised for nerve gas and nuclear attacks and hijacks. They wheeled out a command plane built for a nuclear war. But none of this, it seems, was a match for a few pieces of pipe.

<P>A widow who wants to have her dead husbands baby is fighting for rights that are wrong, says Martin Kettle</TD></TR></TABLE></center>

Diane Blood: going against the letter and the spirit of the law<br> 
<B></B></TD>
</TR> </TABLE>

<p>DIANE BLOODS fight to use her dead husbands sperm stirs sympathy among all who witness it. Thousands of people apparently support her tenacious campaign. The Labour peer Lord Winston is trying to change the law on her behalf. She embodies those indomitable qualities which the British admire and which, in other circumstances, one might describe as spunky.
<p>Watching her anguished face as she puts her case, and listening to the intensity with which Mrs Blood pursues it, no one could fail to be impressed. It is doubly shocking that a woman should lose her husband and then be faced with such an unremitting intimate ordeal, least of all in public. It is outrageous.
<p>Mrs Blood invites us to take a position on her case and most people seem happy to enlist in her support. So I take a different view with some trepidation, because hers is a situation one would not wish upon anybody. But it is she who has put her predicament in the public arena and those of us who are uneasy about what she is doing are entitled to say so.
<p>I think Mrs Blood is in the wrong. I am pleased that she lost her case again last week. I think the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) was right to stand its ground and to uphold both the letter and the spirit of the law. I hope that Mrs Blood continues to lose. I think she deserves unswerving support in her tragic ordeal. But that does not mean that she ought to get her way &#150; least of all because people feel sorry for her.
<p>It isnt good enough to say that because Mrs Bloods situation touched our hearts, the law should be ignored to accommodate her, or even that it should be changed to stop another case like this. This is partly because the law is the law. But it is also because the law that she challenges is a good one and too important to tamper with, let alone in such circumstances.
<p>The dead cannot clarify their intentions. That is why, for example, in the parallel context of property, wills are so important and probate law so meticulous. Mr Bloods sperm is no different. He did not leave the written consent that the law requires, so his intentions are therefore not proved.
<p>This is not some detail that can be set aside merely to gratify his widow. It goes to the heart of the matter. Dont lets kid ourselves. Without such rigid rules, there would be conceptual chaos. The HFEA is right and responsible to refuse Mrs Blood. It is more important to hold the line on that point of principle than it is to give her what she wants. If she cannot prove her case, she should not win. She is not a pioneer but the thin end of the wedge.
<p>But Mrs Blood also seems to me to be wrong for more controversial reasons. All the coverage of the case assumes that it is right and natural for Mrs Blood to conceive a child with a dead father whom she loved and married. But is that so? I dont agree with that either.
<p>Call me Mr Conventional, but I find the whole thing decidedly creepy. It is pretty difficult to accept the way in which the sperm was obtained from the comatose Mr Blood in the first place. Would there be the same tearful popular enthusiasm for a live and healthy husband to impregnate his vegetative wife, I wonder? I doubt it. But, even if we allow the means, I find it hard to see anything natural in any circumstances about conception with a dead person.
<p>It cannot be right for a child to have a dead father who did not even know he was involved in the conception. After all, where do you draw the line? If Mrs Blood gets her way once then what, other than shortage of supply, is to stop her doing it again? The implication of Mrs Bloods case is that she will feel just as entitled to impregnate herself a second, third or fourth time with her husbands deep-frozen sperm. I hope I am not alone in finding this morbid, undesirable and a poor precedent, with or without his consent.
<p>The problem at the centre of the Blood case is that too many people, Mrs Blood included, seem to start from the presumption that a woman has an inalienable right to conceive, which is always superior to any other consideration. If a woman wants a baby, they say, and there is a natural impediment to conception &#150; be it infertility or the absence for some reason of an appropriate donor &#150; then it will always be right for that impediment to be removed.
<p>That cannot be right. Mr Blood is 18 months dead. Mrs Blood may still be fertile when 18 months have become 18 years. It cannot be morally right or socially desirable to allow her access to her husbands sperm after 18 years &#150; and if it is not right then it is not right now either.
<p>In my opinion the Sheffield hospital should never have obtained Mr Bloods sperm and should destroy it now. It is in no ones interest to drag out this saga any further. Mrs Blood and her supporters may see hers as a great and beautiful cause. I think it is misguided, undesirable, morbid and verges on moral blackmail. It should never have been allowed in the first place.

<b> Kigali Diary<BR>
Chris McGreal </b><P>

	<!--TEXT--> AMONG Beatrice's conundrums is how she came to live in a pig-sty. She can put all the elements together. War. Persecution. Genocide. Survival. Even a victory of sorts. But the way things have worked out just don't make sense to the forlorn Rwandan Tutsi who believes her life is over although she is only in middle age.<P>
Beatrice, after all, was a victim. Her family was murdered in the genocide. Yet, she says, she is the one made to feel guilty, while others who claim her suffering as the moral basis for their power don't appear to care.
"What is my life? The survivors are the bottom of the pile. Nobody looks after us. We are the survivors of the genocide, but I am the one living in a pig-sty. It would have been better to die," she said.<P>
Beatrice once had a proper home with three rooms and enough land to feed her family. But then she had a husband, and children too. All of them are gone now. The house was torn down by her neighbours. Her husband was murdered, and days later her four children were killed with machetes.

<P>
Beatrice survived by a stroke of luck she has come to regret. She had hidden her children in the bush and gone to look for food when the killers hunted them down. When she returned they were gone for ever. <P>
As she talks about her lost family, Beatrice curls up on a reed mat. She pulls her shawl around her mouth and mumbles. Like many who escaped the genocide, she is a victim of her survival. She grapples with the guilt of living. And she has to contend with the occasional but stinging accusatory comments of others who wonder how she managed to escape. Worst of all, they come not from hostile Hutus but a few of her fellow Tutsis. <P>
One of Beatrice's neighbours wanders in. She smiles, shakes hands and sits down. But when she hears what is being discussed she moves to leave. Beatrice calms her, tells her that it's just the truth, and asks what anyone can possibly do to them that hasn't already been done. <P>
The woman boldly ventures an opinion.<P>
"Those outsiders did not suffer like we did. They used our suffering and they promised us lots of things. But I think they want to forget us. Perhaps it would have been easier for them if everyone had died," she said.
For a woman who showed such caution only minutes before it was a startling and unusual recognition of the divide between the Tutsis who lived through the genocide, and those who returned to Rwanda from exile. It is the "outsiders" who are Rwanda's new elite. Some of the survivors are beginning to wonder if it is not at their expense. <P>
The genocide's victims, and the other tiny proportion of Tutsis who slipped through, are the moral foundation for Rwanda's government. It has no popular legitimacy. The Hutu majority would vote it out in an instant were there to be an election.
But survivors have noted that there are hardly any of their number in the government. Rwanda's post-war civil service is dominated by men and women who grew up or were born in Uganda. Tutsis returned from Burundi are prominent in business, and notorious even among other Tutsis for their gut-level maltreatment of Hutus. The one-time refugees back from Tanzania have often settled into the more sedate lifestyle of farming. <P>
The survivors have not been so lucky. Often disoriented and numb from grief, they are mostly looking for security, homes and justice. Rarely are they provided. Hutu extremists continue to terrorise and kill. The few Tutsis whose homes are still standing have often not been able to return. Most of the men who organised the genocide are still free. <P>
As her bitterness spills forth, she dares to venture into territory almost no survivor speculates openly about; the origin of their troubles. Yes, there had been decades of routine discrimination interspersed with periodic bursts of anti-Tutsi violence. <P>
But then she mentions October, 1990. However bad things were before, that's when they turned really nasty. That's when the "outsiders" invaded to liberate Rwanda's Tutsis. Beatrice said she paid the price. <P>
"That is when our problems began. Before that we got along with our Hutu neighbours. My husband had many friends. But after October 1990 things became very difficult. People would not talk to us, then they accused us. It spoiled everything," she said.
<P>Beatrice's friend ran out the door.<P>

<P>Julian Borger reports from the town of Foca in Bosnia on the tragic case of two colleagues  one Muslim, one Serb - who find friendship challenged by claims that one took part in killing and rape</TD></TR></TABLE></center>

Bosnia's police, who in 1992 still wore the insignia of the old Yugoslav force, found themselves at the sharp end of ethnic cleansing
<br> 
<B></B></TD>
</TR> </TABLE>

<p>This is the story of two Bosnian policemen. Both are now in their mid-thirties. As well-educated, dedicated young professionals before the war, they represented the best the doomed state of Yugoslavia had to offer.

<p>One is a Muslim, the other a Serb, but in April 1992, when the barricades went up across Bosnia, they patrolled their home town of Foca together, trying to reason with the hotheads in a vain effort to prevent the approaching slaughter.

<p>And when the town descended into a nightmare of executions and mass rape, the Serb rescued his Muslim colleague and had him smuggled across the lines.

<p>The Muslim, Himzo Selimovic, is now the police chief in the Sarajevo suburb of Ilijas. The war has tinged his black hair and moustache with threads of grey, and left him thoughtful and melancholy. Like many Muslims, he finds it hard to talk about 1992 without his eyes filling with tears. The first thing he says about the war is that he owes his survival to his Serb friend, Dragan Gagovic, who was his right-hand man when Mr Selimovic was chief inspector in Foca.

<p>Several other Foca Muslims also credit their survival to Mr Gagovic, so it is hard for them to come to terms with what happened. Mr Selimovic shakes his head when he considers the situation. Mr Gagovic is now an indicted war criminal, charged in June last year by the Hague war crimes tribunal with rape and ex-officio responsibility for many of the atrocities committed in this eastern Bosnian town, where 1,500 Muslims are thought to have been murdered.

<p>Mr Gagovic still lives in Foca. Despite the indictment, he is now a uniformed police officer. In fact, he is now an instructor, teaching civic duties and karate to new officers. He claims to drink regularly with the United Nations police monitors based nearby. "If they arrest me, too bad," he says nonchalantly.

<p>Over the past few months, the two policemen have conducted an extraordinary dialogue across Bosnia's ethnic boundary. Mr Selimovic sent news of a new-born daughter and Mr Gagovic sent back congratulations, with a bottle of home-made brandy. At the same time, they have sounded out each other's war memories.

<p>Mr Gagovic and Mr Selimovic agree the first signs of trouble came to Foca after the Bosnian elections in 1990, when the country's new parties exploited the easy rallying call of ethnic identity. Foca was roughly split, with a slight Muslim majority. The Muslims supported Alija Izetbegovic's Party for Democratic Action, while the Serbs backed the Serb Democratic Party (SDS).

<p>Soon after the elections, the police came across trucks full of weapons belonging to the Serb-dominated Yugoslav National Army (JNA) on isolated country roads. Once in the autumn of 1991, Mr Selimovic impounded a load of mortars and assault rifles, but was ordered by senior military officers to release it. He believes the weapons were bound for Serb militants.

<p>Mr Gagovic says he heard frequent rumours that the JNA was arming civilians, but he was unable to prove anything.

<p>The final signal for the war to begin was the arrival of paramilitary groups from Serbia and Montenegro, blooded the previous year in the war with Croatia. In early April 1992, they began the ethnic cleansing of Zvornik and Bijeljina in the north.

<p>On April 8, 1992, the self-styled Serbian Guard and Serbian Volunteer Guard entered Foca and began rounding up Muslims, with the aid of local Serb criminals and extremists who donned uniforms and took part enthusiastically in the subsequent looting. The seven other Foca Serbs indicted for war crimes all fall into this category.

<p>Muslim men were separated from their families and taken to Foca's huge prison, known as the KP Dom, where about 500 are thought to have been shot or bludgeoned to death, their bodies thrown into the nearby Drina river. The women and children were interned in sports halls and schools, where hundreds were repeatedly raped and assaulted before being deported to Montenegro.

<p>One of those internment camps, the Partizan sports hall in central Foca, was next to Mr Gagovic's police station  and the Hague indictment says it was under his control. Mr Gagovic denies this vehemently. The guards, he claims, were paramilitaries in old police uniforms.

<p>By April 9, Mr Selimovic had realised his position was no longer tenable. The SDS had ordered the Serb police to set up their own unit on the ground floor of the police station. He had only eight Muslim officers left, and the streets were full of Serb soldiers. He ordered his men to slip out one by one. He went last.

<p>"I met Dragan Gagovic at the door," Mr Selimovic recalls. I said: "Please help these people." Dragan cried. He said he wouldn't stay on at the police station without us, and he pulled out his men half an hour later."

<p>Mr Selimovic fled to a friend's flat, but by the next day he realised he was surrounded. Serb soldiers were searching the buildings on either side. As a last resort, he called Mr Gagovic.

<p>"I told him he had two choices: to help us to escape or allow us to be killed. He was silent for two minutes. Then he said he would help because we had always co-operated correctly." 

<p>Ten minutes later, another Serb policeman came for Mr Selimovic, and on Mr Gagovic's orders drove him to a nearby area under Muslim control. A week later, on April 19, Mr Gagovic led his men back to the Foca police station and resumed work.

<p>"This was his great mistake," says Mr Selimovic. "He could have left Foca. He could have resigned."

<p>Mr Gagovic's explanation for his return is likely to be the core of his defence if he ever stands trial. "I felt responsible to prevent the looting and burning. It was a very strange time and we could not do more than we did. All the people who came to the police station got permission to leave. We gave out 3,000 permits . . . If I had not been there, 3,000 Muslims would not be alive today."

<p>The rape indictment against Mr Gagovic is graphic enough. It describes how a Muslim woman went to him to complain about the systematic rape being carried out in Foca. Instead of taking a report he is said to have raped her, forcing her to have anal and oral sex. During the assault, he allegedly pointed his rifle at her neck.

<p>Mr Gagovic says he is outraged at the charge. "It is rude and disgusting that the Hague tribunal could accuse me of such an act," he says. He claims to have sheltered a number of Muslim women in his flat until he could provide exit permits. He insists he never laid a finger on them and names some of them, although most are now refugees abroad.

<p>One woman on the list, however, happened to be in Sarajevo recently, and agreed to tell her story on condition of anonymity. She confirmed that Mr Gagovic had sheltered her, her sister and mother in a Foca flat, and had then arranged transportation to Montenegro.

<p>After explaining all this at a cafe table in Sarajevo, she took a deep breath and said she had missed out one night in her narrative, which until then she had only recounted to her husband and a psychiatric nurse in a refugee camp.

<p>It was the night before she left Foca. She said Mr Gagovic turned up unexpectedly at the flat and sat down facing her. "He started to talk about how he had noticed me a year before and how beautiful I was. He also promised to help my father in the KP Dom. And then he proposed to me."

<p>Surprised and scared, the woman said she could not get married as she was midway through her studies. He was angry and disappointed. Later that night she says he raped her twice. She said it was not a "brutal" assault, as she was too terrified of waking her mother and sister to put up much resistance. "He saved me," she said, "but he also destroyed half my life."

<p>The rape reports have caused Mr Selimovic visible pain. They present him with an awful dilemma. "Gagovic saved my life," he repeats. "But if anyone testified he committed such a crime against human dignity, I would be ready to kill him. Even if he were my brother, I would do the same. It doesn't matter how many people he saved."

<p>Negotiating a deal for Hebron has taken on the classic contours of Middle Eastern carpet haggling: when the price finally seems right the buyer stalks off in a huff, though the merchant knows full well that the reluctant customer will be back.

<p>Hebron is the last of the seven West Bank towns due to be evacuated by the Israelis, who occupied them in the 1967 Middle East war. They were supposed to go last March, but arranging Hebron's future has never been a straightforward transaction, because it is only a small part of a much bigger game in which the stakes are far higher.

<p>It is what happens next that makes closing the deal so very hard, for Hebron has become a vital test of good faith. Will the rightwing Likud prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, live up to the spirit and letter of the Oslo accords signed by Yitzhak Rabin, his murdered Labour predecessor? Or will he sign on the dotted line and then bury the peace process? Faced with that very big question, Hebron itself is a detail.

<p>"The problem of Hebron is very serious," said Noam Arnon, a leader of the Jewish settlers in the city. "But [it] is only the first break in the dike. When it's broken the flood may endanger all the country."

<p>Abdel-Razak Yahyah, one of the Palestinian negotiating team, agrees. "The problem is what comes after Hebron."

<p>Hebron is difficult, because 400 armed and fanatical Jewish settlers live in the heart of a Muslim city that is a byword for bloody intolerance. Religious Jews believe the Cave of Machpelah was bought by the patriarch Abraham as a burial place for his wife. The Tomb of the Patriarchs is also a holy site for Muslims, who call it the Haram al-Ibrahimi. In 1929 scores of the city's Jews were murdered after riots over prayer rights spread from Jerusalem.

<p>In February 1994, just months after the Oslo deal, Baruch Goldstein, a Jew from the nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba, massacred 29 Palestinians at prayer at the al-Ibrahimi mosque.

<p>Leaving Hebron requires Mr Netanyahu to do what he has always been reluctant to do: co-operate fully with the Palestinians; face a strategic choice about his true goals; and grasp the nettle of opposition from his own supporters.

<p>Some of them, such as Noam Friedman, the young soldier who opened fire on New Year's Day, hope that violence will stop not only the Hebron deal but the entire peace process.

<p>Talks about Hebron were suspended by Rabin's successor, Shimon Peres; got stuck on Mr Netanyahu's demands for better protection for the settlers; and almost foundered on the right of Israeli hot pursuit, which is seen by the Palestinians as an unacceptable precedent.

<p>According to the interim agreement of September 1995 (Oslo 2), the withdrawal from Hebron should be followed by three further troop redeployments at six-monthly intervals. Crucially, however, there is no agreement on what these should be, beyond the understanding that settlements and military areas - both notoriously flexible terms in Israeli interpretation - should be excluded.

<p>The first should have taken place by last September, so the next stage is already delayed. Palestinians believe that the Israeli pullbacks should leave them in control of 70 per cent of the West Bank, instead of the current 4 per cent. That would go a long way towards achieving the independence that critics of the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, say he has been cheated out of.

<p>Disagreements are also evident over the extension of Palestinian security powers in areas where they now patrol jointly with the Israelis.

<p>In addition, the Palestinians want Israel to set dates for releasing prisoners, fulfil its promise to allow a Palestinian airport to open in the Gaza Strip, and open a road linking the Strip and the West Bank autonomous areas.

<p>Mr Netanyahu wants Mr Arafat to disarm terrorists, cease all Palestinian Authority activities in Jerusalem, extradite wanted prisoners to Israel, and assure Israel that it has annulled all offensive clauses in the Palestine National Covenant.

<p>Most experts believe Hebron can be cracked, especially with the degree of US pressure now being brought to bear. But many questions remain unanswered. "It would be nice to think this is a turning point and that Netanyahu would realise this is the way forward," said one diplomat.

<p>"Does Netanyahu become part of the peace bloc as a result of Hebron? Or does he remain part of the resistance to the Oslo process . . . who has signed an agreement to get everyone off his back?"

<p>

	<!--TEXT--><FONT SIZE="4"><B>The Guardian Weekly: A Brief History</B></FONT><P>

The Guardian Weekly was launched after the end of the first world war. Its first issue came out of July 4, 1919 with a purpose that remains true to this day: "We aim at presenting what is best and most interesting in the (Manchester) Guardian, what is most distinctive and independent of time, in a compact weekly form. We aim at securing that the readers of the weekly edition shall miss nothing of substance in its record and nothing of value in its interpretation of them."<P>
The Weekly performed a valuable service in Germany in the chaotic aftermath of the first world war, where it was seen as a bastion of free ideas by the intellectual Left of the ill-starred Weimar Republic. Likewise, after the defeat of 1945, the thirst among Germans for news untainted by fascist ideology was immense. The Guardian Weekly could not meet the demand from its Manchester presses, so it flew out the matrices from which the paper was printed to the Hamburg offices of Die Zeit. The circulation of this special German edition reached an astonishing 100,000.<P>
Now, 76 years after it was launched, the Guardian Weekly has become a truly international newspaper printed in five continents - North and South America, Europe, Australia and Africa, where it appears as an integral part of the <A HREF="http://www.mg.co.za/mg/">Mail & Guardian</A>, a liberal weekly paper published and printed in Johannesburg.
Within its covers the Guardian Weekly also carries up to eight pages of news and views from the Washington Post, the paper that exposed the Watergate scandal, and translations from Le Monde, the leading French daily.<P>
From a circulation of little more than 10,000 when it started, the Guardian Weekly now enjoys a print run all over the world of more than 100,000. That figure does not include the special 20-page Latin American edition that appears in four different countries.<P>
The Guardian Weekly has never set out to be merely a newspaper for expatriate Britons. It sets itself the highest standards of journalism and, from its base in London, strives to put all the week's events into an international perspective while championing human rights issues and the values of a free, democratic society.<p>

<b>Chris McGreal</b> sends this eyewitness report from Uvira, Zaire<P>

        <!--TEXT-->
THE little girl&#146;s head was jerked back, seeming to stare longingly up the hill toward those who had fled without her. In the town below, young thugs pranced through the streets celebrating her brutal death. One of them had skewered the child through the throat as they hunted down people who had once been their neighbours.<p>
The fetid overflow of Rwanda&#146;s genocide and Burundi&#146;s civil war is fuelling a new upsurge of ethnic persecution and fighting in eastern Zaire.
Hundreds of thousands of Zaire&#146;s native Tutsis have taken to the hills to escape their government&#146;s threat to expel or exterminate them, which has already resulted in hundreds of deaths.<p>


         <TABLE align=right BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 cellspacing=0>
        <TR><TD valign=top>
<IMG width=131 height=196 SRC="pix/map.gif" alt="Nobel Prize Winner" ALIGN=left> </TD>

</TR> </TABLE>

Meanwhile hundreds of thousands of Rwandan and Burundian Hutu refugees in Zaire fled their camps at the weekend as Tutsis retaliated with raids. They were apparently made with the encouragement of the Rwandan government, which is keen to strike against extremist Hutu militias sheltering in the camps.<p> 
The principal victims of the latest pogroms are about 300,000 Tutsis, known as Banyamulenge, who have lived in Zaire for generations. Hostility has swelled since the end of the Rwandan war in 1994 sent more than 1 million Hutus fleeing into Zaire. But unlike the Tutsi victims of Rwanda&#146;s genocide, or similar persecution further north in Zaire, the Banyamulenge are fighting back.<p>
Among them is Moses Kinde, who helps guard his and 12 other families with a machete and an AK-47 gun. About 100 people in all, they have settled on the edge of small woods in the hills north of Uvira, a squalid border town.<p>
&#147;We know where Zaire learned to persecute us,&#148; he said. &#147;We had problems before, but when the Rwandan Hutus arrived after that it was clear we were going to have a lot of problems. It got more and more dangerous until the government tried to take our land and they told us we had to leave the country and go back to Rwanda.<p>
&#147;But we don&#146;t come from Rwanda and they cannot force us to go because we know how to fight and the army does not.&#148;<p>
Much of the violence is near Uvira. It has long had an air of menace, but the mobs of young men parading through the streets waving machetes, metal bars and wooden stakes are new. They believe they are invincible, magically shielded by the twigs and leaves sprouting from their pockets and headbands. Small children run alongside, giving the war dance a sense of carnival.<p>
In recent weeks they have beaten, stoned or carved up people who until recently were their neighbours. Other Banyamulenge disappear into Zaire&#146;s notorious jails, emerging only for burial.<p>
Uvira&#146;s district commissioner, Shweka Mutabazi, drew up a list of all Banyamulenge property and land, ordered Tutsis to stop building homes, and told soldiers they could take over the houses of those forced to flee. Some people were simply thrown out. Others were beaten up, falsely accused of crimes and imprisoned, or dismissed from their jobs.<p>
Moses Kinde was forewarned. &#147;A friend of mine knew what was going on, what the authorities were planning. It was just like Rwanda. Men came to the house and told me we had to leave but I couldn&#146;t take anything. Some were saying they should kill me. We went to a friend&#146;s house but they came again and said I had to go back to Rwanda. I&#146;ve never been to Rwanda. Then they were killing people and we came up here,&#148; he said.<p>
The region&#146;s deputy governor, Lwasi Ngabo Lwabanji, sent a new wave of terror through the Banyamulenge three weeks ago when he gave them seven days to get out of Zaire or agree to be placed in camps. &#147;For those of them who defy the order and stay in the hills they will be treated as rebels, and like rebels in other countries will be exterminated and expelled,&#148; Mr Lwabanji said.<p>
Thousands of soldiers have been flown into the region. They snatch the first transport to hand - sometimes aid agency vehicles - to load up with grenade launchers, machine-guns and boxes of ammunition. But Zairean troops are often drunk and too frightened to take on the armed Banyamulenge so they lob mortars indiscriminately into the hills or hunt down women and children.
Young Banyamulenge men have struck back, on occasions sending army units fleeing and hitting refugee camps which shelter Hutu militiamen. Banyamulenge rebels were blamed for two massacres at missionary hospitals in which about 50 people were killed three weeks ago.<p>
Although the government portrays them as outsiders, Tutsis first arrived in what is now Zaire some time after the 16th century. They established their settlement in the Mulenge hills and became known as the Banyamulenge. Later they fanned out to Uvira and outlying villages.<p>
The Banyamulenge, often more prosperous than their neighbours, fell victim to President Mobutu&#146;s divide-and-rule politics in 1981. A new law stripped them of citizenship, and with it rendered them stateless. By the time more than 
1 million Hutu refugees fled Rwanda in 1994, on the heels of a similar outpouring from Burundi six months earlier, Zaire&#146;s Tutsi population was more vulnerable than it had ever been.<p>

<FONT SIZE="+3">Farewell to armies of the old empires</FONT><br>
<b> By Martin Woollacott </b><P>

	<!--TEXT-->
It was a situation in which a powerful army "showed itself unable to conquer an adversary who was practically unequipped and whose troops had in general received only rudimentary training. Impossible as this may appear, it is nevertheless a harsh reality that we must confront." So wrote a French colonel after the withdrawal from Indochina in the fifties.<p>
Chechenia is not Vietnam, yet the scene described - "blows aimed at empty space and a do-nothing existence in isolated outposts, until the illegal fighters one day concentrated their forces to win in a single onslaught" - could certainly have been used to describe the former country this month. It is a bad, sad fight in which the destiny of a small people is at stake.

<P>
But the significance of the Chechen war lies, equally, in the opportunity it represents for Russia and the Russian army to join in the transition from unrealistic pretensions to a humbler appreciation of the uses of force that nearly all other big modern armies, China perhaps apart, have already made.
The armies of the West, in particular, were remade in Indochina, Algeria and in smaller conflicts in the Middle East, southeast Asia, Ireland and Cyprus, where they learnt hard lessons about what can and cannot be done in war and about the frequent irrelevance of superior firepower. The armed forces of India took a similar course in the limits of the possible in Sri Lanka, and continue to do so in Kashmir and the northeast. The Israeli army, too, recoiled from the consequences of its Lebanon adventure, and from the tasks of occupation in Gaza and the West Bank. In Latin America, armies have retreated, bruised and rueful, from the political responsibilities they had widely seized a generation ago.<p>
The general story is the same almost everywhere. Whether or not armed forces could effectively carry out the primary role of national defence, narrowly defined, has not usually been tested. But their claims to be able to hold territories whose inhabitants are reluctant citizens or subjects are frayed. So are their claims to be able to mount successful interventions beyond their own frontiers, even where, as in peacekeeping, there is an almost universal wish that they were able to do so. Some interventions work, many do not. And, in those countries where the army had imagined itself the guardian of the nation, with responsibility to ensure that the country stayed on the "right" path, the experience of political meddling has done much to erode that tradition.<p>
This retreat from military overconfidence, ambition and mysticism may, in the West, have gone too far, so that politicians and generals shirk tasks that are possible and that should be undertaken, Bosnia being the prime example. But in Russia, a generation behind the West in these matters, the wisdom of limits has not been fully learnt. The armed forces had, in Soviet days, an assured place in the coalition of ruling interests, a generous share of national resources and privileged connections with the worlds of industry and advanced science. They sat proudly, in eastern Europe, in Russia itself, on territory that the Red Army had won in war, and they compelled the West to make enormous and expensive military efforts.<p>
Now all this is in question, not only because of the present disarray in Chechenia, but because the revealed inadequacies of the armed forces cast doubt on the whole tradition, past as well as future. One doleful military correspondent for a Russian paper wrote after the early reverses in Grozny: "Our forces not only would not have made it to the English Channel; they would have been defeated before they even reached the Rhine."<p>
General Alexander Lebed, President Yeltsin's new security minister and the man charged with finding a Chechenia solution, is an enigma. Is he the leader who can take the Russian armed forces on that journey to wisdom, extracting them, in the first instance, from tasks of suppression and occupation in the Caucasus? Or is he a man whose impulses to reform are directed only to fashioning a more formidable instrument of power, so that a revived Russian army can continue to try to exercise the imperial, interventionist and spuriously national tasks that most other armies have wisely laid aside?<p>

Since the Chechen war began 20 months ago, two strands of criticism have intertwined: that of Russian military incompetence and that of Russian political foolishness. Yet these are very distinct arguments. It is an open question whether the war in Chechenia could be won with better commanders, better troops and a better strategy. There are others  who say that, even if Chechenia can be held, it is not worth doing so. Lebed said during the election campaign that Chechens should be allowed to choose in a referendum between staying in or leaving the Russian federation. But he coupled this with threats of cutting off all aid and co-operation, which suggests he hopes the Chechens might be frightened into choosing the federation or could be undermined if they did not do so.<p>
Lebed presumably now follows the man he chose as defence minister, General Igor Rodionov, in wanting a greatly reduced, more efficient army of 12 divisions. This is, not coincidentally, about the same size as the US army. That is no small ambition, and could also prove beyond Russia's capacities. But there is a modernisation of the mind that is more important than any upgrading of weapons, training or tactics. When de Gaulle took his Algerian decision he told a restive and partly mutinous officer corps: "The army serves no clan, no faction and no interest. The army serves France, and that is all." In retrospect the French army's withdrawal from Algeria, which ended its imperial role and closed an era, was an essential precondition for the emergence of the successful and dynamic France of the last 30 years. Chechenia is symbolic of the imperial temptation that must be put aside if Russia is to experience a similar renewal. It remains to be seen what kind of military moderniser General Lebed is.<P>

</TR> </TABLE>

<p>A MONTH after he died in January 1989, a service of commemoration was held for Bruce Chatwin at the Greek Cathedral of St Sophia in west London. Black-robed, long-bearded priests swung censers under the high domes as representatives of smart society and literary London looked on in more or less bewilderment. "It was a very Chatwin-like event," recalls Susannah Clapp, his editor and now biographer. "To most of the congregation it was rather mysterious. Apart from the repetition of the word, 'Bruce', no one knew what was going on." The service was also of interest in another respect. As the congregation filed out they were confronted by a pack of news journalists. A fatwa had been pronounced in Tehran that morning and Salman Rushdie, a close friend of Chatwin, was ushered away into hiding.<p><p><p><p><p>To see this event as a fantastic coda to a life that had already taken on almost mythical status sounds too much like a neat line for a biographer or an obituarist. But in Chatwin's case it is true. "People sometimes talk about the commemoration service as if Bruce had manipulated it," laughs Clapp. But looking back over his 48 years, nothing could be more appropriate than for his passing to be marked by the peculiar consequences of ancient religion uneasily coming up against modern metropolitan literary chic.<p><p><p><p><p>Despite a relatively short time in the public eye - he was not published until he was 37 - his life as much as his work had become the stuff of legend. It was Chatwin as an 18-year-old working in Sotheby's who identified a Picasso gouache of a harlequin as a fake. It was Chatwin who woke up one morning to find himself blind and so taking his doctor's advice "to seek long horizons", set out for the deserts of Sudan. He announced his resignation from the Sunday Times in a telegram to his editor saying simply, "Gone to Patagonia". <p><p>And even during his final illnesses, while close friends knew he had Aids, he spoke publicly of a rare Chinese bone fungus contracted from a black egg eaten in Lijiang. Clapp's biography With Chatwin, is well placed to pick through the fact and the fiction of his life, as well as to appraise his work. They first met in 1976 when he arrived at the offices of his publisher with a leather haversack slung over his shoulder. He would go on, habitually, to carry a Mont Blanc pen and mole-skin notebooks, but that day he had only a French paperback, a pocket edition of the letters of Sydney Smith and a manuscript of In Patagonia.<p><p><p><p><p>This remarkable book changed travel writing for ever and made Chatwin's reputation as an author. His idiosyncratic study of that strange South American region almost entirely dispensed with the geography of the place, turning instead to a personal exploration of the byways and tangents of its history, legend and people. This "cubist" approach, as Chatwin appositely called it, allowed him to flag up many of the preoccupations - prehistoric animals, the Welsh, archaeology and indigenous peoples and their land - that he would develop in later works.<p><p><p><p><p>Clapp then worked on his debut novel, The Viceroy Of Ouidah, and remained friends with him as he published On The Black Hill, his novel about identical octogenarian twins living on a bleak Welsh farm, and The Songlines, his meditation on Australian Aboriginal beliefs which made the best-seller list. They also worked at the end of his life on the Booker shortlisted novel, Utz.<p><p>His work is difficult to classify. "It dangles between fact and fiction," says Clapp, which partly explains why On The Black Hill, a second novel, won the Whitbread best first novel award and why The Songlines was published as non-fiction in Britain and fiction in America.<p><p><p><p><p>When Chatwin died, Clapp was made a literary executor along with his widow Elizabeth and fellow travel writer Redmond O'Hanlon.<p><p><p><p><p>"I wanted With Chatwin to be a personal memoir that wouldn't disappear under a mass of documentary data," she explains. And while strong on the literary side - providing a fascinating insight into the editing process that pared down In Patagonia and opened up The Viceroy - her book is at its best on the man. She has gone some way to answering Rushdie's complaint that while he admired his work, the Chatwin in the books was not "the whole person he was when you met him". <p><p><p><p><p>Born in Sheffield in 1940 into a solidly middle class family, Bruce Chatwin was the eldest of three brothers. His family moved to the Birmingham suburbs - or "a clearing in the forest of Arden" as he called it - and he attended prep school before going to Marlborough College. There were early signs of the aesthete as his parents remember him in his sixth-form study, furnished with Italian oil paintings and a chaise-longue, being very much an "Edith Sitwell reader among a lot of Neville Shute fans".<p><p><p><p><p>He failed to get in to Oxford and was taken on by Sotheby's as a porter. This was a grander job than it sounds, and when not identifying fakes he was in Cap Ferat persuading Somerset Maugham to sell his collection of Matisses and Renoirs. He soon rose through the ranks and by the time he was in his mid-20s he had married a colleague, Elizabeth Chanler, and been offered a directorship. And then things got really interesting. As an employee of one of the world's great auction houses, he found himself appalled by objects and possessions. As a bisexual man, he found himself newly married.<p><p><p><p><p>Despite having "no problems" from his widow in writing or researching her book, Clapp is reluctant to talk about Chatwin's sexuality. She expresses apprehension that it may overshadow his literary achievements, but in the biography she quotes Howard Hodgkin's accusation that Chatwin would "flirt with man, woman or dog". She also reveals that one of the two men he had loved in his life was the designer Jasper Conran with whom he had once considered setting up home.<p><p><p><p><p>"This aspect has been made more of a problem for him than for other people," says Clapp. "Most writers don't go around saying, 'these are the details of my sex life, please put them on the front page of the paper'. He also wasn't really interested in sexual politics. There were reasons for that - not hurting people's feelings - but it's been portrayed as a moral duty that he should have come out, while in reality he was never in. People knew about it but he didn't write about it. In that sense he was quite old-fashioned."<p><p><p><p><p>Much has been made of the contents of his notebooks in this respect, now housed in the Bodleian Library. They are under embargo until 2010 and have been seen as part of some conspiracy involving his influential friends to protect his reputation. "They did excite a certain amount of fevered discussion after his death," claims Clapp. "But, in fact, he hardly wrote a confessional line in his life. It would have been very surprising if he had poured out his secret thoughts into a notebook, sobbing into a pillow every night. It just wasn't his way of going on." <p><p><p><p><p>And as for his status as the ultimate insider still under the protection of the literary and social mafia? "He started off as very much not part of the establishment," says Clapp, "that was the point of him. But he certainly had a weakness for toffs. He was glamorised by them, and glamour was a term of huge praise in his vocabulary. But that said, he didn't spend the whole time draped around these people. He was a writer who went away and wrote. Admittedly sometimes in the homes of these people, but often not." <p><p><p><p><p>Getting the work right and getting the life right. Clapp sees the influence of his much-vaunted "eye" - his uncanny ability to identify good from bad art - everywhere. "In his close attention to his appearance, to his flat, to his sentences." Equally, it was applied to the self-editing process that created the Chatwin myths during his lifetime and sustained them after his death. "But the really interesting thing," explains Clapp, "is that many of the stories are much truer than posthumous rumours would suggest." <p><p><p><p><p>Chatwin did own the king of Hawaii's bed-sheet, he did dine with Jackie Onassis and, to George Melly's astonishment, he had never heard of the Muppets. As an art expert, he suffered from afflictions of the eye, as a walker he had varicose veins. "What happened to his stories," explains Clapp, "was that they changed as they were retold. It was like a sauce being reduced and becoming more concentrate. Maybe he did himself a disservice by seeming to be more glamorous than he was, while all the time he was more glamorous than he thought."<p><p>

Casualties of war . . . Young girls and boys undergoing training in Beirut 10 years ago.<br>

</TR> </TABLE>

<P>In a report<b>*</b> published last week, it revealed that child soldiers fought in 33 wars last year and were used as executioners, assassins, spies and informers. Based on research in 26 countries, the report shows that children were often given drugs and alcohol before fighting. In Liberia, Sri Lanka and Burma, children were seen throwing themselves into assaults &#147;as though they were immortal or impervious&#148;.

<P>Children carried out executions in Burma, Colombia, Honduras, Liberia, Mozambique, Peru and Uganda, and others as young as 10 were used as assassins in Sri Lanka.
<P>The report says children in Peru were induced to cut the throats of those found guilty by people&#146;s courts and to eat the entrails and drink the blood of executed rebels. In Colombia, boys and girls aged 12 and 13 were executed in front of their peers, who were then forced to drink their blood.
<P>Brutalisation of recruits was standard, often involving the torture or death of relatives in front of them. A child captured by Renamo in Mozambique and trained as a soldier reported that &#147;in captivity, my father was used as a target during the final tests of boys who were being trained&#148;.
In Uganda, most child soldiers had been ordered to torture, maim or kill children or adults attempting to escape. In El Salvador, Burma, Cambodia, Liberia and Ethiopia, children were used as spies or informers in front-line missions. Many were caught and killed.
<P>The findings form part of a two-year United Nations study, Children and War, headed by Graca Machel, the widow of the former president of Mozambique. The study will be presented to the UN General Assembly later this month.
<P>A campaign to curb the use of child soldiers culminates in Geneva in January, when the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child will be revised to make 18 the minimum legal age for combatants.

Djibouti&#146;s social fabric is unravelling as an Aids epidemic cripples the country, writes <b>Alice Martin</B><P>

        <!--TEXT-->
&#147;DJIBOUTI for us is a place to make money. All my girlfriends were sending gold back to their families, so I came thinking I would do the same. I started as a house girl, then I went into prostitution, but I started losing my sight. I became sicker and sicker and now look at me.&#148; <p>

</TR> </TABLE>

Safia, aged 19, is thin with Aids. She came to Djibouti from Dessie in north-east Ethiopia - an area touched by famine - and, like dozens of other Ethiopian and Somali women swelling the numbers of clandestine immigrants to a state of half a million people, she has ended up in the country&#146;s principal profession: prostitution. Now, in addition to other economic woes, Djibouti is being crippled by Aids.<p>
The country produces salt and fish, neither of which has been commercially exploited on a large scale. It also supports France&#146;s largest military base overseas, as well as providing its giant neighbour Ethiopia, which has a population of more than 55 million, with an outlet to the sea.<p>
However, since the end of the Ethiopian civil war in 1991, the trade in international food aid has switched to the Eritrean port of Assab. And despite a fairly strong currency, the country&#146;s economy has plunged dramatically, compounded by a three-year rebellion by ethnic Afars that ended in December 1994.<p>
Now Djibouti must fight Aids. But with a government preoccupied with the health of its ageing president, Hassan Gouled Aptidon, individual efforts to combat the disease are lost in an ocean of ignorance.<p>

&#147;The common perception is that the disease is confined to foreigners and to Ethiopian immigrants in particular,&#148; said Hasna Mohammed, of the Female Solidarity support group. &#147;But everybody has got it now . . . Ethiopians, Somalis and Djiboutians.&#148; Dr Hasna estimates that &#147;5 to 10 per cent of the population is HIV positive and that runs right through society&#148;.<p>
The link between the prevalence of Aids and the 4,000-strong French garrison is not clear, but prostitution has thrived in its presence. The so-called &#147;bar-girls&#148;, who serve the well-to-do, are the lucky ones; their earnings are good and they work with people who are aware of the risk of Aids.
But prostitutes in the quartiers, commonly known as &#147;Coca-Cola girls&#148;, earn as little as 50 cents per client. Because of the intense competition, they are unable to reject men who mistreat them and refuse to wear condoms. Fifty-five per cent of Coca-Cola girls have tested HIV positive, as opposed to 25 per cent of bar girls.<p><IMG width=175 SRC="pix/map.jpeg" alt="A map of Djibouti" ALIGN=left>
An important factor in the rate of HIV infection is the prevalence of qat, a green-leaf narcotic grown in Ethiopia and flown in daily to meet demand for the drug in Djibouti. More than one-third of the average family income is spent on qat.<p>
Offices close at lunchtime and afternoons are spent in qat-sessions in the shade. &#147;When men come to us, they are always drugged up on qat,&#148; Safia said. &#147;Sometimes they beat us if we refuse sex without a condom. Sometimes they pay more. We have to accept or there is no work.&#148;<p>
Qat-chewing was viewed until 20 years ago as a pastime for the rich. Now it is a vital source of earnings for women in the lowest income bracket. It is only the most restrained who do not chew. Asnia, a qat-seller for 20 years and mother of 10, said: &#147;We just sell it not to be hungry.&#148;<p>
At lunchtime the delivery arrives by air from Dire Dawa in Ethiopia. At a speed that no other cargo distribution can match, qat is available within the hour from rows of women sitting behind piles of damp sackcloth concealing the leaves.

        <!--TEXT-->
RADOVAN KARADZIC is not there in person but his presence is as tangible as the early autumn chill. His chubby face smiles coyly from posters in the crowd. His name punctuates every speech. The 3,000 Bosnian Serbs who turn up to the rally are in no doubt for whom they are supposed to be voting on September 14.
"Our unique, legendary Radovan Karadzic is the greatest Serb among us, and we would like him to be here now," Nedeljko Prstojevic, a minor party functionary, shouts to the crowd.

<P>

They cheer when they hear Karadzic's name. Behind Prstojevic there is an empty picture-frame, where the leader's portrait is presumably supposed to hang.<P>
His absence only heightens the aura of quasi-religious mystery, as Prstojevic stretches his obsequious eulogy to absurd lengths: "He is the man whose picture we hold aloft like the icon of St George . . . Brothers and sisters, for these past years, God must clearly have been a Serb."
Anywhere else, the rhetoric would be laughable, but we have stepped through the looking glass. We are in the only Serb-held scrap of urban Sarajevo - a few streets of the former Olympic village called Dobrinja. Many parts of Sarajevo are a mess, but Serb Dobrinja, in its self-imposed isolation, is the most tawdry and depressing corner of the city.<P>
In this inverted world, the poster hanging across the shrapnel-scarred streets in the midst of this squalor seems strangely appropriate. It says: "We have made it. Let's continue." It is the slogan of the Serb Democratic Party (SDS), the separatist clique which first declared, then ethnically cleansed, and now jealously clings to, its territorial creation - the Republika Srpska.
The SDS rally in Dobrinja is bad news for all the international institutions attempting to nudge Bosnia through a transition to a peaceful and stable equilibrium. It is not just because the speeches are all xenophobic and combative. The constant references to Karadzic, who led the Bosnian Serbs right through the war, are a direct challenge to the validity of the elections.
According to the rules that have been drawn up by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) - which is supervising the elections - any party which links itself with an indicted war criminal is liable for disqualification.<P>
Karadzic, who has been twice indicted for crimes against humanity and genocide by the UN war crimes tribunal, has stepped down, after intense international pressure, from all formal positions of power. But his party's unceasing worship of this failed poet and former psychiatrist is designed to chew away gradually at the edges of the rules until they are worthless.<P>
The OSCE is caught in a vice. To do nothing about these violations would further erode its credibility, which has already plummeted since it conceded its political campaign fund - in the interests of free speech - was bankrolling a party run by one of the most notorious Serb ethnic cleansers of the war, Arkan.<P>
But to disqualify the SDS would almost certainly lead to a boycott of the ballot in the Republika Srpska, rendering the entire election useless in terms of its principal goal - the creation of shared, multi-ethnic institutions to help knit the divided country back together. The OSCE is in a cleft stick: officials admit privately that they are under constant pressure from Western capitals to get the elections over with, so Nato can begin to disengage.<P>
On Saturday, 900,000 voters in the Republika Srpska, and possibly more than 2 million in the Muslim-Croat Federation, are due to elect assemblies for their own regional governments. They will also be choosing a joint parliament for the whole country and a joint presidency, comprising one Muslim, one Serb and one Croat.<P>
Carl Bildt, the international community's viceroy in Bosnia, will have the job of trying to make these joint institutions work. In Brussels last week, he said his priority would be to convene the joint presidency within 10 days of the elections being certified legal.<P>
The difficulties he faces were amply illustrated in Dobrinja last week. Republika Srpska's acting president Biljana Plavsic (a prim, coiffured woman oddly reminiscent of Baroness Thatcher) strenuously nurtured her audience's sense of isolation and their contempt for Muslims. "Yes, we do want brotherhood and unity, but only with other Serbs in the Balkans. Not with them," she cried. The former biologist could not even bring herself to use the word "Muslim".<P>
She rounded off with a direct appeal to a deep-seated Serb sense of paranoia. "The world is against us. The world has never understood us and it never will."
Mr Bildt is planning an array of economic sanctions to beat the Serbs into line after the elections. Plavsic is preparing her followers for defiance and secession. There is an almost masochistic glee in her voice.<P>
But she is right on one count. Rational Westerners, such as Mr Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister, can never really understand the Serbs. In the looking-glass world of the Republika Srpska, Lenin's maxim holds good: "The worse it gets, the better."<P>

IN THE villages that ring this glassy man-made lake everyone has an elephant story to tell, and Tissakutti Premadasa's is as remarkable as any other. The evening sun on his back was driving him towards home when something swatted at his cap. Before the startled farmer could look back, a belt of grey had clasped his waist like steel, and he was hoisted into the air.

He dangled there for a terrifying instant, before the trunk uncurled and dropped him on the ground. Then its owner trod over him, resuming its stately course through the jungle. Premadasa broke his collar bone and leg, but he was luckier than most - he survived.<p>
In his village of Pubuduwewagama, the attack transformed this farmer with a herd of 50 fat buffalo from a man of substance into a living myth. All but one other such encounters with elephants have ended in death. And to Premadasa's evident satisfaction, the elephant came to learn the error of its ways. A few months after their meeting, the beast fell into a pit and died. All 200 families in the village have elephant stories to tell.<P>
Four years ago, there was a scraping sound outside Premadasa's home in the middle of the night. There came a thunderous knock and six elephants walked through the mud walls into the front room. The family fled out the back.<P>
Now the Sri Lankan authorities believe they have found a way out of the elephant wars. Last month, wildlife officials drove the herd that lived around Handapangala out of the jungle and along a path formed by electrified fences to the Yalle nature reserve, 24km away.
By luring the elephants from their ancient domain the government had hoped to end what had become a lumbering dance of death - deadly for both species. Last year alone the toll was elephants 21, humans 53, according to the plantation and wildlife minister, Ratnasiri Wickramanayake. He estimates more than 140 houses were destroyed by rampaging beasts, and countless fields of crops.<P>
For while the herd wreaked havoc, the villagers fought back, uninhibited by Buddhist tradition which holds the elephant to be sacred. Over the years, dozens of elephants have fallen to vengeful villagers. Some of the beasts were shot, others crippled by treading on logs studded with nails that were deliberately put in their paths.<P>
More died for the pursuit of profit. Despite an international ban on the traffic in ivory, the going rate for tusks is easily $1,000 a kilogram. It wasn't always thus. Fifteen years ago, the lands around Handapangala were untamed jungle, a haven of palms and foliage for a herd reckoned to number between 160 and 190 elephants. There were only a few human inhabitants: small scale cultivators who lived in tree houses, and moved along with the seasons.<P>
"This was their kingdom," Premadasa says. "We people didn't belong here." Then the government began clearing the land for the island's most ambitious agro-industry project, the Pelwatte Sugar Industries plantation, and the invasion began. The elephant kingdom was reduced to less than 400 hectares of forest and pasture land. With the 60,000 arriving humans came buffalo and other farm animals. All fed off the same pastures that had once belonged to the elephants alone, and drank from the reservoirs that were intended to nourish the new cash crops. In the parched summer months, the competition grew fierce.<P>
Local government officials say it's impossible to tot up the entire ruin of the last decade, caused by desperate elephants searching for food. "House damage and property damage is happening every day but normally we don't record these things because it is useless," says 
H P Jayananda at the administrative headquarters of Welawaya. "We aren't giving compensation so people normally don't complain to us." Even so, a few villagers, dressed in starched white sarongs, wait timidly in his airless cabin with the latest tale of woe.<P>
"You never knew what they would do. Sometimes they just came to have their dinner in the village and then they would walk along the road peacefully. But in the evening when people would go out to the local shops, the elephants would come and kill them," says 
D M Podeappuhamy, who grows rice, coconut, jackfruit and mango on a sizeable plot of land. "We started to go out with firecrackers and torches, but the elephants just got used to them."
And yet the villagers managed to find some harmony with the herd. As Handapangala's fame grew as a spot for watching wildlife, the locals set up tea shops for tourists and prospered. Many believe the elephants only attack those who have wronged them.<P>
Meanwhile, at Pelwatte, the sugar cane stretches as far as the eye can see: an 8,000-hectare expanse of gold and green that translates into hundreds of tons of sugar a day. FYI, the Commonwealth Development Corporation, which is a UK government body, is the largest single foreign investor with a 16 per cent shareholding. It has every luxury a plantation could want - neat bungalows for the managers, swimming pool, tennis courts, golf course - all contained within an electrified fence and patrolled by 800 armed night watchmen on foot and in tractors.
But even they cannot keep the elephants out. They charge at the fence with logs curled up in their trunks, neutralise it, and have their dinner. "At certain times they came to have a taste of the sweet cane," says project co-ordinator P Ganegama. "Sometimes it happened regularly - once a week."<P>
Earlier attempts to get man and elephant to co-exist foundered. And so last month the elephants were forced to move on. More than 100 forest rangers, armed with firecrackers, drove the elephants through the electrified passage to their new home. Environmentalists have criticised the drive, arguing that Yalle, which this summer has baked in an island-wide drought, cannot produce enough water or fodder for the herd. Wildlife officials agree, but say the elephants will be all right after the rains.<P>
The wildlife department is plainly thrilled about the clear-out, claiming it was more like a majestic walk through the jungle than an expulsion. Reportedly, the herd was moved without a single shot being fired. And, despite everything, the villagers were sad to see the last of them go. "Although there has been a conflict with the animals, now we feel lonely," said one.
But in Pubuduwewagama, people say the war with nature is not yet won. Days after the round-up, wildlife department officials were searching for four stray bull elephants. One lost baby had already wandered back home. "They will be back, they are not used to that place. This is their kingdom," Premadasa says.

<FONT SIZE="+3">Report on child sex abuse in Bradford</FONT><br>
<b> By Maggie O'Kane </b><P>

        <!--TEXT-->
A pioneering project on child sex abuse in Bradford has found that children as young as 12 are being kept prisoner, tortured and pushed on to the streets as prostitutes. The report - released on the same day that Save The Children warned of a worldwide increase in the child sex industry - details the first year at the Barnardos project for child prostitutes and the stories of 45 girls asked for help. Maggie O'Kane heard one shocking account . . .

A Bradford prostitute hides <BR>
her face from the camera<BR></B></TD>
</TR> </TABLE>

<P>
HER room measured 4 metres by 4 metres, from the blue lino of the corridor to the window under the roof. It had a bed, a wardrobe and a view that looked out over the golden tips of a mosque. Under her window, there was a car park and a car repair shop.
Her work as a prostitute in Bradford did not begin until 6pm when she was unlocked from her room by her pimp, ready for the men who leave their city offices and stop off on their way home for tea to buy sex from children.<p>
Her story is the story of hundreds, perhaps thousands of British children exposed by a pioneering Barnardos project.
When a new landlord took over the premises two months ago, he repainted her attic room to take away the lingering smell of urine and human waste. When she was locked up she used the sink to urinate in and a cardboard box in the corner for her toilet.
She was 15 when she was locked into the room, over 17 when she left it. During those two years she was taken out only at night to sell sex by the deserted mills of Thornton Road and Preston Steet.<p>
Nights went on until she had £200 to give her pimp; 10 punters at £20 for full sex, £15 for oral sex and £15 for masturbation. 
She would be returned to the room in the early hours after her pimp had taken all the money.
She was sold to her first punter at 15. She remembers him, and the pain he caused. But, after that, it got easier. Her pimp even brought the clothes he wanted her to wear - short, transparent dresses and skirts.<p>
The routine in her attic room never varied. She slept for most of the morning, waking to watch the men moving towards the mosque at 1pm for prayers. She watched Neighbours; once her pimp brought her a big thick colouring book and crayons.
Now she is a shaky 18-year-old who drinks lime pop, wears pink midrift bare T-shirts, likes listening to those old ballads about love and has been raped four times.<p>
She escaped on November 2 after leaving a note in her sister's social welfare book on which she had written: "Help me."
She heard later that her pimp had got a new girl who was 15. Now, she would like to see him buried, but he is too big and his friends would get to her if she told the police.<p>
Her journey to the attic of one of those scruffy yellow Yorkshire stone houses began when she was drunk at a party and had sex with Dealer, a Pakistani drugs dealer. She met Dealer afterwards but he did not want to know. A month before she was due to give birth he said that he loved her and that she should go to his mother's house.<p>
She gave birth to a daughter, now three, in the front room with his mother, sister, aunt and granny to help her. There was no midwife or doctor at the birth, which was never registered.<p>
After the birth, the baby was taken away. Everyone said it was the best thing because she was "too poorly". She spent nearly four weeks waiting to see the baby. Dealer's sister said she had registered the baby as hers and her baby was going to Pakistan - all the stuff Dealer had told her about loving her and wanting to take care of her and the baby was wrong.<p>
She was feeling a bit soft when she met her pimp on Skinner's Lane. He said she was lovely and kept hassling her for her address. He was in his 20s and good-looking. He listened and was very understanding when she explained about her baby.
He said he was going to help her get her baby back. He found her the attic flat with the view of the golden-tipped mosque, a garage repair shop and a car park.<p>
He was careful when he beat her with the dumb bell weights he got from the mail-order catalogue; careful, that he always got her in the stomach or back - places where it did not show.<p>
Her foster mother sent the police round once but he stood behind the door and she told the police that she was fine.
Her pimp would want sex from her as well as his other girls. He gave her something called chlamydia - a word she cannot quite pronounce - and now her tubes are messed up and she cannot have any more babies. That is why she would like to find her baby and why she is telling her story - so the same thing will not happen to other girls.<P>

<FONT SIZE="+3"> Yeltsin leaves trail of broken promises</FONT><br>
<b> James Meek in Moscow</b><P>

	<!--TEXT-->
 THE most risky campaign promise Boris Yeltsin made was never spoken out loud. It was all in the twist of his big body as he jived on stage at those Russian rock concerts on the election trail in May. "Read my hips," he was saying. "I'm fightin' fit." <P>
It was a broken promise for which his age and health, rather than the sickness of the body politic he heads, was responsible. But when the ailing president took the oath of office in the Kremlin last week, the live television audience had plenty of other broken promises to remember.  <TABLE   align=right BORDER=0 CELLPADDING="10" CELLSPACING="10">

Boris Yeltsin greets residents of Grozny during his<BR>
lightning visit to the Chechen capital as part of his <BR>presidential election campaign</B></TD>
</TR> </TABLE>

<P>
The guests present at the short inauguration ceremony were conscious that the greatest stain on Mr Yeltsin's first presidency - the decision to intervene in Chechenia and the subsequent death of tens of thousands of people - had not been atoned for. <P>
The boom of artillery across the Moscow river in a 30-gun salute to honour Russia's newly sworn-in president was answered a thousand-fold from the charnel house of Grozny as Russian forces fought the third battle for the Chechen capital with unabated ferocity this week. Scores of soldiers, rebels and civilians have died. Alexander Lebed, Mr Yeltsin's national security adviser, is to be given unprecedented powers to solve the crisis, the ex-paratroop general announced last week. <P>
Fears that Mr Yeltsin's health will prevent him from serving a full four-year term, ushering in a backstage power struggle for a successor, were not allayed by the president's awkward appearance at the inauguration ceremony. He strode sternly on to the stage in the Kremlin, in front of some 3,000 guests, and stood stiffly for 16 minutes, swearing the oath with his hand on a copy of the constitution. He spoke slowly and slurred his words as he undertook to "loyally serve the people". <P>
The ceremony, broadcast live on Russian television, was intended to lay down a tradition for the democratic handover of power. Its last-minute scaling down - from an hour-long event on the Kremlin's Cathedral Square to a brief civil ceremony - increased doubts about Mr Yeltsin's strength. <P>
Mr Yeltsin's pre-election theatrical peace-treaty signing ceremony with the separatist leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev in the Kremlin, and his lightning visit to Chechenia, where he told Russian troops that the war was over and they had won, have turned out to be bogus. <P>
So, too, says Valentina Melnikova of the Committee for Soldiers' Mothers, was the president's clear undertaking in May that Russian conscripts would no longer be forced to serve in Chechenia. "They're sending conscripts there, just the same as they did before. Nothing has changed," she said. "They just move one regiment out and put another one in." <P>
Promises to spend billions of dollars rebuilding the ruined city of Grozny are also in question. Presidential and governmental decrees on Chechen reconstruction are on a list of 56 high-cost pledges, many linked to the presidential election campaign, due to be axed by a team set up to keep the budget deficit within the limits agreed with the International Monetary Fund. 
Details of the team's work, published in Sevodnya newspaper this week, show that the list includes a decree on Chechen reconstruction worth about $3 billion. Another is a 
$45 million programme to protect mafia-threatened judges, a key item in Mr Lebed's plans to end crime and corruption. <P>
The economics minister, Yevgeny Yasin, admitted last week that the government did not have the money to fulfil the president's promises. "All instructions of the president will be fulfilled. The major issue concerns the term, and when it will be possible to find these assets," he said. <P>
But it is Mr Yeltsin's fragile health rather than his hollow promises that really threatens his hold on power. Few who voted for him believed his cornucopian pledges of peace and roubles by the cubic metre. <P>
"Nobody expected he would pay. Everybody understood they were just election promises. The same with Chechenia. Politics everywhere is a cynical business," said Sergei Markov of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Moscow.

<BR>

<P>Airplanes can be nasty places for sensitive and delicate 
passengers, especially when those passengers are telescopes!  
The pain is worth the gain, though, as you will see.  

<P>SOFIA will be NASA's newest airborne astronomical observatory.  It will
consist of a telescope more than 8 feet (2.5 meters) in diameter housed in
a Boeing 747.  It will observe the heavens from above 40,000 feet (12,000 
meters). 

<P>So what will it be: coffee, tea, or Milky Way?

<P>The ozone hole over the Antarctic region, about which we heard so much
in the news in the 1980s, is alive and well. In fact, on September 7,
1996, the hole reached its largest size on record, extending over 10
million square miles (see first image above).  In comparison, the North
American continent has an area of 9.4 million square miles. 

<P>The size of the ozone hole above Antarctica is not constant.  It varies
from day to day and season to season. Compare, for instance, the October 7
image above with the September 7 image and note the change during a
one-month period.  In most years, the hole begins to form in August,
reaches its greatest extent in September, and then shrinks.  The ozone
hole usually disappears by early December. 

<P>At any given time of the year, the ozone level varies significantly
from location to location all over the globe, as illustrated by the third
image above.  Data from the TOMS spacecraft indicate that worldwide ozone
in the upper atmosphere is gradually being depleted.  Scientists expect
ozone to reach a minimum in the next few years and to slowly recover over
the next fifty years (see the discussion below on international efforts to
limit the emission of ozone-destroying chemicals). 

<H3>The Meaning of Ozone and Ozone Hole</H3>

<P><I>Ozone</I> refers to oxygen molecules that consist of three oxygen
atoms.  Most of the oxygen in our atmosphere consists of two oxygen atoms. 
Ozone is relatively rare in our atmosphere.  It is found at two different
levels: 

<UL>

<LI>Near the ground as a result of pollution from cars and factories. 
This is the so-called <I>bad</I> ozone.  When its concentration is high,
as it often is in our cities on hot, windless summer days, this ozone can
cause damage to animals and plants. 

<BR>
<BR>

<LI>At altitudes between roughly eight and thirty miles.  This is the
<I>good</I> ozone because it acts as a shield against ultraviolet (UV)
radiation from the Sun.  Without this high-altitude ozone, solar UV
radiation would reach the ground, where it would increase the incidence of
skin cancer and cataracts in humans, and harm plants and marine life. 

</UL>

<P>If all of the ozone in the Earth's upper atmosphere were brought down
to sea level, spread out evenly over the entire Earth, and kept at a
temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit, it would make a layer just three
millimeters thick (about the thickness of three dimes stacked upon each
other).  Scientists say this layer of ozone is 300 Dobson units thick. 
The unit is named after George Dobson, an English scientist who began to
systematically measure ozone from the ground in the 1920s. 

<P>In the above images, the Antarctic ozone hole is indicated by ozone
values of 225 Dobson units or less, namely the areas shaded gray, pink,
violet, and dark blue. 

<H3>The Montreal Protocol</H3>

<P>Scientists and policy makers in many countries are concerned about the
destruction of ozone in the Earth's upper atmosphere and the potential
damaging effects on life.  Since the early 1970s, convincing evidence has
been gathered to indicate that the major cause of this destruction is the
release of industrial chemicals into the atmosphere, in particular the
release of chlorine-containing chemicals such as chlorofluorocarbons, or
CFCs.  Chlorofluorocarbons are used in refrigeration, electronics, and
insulating materials. 

<P>If humans stop releasing CFCs and other ozone-destroying chemicals, the
ozone layer will repair itself.  Eliminating the release of these
chemicals requires that alternative technologies be developed and that
these technologies are adopted by all nations.  Much progress has been
made in this regard.  Furthermore, through the leadership of the United
Nations, twenty-four states adopted the <I>Montreal Protocol</I> in 1987,
according to which CFC production was to be cut to half of the 1986 levels
by the year 1999.  This protocol has been amended twice, and most
ozone-destroying substances were to have been eliminated by 1996. 
Furthermore, the industrialized nations are to extend financial support to
the developing nations to aid them in acquiring technologies that replace
the use of ozone-destroying chemicals.

HUBBLE CENSUS</H3></A>
 
<P>Announcing the discovery of 3 black holes in 3 normal galaxies, an
international team of astronomers suggests that nearly all galaxies may
harbor supermassive black holes which once powered quasars (extremely
luminous nuclei of galaxies), but now are quiescent. 
 
<P>This conclusion is based on a census of 27 nearby galaxies carried out
by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based telescopes in
Hawaii, which are being used to conduct a spectroscopic and photometric
survey of galaxies to find black holes which have consumed the mass of
millions of Sun-like stars.

<p>Planes and flying are fun.</p>

<p>During take-off, we get pushed back into our seats like on a roller 
coaster. From the air, buildings, trees, and cars are so small they look 
like toys; highways and railroad tracks are mere lines across the land. 
After we land at our destination, new adventures await us.</p>

<p>If you have ever flown, you may remember these feelings. But have you 
ever wondered, how planes stay up in the air? For the answer, click

A controversy developed after the <I>Million Man March</I> in
Washington, DC, in October 1995. The National Park Service announced
that 400,000 people participated in the event, but organizers
called that figure a &quot;gross underestimate.&quot; Could remote
sensing resolve the dispute? </CENTER><CENTER>
<P>
Dr. Farouk El-Baz, director of the Boston University (BU) Remote
Sensing Lab, answered with a resounding &quot;Yes!&quot; He knew
he could &quot;count&quot;on remote sensing. </CENTER><CENTER>
<P>
Counting objects on aerial photographs has long been an application
of remotely-sensed imagery. For example, foresters routinely count
trees, geologists count sand dunes, agronomists count hay bales
and cows, planners count houses and cars, and biologists count
birds. Very often a grid is placed over the images and objects
are either directly counted or estimated for each grid square.

<br>On a clear, dark night, with good eyesight, you can see about three
thousand stars overhead. With the aid of binoculars you can see many more,
and with the light-gathering power of large telescopes the number increases
still further. Altogether, there are about 100 billion stars in our Milky
Way galaxy. Their light merges with that from interstellar clouds of gas
and dust to form the silvery band that stretches from horizon to horizon
in the night sky. </p></center>

Lee Blackmore was finally enjoying an early morning cup of coffee when the
phone rang. A young image analyst and GIS specialist with the St.  Louis
Community Development Agency (CDA), he had finally managed to grab a
few hours of sleep after nearly two days in front of his computer
producing maps and images of the flooded Mississippi River. On the phone
was an emergency coordinator from the police department. &quot;Lee,&quot; the
voice said, &quot;we need your help.&quot;

<P>Walk outside and watch the clouds moving overhead, or a thunderstorm
building up and then unleashing a downpour.  Perhaps you have lived
through a hurricane sweeping onto land from the sea and wreaking havoc on
a community.</P>

<P>Change is unavoidable!</P>

<P>Humans, too, do their share in bringing about change.  If you could
have been an astronaut 100 years ago and looked down on earth from orbit,
you would have seen a world very different from today's. There would have
been few city lights 100 years ago.  The rain forests would have been more 
extensive.</P>

<P>The best place to observe earth's many changes is from space.  Only from 
100 miles up and higher do we get a global view. This exhibit highlights 
some of our planet's changing features from the unique perspective of 
earth orbit.</FONT>

<P>Even at the scale of the family farm, agriculture is increasingly 
becoming a business where daily decisions regarding irrigation, the 
application of pesticides and fertilizers, and crop protection against 
frost damage often make the difference between profit and loss.
<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="graphics/farm.jpeg" ALT="Data At Work Features - Farm photo">

<BR>
<P>These same decisions can also make a significant impact on the 
environment, the prospect for future growing seasons, and overall 
quality of life. 

<P><B>In a NASA project called TiSDat (Timely Satellite Data), University 
of Wisconsin scientists -- in collaboration with the Wisconsin State 
Cranberry Growers Association and the Wisconsin Potato and Vegetable 
Growers Association -- are developing management decision aids that 
derive much of their power from satellite data available on the 
Internet soon after collection.
</B>
<P>These aids are designed to improve agricultural and environmental 
management decisions using satellite data of farmland. TiSDat has 
four specific projects:
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>making irrigation schedules more efficient

<LI>predicting power needs of farmland irrigation to help utility 	 
companies make power generation decisions

<LI>estimating the duration of leaf wetness to help predict foliar 
disease in potatoes

<LI>predicting freezing temperatures to help protect cranberry crops 
from frost damage

<H2>BADGER: A Different Point of View</H2>

<P>IMAGINE...a community of local governments, utilities, and businesses,
just like yours, that has Internet access to multiple levels of integrated
geographic data.  Imagine...a multi-layer data visualization system
available through the Internet to municipalities, utilities, commercial,
environmental, and non-profit groups, and other organizations with
interests just like yours.  Just think of the possibilities for your
community, your business, and your quality of life. Does it exist?  You
bet!  It's called BADGER--the Bay Area Digital GeoResource, and it's a
model for public and private access to earth science data over the
Internet.</P>

<P>What exactly is BADGER, and how does it work? BADGER, a non-profit 
community resource, is an on-line visualization system for geographic 
data of the San Francisco Bay Area developed from satellite and aerial 
imagery, maps, and databases. The system is available through the Internet 
to the groups noted above, as well as others. Environmental features, 
underground services, property lines, municipal zones, census data, and 
demographic information are depicted in BADGER's multi-layer
visualization system.</P>

<P>How do we meet the needs of a developed economy while maintaining the 
ecosystems on which that economy depends?
</CENTER>
</B>

<P>An example: A modern American city, in part because of its proximity to
the Great Outdoors, is attracting scores of new residents. Local
businesses are booming. Property values are rising. And massive
development and construction are underway. It's good news for all...even
the surrounding forests. WHAT?! HOW?! 


<P>By using Internet technology, ForNet helps forest managers 
contribute to (by locating usable timber and land, for instance) and
sensibly manage (by closely monitoring ecosystems) urban growth.

<H2>Camera On a Chip</H2>

<P>NASA has developed a new imaging system that is virtually a camera on a
chip.  The figure shows the actual size of the device.  Called the
CMOS Active Pixel Sensor (APS), the new system uses complementary
metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology.  Most calculator and
computer chips use CMOS technology.  It is well understood
and supported by worldwide research and development.</P>

<P>Current space imaging systems, video camcorders, and electronic imaging
instruments use charge-coupled devices, or CCDs.  CCDs require much more
power than the five volts needed to operate the APS.  The APS has an
electronic shutter, as well as timing and control circuits built into its
chip so that the camera can connect directly to a recorder.  It can also
connect to a computer for display.  This reduces the number of additional
components the camera needs and makes it much more compact than a 
CCD-based camera. </P>

<P>The APS uses standard CMOS industrial processes.  It can be manufactured
for a fraction of the cost of a comparable CCD imager.  In addition to
its use on future space missions, the APS will find potential uses in home
security systems, personal electronic cameras, manufacturing inspection,
and dental x-ray imaging.  Several companies are interested in licensing
the APS for commercial use.</P>

<IMG SRC="graphics/ulysses_big.gif" ALT="Ulysses Spacecraft" 
ALIGN="LEFT"> <H2>Ulysses Plays Billiards to Reach the Sun's Poles</H2>

 
<P>The Ulysses spacecraft, the first to reach the poles of the sun,
accomplished its task by playing planetary billiards.  Most spacecraft
operate in the plane of the earth's orbit.  Getting out of the plane of
the earth's orbit requires enormous energy, and Ulysses got its energy
from a gravitational bounce at Jupiter.</P>

<P>To enable Ulysses to reach the sun's south pole, the NASA space shuttle
launched the craft toward Jupiter in October of 1990.  As Ulysses flew
past Jupiter, the planet's gravity pulled it around and gave it an
enormous push in the direction of the south pole of the sun. Ulysses'
journey from launch to the south pole took nearly four years.  The
spacecraft traveled almost five years and 1.86 billion miles from launch,
over the sun's south pole and on to the sun's north pole.  The direct
distance from the earth to the sun is 90 million miles.</P>

<P>Ulysses' objective is to explore the interplanetary medium at high solar
latitudes.  The polar passes gave scientists valuable information on the
velocity and density of the solar wind and the shape of the sun's magnetic
field.  The measurements are important because they will help scientists
to better understand the processes that govern the sun and its outer
atmosphere.  Theories on the origin of the solar wind are being revised
because of the greater density and velocity of the solar wind Ulysses
found at high latitudes.  Scientists will have another opportunity to
confirm their findings when Ulysses completes its second flight around
Jupiter and returns to the sun's south pole in 2000, and to the north pole
in 2001.</P>

<P>Ulysses is an international cooperative project between the European
Space Agency (ESA) and NASA.</P>

Laboratory Ulysses homepage at:</P>

<P>
Emergency preparedness, planning, and mitigation are critical in the 
face of natural and technological disasters. Remote sensing data is being 
used in the prediction of potential emergency and crisis situations, and 
in the handling of these situations should they occur.
</P>
<P>
Here are some resources focused on predicting and assisting in emergency 
and crisis situations.</P>

<P>Sometimes the Internet can seem like a library with no card catalog, 
and with all of the books in a big heap in the middle of the floor.  Sure 
there is lots of data there, but who can find anything?</P>

<P>Individual data centers and archives face similar problems.  What 
is the best way to catalog and index large holdings?  How can search 
tools be designed that understand the way people think and ask 
questions?</P> 

<P>The ability to find quickly the information we need and want becomes
more important as the amount of information and number of sites on the
Internet continue to grow.  Here we present some of the work being done to
bring order to the chaos of the Net. </P>

<H2>Data Compression</H2>
</CENTER>

<P>New NASA earth and space observing missions are being designed that
will generate as much as 300 megabytes of data per second.  Moving and
storing this much data is a real challenge for data system designers. 
Closer to home, you may have experienced the frustration of downloading a
large image through a modem, where a 1 megabyte file can take 15 minutes
or more to be received.</P>

<P>Communication and information theory researchers are working on
ways to use data compression to minimize the number of bits (and hence
the time) required to transmit files.</P>

<P>Check out the resources below for information on some of the latest 
research in this fast-moving and exciting area.</B>
