<h2>
The Good News About Food!</h2> 
</td><td>

<p>
Nutrition and food make the news everyday!  Many reports offer information and advice to help you make smart food choices.  What should you eat for good health?  There’s plenty of good news about eating...information that’s easy to follow, too!
<P>


<b>A healthful eating pattern has three common-sense qualities:  variety, moderation, and balance</b>
<p>
No matter what headlines make the news, nutrition advice remains the same for healthy people.  Eat a wide variety of foods within the groups of the Food Guide Pyramid.  For balance, choose enough daily servings from each food group.  And go easy on fats, oils, and sweets.
<p>

<b>You can eat what you like</b>
<p>
In moderation, any food can fit in an eating pattern that promotes your good health.  There are no "good" or "bad" foods and no "good" or "bad" meals or snacks, just good and bad diets.
<p>
A variety of nutrient-rich foods fit into the five food groups.  That’s good news!  Eat primarily foods in each group with less fat, sugar, and sodium.
<p>
If you opt for foods with more fat, sugar, or sodium, make trade-offs.  For example, build a great sandwich with low-fat deli meats, then spend the fat savings on an avocado or cheese slice.
<p>
<center>
<img src="gifs/pyramid.gif">
</center>
<b>You can make healthful food choices anytime, anywhere!</b>
<p>
Supermarkets, restaurants, delis, home...almost everywhere, you have plenty of tasty food choices these days.
<p>
Besides traditional fare, more good-tasting food choices are readily available today, such as lean meat, fat-free or reduced-fat cheese, and low-fat ice cream.  Prepared meals, such as fettucine alfredo and cheese enchiladas, are available in traditional and "leaner" versions.  Some foods also are prepared with less sodium or more fiber or calcium.  Check the Nutrition Facts label to make healthful food selections.
<p>
Eating out doesn’t need to be a high-calorie, high-fat food experience, either.  Restaurants, fast-food chains, and delis offer menus with delicious lower-calorie, lower-fat options, along with grains, fruits, and vegetables.
<p>

<b>Eating healthy can be convenient and quick</b>
<p>
You can prepare and eat healthful and tasty meals or snacks in no time at all:
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Keep a supply of quick-to-fix foods on hand:  frozen vegetables, pasta, milk, low-fat yogurt, healthfully prepared meals and canned soups, cheese, lean deli meats, and canned beans.<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Use quick-and-healthy cooking methods, such as stir-frying, broiling, and microwaving.<p>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Buy preprepared foods, such as precut vegetables, canned beans, or shredded fat-free or reduced-fat cheese.<p>


<b>Healthful foods can taste good</b>
<p>
How can you ensure the great taste of meals and snacks?
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Retain the quality and flavor of foods with proper food storage, careful handling, and good food preparation techniques.<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Enhance the natural flavors of food with a variety of fresh herbs, spices, fruit juices, and vinegars, rather than rich sauces, added sugar, or salt.<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Experiment with flavor combinations:  salsa as a raw vegetable dip or shredded low-fat cheese on any sliced, fresh fruit.
<p>

<b>The media can keep you updated on food and nutrition news</b>
<p>
Be a smart consumer of food news.  Remember these tips:
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Read--or listen to--the whole story.  Experts’ comments, which often appear at the end, put studies in perspective, and sometimes offer a different point of view.
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Just because it appeared in print or on the airwaves doesn’t necessarily mean that the latest piece of nutrition research is significant for you.  Remember, one study isn’t enough to prove anything; the results from one study build on another.
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Ask questions:  Was the study or report from a reputable source?  Were the people studied similar to you--in age, sex, health condition, and lifestyle?  Is the research confirmed by other studies?
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Find out what is best for your eating style--<a href="finddiet.html">ask a registered dietitian.</a><p>

<H2>Healthy Eating--Make Yours Easy, Convenient and Delicious!</H2>
</TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
Healthful eating isn't complicated. It's just a matter of balance, variety and moderation. With these ideas in mind, you can easily enjoy a nutritious eating plan without counting calories, fat or cholesterol.
<P>
<H3>Healthy Eating Can Be Made Easy With A Little Planning.</H3>
<P>
At home, stock your pantry with foods such as rice, pasta, whole grains, fruits and vegetables. Selected with care, these foods can provide good sources of fiber and be lower in fat. Low-fat dairy products, lean and well-trimmed meat, poultry with the skin removed, and seafood add taste, variety and valuable nutrients.
<P>
<H3>Plan Ahead For Eating Out.</H3>
<P>
Choose the type of restaurant in advance and consider your options. Once there, ask questions, be the first to order so you're not influenced by others' choices, and make requests that minimize fat. By planning, you can be sure you are eating by choice, not by chance.
<P>
<H3>Healthful Eating Doesn't Have To Take More Time.</H3>
<P>
Whether it's breakfast on the run, dinner on demand or instant family snacks, making wise food choices is the key to planning quick and convenient meals. Keep the fridge stocked with a variety of foods, and you can easily balance low-fat selections against higher-fat choices. If you choose a higher-fat food, for example, make trade-offs by selecting lower-fat foods in the next day or two. The Nutrition Facts panel on food labels can help you choose foods that offer convenience and nutritional value. On a busy day, try a piece of fruit, such as a pear or banana, low-fat cheese or yogurt, pre-cut vegetables, and a handful of whole grain crackers. On weekends when you're not rushed, create your own take-out. Prepare and freeze a family favorite such as the delicious lasagna recipe on the next page. When the midweek rush hits, you can pop it into the microwave and feel good about what you're eating.
<P>
<H3>Healthful Eating Doesn't Mean Losing Out On Great Taste.</H3>
<P>
With a few fresh ideas, you can trade fat for flavor.  Instead of butter 
or margarine for baking, use pureed fruit, applesauce, non-fat yogurt. Instead of oil for sauteing, use wine, bouillon, tomato juice. Instead of creamy sauces, use flavored mustard or fruit salsa.
<P>
Also, you can easily replace fat with flavor by using herbs, spices and seasoning blends. When you reduce the fat in a savory recipe, increase the seasoning by about one-half.
<P>
<H3>Healthful Eating Is Only One Lifestyle Factor.</H3>
<P>
Balance your eating habits with a realistic physical activity plan. Start by gradually increasing your daily activity such as taking the stairs, parking farther away from your destination, trading coffee breaks for walk breaks. Remember to begin and advance at your own pace. Consider that three 10-minute walks during the day are as effective as a 30-minute one. For other sources of activity think about "pleasure workouts." Dancing, playing ball with your kids, and puttering in the garden all qualify. These pleasure workouts require movement, and you may be more likely to do them because they're fun. Remember, every little bit helps. Even a modest increase in physical activity provides health benefits.
<P>

<B><H3>RECIPE: Easy Spinach Lasagna</H3></B>
<P>
1 32-ounce jar chunky vegetable marinara sauce<BR>
1 1/4 cups water<BR>
1/2 teaspoon minced garlic<BR>
1 egg white<BR>
1 cup reduced-fat ricotta cheese<BR>
No-stick vegetable spray<BR>
1 8-ounce box uncooked lasagna noodles<BR>
2 10-ounce packages frozen, chopped spinach, defrosted and drained well<BR>
1 1/2 cups part-skim shredded mozzarella cheese<BR>
1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese<BR>
<P>
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. In large bowl, thoroughly mix marinara sauce, water and garlic; set aside. In a medium-size bowl, beat egg white. Stir in ricotta cheese. Coat 13x9x2-inch baking dish with no-stick spray. Spread 1/2 cup sauce over bottom of dish. Arrange 1/3 of the uncooked noodles over the sauce. Spread the ricotta mixture over the noodles. Place another 1/3 of the noodles over the ricotta mixture, then an even layer of the spinach and the remaining noodles. Pour remaining sauce over all. Top with mozzarella cheese, then sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil. Bake for 1 hour. You may remove the foil during the last 15 minutes to brown.

<H2>Healthy Weight, Healthy You</H2> </TD><TD>
<B>Did you know that being overweight or underweight can increase your risk of health problems?</B>
<P>
Research has shown excess weight is a serious health problem for many Americans, increasing their risk of developing a number of serious illnesses, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and high blood pressure.  Being underweight is linked with heart problems, lowered resistance to infection, chronic fatigue, anemia, depression and other illnesses.  The good news:  healthful eating and regular physical activity can help to prevent these illnesses.  Managing your weight plays a vital role in achieving and maintaining good health while enhancing the quality of your life.  The key is to achieve and maintain your realistic healthy weight through proper food choices and regular physical activity.  By making changes in your habits--including eating and physical activity--you can help achieve long-term health and lifelong weight management. 
<P>

<B>But what is a healthy weight?</B>
<P>


Your healthy weight is likely to  be quite different from anyone else's.  A variety of factors influence your weight, including your genes (which play a role in determining your body size and shape), physical activity, age, dieting history, and the foods you eat.  Whether your weight is healthy depends on where your body fat is located, how much of your weight is fat, and whether you have weight-related health problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure.  Most people fall within the range of weights in the chart that follows.  
<P>

<H3>Use the following guidelines to judge if your weight is healthy:</H3>

<P>

<B>Body shape</B><P>

Are you apple-shaped with more fat on your upper body (around your abdomen), or pear-shaped with fat gathering on your lower body (on the buttocks or thighs)?  Excess weight below the waist creates a pear-shaped body and does not appear to pose as much risk for weight-related health problems as weight carried  above the waist.
<P>

<B>Weight tables</B>
<P>
The chart offers some guidelines for determining a reasonable weight range based on height.  Because muscle and bone weigh more than fat, the higher weights in the range typically apply to those with more muscle and a larger  frame.  People with less muscle and a smaller frame will fall at the lower end of the range.  Weights above and below the ranges are associated with increased incidence of disease and disability.
<P>
<B>Are you a healthy weight?</B><P>

<B>Where do I start?</B>
<P>
  

First, use the guidelines provided to see if you are within a healthy weight range.  If you need to lose or gain weight, 
ask for support.  Sources can include family, friends, and a registered dietitian.  
Your success at reaching these goals may depend on improved regular physical activity and eating habits.  A registered dietitian can help you set a reasonable weight goal and recommend an approach that's right for you.

<tr><td></td><td valign=top><h2>Holiday 
Snacks 
Work 
With the 
Pyramid </h2>
</td><td>The holidays are coming! You can feel the excitement. It's a season for spending 
time and sharing meals with friends, and preparing traditional foods. Yet 
holidays are busy times, and with all the preparations and celebrations, you 
might be too busy to eat regular meals. If this is true, take some time to learn 
how tasty, convenient snacks and appetizers can fill hunger gaps, contribute 
important nutrients, and add enjoyment to your holiday eating. <p>

<font size=3><strong>The pyramid plan </strong></font></p>
<p>Smart snackers use the Food Guide Pyramid as a practical guide to determine 
the types of foods and the number of servings from each food group to eat 
every day. The variety of foods and range of recommended servings can help 
you meet your personal nutrient and calorie needs. Nutrition experts advise 
healthy people two years of age and over to eat at least the minimum 
recommended number of servings from each food group daily. Use the Pyramid 
to plan a healthful snacking strategy for times at home, traveling, and 
enter-taining. Choose snacks that complement your daily food choices. </p>
<center><img src="gifs/pyramid.gif"></center>
<p><font size=3><strong>Have snacks, will travel </strong></font></p>
<p>Take along some portable snacks when you travel. When it's time for a bite to 
eat, you'll be prepared. Here are a few ideas: </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11>Make a trail mix of nuts, raisins, and pretzel chips. <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11>Tote some of your favorite ready-to-eat cereal in a plastic bag. <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11>Bring along a package of crackers and a portion of string cheese. <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11>Stow a couple of breadsticks and a crisp apple. <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11>Pack a handful of graham snacks and a small can of fruit juice. <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11>Wrap up a mini-bagel spread with peanut butter. By bringing snacks along

        <h2>Kids Need Fiber, Too </h2>
        </td>
        <td><br>
        <br>
        Nutrition experts agree that healthy eating affects the
        way we look and feel. But did you know that the same is
        true for children? It's important to teach children early
        on to develop lifelong healthy eating habits.<p>Youngsters
        even as young as two years of age should eat relatively
        fewer foods high in fat and more foods rich in fiber,
        vitamins, and minerals, like breads, cereals, fruits, and
        vegetables.</p>
        <p><b>What is fiber?</b> </p>
        <p>Dietary fiber is found in an assortment of plant foods
        and is generally divided into two categories: soluble
        fiber and insoluble fiber. Soluble fiber dissolves in
        water; insoluble fiber does not. Some good sources of
        fiber are grains, such as wheat, corn, rice, and oats,
        which are used to make breads and ready-to-eat cereals,
        fruits, vegetables, and nuts.</p>
        <p>Among the sources of fiber most widely accepted by
        children are fruits, vegetables, and pre-sweetened
        fortified breakfast cereals. Good sources of fiber can
        often be found in wheat bran-based and whole wheat
        cereals like raisin bran and whole wheat biscuits. </p>
        <p><b>Why is fiber important?</b></p>
        <p>Soluble fiber sources, such as psyllium (the
        &quot;p&quot; is silent) and oat bran, when included as
        part of a diet low in total fat, saturated fat, and
        cholesterol, can help lower blood cholesterol levels.
        Sources of insoluble fiber, such as wheat bran, can help
        promote bowel regularity and may help reduce the risk of
        some forms of cancer. Also, foods that contain fiber
        often provide many important vitamins and minerals. For
        example, starting your child's day with a breakfast such
        as cereal or bran waffles with yogurt and sliced fresh
        fruit and a glass of orange juice or lowfat milk can add
        up to 6 grams of fiber, as well as, providing important
        vitamins and minerals needed to grow.</p>
        <p><b>Why do children need fiber?</b></p>
        <p>Scientists are now beginning to understand the
        importance of fiber in a child's diet. As your child
        grows, maintaining good health depends on many factors.
        However, an eating pattern low in total fat, saturated
        fat, and cholesterol and high in fiber-containing foods,
        such as grain products, fruits, and vegetables, may
        reduce the risk of developing heart disease and some
        types of cancer later in life.</p>
        <p><b>How much fiber should children eat?</b></p>
        <p>Currently, children are not getting the fiber they
        need. The benefits of fiber for children may have been
        overlooked in the past because there was no formal
        dietary fiber recommendation geared to children's needs
        and their developmental cycle. Now, for the first time,
        we have a fiber recommendation for children ages three to 18.
        The new formula is simple--a child's age plus five equals
        the grams of dietary fiber he or she should eat daily.
        For example a six-year-old child would need about 11
        grams of fiber, 6+5=11. </p>
        <p>Children need more and more fiber as they grow to meet
        their changing needs. The new formula gradually increases
        the amount of fiber in your children's diets as they grow.</p>
        <p>Adding five to your child's age is an easy-to-use and
        easy-to-remember formula for determining your child's
        daily fiber needs. But remember, as with anyone
        increasing dietary fiber, it is important to drink extra
        liquids, such as water, juice, or milk. </p>

<H2>  Lactose Intolerance      </H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
<B>What is lactose intolerance?</B><P>
Lactose intolerance is a set of symptoms resulting from the body's inability to digest the milk sugar called lactose.  Lactose is commonly found in dairy-based foods and beverages, and is digested in the intestines by the enzyme lactase.  Lactase breaks down lactose so it can be absorbed into the bloodstream.  When the body does not produce enough lactase, lactose cannot be digested which may result in lactose intolerance.  Individuals may have varying degrees of intolerance to lactose.<P>
Between 30 to 50 million Americans suffers from lactose intolerance.  In fact, 75 percent of adults worldwide do not produce adequate amounts of the lactase enzyme, and therefore may experience some or all of the symptoms of lactose intolerance. <P>
If you are lactose intolerant, you share this condition with many people. It is estimated that 90 percent of Asian-Americans are lactose intolerant and 75 percent of all African and Native Americans, Jews, and Hispanics in the U.S. have insufficient levels of the lactase enzyme and may experience some or all symptoms.<P>
<B>What are the symptoms?</B><P>
Depending on the individual, the symptoms may vary, including cramps, bloating, gas, diarrhea, and nausea.  If you experience these symptoms after eating dairy products, talk with a <a href="finddiet.html">registered dietitian</a> or physician for an accurate evaluation and appropriate management.<P>
<B>How can I manage lactose intolerance?</B><P>
Lactose intolerance can be easily managed.  Because some individuals may produce small amounts of lactase, they may be able to consume small servings of dairy products or other foods that contain lactose without experiencing discomfort.  A larger amount of lactase is needed to digest a larger amount of lactose, so eating a larger serving of lactose-containing foods could result in the symptoms of lactose intolerance.  In such cases, a <a href="finddiet.html">registered dietitian</a> can plan helpful strategies to manage lactose intolerance.<P>
Consider the following suggestions:<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Drink milk in servings of one cup or less.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Try hard cheeses that are low in lactose, like cheddar.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Drink milk with a meal or with other foods.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Try yogurt with active cultures.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Substitute lactose-reduced dairy products, such as nonfat, low-fat, and calcium-fortified milk, cottage cheese, yogurt, and ice cream, for regular dairy products.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Take lactase enzyme tablets before eating or with dairy products.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Add lactase enzyme drops to regular milk.<p>
<B>Do other nondairy foods also contain lactose?</B><P>
Some nondairy foods may include ingredients that contain lactose.  The ingredient list on food packages informs you of lactose or lactose-containing ingredients in the food.  Although dairy products are the most common sources of lactose, some nondairy processed or baked foods contain smaller amounts.

Individuals who experience symptoms of lactose intolerance with small amounts of lactose-containing foods should look for words such as &quot;whey,&quot; &quot;lactose,&quot; &quot;nonfat milk solids,&quot; &quot;buttermilk,&quot; &quot;malted milk,&quot; &quot;margarine,&quot; and &quot;sweet&quot; or &quot;sour cream.&quot;  Some breads, dry cereals, cookies, instant soups, breakfast drinks, and milk chocolate contain small amounts of lactose.  Ask a pharmacist if medications you take contain lactose.
<p>

<b>Does lactose-reduced milk contain the same nutrients as regular milk?</B><P>Lactose-reduced milk contains the same amounts of protein, vitamins A, D, and riboflavin, and the minerals calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium as regular milk.  Some lactose-reduced milk is also calcium-fortified. Check the Nutrition Facts label for the amounts of nutrients in milk. Dairy products are a significant source of calcium and other minerals needed for healthy bones and teeth.  Two to three servings from the milk, yogurt, and cheese group help provide the calcium and other minerals you need each day.<P>
<B>What foods contain calcium?</B>
<P>Many foods contain calcium, such as broccoli, kale, canned salmon with bones, calcium-fortified breads, and tofu.  Read the Nutrition Facts label for the amounts of calcium in these foods.  A healthy, well-balanced eating pattern includes foods from all food groups: bread, cereal, rice, pasta, fruits, vegetables, meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dry beans, nuts, milk, yogurt, and cheese.

<H2>The Lean 'n Easy Way to Enjoy Meat</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
<B>Enjoy a variety of foods!</B>
<P>
Eating healthy is about enjoying the wonderful variety of
 foods available today.  Choosing a variety of foods from
 among the food groups, as well as from within each group,
 makes meals and snacks interesting and helps provide all the
 nutrients you need.  Also, eating a variety of tasty foods
 enhances the pleasure of eating!
<P>     According to the Food Guide Pyramid, you can enjoy 2 to 3
 servings each day (a total of 5 to 7 ounces) of foods from the
 meat group, such as lean meat, poultry, fish, dry beans, eggs, and nuts.  Many people think
 they must restrict their intake of all meats to lower their fat 
intake.  It's easy to lower your fat intake by choosing lean cuts of
 beef or other meat, trimming it before cooking, and using 
low-fat cooking methods.
<P>

<img src="gifs/pyramid.gif"><p>

<B>Choose lean cuts of meat</B>
<P>Choose lean cuts and appropriate serving sizes of meat.  One
 serving of meat is about the 
size of a deck of cards.  The amounts of calories, cholesterol,
 and fat vary greatly among different cuts of meat or poultry. 
 For example, a 3-ounce skinless chicken breast contains
 about 3 grams of fat, whereas a 3-ounce skinless chicken thigh
 contains about 9 grams of fat.  You can balance higher-
 and lower-fat choices over a few days, so any cut of meat can be a part of a healthy
 eating plan.
<P>     The skinless breast is the leanest part of the chicken.  But
 did you know that some leaner cuts of beef such as eye of
 round, top round, and round tip actually are close to skinless
 chicken breast in terms of fat, calories, and cholesterol?  For
 example, a 3-ounce serving of eye of round contains about 4
 grams of fat.   When choosing lean beef, look for cuts with the
 words "round" or "loin" in the
 name, like top <I>round</I> or sir<i>loin.</i>
<P><B>Trim the fat from meat</B>
<P>Decreasing the fat content of meat and poultry is easy be
cause you can <I>see</I> the fat.  Trimming visible fat from a
 sirloin steak lowers total fat per serving by 50 percent.  Also,
 remember to remove the skin from poultry before eating.
<P><B>Prepare lean meat dishes</B>
<P>Several cooking methods can lower the fat content of meats
 and retain the flavor and nutrients.  Round cuts cook well when they're braised or
 stewed.  Try these quick methods of cooking loin cuts:
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Roasting
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Broiling
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">  Grilling
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Pan-broiling
<P> <img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Stir-frying
<P>


<P><B>Enjoy beef the lean 'n easy way</B>
<P>Carefully chosen and prepared, any food in today's diverse
 marketplace will fit into a healthy eating plan.  Try this
 lean beef dish to spice up your menu.
<p>
<B>Moo Shu Beef</B>

<p>
1 lb beef round tip steaks, cut 1/8" to 1/4" thick<br>3 cups shredded cabbage, or packaged coleslaw mix without the dressing<br>2/3 cup sliced green onions
<br>1 tablespoon cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 cup water<br>8 medium flour tortillas, warmed<br>1/3 cup hoisin sauce, optional
<P>
<i>Marinade</i><br>
2 tablespoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
<br>2 tablespoons water
<br>1 tablespoon dark sesame oil
<br>2 cloves garlic, crushed
<br>2 teaspoons sugar
<p>

Cut steaks lengthwise in half and then crosswise into thin strips.  In medium
 bowl, combine marinade ingredients; add beef, tossing to coat.  Cover and
 marinate in refrigerator for 20 minutes.
<P>     Remove beef from marinade; discard marinade.  Heat large, nonstick skillet
 over medium-high heat.  Add beef (half at a time) and stir-fry 1 to 2 minutes or
 until outside is no longer pink.  (Do not overcook.)  Add coleslaw mix, green
 onions, and cornstarch mixture.  Cook and stir until sauce is thickened and
 bubbly.
<P>     To assemble, spoon 1/2 cup of beef mixture into center of each tortilla.  (If
 using hoisin sauce, spread 2 teaspoons onto tortilla first.)  Fold bottom edge
 over filling.  Fold sides to center, overlapping edges.
<P>     Makes 4 servings.  Allow 30 minutes to prepare and cook.  
<P>     Nutrition information per serving without hoisin sauce:  501 calories; 13
 grams fat; 6 milligrams iron; 653 milligrams sodium; 69 milligrams cholesterol.

<h2>
Nutrition Fuels Fitness:  Let’s Get Moving!
</h2> 
</td><td>

<p>
<b>What is fitness?</b>
<p>
When you are fit you look and feel your best.  You have the strength, flexibility, and endurance you need for daily activities.
<P>

<b>Why is fitness so important?</b>
<p>
Staying fit helps you maintain a healthy weight and look you best.  If you already exercise regularly, don’t stop.  If you do not currently exercise, become more active by just moving more.  When you increase your physical activity level or exercise, you gain muscle.  Muscle uses more calories than fat tissue, but takes up less space.  Also, your leaner body uses extra energy both while you are exercising and for 24 hours afterwards.  As you gain muscle and lose fat, you:
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">may begin wearing a smaller size<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">eat more and stay at the same weight<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">eat the same amount and lose weight
<p>
Fitness has other health benefits, too.  Exercise helps keep blood pressure and stress under control and reduces your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis.
<p>

<b>How does nutrition fuel fitness?</b>
<p>
Energy for exercise comes either from food or body fat.  Even if you want to burn as much body fat as possible, your muscles still need some energy from carbohydrates to get going.  Carbohydrates have to come from food because your body can only store small amounts of this nutrient.  The best way to make sure your body has the carbohydrates it needs for exercise is to eat plenty of grain products (bread, cereal, rice, and pasta), vegetables, legumes (beans and peas), and fruits.
<p>

<b>Tips to keep you fit:</b>
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Aim to accumulate 30 minutes or more of moderate intensity physical activity during most days.  If you have not been active, start slowly and add a few minutes of activity each day.
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Break up your activity over the course of the day.  Your day might include a 15 minute walk, 10 minutes on an exercise bike, or 30 minutes of swimming.
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Keep yourself motivated by including a variety of options--exercise with family and friends, enroll in classes, exercise to music.
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Don’t try to exercise on an empty stomach.  If you have not eaten for several hours, you will soon run out of energy and feel lethargic.  Eat something high in carbohydrate within two hours before you exercise.  Just half a bagel, a handful of pretzels, a piece of fruit, or a carton of non-fat yogurt is enough to help you perform at your best.
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Remember to drink plenty of water or other fluids before, during, and after exercise and especially in hot weather.
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Set realistic goals.  Start with a 10 minute walk four or five days a week and work your way up.
<p>

<b>What is the role of exercise in fitness?</b>
<p>
Exercise and good eating habits are important keys to fitness.  Whatever your exercise style, it is important to include a variety of activities.  Exercises such as weight-lifting, leg lifts, abdominal crunches, and push ups are examples of weight bearing exercise and increase the strength of muscles, bones, and joints.  Aerobic exercises (brisk walking, jogging, cycling, swimming laps) increase your endurance.  Always stretch before and after exercising to increase flexibility, reduce stiffness, and lessen your chance of injury.  Pick activities you enjoy.  If you get bored, try something else, but keep moving!
<p>
Remember:  Talk to your physician before you begin any new exercise program.
<p>

<H2> Nutrition Strategies for People Living with HIV/AIDS       </H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
If you are a person living with HIV/AIDS, proper nutrition is extremely important.  The vitamins, minerals, and energy you receive from food, along with advice from your medical team about using nutritional supplements, may help minimize the complications of HIV disease.  When you make nutrition a priority each day, the benefits may include feeling and looking better and staying healthier longer.  Eating enough of the foods you need can be challenging, since HIV/AIDS adds stresses that change your usual nutrient needs.  A registered dietitian (RD) can offer practical tips to maintain or improve your appetite and help you make wise food choices to allow nutrition to work for you.
<p>
<B>Making nutrition a priority pays off</B><P>Consuming enough food can maximize your day-to-day energy level, productivity, and sense of well-being.  Think of nutrition as an investment that pays off both physically and psychologically.  You need good nutrition habits to maintain<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">muscles for strength,<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">your body weight, and, in the long run,<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">a healthier mind and body.
<P>
<B>Nutrients build immune defenses</B><P>
Three or more meals and snacks each day can provide the nutrients needed to build a strong immune system.  These nutrients include protein, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water.  In addition, food keeps the digestive tract working.  Because the digestive tract plays an important role in building a strong immune system, the act of eating is a disease-fighting tactic.<P>
<B>Tips on snacking</B>
<P>Include nutritious snacks, such as hot or cold cereal and milk with raisins, peanut butter and crackers, and frozen yogurt or ice cream, as an additional strategy for improving your nutritional health. 
<p>
<B>Managing HIV/AIDS-related complications</B><P>
Many HIV/AIDS-related complications, including fever, weight loss, and muscle wasting, may be worsened by poor nutrition habits.  While receiving medical treatments, you can greatly strengthen your defenses against these complications through good nutrition.  For example, when fever strikes, the body burns fuels at a higher rate.  Thus, body tissues and muscles may be used for fuel, especially if energy from food is in short supply.  When you eat enough during a fever, body tissues and muscles are more likely to be spared.  Good nutrition planning includes consuming enough food and fluids to hasten your recovery from HIV/AIDS-related complications.<P>
<B>Working through hard times</B><P>
When you are unable to eat enough food because of poor appetite, nausea, diarrhea, or food intolerance, don't take it lying down.  Rather than falling 
behind, ask a <a href="finddiet.html">registered dietitian</a> or physician for suggestions for managing your specific problem.  If eating enough food becomes difficult, a nutritional supplement can be added to (or replace) your meals and snacks until the problem subsides.<P>
<B>Dealing with diarrhea </B><P>If diarrhea occurs, valuable nutrients cannot be absorbed and are literally flushed out.  If the discomfort of diarrhea makes you afraid to eat, try foods such as applesauce, potatoes without the skin, hot cereal, rice, gelatin, bananas, and crackers.  Caffeine-free liquids such as broth, fruit juice, sports drinks, and ice chips or water are recommended to replace fluid losses.  <P>     Persistent diarrhea may cause further problems.  If nutrients from foods are not absorbed, a condition known as malabsorption, or the inability to absorb nutrients, may result.  To fight this problem, a specially designed nutritional supplement may be used.  Such supplements contain easily absorbed forms of nutrients, such as protein, fat, and carbohydrate, to provide complete and balanced nutrition.

<H2> The Pyramid Snack Advantage for Kids--Start with Grains       </H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>

<b>Start Now for Healthful Eating</b><p>


Children's diets affect their growth and development.  That's why it's important to help them form healthful eating patterns at an early age.  Encourage children to eat a variety of foods from each of the food groups pictured on the Food Guide Pyramid.  A variety of foods supply essential nutrients needed for good health and introduce children to the many colors, textures, and flavors of foods.  Offer an appropriate number of servings in smaller sizes so children aren't overwhelmed by large adult portions.  Let children assist you with meal planning, cooking, and baking.  Kids are more likely to taste foods they have helped prepare.


<center><img src="gifs/pyramid.gif"></center>
<b>Snacks Count for Children</b>
<P>
Snacks play an important role in children's diets.  Children need energy to grow and to fuel their daily activities.  They eat smaller portions than adults, so snacks can help prevent between-meal hunger and fatigue.  Also, snacks can add variety and important nutrients to children's diets.  Because about 20% of children's calories are eaten as snacks, it's smart to plan ahead.  Offer wholesome snacks that complement their daily meals and that they'll enjoy eating.
<p>
<b>Stock Up on Sensible Snacks</b><p>
Keep on hand a supply of tasty snacks you want your children to eat.  Stock the refrigerator with fresh fruits, juices, low-fat yogurt, low-fat cheeses, and prepared raw vegetable sticks.  Store crunchy crackers, fun-shaped graham snacks, pretzels, cereals, and lower-fat tortilla chips on a convenient shelf in the kitchen.  Encourage children to make their own snack choices from these selections.
<p>
<b>Start with Grains</b><p>
When choosing great-tasting, portable snacks for children, start with grains!  The Food Guide Pyramid shows that grain foods are the foundation of a healthful diet.  Nutrition experts emphasize the importance of eating foods made from grain for very sound reasons.  Grains supply carbohydrates--an excellent source of energy for active, growing bodies.  They also provide essential vitamins and minerals.
<p>
<b>How Serving Sizes of Grain Foods Stack Up</b><p>

Depending on their age, size, and activity levels, children need between six and eleven servings of grain foods each day.  If that sounds like a lot, don't worry.  Many of their favorite foods are made from grains.  One slice of bread or a half-cup serving of cereal, rice, or spaghetti are some obvious choices.  There are many others as well.  Each of these also counts as one serving from the Bread, Cereal, Rice and Pasta Group:  three to four medium crackers, two breadsticks, a tortilla, two graham crackers, half a bagel or pita pocket, one small muffin, or six to ten pretzels.  With all these options, it's easy to include grain foods for healthful eating.<P>
<b>Match Up Pyramid Partner Snacks</b><p>
Some more good news is that foods made from grains make perfect partners for other Pyramid choices.  Here are a few Pyramid snack ideas for your kids to create themselves or with your help.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Top crunchy crackers with cheese and apple slices.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Enjoy fun-shaped graham snacks and cold milk.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Try whole wheat wafers with chunky vegetable dip.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Sip cool fruit juice with pretzel chips.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Munch lower-fat tortilla chips and salsa.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Spread peanut butter on crackers.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Bite into a grahamwich.<p>  
<b>Frozen Yogurt Grahamwiches</b><P>
18 graham cracker squares<br>
3 cups softened frozen yogurt, any flavor<br>
1 cup granola or chopped yogurt-covered raisins<P>
Line an 8 x 8 x 2-inch baking pan with plastic wrap.  Place 9 grahams in single layer on bottom of lined pan.  Spread frozen yogurt evenly over grahams.  Top with a single layer of remaining grahams.  Cover, freeze until firm, about 4 hours. Remove frozen grahams from pan, cut into 9 squares.  Coat sides of each sandwich with granola or yogurt-covered raisins.  Individually wrap and store in freezer for up to 2 weeks. <p>
 Makes 9 servings. Nutrition information per one square (using granola):  255 calories per serving; 5 grams fat; 1 gram saturated fat; 3 milligrams cholesterol.

<H2>Reducing the Fat in Baked Goods</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
Whether it’s after dinner or as an indulgent treat, most people find cookies, cakes, and muffins hard to resist.  But how much is too much?  The Food Guide Pyramid can help you determine the types of foods and number of servings from each food group to eat daily.  For a balanced diet, it is recommended that the majority of your foods come from the base of the Pyramid, which includes grains, fruits, and vegetables.  High-fat and high sugar foods found at the tip of the Pyramid should be eaten sparingly.  While we all know that we should try to cut back the amount of fat in our diets, no one wants to give up the treats they love.  Thanks to recent baking innovations you can have your cake (in moderation) and eat it too!
<p>

<b>What role does fat play in baking?</b><p>In baking, fat adds moisture, flavor, and tender texture to cookies, cakes, quick breads, and muffins.  Fruit purees, such as prune or banana, and nonfat dairy products like nonfat yogurt or sour cream, provide some of the fat-like characteristics in home-made baked goods without the addition of fat.  In fact, by revising your recipes to include fruit instead of fat, you’ll be adding a slight boost of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.
<p>
<b>How can I cut fat without sacrificing taste?</b><p>While you can cut most of the fat in baked goods by substituting fruit purees or nonfat dairy products for the butter, margarine, or oil, taste is the ultimate test.  Baked goods made with natural fat substitutes instead of fat have comparable flavor to their full-fat counterparts, with a lot less fat.  For example, a traditional brownie may contain seven grams of fat per serving.  By using a fruit puree in place of the margarine or butter, the fat is reduced to less than two grams of fat per serving.  Much less fat, and lots of flavor!
<p>
<b>Do all fruit purees produce the same results?</b><p>Not all fruit purees are equal.  Flavors vary depending on which fruit puree you choose.  For example, prune puree provides a rich flavor and moist, tender texture.  Naturally occurring elements in prunes work to enhance other flavors in the recipe such as chocolate, cinnamon, and orange, leaving your baked goods flavorful, moist and...lower in fat.
<P>
<b>What are the secrets to low-fat baking success?</b><p>
Even though reducing fat is important, flavor doesn’t have to be lost in the process.  Depending on the recipe, it may not be possible or even desirable to replace all the fat with a nonfat substitute.  When you modify a recipe using fruit purees, substitute 1/2 as much of the chosen substitute (prune or banana puree) for fat.  For example, use 1/2 cup of pureed prunes in place of one cup of butter.  You may add a tablespoon or two of fat back into the recipe to achieve the best results.  In addition to using fruit purees or nonfat dairy products to cut the fat, other ways to trim the fat include using egg whites or egg substitute instead of whole eggs, and graham cracker or chocolate cookie crumb crusts in recipes that call for a higher fat pastry dough crust.
<p>
<b>Low-Fat Fudgy Brownies</b><p>
4 ounces unsweetened chocolate<br>
1/2 cup prune puree (see below)<br>
3 large egg whites<br>
1 cup sugar<br>
1 teaspoon salt<br>
1 teaspoon vanilla<br>
1/2 cup flour<br>
1/4 cup chopped walnuts<p>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Coat an 8-inch square baking pan with vegetable cooking spray.  Cut chocolate into 1-inch pieces and place in heatproof bowl.  Melt chocolate in double boiler or microwave oven.  Stir occasionally until chocolate is melted.  Remove from heat; set aside.  In mixer bowl, combine all ingredients except flour and walnuts; beat to blend thoroughly.  Mix in flour.  Spread batter in prepared pan; sprinkle with walnuts.  Bake about 30 minutes until springy to the touch about 2 inches around edges.  Cool on rack.  Cut into 1 1/2 inch squares.<p>
Makes 3 dozen brownies.<p>
Nutrition information per serving:  58 calories; 0 mg cholesterol; 2 grams fat; 70 milligrams sodium; 0.4 gram fiber.
<p>
<b>Prune puree: </b> Combine 1 1/3 cups (8 ounces) pitted prunes and six tablespoons hot water in container of food processor; puree until smooth.  Makes one cup.  Keep prune puree refrigerated for up to two months in a tightly sealed container.

<H2>Striking a Balance in the Lunch Box: How to Pack a Nutritious Lunch Your Kids Will Like</H2></td><TD>
Whether the school's registered dietitian plans lunches for your
 children or you pack lunch boxes at home, it is important
 to balance nutrition with good taste.  Parents want kids to
 learn healthy eating patterns early in life and to eat
 appropriate amounts of a variety of nutritious foods from
 the Food Guide Pyramid.  Kids, on the other hand, just want
 foods that taste good.
<P>In planning lunches that will satisfy both parents and kids,
 the key is to find good-tasting foods that are nutritious and
 fun for kids to eat, and help kids meet the practical guide
lines set by the Pyramid.  Here are some suggestions:
<P><B>Snack-wiches</B>
<P>Think snack-sizes with everything you pack in the lunch
 box--including sandwiches:
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Create great sandwich stand-ins with mini-bagels. 
 They can be topped with peanut butter and jelly or lean
 lunch meat roll-ups like turkey breast or ham.
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Stuff a pita pocket with sliced lean roast beef, sliced cheese,
 tomato, a squirt of mustard, and sprouts.
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Use spreads like chicken or tuna salad for dipping.  Kids can
 have fun spooning them onto whole-wheat crackers.
<P>One serving of meat, fish, poultry, and dry beans includes 2-3
 ounces cooked lean meat, fish, or poultry; 1 egg; or 2 table
spoons peanut butter.
<P><B>Kid-friendly fruits and vegetables</B>
<P>Continue the snack approach to lunch by offering fun ways to eat
 fruits and veggies:
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">  Make sure to pack fresh fruit that your child likes
 and that is easy to eat.  Try fruit that comes in natu
rally bite-sized pieces, like grapes and strawberries.
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Offer raw veggies, like baby carrots, red pepper strips, and jicama, to dip in low-fat ranch dressing.<p>
<img src="gifs/pyramid.gif">

<P>One serving of fruit includes  one medium piece of fruit,
 such as an orange, pear, or banana; 1/2 cup cut-up fruit; 
3/4 cup or 6 ounces fruit juice.
<P>One serving of vegetables includes 1 cup raw leafy veg
etables, such as lettuce; 
1/2 cup other vegetables, either cooked or raw, such as carrots
 or broccoli; 3/4 cup or 6 ounces vegetable juice.<p><b>Don't forget the dairy</b><p>Dairy products provide calcium to keep growing bones
 strong:
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Encourage your kids to buy milk at school.  Look for 1% or
 skim milk.
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Pack some string cheese or low-fat yogurt.
<P>One serving of dairy products includes 8 ounces milk or
 yogurt; 2 ounces processed cheese; 1-1/2 ounces natural
 cheese.
<P><B>Pack "snacks"</B>
<P>Take a "snack approach" to school lunches:
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Pack grain-based low-fat chewy granola bars to give kids 
 energy they need and the fun taste of chocolate with less fat.
<P><img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Offer other good choices, like graham crackers, bagels,
 pita bread, whole-grain crackers, mini-pretzels, rice or
 popcorn cakes.
<P>One serving of grains includes 1 slice bread; 1/
2 bagel; 3-4 crackers; 1 granola bar.
<P>Get kids involved in their own lunch food choices.  Start by
 providing a variety of nutritious options.  Then let kids decide
 what foods go to school each day.  Develop a list of choices
 and take kids grocery shopping for their lunch box ingredients. 
 Kids feel good when they have a say in what goes into the lunch
 box--and you'll feel good knowing your kids are eating a
 nutritious lunch.
<P>On your shopping trips, teach kids about the Pyramid.  De
velop fun games like giving kids a"mini-quiz" about the foods in
 their lunch box, asking from which level of the Pyramid they
 come.
<P>And remember, check out the school lunch program.  Many
 schools offer breakfast and lunch programs that provide healthful
 foods kids enjoy.
<P><B>Don't stop with lunch</B>
<P>Good eating doesn't end when the last school bell rings.  Be
 sure to stock the cupboards at home with plenty of good-tasting, fun-to-eat, nutritious after-school snacks.  Some
 good choices include mini-boxes of raisins, individual
 servings of nuts or sunflower seeds, animal crackers, and
 low-fat chewy granola bars--they taste like a treat and are a
 good source of carbohydrates for energy.

<H2>Summer Snacking <br>
The Food Guide Pyramid Way</H2> </TD><TD>
<P>
<P>
               Summer and fun...and snacks go together.  But these relaxing days don’t mean that we have to take a vacation from healthful eating.  The Food Guide Pyramid, developed by nutrition experts, can help you snack well and love it!<p>
             
<b>    Snacks count</b><p>
             Snacks are important, so they should be planned.  Smart snacking is worth the effort.  Here are some reasons why.  Snacks:<p>
             <IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> help satisfy between-meal hunger and give you energy for your day’s activities.<p>
             <IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> can add satisfaction and variety to your food choices.<p>
             <IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> can contribute important nutrients to your diet.
<p>
             
<b>    Learning the basics</b><p>	
             Using the Food Guide Pyramid, you can learn how to choose snacks from each of the food groups to support a healthful diet that meets your individual needs.  <p>
             <IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Vary your food choices among the food groups to get all the nutrients needed for good health.<p>
             <IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Balance the number of servings you eat from each food group.  The chart below shows the range of servings that helps you meet your individual nutrient and calorie needs.  After age two, most of us should eat at least the lower number of servings daily.  <p>
             <IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Moderate your portion sizes to help you get the nutrients you need without over indulging with too many calories or too much fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, or sodium.  
 <p>            
<b>    The pyramid focus</b><p>
             The Food Guide Pyramid shows the types of foods and the number of servings of each to eat daily.<p>
 
<img src="gifs/pyramid.gif"> <p>           
  <b> Serving it up</b><p>
             How do your snacks stack up on the Pyramid?  The servings suggested for all food groups may seem like a lot until you realize that snacks can count toward your goal.  Here’s what counts as a serving. <p>
 <b> Bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group</b><p>

             Choose snack foods from the base of the Pyramid.  We need the most servings from this group.  Enjoy breads, crackers, cereals, graham snacks, tortillas, pretzels, and other grain-based foods.  Serving sizes include 1 slice bread or small pita; 1/2 bagel; 3-4 crackers; 1 oz. pretzels;              1 oz. ready-to-eat cereal; 1 tortilla.  These portable snacks fit easily into your beach bag, picnic basket, briefcase, or backpack!<p>
             
  <b>           Vegetable group</b><p>
             Snacking on vegetables or vegetable juices can help you meet the target of 3-5 servings each day.  Great snack ideas include red cabbage, baby carrots, red pepper strips, radishes, or cherry tomatoes.  <p>
             A serving is 1/2 cup for most vegetables, but 1 cup for leafy greens.  Try vegetable juices such as spicy tomato juice.  One serving is 6 ounces or 3/4 cup juice.<p>
             
<b>             Fruit group</b><p>
             Eat 2-4 servings of fruit each day.  Bananas, apples, pears, peaches, kiwi, and plums are easy to carry with you and make great snacks.  One serving is a medium piece of fruit or 3/4 cup juice or juice drink, such as orange or cranberry cocktail.<p>
             
 <b>            Milk, yogurt, cheese group</b><p>
             Snacks such as 1 cup milk or yogurt; 1 1/2 oz. natural cheese such as mozzarella, cheddar, or Swiss; or 2 oz. American process cheese can help you reach your goal of 2-3 servings each day.  Be sure to keep these snacks cold.<p>
  <b>           Meat or meat alternate group</b><p>
             Eat a total of 2-3 servings from this group daily.  Count 2-3 oz. cooked lean meat, fish, or poultry with the skin removed as one serving.  Servings of 1 egg or 1/4 cup egg alternative; 1/3 cup nuts, such as walnuts or almonds; or 2 Tbs. peanut butter count as 1 oz. of meat.  Be sure to keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. <p>
             
<b>             Fats, oils, and sweets</b><p>
             The Pyramid tip includes fats, oils and sweets.  Margarine; butter; oils—such as olive or corn; candies; and jellies add calories, but also good taste and texture, to our food choices.  Savor them wisely and in moderation as part of an overall healthful eating pattern.<p>
             
<b>   Pyramid snack ideas</b><p>	
             These ideas combine foods from different food groups.<br>
             <IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 	Graham crackers and milk.<br>
            <IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 	Fresh fruit mixed with low-fat vanilla yogurt.<br>
             <IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 	Pretzel or pretzel chips and spicy vegetable dip.<br>
             <IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 	A blueberry bagel with fruit spread.<br>
             <IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 	Trail mix of raisins, nuts, and graham snacks.<br>
             <IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 	Peanut butter and banana slices on crackers.<br>
             <IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> 	Fruit juice and pretzels.

<table>
<tr><td valign=top><h2>What are 
Triglycerides? </h2>
</td><td>Fat and oil in foods like butter, margarine, corn, and canola oil are 
mainly in triglyceride form. The stored fat in body tissue is in triglyceride 
form, too. Most of the fats that the average American eats every day are 
triglycerides. Once eaten, triglycerides are processed in the liver several 
ways:<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> If you eat too much saturated fat, the liver produces more cholesterol 
and releases it into the blood stream. </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> If you eat too many calories, the liver makes them into triglycerides, 
and your body stores it as fat. </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> If you drink alcohol, the liver produces more triglycerides that 
circulate in the blood. </p>
<p><b>Is a high triglyceride level a health problem?</b> </p>
<p>High blood triglycerides, along with other risk factors, may increase your 
chance of developing heart disease. Risk factors, which must be 
evaluated by your physician, include high blood triglycerides, high blood 
cholesterol, family history, smoking, high blood pressure, and obesity. </p>
<p><b>When are triglycerides measured?</b> </p>
<p>A physician may check triglyceride levels when total blood cholesterol is 
measured, especially for individuals with one or more of the following:</p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> High total cholesterol </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Two or more risk factors for heart disease, such as smoking and 
obesity</p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Health problems related to high triglycerides, such as diabetes, high 
blood pressure, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and circulatory disease </p>
<p>Blood triglycerides normally increase following a meal. Measurements 
are affected by alcohol intake, medications, hormones, diet, menstrual 
cycle, time of day, and recent exercise. For an accurate triglyceride 
assessment, two or three blood samples should be taken in the fasting 
state (no food or drink--except water--for 12 hours) at least one week 
apart. </p>
<p><b>What is a normal tryglyceride level?</b> </p>
<p>A triglyceride level below 250 mg/dl (milligrams/deciliter of blood) is 
considered normal, if blood cholesterol levels are also normal. Normal 
blood cholesterol is below 200 mg/dl. </p>
<p>About five to 10 percent of adult Americans have borderline high blood 
triglyceride levels--250 to 500 mg/dl. Very few people have a higher 
level of triglycerides than 500 mg/dl. These high levels are rarely caused 
by diet alone and usually involve other risk factors for heart disease, as 
well as other disease states. </p>
<p><strong>How Many Fat Grams Should I Eat?</strong></p>
<table>
<tr><td>If you eat this many calories 
daily:</td><td>Eat no more than this many fat grams 
daily:</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,200 </td><td>40</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,500 </td><td>50</td></tr>
<tr><td>1,800 </td><td>60 </td></tr>
<tr><td>2,000 </td><td>65</td></tr>
<tr><td>2,200 </td><td>70</td></tr>
<tr><td>2,500 </td><td>80</td></tr>
</table>
<p><b>How can I reduce my high blood triglycerides?</b> </p>
<p>Here are some tips that may help:</p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Choose to eat lowfat foods. Limit the number of egg yolks to three to 
four per week and include plenty of grains and vegetables for fiber. 
Cutting down on fruit juice and dried fruit may lower triglyceride levels. </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11>Achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Often, weight loss alone can 
significantly lower triglyceride levels. </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Increase daily activity. Maintaining a healthy weight, combined with 
regular physical activity, can lower triglycerides. </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> Stop smoking. </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif" align=bottom width=11 height=11> If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For example, a woman 
should drink no more than five ounces of wine a day, and a man should 
drink no more than two 12-ounce servings of beer a day. </p>
<p>Alcohol increases triglycerides for some individuals. Your doctor may 
advise reducing or eliminating alcohol intake. Drug therapy may be 
necessary if these measures are not effective. </p>
<p>The care of a physician and a registered dietitian is very important when 
trying to lower triglycerides. </p>

<tr><td></td><td valign=top><h2>Vegetables and Fruits: Your Personal Health Insurance </h2>
</td><td>

<p>Remember the &quot;eat your vegetables&quot; routine at the dinner table? Well, guess what--this childhood 
advice is now supported by scientific research. </p>
<p>Health experts now recommend that we eat at least three to five servings of vegetables every day 
and two to three servings of fruit. Here's why: </p>
<p>Vegetables and fruits are: </p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">low in fat <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">cholesterol free<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">low in calories<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">loaded with vitamins and minerals<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">great sources of fiber </p>

<p>Scientists believe this advice alone would go a long way toward improving Americans' health. 
Adding to this good news is that vegetables also contain phytochemicals (say: &quot;fye-toe-chemicals&quot;) 
and anti-oxidant vitamins. A tomato, for example, contains about 10,000 phytochemicals, and a 
bite of broccoli or brussels sprouts serves up thousands of phytochemicals.</p>
<p><strong>What are phytochemicals and antioxidant vitamins? </strong></p>
<p>Phytochemicals simply refers to chemicals found in plants. You won't need to go shopping for them 
because they occur naturally in vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, and seeds. Scientists believe these 
plant chemicals may protect our cells from the damaging effects of toxic substances that can result 
in cancer and heart disease and foster the aging process. </p>
<p>Vitamin C, vitamin E, and beta-carotene are examples of phytochemicals. They are better known 
as antioxidant nutrients. Research suggests that people tend to develop fewer cancers when their 
diets contain antioxidant-rich foods. Other studies suggest that the antioxidant vitamins in vegetables 
and other plant foods may help reduce the risk of heart disease. </p>
<p>So, the best advice to ensure your personal health is to eat a wide variety of plant foods, including 
vegetables and fruits. As a result, antioxidant vitamins will be among the many benefits you'll 
receive. </p>
<p>For a delicious array of foods rich in those cell-protecting antioxidants, check out the list below. 
Think of it as personal health insurance that's easy to swallow! </p>
<p><strong>Antioxidant-Rich Foods </strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Beta-carotene </strong></em></p>
<p>Choose yellow-orange and dark-green leafy vegetables and fruits: </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">carrots, sweet potatoes, winter squash, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">apricots, cantaloupe, papayas, peaches </p>
<p><strong><i>Vitamin C</i></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, toma toes, green peppers, potatoes </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">citrus fruits (such as oranges and grapefruits), strawberries, cantaloupe </p>
<p><strong><i>Vitamin E</i></strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">dark-green leafy vegetables like broccoli, spinach, romaine lettuce </p>

<p><strong>Your Best Bet </strong></p>
<p>Remember, the best way to get phytochemicals and antioxidant vitamins, as well as other nutrients, 
is to eat a wide variety of foods, including vegetables, fruits, and grains. One serving equals about 
one-half cup cooked or raw vegetables, one cup leafy vegetables, a medium piece of fruit, one-half 
cup canned fruit, a slice of bread, or one-half cup cooked rice or pasta. Check out the veggie tips 
below and the recipe to the right. One serving of this minestrone soup provides 50 percent of your 
daily needs for beta-carotene and vitamin C. You'll discover how easy it is to eat your vegetables 
after all. </p>
<p><strong>Quick Veggie Tips </strong></p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Stuff your favorite omelet with low-fat shredded cheese, tomatoes, and frozen spinach (that has 
been cooked and drained). Garnish with strawberries or peaches. </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">For a tasty salad, cook several frozen or fresh veg etables (cauliflower, carrots, broccoli, brussels 
sprouts), until tender and crisp. Add one-half cup prepared Italian salad dressing per one pound of 
vegetables. Mix well and refrigerate until chilled. Use low-fat or nonfat dressing. </p>
<p> <img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Turn your family's favorite main dish casserole into a nutri tious, blue-ribbon winner by adding 
one cup frozen or canned mixed vegetables. Be sure to look for the veggie blends that include 
cauliflower, broccoli, and carrots. </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Stuff your favorite spud with antioxidant-rich toppings such as stewed tomatoes, green and red 
peppers, onions, broccoli, and low-fat cheese. </p>
<p><strong>Quick Minestrone Soup</strong> </p>
<p>Four antioxidant-rich veggies make this soup a real winner. </p>
<p>1 (16-oz.) pkg. frozen broccoli, cauliflower, and carrot blend<br>
2 (15-oz.) cans stewed tomatoes<br>
2 (14 1/2-oz.) cans broth (beef, vegetable, or poultry) <br>
1 (15-oz.) can great northern beans<br>
2 oz. uncooked vermicelli pasta (break into 2-inch pieces) <br>
Grated parmesan cheese </p>
<p>In a large sauce pan, combine vegetables, tomatoes, broth, beans, and pasta; bring to a boil. 
Reduce heat; cover and simmer 6 to 8 minutes or until vegetables and pasta are tender. Sprinkle 
with parmesan cheese. </p>
<p>Makes 4 to 6 (1-1/2 cup) servings. </p>

<H2>  What’s New in Diabetes Meal Planning?        </H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>
Careful meal planning plays an important role in managing diabetes.  In The American Dietetic Association’s (ADA) recent study, meal planning provided by a registered dietitian together with other diabetes treatment proved to be very helpful in controlling the disease.
<p>
<b>Three forms of diabetes</b><p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"><i>Type I diabetes</i> is the most serious but least common form and usually develops before age 30.  People with this type of diabetes cannot make the hormone insulin in their pancreas to help energy (glucose) get into the body’s cells.  They need to take insulin and balance their food intake and physical activity with their insulin.
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"><i>Type II diabetes</i> is the most common and usually develops after age 40.  Type II diabetes is more likely to develop if you are overweight and have high blood pressure, high levels of fat in your blood, or a history of diabetes in your family.  The treatment is weight loss and increased physical activity, sometimes along with medication (pills or insulin injections).
<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"><i>Gestational diabetes</i> develops in some women during pregnancy and often results in unusually large babies if not treated.  Women who are overweight and older are more likely to have gestational diabetes.  All pregnant women should be tested for diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy so that gestational diabetes, if found, can be treated.
<p>
<b>Old beliefs don’t stand up to new research</b><p>For a long time, nutrition experts thought that "sugars," such as candy and regular soda and "sweets," such as cakes and cookies, were off limits for people with diabetes.  That was because they thought such foods raised blood glucose (sugar) too quickly.<p>
Though it’s hard to believe, research shows that sugars and sweets, or "simple sugars," don’t raise blood glucose any quicker than starches, or "complex carbohydrates."  So sugars and sweets aren’t off limits.  Simply follow healthy nutrition advice--eat sugars and sweets in moderation.
<P>
<b>No one "diabetes diet"</b><p>
There’s no one diet for diabetes.  General guidelines exist, such as "eat less fat and saturated fat" and "eat more whole grains, fruits, and vegetables."  Your diabetes meal plan must be based on your individual needs and developed with expert assistance from a registered dietitian.  Also, use the Nutrition Facts information on food labels to help you choose healthful foods.
<p>
<b>What’s to eat?</b>
<p>
<b>Eat more starches, such as bread, cereal, and starchy vegetables--6 servings a day or more.</b><br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Start the day with cold (dry) cereal with nonfat/skim milk or a bagel with one teaspoon of jelly/jam.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Put starch center stage--pasta with tomato sauce, baked potato with chili, rice and stir-fried beef and vegetables.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Add cooked black beans, corn, or garbanzo beans (chickpeas) to salads or casseroles.<p>
<b>Eat more fruits and vegetables--try 5 a day.</b><br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Grab a piece of fruit or two as a snack.<br>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Pack raw vegetables for lunch--broccoli, carrots, cauliflower, or peppers.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Add vegetables to chili, stir-fried dishes, or stews.<p>
<b>Eat sugars and sweets in moderation.</b><br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Pick your favorite sweets and include them in your meal plan once or twice a week at most.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Split a dessert to satisfy your sweet tooth while lowering the sugar, fat, and calories.<p>
<b>Eat less total fat.</b><br>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Use low-fat or fat-free cream cheese, salad dressing, mayonnaise, or sour cream.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Just use less--butter/margarine, mayonnaise, cream cheese, salad dressing, or oil.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Use fat-free toppers--jam/jelly, mustard, salsa, fat-free yogurt, or sauces.<br>

<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">"Sauté" with flavored vinegars or lemon/lime juice.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">When using oil, choose olive, canola, soybean, corn, sunflower, or safflower.<p><b>Eat less saturated fat.</b><br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Choose lean cuts of meats (beef, lamb, pork, or veal) and think of meat as the side dish, not the main course.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Eat more skinless poultry and seafood prepared by grilling, broiling, or poaching. <br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Use low-fat dairy products--nonfat/skim milk, low-fat cheeses, low-fat yogurt, and low-fat dairy desserts.<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Moderate your intake of foods that use hydrogenated fat as an ingredient.
<p>
<b>Help is close by</b><p>Just as no one diabetes diet exists, no one meal plan or approach to meal planning exists.  You must have an individualized meal plan designed for you, based on your diabetes treatment goals, eating habits, and lifestyle.  <a href="finddiet.html">Registered dietitians</a> can help you develop a plan to fit your own needs.

<h2>Whole-Grain Goodness--Three Are Key!</h2> 
</td><td>

<p>Nutrition experts recommend we eat at least three servings of whole-grain foods daily. How many 
do you eat each day? </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Whole-grain cereals (1 cup dry ready-to-eat or 1/2 cup cooked = 1 serving) </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Whole-grain breads (1 slice bread or small roll or 1/2 bagel or 1/2 English muffin or 1/2 
hamburger bun = 1 serving) </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Brown rice or whole-grain pasta ( 1/2 cup cooked = 1 serving) </p>
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">Other foods made with whole-grain flour (2 small pancakes or 1 small waffle or 1 small muffin or 
3-4 small crackers = 1 serving) </p>
<p><strong>How did you do? </strong></p>
<p>If you're like most people, you eat on average less than 1 serving a day! And if you're like many 
more people, you had trouble answering the question because you're not certain just what 
whole-grain means. </p>
<p><strong>How can I tell if a food is whole-grain? </strong></p>
<p>Before they are milled or refined, all grains are whole. That is, they contain all the original 
components of grains: an inner layer of germ, a middle layer called the endo-sperm, and the outer 
bran layer. When grains are milled, the germ and bran are often removed, and the starchy 
endosperm is left. That's what you eat when you enjoy white rice or foods made with white flour. </p>
<p>Many popular foods today contain whole grains, including whole-grain breakfast cereals, 
whole-wheat and whole-grain breads and rolls, and whole-grain waffles. To make certain you're 
eating a food that contains a significant amount of whole grains, check the ingredient list on the 
label. The predominant ingredient should be labeled &quot;whole&quot; or &quot;whole-grain,&quot; such as whole-grain 
oats, whole-grain wheat, whole-grain rice, whole-grain corn, or whole-grain barley, or 
&quot;whole-wheat,&quot; such as whole-wheat flour. The labels of some packaged foods also announce that 
the product is made from whole grains. </p>
<p><strong>Why eat whole-grain foods?</strong></p>
<p>Whole-grain foods supply important nutrients that are vital to health and are often found in short 
supply in the American diet. Generally low in fat with little or no cholesterol, whole-grain foods are 
rich in complex carbohydrates, including dietary fiber, and contain important vitamins and minerals 
and other components that appear to play a role in keeping us healthy. As we strive to eat fewer 
high-fat foods, whole-grain foods are nutritionally ideal choices. For optimal nutrition, try to eat at 
least three servings of whole-grain foods each day. </p>
<p>Whole-grain foods are important sources of both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. Studies 
suggest that eating more soluble fiber may reduce blood cholesterol levels. Lower blood cholesterol 
levels may help reduce the risk of heart disease. </p>
<p>Insoluble dietary fiber aids in bowel regularity and may prevent gastrointestinal disorders. 
Fiber-containing whole-grain foods may be effective in reducing the risk of certain types of cancer. </p>
<p>In addition, diets rich in fiber are greater in volume and take longer to chew. As a result, high-fiber 
diets may be more satisfying and may control food intake to aid weight management. Studies have 
shown modest weight losses in obese people who increase their fiber intake. </p>
<p>Whole-grain foods are also important sources of antioxidant nutrients, including vitamin E and 
selenium. Whole-grain foods also supply minerals such as zinc, copper, and iron, and vitamins B6, 
A, and E, all necessary for good health. </p>
<p><strong>In Search of Whole Grains</strong></p>
<p>It's easy to get three servings of whole-grain foods each day if you know where to look. A variety 
of whole-grain foods such as waffles, pancakes, crackers, cookies, and muffins exist for your 
enjoyment. Again, check the ingredient list to make sure whole-grain ingredients predominate. For 
healthy eating, also look for low-fat varieties of these foods. The following tips help you identify 
whole-grain sources among the major types of grain foods eaten in this country. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<table border=1 width=100%>
<tr><td width=50%><strong>Grain Foods</strong></td><td width=50%><strong>Look for Whole-Grain Sources</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td width=50%><strong>Breakfast cereals</strong></td><td width=50%>Look for &quot;whole-grain&quot; on the package. Check 
the ingredient list for the words &quot;whole-grain&quot; or 
&quot;whole&quot; in front of these grains: oats, wheat, rice, 
corn or barley.</td></tr>
<tr><td width=50%><strong>Bread</strong></td><td width=50%>Look for whole-wheat bread. Since whole-grain 
bread is not required to be 100% whole-grain, 
check the ingredient list to make certain 
whole-grain flour is used in greater quantities than 
other flours. Whole-grain flour should be the first 
ingredient listed, or if several flours are used, the 
majority should be whole-grain. </td></tr>
<tr><td width=50%><strong>Rice &amp; Pasta</strong></td><td width=50%>Brown rice is the only whole-grain rice. To cook, 
add about 2 cups of water for every 1 cup of 
raw brown rice. One cup of raw brown rice 
makes about three cups cooked. Most pasta in 
this country is not whole-grain, but you can find 
whole-grain pasta if you look for it. </td></tr>

<b>Weight gain and increased concentrations
of receptor proteins for tumor necrosis factor after patients
with symptomatic HIV infection received fortified nutrition support</b><BR>
</B><I>Ulrich S&uuml;ttmann, MD, Johann Ockenga, MD, Heinz Schneider,
PhD, Oliver Selberg, MD, Anja Schlesinger, RD, Harald Gallati,
PhD, G&uuml;nther Wolfram, MD, Helmuth Deicher, MD, and Manfred
J. M&uuml;ller, MD</I> 
<p>
A supplementary formula enriched with arginine, alpha-linolenic
acid, and nucleotides may be more effective than standard formulas
for improving the nutritional status of patients with HIV infection.
Significant increases in body weight and serum concentrations
of soluble tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor proteins (which
modulate the catabolic effects of TNF associated with HIV infection)
were recorded when patients received a fortified formula compared
with when they were given a standard formula.

<B>Meals-on-wheels applicants are a population at risk for
poor nutritional status<BR>
</B><I>Ann M. Coulston, MS, RD, Lisa Craig, PhD, RD, and Anne
Coble Voss, PhD, RD</I> <p>
Seventy-four percent of 230 applicants for meals-on-wheels
were identified as being at risk for poor nutritional status according
to criteria established for this study. When researchers used
the Nutrition Screening Initiative's DETERMINE checklist to screen
this same group, 98% were identified as being at risk for poor
nutritional status. Results indicate that most elderly persons
living in the community need nutrition screening and assessment
to maximize their health and functional independence.

<B>Monitoring dietary change in a low-fat diet intervention
study: Advantages of using 24-hour dietary recalls vs food records
<BR>

W. Jeffery, PhD, Laurie McBane, MPH, Paul McGovern, PhD, Judith
S. Baxter, PhD, Alice C. Shapiro, PhD, RD, George L. Blackburn,
MD, PhD, Rowan T. Chlebowski, MD, PhD, Robert M. Elashoff, PhD,
and Ernst L. Wynder, MD</I> <p>
Dietary data from women assigned to either a low-fat diet
intervention group or a control group were collected using 4-day
food records and unannounced 24-hour dietary recalls conducted
by telephone interview. The telephone recall method was less subject
to compliance bias and therefore suggests that multiple telephone
recall interviews may be preferable to multiple-day food records
for estimating dietary change.

<B>Relationship of social roles and nutrition beliefs to fat
avoidance practices: Investigation of a US model among Danish
women<BR>
</B><I>Carol M. Devine, PhD, RD, and Brittmarie Sandstr&ouml;m,
PhD</I> 
<p>When a theoretical model of the associations between nutrition
attitudes and beliefs and social roles was applied to Danish women,
researchers found that similar to US women, Danish women who were
not employed, who had less education, and who had lower social
status had lower fat-avoidance scores. However, unlike the US
women, Danish women did not consider employment to be a barrier
to healthful eating and Danish women in their thirties did not
have a positive association between caretaking and fat avoidance.

<b>Quantitative use of the Food Guide Pyramid
to evaluate dietary intake of college students</b><br>
<i>Lisa K. Schuette, MS, RD, Won O. Song, PhD, RD,
and Sharon L. Hoerr, PhD, RD</i>
<p>
Two dietary scoring systems based on the Food Guide Pyramid indicated that only 11% and 35% of 2,489 college students had nutritionally adequate diets. But 70% of the students' diets were classified as "nutritionally adequate" when another system--calculation of a mean adequacy ratio for five nutrients--was used. The two Food Guide Pyramid scoring systems, which rated whether students were eating recommended minimum servings of foods in five food groups, have equally high sensitivity for identifying nutritionally inadequate diets but are less accurate (ie, have low to moderate specificity) at identifying nutritionally adequate diets.</TD>

<b>Controlled portions of presweetened cereals present no glycemic penalty in persons with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus</b><br>
<i>Madelyn L. Wheeler, MS, RD, S. Edwin Fineberg, MD, Reid Gibson, MS, and Naomi Fineberg, PhD</i>
<p>
Twenty-four teenagers and young adults with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus were fed four test meals containing equivalent amounts of carbohydrate: sweetened flaked corn cereal, unsweetened flaked corn cereal, sucrose alone, and glucose alone. Subjects' plasma glucose responses to the two cereals, as determined by the areas under 3-hour blood glucose response curves, were not significantly different. This finding supports recommendations that stress the importance of the quantity, rather than the source, of carbohydrate for management of diabetes mellitus.</td>

<b>Trends in breakfast consumption of US adults between 1965 and 1991</b><br>
<i>Pamela S. Haines, DrPH, RD, David K. Guilkey, PhD,
and Barry M. Popkin, PhD</i>
<p>
In 1965, about 86% of US adults reported eating breakfast, but this percentage dropped to 75% by 1991. This decline in breakfast consumption was observed across all demographic and personal characteristic subcategories. Many demographic predictors of breakfast consumption did not change between 1965 and 1991. For example, persons with more education were more likely to eat breakfast, whereas black or obese persons were more likely to skip breakfast. Being age 40 or older was increasingly associated with eating breakfast during the 26-year period analyzed. The nutritional quality of food eaten at breakfast has improved since 1965.

<b>Salt taste perceptions and preferences are unrelated to sodium consumption in healthy older adults</b><br>
<i>Adam Drewnowski, PhD, Susan Ahlstrom Henderson, MS, RD,
Alissa Driscoll, MS, RD, and Barbara J. Rolls, PhD</i>
<p>
Although it is often assumed that aging leads to diminished perception of salt taste, older and younger subjects gave similar sensory ratings to salted chicken broth, including their ratings of the intensity of salt taste. Older subjects, on average, preferred less salty soups than did younger subjects. Sodium intake was not affected by age and appears to be independent of preference for salt taste in soup.

<p>
In general, participation in a congregate-site meal program had no significant effect on either the mean nutrient intakes or the nutritional status (as measured by biochemical indexes) of healthy elderly persons. Regardless of their participation in the congregate meal program, subjects' mean intakes of vitamins and minerals (except calcium, zinc, and copper) exceeded recommended levels. More than 25% of all subjects ate diets that could place them at nutritional risk.

<b>Enhanced enteral and parenteral nutrition practice

The author describes the implementation and evaluation of an interdisciplinary effort to improve practice patterns and outcomes related to delivery of nutrition support to critically ill patients. Three actions were identified as opportunities to improve patient outcomes: increase initial use of enteral vs parenteral nutrition support; start nutrition support sooner, especially via the enteral route; and meet protein and energy needs of patients.</TD>

<b>Vitamin retention in cook/chill and cook/hot-hold
hospital foodservices</b><br>
<i>Peter G. Williams, PhD, DipNutrDiet, MHP, APD</i>
<p>
Under typical conditions, whether a conventional (ie, cook/hot-hold) or a cook/chill system is used, almost half the vitamin C and more than one fifth the vitamin B-6 and folate content of vegetables can be lost during the preparation and delivery of meals for patients. Overall, when hot-holding is limited to less than 90 minutes, vitamin retention seems to be better in conventional foodservice systems than in cook/chill systems. Suggestions for reducing nutrient losses in chilled foodservice systems are listed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>Eating Disorders</B><p>
This category of disorders is characterized by severe disturbances in eating behavior. It consists of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, which are symptomatically related. The salient feature of anorexia nervosa is a refusal to maintain a minimally normal body weight. Bulimia nervosa is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise. A distorted perception of body shape and weight is an essential feature of both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. An "eating disorder not otherwise specified "category is also provided for coding disorders that do not meet criteria for any specific eating disorder.<p>
	Simple obesity is included in the <I>International Classification</I> of Diseases as a general medical condition, but does not appear in the DSM-IV because it has not been established that it is consistently associated with a psychological or behavioral syndrome. However, when there is evidence that psychological factors are of importance in the etiology or course of a particular case of obesity, this can be indicated by noting the presence of psychological factors affecting medical condition.<p> 
	Disorders of feeding and eating that are usually first diagnosed in infancy or early childhood (ie, pica, rumination disorder, and feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood) are included in the section for feeding and eating disorders of infancy or early childhood.<p>

<B>307.1 Anorexia Nervosa</B><p>
Diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa:<p>
A. Refusal to maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal weight for age and height (eg, weight loss leading to maintenance of body weight less than 85% of that expected; or failure to make expected weight gain during period of growth, leading to body weight less than 85% of that expected).
<br>B. Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even though underweight.
<br>C. Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or denial of the seriousness of the current low body weight.
<br>D. Amenorrhea in postmenarchal women, that is, the absence of at least three consecutive menstrual cycles. (A woman is considered to have amenorrhea if her menstrual periods occur only after administration of  hormones such as estrogen).
<p>
Specify type:<p> 
Restricting type: During the episode of anorexia nervosa, the person does not regularly engage in binge eating or purging behavior (ie, self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).<p>
Binge eating/purging type: During the episode of anorexia nervosa, the person regularly engages in binge eating or purging behavior (ie, self-induced vomiting or the misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or enemas).<p>

<B>307.51 Bulimia Nervosa</B><p>
Diagnostic criteria for Bulimia Nervosa:<p>
A.	Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following:<p>
	1. Eating, in a discrete period of time (eg, within any 2-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances, and

<P><B>Sustainability</B> Society's ability to shape its economic 
and social systems so as to maintain both natural resources 
and human life. Sustainable development includes the reduction 
of poverty and hunger in environmentally sound ways. It 
also embraces the following broader objectives that are 
interrelated and mutually reinforcing:
<P>
<blockquote>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Expanding economic opportunities, especially for 
poor people, to increase their productivity, earning capacity, 
and chances to earn income in ways that are 
environmentally, economically, and socially viable over the long term;
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Meeting basic human needs for food, clean water, 
shelter, health care, education, and fulfillment of the human spirit;
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Protecting and enhancing the natural environment 
by managing natural resources in ways that take into account 
the needs of present and future generations; and
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Promoting pluralism and democratic participation, 
especially by poor women and men, in economic and 
political decisions that affect their lives, with full respect for 
internationally recognized human rights (24).
</blockquote>
<P>
<P><B>Hunger</B> A condition in which people lack the basic food 
intake to provide them with the energy and nutrients for 
fully productive, active lives (13).
<P>
<P><B>Malnutrition</B> Failure to achieve nutrient requirements, 
which can impair physical and/or mental health. It may result 
from consuming too little food or a shortage or imbalance of 
key nutrients (eg, micronutrient deficiencies or excess 
consumption of refined sugar and fat) (13).
<P>
<P><B>Food security</B> Access at all times by all people to 
adequate food for an active and healthy life (1).

<H2>Glossary of managed care terms.</H2><P><I>Source: </I> Issue Briefing: Glossary of Managed Care terms. Chicago, Ill: Society for Ambulatory Care Professionals of the American Hospital Association; January 1994.<P>

<STRONG>Managed care</STRONG><BR> Provision of health care in which access, cost, and quality are controlled by direct intervention before or during service. Programs rely on primary care physicians to manage patient care and control costs; they encourage the use of case managers to plan and accelerate high-cost care when it is necessary; and they promote arrangements between payer and providers to minimize health care costs whenever possible. Management information systems are available to track data. Quality management programs and fiscal solvency are required. The goal is a comprehensive system where patients get medically necessary care in the most cost-effective manner while maintaining quality and member satisfaction.<P>

<STRONG>Primary care</STRONG><BR> Health services, including preventive care, provided by a family practitioner, pediatrician, internist, or obstetrician/gynecologist in an ambulatory setting.<P>

<STRONG>Physician-hospital organization </STRONG><BR> A legal entity formed by hospitals and physicians to negotiate contracts with third-party payers to provide services under managed care. These organizations may also be involved in the management and oversight of the facilities.<P>

<STRONG>Health maintenance organization (HMO)</STRONG><BR> A risk-bearing organization with management responsibility for providing comprehensive health services, with an emphasis on preventive care, on a prepayment or capitated basis to voluntarily enrolled people in a designated population. Services are provided at an HMO-owned facility. HMOs operate as staff model programs.<P>

<STRONG>Independent practice association</STRONG><BR> An HMO model in which medical services are provided through an organization that contracts with practitioners in medicine, dentistry, and other health care fields. Patients receive primary care and access to specialists is managed. Services are provided in private offices. Care providers are paid at a contracted rate or at a capitated rate.<P>

<STRONG>Preferred provider organization</STRONG><BR> A term applied to a variety of direct contractual relationships between hospitals, physicians, insurers, employers, or third-party administrators for a network in which providers negotiate with group purchasers to provide health services for a defined population at a negotiated rate. The preferred providers are often subject to other stipulations regarding the monitoring of utilization and quality of care.<P>

<STRONG>Utilization management review </STRONG><BR>Utilization review and intervention actions are a series of control techniques or processes used to identify and reduce inappropriate and unnecessary care services.<P>

<STRONG>Case management </STRONG><BR>A system for assessing, planning treatment for, referring, and monitoring patients to ensure the provision of comprehensive and continuous service and the coordination of payment and reimbursement for care.<P>

<STRONG>Capitation </STRONG><BR>The actual prepayment to a provider or insurer for a negotiated package of comprehensive and continuous health care services. Providers assume a greater portion of financial and service risk in most capitated systems.<P>

<STRONG>Integrated delivery system </STRONG><BR>A group of hospital systems, medical groups, and HMOs or insurance companies that form for the purpose of coordinating the continuum of care, eliminating redundant services, and developing comprehensive medical information systems under a single management system. These systems are willing to be held clinically and fiscally accountable for the outcomes and health status of the populations served. The goal is the delivery of health care in a seamless system.<P>

<STRONG>Continuum of care</STRONG><BR>An integrated delivery system that provides its patients with access to all services needed for health care in a highly integrated manner, allowing the patient to move to different sites and services in the system with strong continuity of care. The continuum of care will include physician services, emergency services, acute care, subacute care, skilled nursing facilities, outpatient centers, home care, day treatment programs, adult day care, assisted living, mental health services, and family/community supports.<P>

Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Food And nutrition misinformation</H2><P>
During the past decade, the Federal government and national health organizations have published an unprecedented number of recommendations about eating healthfully. In addition, enormous advances have been made in the science of food and nutrition. Despite these encouraging developments, misinformation about the role of nutrition in health abounds in our society. In this climate of misinformation, nutrition-related misbeliefs, health fraud, and quackery flourish. Consistent with its vision that members "will shape the food choices and impact the nutritional status of the public," The American Dietetic Association (ADA) recognizes its responsibility to help consumers identify food and nutrition misinformation. ADA, which represents the nation's largest organization of food and nutrition professionals, is working diligently with other health-care practitioners, educators, and the food industry to address the medical and economic effects of food- and nutrition-related misinformation on consumers.<P>
<H3>Position Statement</H3><P>
It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that food and nutrition misinformation has harmful effects on the health and economic status of consumers. Qualified nutrition practitioners in health care, academia, public health, and the food industry will continue to promote sound nutrition information to the public and actively confront food and nutrition misinformation.<P>
<H3>Definitions</H3><P>
The public is faced with an overwhelming amount of food and nutrition information. Unfortunately, it is not always clear how to distinguish nutrition facts from nutrition misinformation. In addition, studies show that neither health professionals nor the public have a clear conception of what constitutes health fraud or quackery (1). Nutrition facts are those that have been established using the scientific method. Nutrition misinformation, on the other hand, consists of erroneous facts or misinterpretation of nutrition food and science. The danger of nutrition misinformation is that it may be used to fuel food faddism, quackery, or health fraud.<P> 
	Food faddism is a dietary practice based on an exaggerated belief in the effects of nutrition on health and disease. Food fads involve unreasonable and exaggerated beliefs that special attributes of a particular food may cure disease, that certain foods should be eliminated from the diet because they are harmful, and that certain foods convey unique health benefits. The <I>US Surgeon General's Report on Nutrition and Health</I> defines food quackery as "the promotion for profit of special foods, products, processes, or appliances with false or misleading health or therapeutic claims" (2, p 696). Food quackery is exploitative and entrepreneurial. Nevertheless, many people who promote quackery schemes may themselves be victims of misinformation and may sincerely believe that they are promoting accurate information. Health fraud shares many of the characteristics of food faddism and food quackery, yet it is always deliberate and done for gain. In cases of health fraud, a person or group knowingly disseminates erroneous nutrition information or makes false claims of nutrition benefits.<P>
<H3>The Harmful Effects on the Health and Economic Status of Consumers</H3><p>
Health fraud, including food faddism and quackery, is estimated to be a multibillion dollar public health problem in the United States (3-7). A substantial portion of health fraud is nutrition related. In 1987, Louis Harris and Associates (3) studied the use by American adults of questionable health products for 15 different conditions and found that nutrition products were by far the most commonly misused. In 1984, a report of the US House of Representatives stated that "Quackery has become big business. Twenty-five years ago, quackery was said to cost $1-2 billion a year. Today, it probably totals at least $10 billion" (4, p 3). The health consequences of quackery may result from failure to seek legitimate medical care or continue essential treatment, effects of nutrient toxicities or potentially toxic components of products, undesirable nutrient-drug interactions, nutrient deficiencies, and interference with sound nutrition education and practices. Economic harm occurs when purported remedies and cures do not work and when products are purchased needlessly. Another potentially harmful result occurs when public opinion based on conflicting information (ie, reliable and unreliable facts) affects public policies, including resource allocation, legislation, and law enforcement. For example, lawmakers had to sort through a morass of fact and misinformation in shaping recent legislation on dietary supplements.<p>
<H3>Sources of Nutrition Misinformation</H3><P>
<B>Influence of Culture</B><P>
Nutrition misinformation and misbelief flourish to some degree because they are deeply rooted in our cultural milieu. Throughout history, many cultures have ascribed health-promoting powers to certain foods, and many religions have followed specific dietary practices. The Chinese "herbs of immortality" that were a popular fad among the ancient Egyptians (8) have their modern manifestation in Chinese herbs promoted to body builders in health-food stores.<P>
	Also fundamental to nutrition misbelief today is the folk statement "you are what you eat," which implies that everything from mood and behavior to intellectual capacity is determined by diet. "Fish is brain food" and "Eat your spinach and you'll be strong like Popeye" are some of the many common folk beliefs about food.<P>
	Although food beliefs that are rooted in traditional cultures and religions may be unsupported by scientific evidence, they should be respected as long as they are reasonable and do not lead to possible harm and economic exploitation to adherents.<p> 
<B>Misinterpretation of Scientific Studies</B><P>
Scientific progress alone does not eliminate nutrition misinformation. Too often the popular media capitalizes on preliminary research data in an effort to enhance audience and readership ratings. Promoters quickly turn legitimate research findings into sales pitches, products, and services. Therefore, universities, research groups, and commercial enterprises who fund a study and release it to the media must use caution in presenting their findings. Both the news media and researchers need to share the responsibility for reporting accurate and balanced information to the public.<P>
	The <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>, concerned about the way the scientific articles in their journal are sensationalized by the media, has reacted by developing the following caveats for the media to use when assessing research findings: "First, an association between two events is not the same as a cause and effect. Second, demonstrating one link is a postulated chain of events does not mean that the whole chain is proved. ;Third, probabilities are not the same as certainties. And fourth, the way a scientific result is framed can greatly affect its impact" (9). The evaluation of nutrition information, however, is best done through proper interpretation of scientific studies by qualified nutrition professionals. Thus, the media should take advantage of the expertise and of nutrition professionals to clarify nutrition information and place new research findings in their broader context.<P>
	For their part, researchers need to put their own findings into perspective by connecting them with other studies that may have shown different outcomes. Researchers can also lay the groundwork for ensuring that their findings are presented accurately by critically evaluating the supporting documentation used in their research. One model to follow is the rigorous criteria used by the National Research Council in determining what studies to cite in the report <I>Diet and Health: Implications for Reducing Chronic Disease Risk</I> (10). The Council first assessed the strengths and weaknesses of each kind of study and then evaluated the total evidence against six criteria: strength of association, dose-response relationship, temporally correct association, consistency of association, specificity of association, and biological plausibility. To properly evaluate reports of scientific studies, such criteria are needed, as well as knowledge of whether the studies were conducted by experienced investigators (8,11,12).<P> 
	Health professionals must be trained in critical research skills and must know how to interpret research findings and communicate them to the public. They must recognize and communicate the fact that studies done on small, select groups are not applicable to the population in general and that one study seldom becomes accepted fact because additional studies are necessary to confirm a new premise. Health professionals must also recognize that scientific studies will always be open to differences of interpretation; there may not be one "proper" view or clear scientific consensus of opinion on an issue for many years.<P> 
<B>Other Sources</B><P>
Nutrition misinformation is often disseminated as promotional material with dietary supplements, herbal remedies, or special preparations for weight control, constituting a form of hidden advertising (13). Although such messages may fall short of the rigorous assessment criteria described in the previous section, much of this material is protected as freedom of speech under the First Amendment.<P> 
	Testimonials are another way misinformation is spread. People believe information that is reinforced by sports figures, celebrities, teachers, coaches, ministers, legislators, health-care workers, media commentators, health professionals, and other persons they respect. The effect of testimonials by such people about the benefits of specific nutritional practices can be far reaching and potentially harmful to the public. Thus, respected people have an obligation to examine carefully the accuracy and reliability of any nutrition information that they disseminate and to sharpen their skills at making appropriate inferences from scientific reports. They should seek the advice of a dietetics professional if they are uncertain about the scientific merit of a nutrition product they are asked to endorse. Promoters of such messages may not have the scientific expertise to identify nutrition misinformation based on uncorroborated studies, anecdotal evidence, and testimonials that provide biased or incomplete answers to complex health and wellness issues. Thus, dietetics professionals and ADA members need to be aware of the various sources of nutrition misinformation. They must be prepared to counter misinformation by providing reliable, accurate information to the media and the public.<P>
<H3>Combating Food and Nutrition Misinformation</H3><P> 
<B>Let the Buyer Beware</B><P>
Consumers can take steps to arm themselves against nutrition misinformation by becoming more aware of the many ways misinformation, food fraud, and quackery operate. Consumers need to question the qualifications of authors or presenters and the evidence for any claims that are made. They need to think critically about food and nutrition claims used to promote the sale of a product or service (14). Consumers suspicious about a statement, product, or service should be encouraged to make an inquiry to the local health department, the medical or nutrition department of a nearby university or college, or the food and nutrition department of a local hospital/medical center to obtain current and accurate information.<P>
<B>The Role of Food Industry</B><P>
The American food industry is the nutrition professional's ally when it comes to providing complete and reliable nutrition information to the public. Many food companies employ dietetics professionals full-time for their expertise in nutrition issues. Qualified dietetics professionals need to continue to work with the food industry to help shape the public's food choices, knowledge of nutrition and health, and ability to think more critically about food and nutrition issues.<P>
<B>The Role of Health Professionals</B><P> 
The question of how best to disseminate accurate nutrition and health information to the public is currently a matter of debate. Consumer groups are concerned that promoters of commercial products and services are likely to exaggerate potential benefits while playing down or eliminating information about possible harmful effects. In the face of this, qualified dietetics professionals and nutrition educators with expertise in communicating balanced, accurate information on nutrition and health to consumers are best prepared to communicate new advances in their field. These professionals should be encouraged to take an active role in disseminating accurate nutrition and health information through public information channels (7,15) The Figure provides some strategies for dietetics professionals to use in presenting nutrition information to the public.<P>
<A HREF="strategiestable.html">See Figure </A> regarding strategies for communicating accurate nutritional information to the public.<P>
 
	Consumers need to be made aware of credible sources of nutrition information. One such source is ADA's public education center, the National Center for Nutrition and Dietetics (NCND), which serves the consumer through promotion of optimal nutrition, health, and well-being. NCND's vision is to be the preferred source of objective, credible food and nutrition information for the consumer. Government agencies that provide reliable health information include the Federal Trade Commission, US Department of Health and Human Services, Food and Drug Administration, US Department of Agriculture, State Cooperative Extension Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, and National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Scientific and professional organizations that offer credible nutrition information to the public include The American Dietetic Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Institute of Nutrition, American Society for Clinical Nutrition, Society for Nutrition Education, American Medical Association, American Cancer Society, American Diabetes Association, and the American Heart Association. Reputable consumer organizations include the Better Business Bureau, Consumer Union, and National Council Against Health Fraud. Industry groups that provide reputable nutrition information to the public include the International Food Information Council, National Live Stock and Meat Board, Food Marketing Institute, and National Dairy Council.<P> 
<H3>Summary</H3><P>
Food and nutrition experts, including ADA members, need to take an active role in helping consumers recognize misinformation. The challenge of dealing with food and nutrition misinformation is long-standing and persistent. However, qualified dietetics professionals, in partnership with other members of the health-care team, educators, and representatives of the food industry, can be a forceful voice against food and nutrition misinformation. Qualified dietetics professionals can positively shape the food choices of Americans by collaborating with the media to communicate balanced nutrition information to consumers and to counter misinformation; writing letters to the editors of newspapers and magazines to counter inaccurate and biased articles; calling television and radio shows that interview nutrition extremists and purveyors of misinformation to express their professional concerns; directing the news media and consumers to responsible sources of nutrition information; encouraging researchers to present their results with a balanced perspective; collaborating with the food industry to provide reliable nutrition information; and cooperating with other practitioners to expose emerging misinformation, misbeliefs, frauds, and quackery before they are widely accepted.<P>

<H2>
Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Biotechnology and the future of food</H2><P>

<P>
Consumers perceive dietetics professionals as reliable sources of food and nutrition information and services. Thus, it is important that dietetics professionals provide consumer education when qualitative, labeling, and regulatory questions arise regarding food materials derived using biotechnology techniques.<p>

<H3>Position Statement</H3><p>
<I>It is the position of The American Dietetic Association that biotechnology techniques have the potential to be useful in enhancing the quality, nutritional value, and variety of food available for human consumption and in increasing the efficiency of food production, food processing, food distribution, and waste management.</I><p>
<H3>General Terminology</H3><p>
The term "biotechnology" has come to mean different things to different people. Because the term is politically charged, it is important to understand the wide range of definitions that are applied to it (1).<p> 
	The simplest definition of biotechnology is "applied biology." Another definition is "the use of living organisms to make a product or run a process." By this definition, the classic techniques used for plant and animal breeding, fermentation, and enzyme purification would be considered biotechnology. Examples include use of bacteria to make yogurt, cheese, and vinegar and use of plant or animal cross-breeding techniques to produce stock with enhanced qualities.<p> 
	Some people use the term biotechnology only to refer to the newer tools of genetic engineering developed since 1973. In this context, biotechnology may be defined as "the use of biotechnical methods to modify the genetic material of living cells so they will produce new substances or perform new functions" (1, p 4). Examples include recombinant DNA (rDNA) technology, in which a copy of a piece of DNA containing one or a few genes is transferred between organisms or recombined within an organism, and rDNA or gene splicing, which may be likened to cutting a circle of tape, inserting a different piece, and rejoining both ends to the new piece (1). <A HREF="amplification.html">See figure</A> for terms commonly used in biotechnology.<p>
<H3>Applications of Biotechnology</H3><p>
This discussion will focus on applications of biotechnology that use genetic engineering or rDNA technology. Genetic engineering technologies can be used to increase the amount of a protein or metabolite produced by an organism, to allow organisms that did not originally produce that protein or metabolite to do so, or to block production of a protein or metabolite by an organism (2). rDNA technology allows researchers to move genetic information between unrelated organisms to produce desired products or characteristics or to eliminate undesired ones.<p>
<B>Medical Applications of Biotechnology</B><p>
Biotechnical methods are now used to produce many proteins for pharmaceutical and other specialized purposes (3). A nonvirulent strain of  <I>Escherichia coli</I> bacteria, given a copy of the gene for human insulin, can make insulin; when the gene is "amplified" the bacterial cells produce large quantities of human insulin that are purified and used to treat diabetes in human beings (1,2). Human insulin, the first genetically engineered product to be produced commercially (Eli Lilly and Co), was approved for use in 1982 (4). Since then, a number of other genetically engineered products have been approved, including human growth hormone, alpha interferon, recombinant erythropoietin and tissue plasminogen activator, and a variety of pharmacologic drugs (1,4). Microorganisms can also be engineered to produce digestive enzymes. In the future, these microorganisms could be colonized in the intestinal tract of persons with digestive enzyme insufficiencies. Similarly, persons with immune disorders could be treated with nonpathogenic microorganisms that have been genetically modified to produce antibodies (4).<p> 
<B>Plant Food Applications</B><p>
Biotechnology techniques are being applied to plants to produce plant materials with improved composition, functional characteristics, or organoleptic properties. Genetic modifications have produced fruits that can ripen on the vine for better taste yet have a longer shelf life through delayed pectin degradation (5,6) or altered responses to the plant hormone ethylene (7). Among the first commercially available whole food products was the Flavr Savr (Calgene, Inc) slow-ripening tomato, which US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved in May 1994; the gene for polygalacturonase, the enzyme responsible for softening, is turned off in this tomato (8).<p> 
	Plants that are resistant to disease, pests, environmental conditions, or selected herbicides or pesticides are also being developed. A variety of squash that is resistant to two plant viruses was approved by FDA in 1994. In 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave clearance for development of transgenic corn seed, cotton seed, and seed potatoes that contain the genetic material to resist certain insects (9); FDA approved these biotechnology applications in 1994. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) is considering herbicide-resistant soybeans and cotton seed for animal feed. The advantage of such products is that they allow the use of less toxic and more environmentally friendly herbicides and pesticides (2). Production of heat- and drought-resistant plants could bring agricultural opportunities to regions of the world currently unsuitable for raising food crops (4).<p>
	Plant foods with enhanced processing and/or nutritional characteristics are a likely application of biotechnology. In 1992, Monsanto Company successfully inserted a gene from a bacterium into the Russet Burbank potato. This gene increases the starch content of the transgenic potato. Higher starch content reduces oil absorption during frying, thereby lowering the cost of frying french fries and chips and reducing the oil content in the finished product (1). In the future, such genetic applications as altering the fatty acid profile in oil seeds and producing wheat with no phenylalanine may be possible.
	<p>Applications of biotechnology in plant breeding require more time to develop than pharmaceutical applications because of difficulties associated in working with living tissue. The pace of implementation is also limited by growing seasons. Barriers to applications of biotechnical methods with plants are minor, however, compared with barriers to  applications of biotechnical methods in the breeding and production of animal foods.<p>
<B>Animal Food Applications</B><p>
The first FDA-approved application of biotechnology to animal production was the use of recombinant bovine somatotropin (bST) in dairy cows (1). bST, a protein hormone found naturally in cows, is necessary for milk production. As with human insulin, bST can be isolated from cows, inserted into bacterial cells, and produced in large quantities by those cells. The bST can then be recovered, purified, and injected into dairy cows. When the recombinant bST is administered to dairy cows under ideal management conditions, milk production has been shown to increase by 10% to 25% (10).<p>
	After much study and amid some controversy, the FDA approved the use of bST in dairy cows in November 1993. Commercial sales were delayed for 90 days, however, because of a Congressional act (1). FDA based its rulings on findings that (a) bST is species-specific for cows, (b) bST is a protein that is digested in the intestinal tract of human beings and cows, (c) milk contains bST naturally and supplementation does not increase the amount of bST to levels outside the normal ranges, (d) bST supplementation does not change milk composition, and (e) bST has not been found to cause growth-promoting activity in a variety of species (11-13). Although results of a 1-year follow-up study of cow health issues have produced no new animal health concerns (14), the use of recombinant bST in dairy cows remains a political and social issue (15,16).<p>
	Porcine somatotropin (pST), a hormone similar to bST but active in hogs, is a "repartitioning agent" in that it redirects dietary energy away from fat deposition in the direction of lean muscle tissue production. Use of pST increases pork carcass leanness and reduces fattiness (17). Although pST has not yet been approved for use in the United States, it has been approved in European countries.<p>
	Other uses of biotechnology in animal production include development of vaccines to protect animals from disease (eg,  swine pseudorabies), production of several calves from one embryo (cloning), artificial insemination, improvement of  growth rate and/or feed efficiency, and rapid disease detection (1,2). In addition, "transgenic animals" or animals with altered genetic make-ups could be produced. The pace of implementation of biotechnology in animal foods will likely be limited, however, by difficulties inherent in working with living tissues and life cycles and by consumers' social and ethical concerns  regarding animal applications of biotechnology (18-20).<p>
<B>Food Ingredient and Processing Applications</B><p>
In addition to the genetic manipulation of whole plant foods and animals, microorganisms can be designed to improve the efficiency of fermentations and other primarily enzymatic processes and to produce natural food ingredients. Biotechnical methods can produce food materials with improved nutritional value, functional characteristics, shelf stability, and/or sensory characteristics; more efficient processing techniques; more sensitive analytic techniques for quality control and food safety; and bioremediation techniques that convert by-products to fuel, chemicals, or usable materials (4).<p> 
	Microbes have been genetically engineered to produce amino acids for the synthesis of aspartame (21). In addition, plant cells grown in fermenters can produce flavors such as vanilla, reducing the need for extracting the compounds from vanilla beans (21). Food processing has benefited from biotechnically produced chymosin (rennet), which is used in cheese manufacture; alpha-amylase, which is used in production of high-fructose corn syrup and dry beer; and lactase, which is added to milk to reduce the lactose content for persons with lactose intolerance. The FDA has affirmed the GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) status of alpha-amylase and chymosin produced by genetically modified microorganisms, thereby allowing their use in place of the conventional sources of these enzymes for starch hydrolysis and cheese manufacturing (22). Genetically engineered enzymes are easier to produce than enzymes isolated from original sources and are favored over chemically synthesized substances because they do not create by-products or off-flavors in foods (21).<p>
<B>Food Safety Applications</B><p>
Biotechnology offers effective techniques to address consumer concerns about microbial contamination of foods (4). Biotechnical methods may be used to decrease the time necessary to detect foodborne pathogens, toxins, and chemical contaminants and to increase detection sensitivity. Enzymes, antibodies, and microorganisms produced using rDNA techniques are being used to monitor food production and processing systems for quality control (23). Microbial probes, biosensors based on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, are being used experimentally as indicators of bacterial contamination. Biosensors to detect animal disease, alterations in product quality, or temperature abuse are under investigation (1,4). These developments offer the potential of lowering the cost and improving the safety of the food supply in a timely manner.<p>
<B>Waste Management Applications</B><p>
Waste management, or bioremediation, is an area of increasing interest to consumers. In response, dietetics and food professionals are initiating efforts to control the amount of waste generated in foodservice operations. Through application of biotechnical methods, enzyme bioreactors are being developed that will pretreat some disposable serviceware or food waste components and allow their removal through the sewage system rather than through solid waste disposal mechanisms or will allow their conversion to biofuel for operating generators (4). Microbes can be induced to produce enzymes needed to convert biodegradable materials into the building blocks for new polymers. Waste streams can be controlled to convert by-products to biofuel (wheat straw to glucose to ethanol), specialty chemicals (sugar or fat substitutes), or feedstocks and other useful materials (packaging materials or coatings) (1).<p> 
<H3>Issues of Biotechnology In The Food System</H3><p>
<B>Public Health/Food Safety Issues</B><p>
With any new technology, safety issues must be addressed. Potential public health hazards posed by introduction of a genetically engineered product into the food supply include an increase in toxins naturally occurring in the parent line,  inclusion of a new and potentially allergenic protein derived from the originator of the genetic material, introduction of "unnaturally occurring" hormones into the food supply, and the possibility that bacterial resistance from genetically engineered organisms could transfer to pathogenic strains of bacteria (24).<p>
	Biotechnology applications in food and agriculture are the subject of extensive regulatory review to protect against potential negative effects on food safety and the environment. Federal agencies involved in biotechnology regulation include USDA, which evaluates whole foods and production processes; FDA, which evaluates whole foods, food ingredients, and food additives; and EPA, which evaluates production process (25).<p>
	The FDA currently evaluates each application of biotechnology to animal food products on a case-by-case basis. In contrast, FDA has determined that plant foods produced through biotechnology present no inherent risk and, therefore, should be regulated as any other food entering the marketplace (26). Under the jurisdiction of the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA uses characteristics of the food, not the processes used in its production, as the basis for regulating food products derived through biotechnology. FDA offers a decision-tree approach for companies developing plant food using biotechnology (24). These decision trees represent a series of testing procedures that enables food processors to anticipate safety concerns and consult FDA as necessary for regulatory review of products under development. The assessment focuses on toxicants characteristic of the host and donor species; the potential that food allergens will be transferred from one food source to another; the concentration and bioavailability of important nutrients for which a food crop is consumed; the safety and nutritional value of newly introduced proteins; and the identity, composition, and nutritional value of modified carbohydrates or fats and oils (24). To ensure safety, a variety of toxicologic and product safety data must accompany the application for approval of any food product or ingredient produced via genetic engineering.<p> 
<B>Labeling</B><p>
Labeling food from genetically modified plants and animals has become an important issue. Some consumers and consumer groups believe they have a right to know whether genetic engineering was used to produce a food, some want to be able to choose food on the basis of how it is produced, and some believe labels are needed to notify consumers of potential allergens (15). Others believe labeling is not necessary if foods are essentially equivalent in composition.<p>
	Food labels are regulated by FDA and, in some cases, by USDA. Regulatory agencies are concerned with ensuring that food labels are both true and not misleading. As a result, label information may be compulsory, permitted, or prohibited. In all the assessment considerations, producers of whole foods or food components produced biotechnically must provide evidence that no safety issues are raised. New products must comply with existing portions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. For example, if producers introduce a potential allergen into a food, a compulsory label declaration must be made so that allergic consumers can avoid the product. Failure to do so would be regarded as misleading labeling and would result in enforcement action against the producer (1,24).<p>
	Not all foods developed using rDNA techniques are required to bear a special label. As stated in the Federal Register (24):<p> 
"FDA believes that the new techniques are extensions at the molecular level of traditional methods and will be used to achieve the same goals as pursued with traditional plant breeding. The agency is not aware of any information showing that food derived by these new methods differ from other foods in any meaningful or uniform way, or that, as a class, foods developed by the new techniques present any different or greater safety concern than foods developed by traditional plant breeding. For this reason, the agency does not believe that the method of development of a new plant variety is normally material information ... would not usually be required to be disclosed in labeling for the food." (24, p 22991)<p>
On a case-by-case basis, some types of label declarations are permitted. For example, a food processor seeking to sell cheese to vegetarians would be permitted to include the statement on the cheese: "Made using microbial enzymes; no animal rennet used" (1).<p>
	Misleading label statements are prohibited, even if they are true. For example, FDA guidelines do not allow a label statement such as "the milk was derived from cows not injected with bST" unless an accompanying statement makes it clear that there is no substantial difference between milk from bST-treated cows and milk from untreated cows (27). The FDA's rationale for requiring the qualifying statement is that a "no bST" declaration should not be construed to imply that milk from bST-supplemented cows is less wholesome.
	<p>Although FDA evaluates food products and ingredients produced using biotechnology on a case-by-case basis, the labeling regulations bear out the historical whole-food approach; if the whole food is not materially different from its traditional counterpart, mandatory labeling designating it as a product of biotechnology is not required and is, in fact, misleading unless accompanied by a statement clarifying that there is no difference in healthfulness between the two products. Whereas FDA's approach to labeling biotechnically produced foods is based on sound science, it is not without controversy. Some groups believe it does not adequately provide for consumer right-to-know and social issues (15); others are content with the present arrangements.<p>
<B>Social and Consumer Issues</B><p>
If biotechnology is to be used to ensure a safe, abundant, and affordable food supply, it must be accepted by the public (18). Increasingly, public interest groups are questioning whether technological change is good or needed, particularly as it affects food safety, the environment, animal rights, and the changing structure of agriculture (15).<p>
	Recent surveys regarding consumer attitudes about biotechnology have shown that consumers are not well informed about biotechnology, but are interested in it and are cautiously optimistic about its use in food production and processing (19,20,28). In a national telephone survey conducted by Hoban and Kendall (20), most participants expressed positive attitudes about the general use of biotechnology in agriculture and food production. Certain applications were more acceptable than others, however, depending on the perceived value and potential effects. For example, using biotechnology to change plants was considered much more acceptable than using it to change animals. Transgenic applications of biotechnology, such as the insertion of animal genes into plants, were unacceptable to many participants. Environmental concerns were important to most people and many considered ethical issues important as well. Bruhn (28) reported that consumer concerns about biotechnology related to perceived unpredictability, risks to the environment, alterations in the ecosystems, and moral and social questions.  Bruhn (28) and Hoban and Kendall (20) stressed the importance of education that uses practical explanations and familiar contexts.<p>
<H3>Implications</H3><p>
Consumers perceive dietetics professionals as reliable providers of food and nutrition information and services. Hoban and Kendall (20) found that consumers would be most likely to trust information about biotechnology that was provided by a dietitian/nutritionist. A survey of dietetics professionals, however, indicated that most respondents were not comfortable answering clients' questions regarding milk or dairy products from bST-treated cows (29). Nearly all of those surveyed wanted more information on biotechnology and food. If dietetics professionals are to maintain the trust of their clients, it is imperative that they understand the terminology and basic science behind applications of biotechnology, along with the complexities of issues surrounding the use of biotechnical methods. A critical issue is food safety. Issues of a social, ethical, economic, and environmental nature are also of concern. Only when dietetics professionals understand and appreciate the complexities of such issues can they help consumers make informed choices. Improved knowledge will permit consumers to focus on substantive issues and evaluate the validity of these new technologies effectively.<p>

<H3>Sports, Cardiovascular and Wellness Nutritionist (SCAN)
</H3>
Sports, Cardiovascular and Wellness Nutritionists (SCAN).  While the name no longer fits the acronym and now encompasses the addition of a disordered eating subunit, SCAN membership “fits” the goal of pursuing both professional and personal interests.  According to chair Lynn Umbreit, MS, RD, “SCAN is a professional home with personal benefits.  Our DPG not only provides leadership in promoting the role of nutrition in physical performance, cardiovascular health, wellness, and disordered eating, but also provides inspiration for practicing what we preach–living a healthy lifestyle–through the camaraderie of our dynamic members.”  Member benefits include continuing education opportunities, publications, professional resources, and recognition programs.

<H3>Hunger and Malnutrition (H&M)  
</H3>
“The Hunger and Malnutrition (H&M) DPG is pertinent to every dietetic practitioner, regardless of practice specialty,” says former chair Lena Hackett, MPH, RD.  “Access to food is the cornerstone of all avenues of dietetic practice and, therefore, should be a primary concern for all practitioners.”  Hunger and Malnutrition has promoted full funding for public food and nutrition programs and has opposed all attempts to restrict public funding.  Its mission is to strive for a world free from hunger; ensure access to nutrition services for all Americans; and promote the health and well-being of all people, regardless of income levels.

<H3>Management in Health Care Systems (MHS)
</H3>
Two DPGs–Management in Health Care Systems (MHS) and Dietitians in College and University Food Service–merged last year.  Both groups had a similar mission: to promote the dietetics professional as a leader in foodservice management and nutrition education.  Chair Nancy A. Gregory, MS, RD, LD, notes that the merger is a natural alliance because the skills of management are easily transferable from an institutional to a campus setting.  She reports that the group’s first order of business now is to select a new name and to develop a strategic plan that meets the needs of all its members. The group also provides technical expertise to ADA in developing  position papers, publications, and legislative issues.

<H3>Perinatal Nutrition (PN)  
</H3>
The Perinatal Nutrition (PN) DPG addresses women’s nutrition care issues during the reproductive years, including preconception, prenatal, postpartum, and lactation.  Dietetics professionals in this specialty area educate healthy women of reproductive age as well as deliver medical nutrition therapy to women with obstetrical or medical complications.  Diabetes, renal disease, multiple gestation, and hyperemesis gravidarum are examples of high-risk perinatal conditions that benefit from specialized nutrition therapies.  According to chair Lynne K. Lyons, MPH, RD, “Perinatal nutrition is a rewarding area of practice due to the impact on both maternal and fetal health and the short term measurable outcomes.  There is also mounting research that demonstrates a convincing link between fetal well being and the prevention of chronic disease.  Perinatal nutrition intervention is cost effective in both the short and long term basis.”

“Members of Public Health Nutrition DPG (PHNPG) gain a competitive edge by participating in this nationwide DPG,” says chair Ted Fairchild, MPH, RD.  “Their expertise in community assessment and in program development, planning, and evaluation makes them the nutrition experts in the community.” PHNPG members work in nutrition programs emphasizing health promotion, disease prevention, primary and ambulatory health care, and care of high-risk populations.  The DPG has been involved in formulating nutrition criteria for women’s health, influencing legislation and public policy, setting standards for care and professional practice, and developing projects that promote public health nutrition.  It also publishes a quarterly newsletter, <i>The Digest,</i> that features Healthy People 2000 initiative activities.  Members can network through geographical area coordinators.

<H2>Chefs Show How Chiles, Soy Can Boost Nutrition Deliciously

</H2>

<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Better nutrition is a top concern among today’s consumers--but few want to achieve it by eating unfamiliar foods.  To the rescue: registered dietitians and chefs who can show consumers how to use nutrient-rich ingredients in favorite recipes without compromising flavor or familiarity.  Two such ingredients--chile peppers and soy--took the spotlight at the 79th Annual Meeting & Exhibition of The American Dietetic Association (ADA), at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center (October 21-24).
<p>	"Some consumers haven’t warmed up to chile peppers--yet.  But if a hankering for heat doesn’t grab them, a chile’s nutrients will," said Nancy F. Sandbach, R.D. (registered dietitian), president of the Rhode Island Dietetic Association and nutrition education specialist at the New England Dairy and Food council, during a culinary demonstration titled <i>Mild to Wild!  Cooking with Chile Peppers.</i><P>
	These little powerhouses also pack another nutrient punch in capsaicin, the chemical that makes chiles hot. "Capsaicin appears to be one of the phytochemical elements that we’re seeing so much research and discussion about," Sandbach said. "It’s one more reason for consumers to learn how chiles can give you a high-flavor, low-fat seasoning."<p>
	With chef-partner Frank A. Terranova, associate instructor at Johnson & Wales University in Rhode Island, Sandbach is author of <i>New Paradigm Cooking:  A Tasteful Shift to Healthful Eating </i>(New Paradigm, $18.95).  The chef-RD pair showed their audiences how to gauge the hotness of various chiles while demonstrating recipes and dispelling a few myths about the vegetable.  One myth, Sandbach said, is the idea that a pepper’s heat comes from its seeds.  "Most of that ‘hot’ is in the membrane that holds the seeds to the chile," she explained.
<p>	Also clearing up misconceptions about a nutrient-dense food was soy expert Stephanie Lynch, R.D., who joined chef Mark Buckley in a session titled <i>The Joy of Soy.</i><p>
	Lynch, of the United Soybean Board’s School Lunch Program, described the pilot project, in which some 3,000 pupils tried school lunches that substituted soy protein for some meat in such kid-friendly foods as tacos, chili cheese nachos, submarine sandwiches, hot dogs, chicken sandwiches and chili cheese fries.<p>
	Sixty-seven percent of the youngsters surveyed rated soy-enhanced foods above average in taste, Lynch said.  Better yet, 65 percent of the students ate all the soy-enhanced food they were served.  Another 22
percent ate at least half of their lunch, she added.  And three of four said they would eat the entree again.<p>
	As Buckley demonstrated the use of soy in such recipes as spaghetti sauce and a ranch chicken casserole, Lynch noted the increasing availability of soy products.  "You’ll find soy in things from chicken patties to lunch meats, pizza toppings to beverages," she said.
<p>	"We look at using soy protein as a problem-solver for school-lunch programs, but it’s just as applicable to the home cook," she said.  "For anyone, using soy protein can reduce fat and cholesterol.  And it helps school-lunch directors save money!"<p>
	With all nine essential amino acids, soy is the only vegetable protein whose quality equals the protein in meat or milk, Lynch said.  Soy also is rich in phytochemicals that researchers believe may protect humans against heart disease, osteoporosis and cancers.

<H2>Four Decades After its Application, Food Irradiation is Still a Mystery to the American Public
</H2>

<H3>SAN ANTONIO, October 23, 1996<br>
                    </H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Despite extensive media coverage of recent outbreaks of foodborne illnesses caused by <i>E.coli</i> and <i>Salmonella</i> bacteria, the American public's knowledge and awareness of the role of irradiation technology in ensuring food safety and quality still remain very low, said researchers during sessions at the 79th Annual Meeting & Exhibition of The American Dietetic Association (ADA), at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center (October 21-24).
<p>


"More than four decades after irradiation technology was introduced to enhance the sanitary quality of foods in the U.S., many consumers still have not formed an opinion about irradiation and are seeking additional information," said Christine Bruhn, Ph.D., director of the Center for Consumer Research at the University of California at Davis, during a session titled Food Irradiation: Nutrition, Safety and Education.
<p>	According to Bruhn, recent surveys indicate that 72 percent of consumers have heard of irradiation, although 88 percent of these say they do not know very much about the process and 30 percent think irradiated food is "radioactive."
<p>	Bruhn said that the public's lack of understanding of food irradiation and nuclear science has made it easier for special interest groups to spread misleading information and fear.  "In fact, irradiation of meat and poultry is an important public health measure, just like pasteurization of milk and juices," said Bruhn.
<p>	Irradiation is critical in eliminating disease-causing bacteria in raw or frozen poultry and meat, said Dean Cliver, Ph.D., professor of food safety at the University of California at Davis.
<p>	"Although <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>E.coli</i> bacteria occurring in poultry and meat can readily be killed by thorough cooking, there have been many instances in which cooking was insufficient and people who ate the food became ill.  There is also a risk that these bacteria may cross-contaminate other foods, for example, through unwashed hands and cutting boards," said Cliver.
<p>	Bruhn said that since young children are the most severely affected by microbiological pathogens, there is a moral obligation to increase protection measures.
<p>	Consumer studies consistently demonstrate that when provided with science-based information, a high percentage of consumers are willing to buy and, in fact, prefer irradiated foods.  A recent study conducted at Purdue University, West Lafayette, Ind., showed that about half of a group of 178 people were willing to buy irradiated foods based on previous exposure to information about the process.  After viewing a brief video, subjects demonstrated a significant positive change in knowledge.  And, willingness to buy increased to 90 percent.  Among those who both saw the video and sampled irradiated strawberries, willingness to buy increased to 99 percent.
<p>	"It is imperative that consumers be provided with accurate information so choices can be made based upon facts, not fear and innuendo," said Donald Thayer, Ph.D., research leader for food safety, agricultural research services at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<p>	Thayer, who has conducted extensive studies on the effects of irradiation on nutrients, said food nutrient losses are small and often substantially less than nutrient losses associated with other methods of preservation such as canning, drying and heat pasteurization.  In addition, Thayer pointed out that irradiation may cause some benign changes in food, such as a minor loss of vitamins, identical to changes that happen during cooking, steaming, and pasteurization.  However, he said so far no studies have produced any negative toxicological evidence.

<H2>High-Fat Diet Curbs Childhood Seizures

</H2> 
</TD>

<TD>
<H3>SAN ANTONIO, October 23, 1996                    </H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> When medication fails, a fat laden diet with almost no carbohydrates can dramatically improve the condition of children who have seizures, a dietitian and a pediatric neurologist reported during a session titled <i>The Ketogenic Diet--New Successes for Ancient Therapy,</i> at the 79th Annual Meeting & Exhibition of The American Dietetic Association (ADA), at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center (October 21-24).<p>
	The ketogenic diet mimics the metabolic effects of fasting, known since ancient times to reduce seizures.  To keep the body burning fat instead of stored carbohydrates, the diet is "very high in fat, low in protein, and with almost nonexistent sugar--lots of bacon, butter, mayonnaise, peanut butter," said David B. Sperry, M.D., clinical assistant professor of neurology and pediatrics at Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Tex.<P>
	Burning fat results in ketones, which "causes the brain to become less irritable, so there are fewer seizures," Dr. Sperry explained.<p>
	"This diet has an astonishing success rate," said Karen Amorde-Spalding, R.D. (registered dietitian), pediatric dietitian for the Ketogenic Diet Program at Children’s Hospital, Oakland, Calif.  "In our program, nearly 70 percent of the children placed on the diet experienced significant improvement in seizure control while on reduced or no anti-epileptic drugs."<p>
		Most children who need the ketogenic diet are brain-damaged from accidents, disease or congenital problems.  "In a situation where you have brain damage from accident or meningitis, you will see lots of developmental delays," explained Dr. Sperry.<p>
	Traditionally, medication was used to control the side effects and seizures.  The downside to these medications is lethargy and sleepiness, which the diet relieves.<p>
	Dr. Sperry said this diet "really clears the air" about the child’s condition.  "The brain becomes more susceptible to development as the number of seizures drops," he said.  "All these children become more alert, their personalities improve and a few are even totally seizure-free.  The child will still be brain-damaged, but much more responsive and alert.  Therefore, the children need much less care, and face far fewer dangerous health-related problems."<p>
	The ketogenic diet may sound attractive to the millions of Americans trying to eat less fat at the recommendation of health experts, but this is a therapeutic diet and not for the general, healthy population, Dr. Sperry noted.  "It’s even much more rigorous than a diabetic diet," he said.
 "Patients experience nausea and diarrhea.  These children can not even take a little acetaminophen for a fever.  Any medication with sugar, and these kids cannot have it."<p>
	But that’s no deterrent to the patients’ families.  "This is a unique population.  These families have been to hell and back," Amorde-Spalding said bluntly.  "Most of the children are pretty impaired and haven’t responded to any other therapy.  Many are on multiple drugs, some having toxic effects."<p>
	For these families, devising ways to get their child to eat lots of butter and mayonnaise is a minor challenge compared to the struggles they have faced over the years. "Toddlers and pre-schoolers are the majority of patients on the diet in our program, and they eat with their fingers and love to dip things," she said.  "So you give them a bit of broccoli or a bit of chicken and a mound of butter or mayonnaise.  That’s not always successful with older children, but parents are <i>most </i>clever about devising recipes for quiches or custards or omelets."
<p>	Seeing young patients improve on the ketogenic diet is a great reward.  "Lots of our kids are developmentally delayed," Amorde-Spalding said, "but some of our patients are integrated into regular classrooms.  Some can read; many can do the usual kid things.  Our oldest truly successful patient is 11, and he had horrible behavior problems.  Now, he is much, much better without the drugs.  He’s in school and his whole life has changed."<p>

<H2>Research Finds Folate A Promising Cancer Preventive
</H2> 
</TD>

<TD>
<H3>
SAN ANTONIO, October 22, 1996    </H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> In addition to preventing fetal neural-tube defects (spina bifida), the B vitamin folate "is a very, very promising agent for nutritional chemoprevention of colon cancer," said researcher Joel B. Mason, M.D., during a session at the 79th Annual Meeting & Exhibition of The American Dietetic Association (ADA), at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center (October 21-24).<p>
	"We’re still a few years away from making public health recommendations on folate as preventative," said Dr. Mason, assistant professor of medicine and nutrition at Tufts University and the USDA Human Nutrition Research Center, Medford, Mass.<p>
	Already, however, "colon cancer is probably <i>the</i> human cancer that is most closely tied to diet," he said.  "People who eat a diet with lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, high fiber, and low animal fat, have a low rate of colon cancer. Several studies have shown that folate depletion adversely affects the P-53 gene," which is involved with colon cancer, he added.<p>
	Yet "very, very few people eat enough leafy green vegetables and fruits to offer protection," said Lynn Bailey, Ph.D., R.D. (registered dietitian), professor of food sciences and human nutrition at the University of Florida, Gainesville.  "And fortifying grain products, as the FDA will require food companies to do by January 1998, won’t be enough."<p>
	"Just for prevention of neural-tube defects, women of child-bearing age need 400 micrograms a day," Bailey explained.  "Fortifying grain products will increase consumption by about 100 micrograms, but consumption now is at about 200 micrograms a day."<p>
	Another problem, she said, is that recent changes in the Recommended Daily Allowance of folate reduced the amount from 400 micrograms a day to just 180.  "And that’s just not sufficient," she said.  "So we need to go back and restore that recommendation to the same amount the Public Health Service recommends to reduce the risk of neural-tube defects.  And we need more and better nutrition education to get people eating more folate-rich foods!"<p>
	Orange juice is "a very concentrated source, with about 85 micrograms in an 8-ounce glass," Bailey said.  "The super-fortified breakfast cereals are another good source, but probably 90 percent of breakfast cereals have only 100 micrograms of folate per serving."
<p>	Broccoli, asparagus, brussels sprouts, spinach, and many types of beans are good sources of folate.  "But folate is water-soluble, so some of it is leached out during cooking," Bailey noted.  Raw fruits, including strawberries and cantaloupe, are good sources, and "whole grains are richer than refined grains," she said.
<p>	Bailey said she is optimistic about improving Americans’ health through greater folate consumption, including the hike that will take place when more grain products are fortified with folate.  "It [fortification] worked for pellagra, it worked for beri beri," she said.  "Adding thiamin and niacin to grain products had a great impact on this nation’s health."
<p>	Mason noted that though a relationship between folate and colon cancer is evident, it is not yet completely understood.  "There are other nutrients that look promising, too," he said.  "Calcium, vitamin D, fish oil and selenium are all under intense investigation now."

<H2>Surveys Show American Consumers Support the Use of Biotechnology in Agriculture and Food Production
</H2> 
</TD>

<TD>
<H3>SAN ANTONIO, October 22, 1996</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Studies in the past five years consistently show that most American consumers support the use of biotechnology in agriculture and food production, said researchers during sessions at the 79th Annual Meeting & Exhibition of The American Dietetic Association (ADA), at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center (October 21-24).<p>
	"Consumers have a positive view on the use of biotechnology and accept biotech-produced foods when they recognize personal or societal benefits,” said Thomas Hoban, Ph.D., associate professor and extension sociology specialist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  From 1992 to 1995, Hoban conducted telephone surveys for the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Grocery Manufacturers of America to gauge public reaction to biotech-produced foods.<p>
	During the 1995 survey, about 80 percent of the respondents said the use of biotechnology would be acceptable if the goal is to lower the fat content of foods.  Three quarters found biotechnology acceptable if used to grow foods that taste better, stay fresh longer, and include substances that may help prevent diseases.<p>
	Using the introduction of bovine somatotropin (BST) in 1994 as an example, Hobin said that despite an organized activist campaign, milk consumption was not affected by the introduction of this naturally-occurring hormone produced through biotechnology.  BST increases milk production by an average of 10 to 20 percent when administered to dairy cows.<p>
	"This successful marketing experience shows that food biotechnology has not been an issue for the vast majority of people.  Most people prefer to focus on what is important to them - characteristics of the product, rather than the process used to produce the food," said Hoban.
<p>	While consumers’ acceptance levels are high, Hoban said survey results also indicate that public awareness of biotechnology remains relatively low.  Most people indicate a willingness to learn more about biotechnology.<p>
	"Consumers want to know why biotechnology is used, as well as its safety and benefits.  Providing factual and credible information increases public acceptance," Hoban added.  When asked to rate the credibility of the different information sources, Hoban said that American consumers reported the most trust in independent health and scientific experts.<p>
	Hoban presented these survey results in a session called <i>Understanding Biotechnology and Its Application to Foods. </i>Other presenters in this session included:<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Mark Messina, Ph.D., former program director at the National Cancer Institute, now a nutrition consultant and co-author of The Dietitian’s Guide to Vegetarian Diets.  Messina discussed how biotechnology has enhanced the nutritional contents of soybean products.
<p><img src="gifs/marker2.gif">  Subtach Gupta, Ph.D., biotechnologist at USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services, explained the science behind biotechnology and highlighted the role of U.S. regulatory agencies in formulating polices governing the use of biotechnology.

<H2> A Low-Fat Eating Plan:  Favorable Tool in Blood Cholesterol Control, but Not a Panacea for Everyone

</H2>
</td>

<H3>SAN ANTONIO, October 21, 1996</H3>

<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> It is commonly recognized that reducing intake of total fat and saturated fat, primarily found in animal food products, can lessen the risks of heart disease. 
However, an eating plan that is low in saturated fat but relatively high in total fat derived from monounsaturated fat, found in olives, olive oil, canola oil and hazelnuts, can for the most part elicit the same result, said researchers during a session at the 79th Annual Meeting & Exhibition of The American Dietetic Association (ADA), at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center (October 21-24).
<p>	"Current dietary recommendations focus on lowering total fat intake to 30 percent of calories or less and saturated fat to eight to 10 percent.  Studies in the past have consistently shown that this type of low-fat eating style is effective in lowering the body’s total blood cholesterol level," said Penny Kris-Etherton, Ph.D., R.D. (registered dietitian), professor of nutrition at The Pennsylvania State University and a principal investigator of the Diet Effects on Lipoproteins and Thrombogenic Activity (DELTA) study.  Its aim was to find the optimal dietary replacement for saturated fat, the key nutrient that should be reduced to prevent coronary heart disease.
<p>	However, Kris-Etherton pointed out that a low-fat eating style may not be ideal for everybody.  "An eating plan rich in carbohydrates, but low in total fat and saturated fat has the potential to increase triglycerides (fat in the blood stream) and lower ‘the good cholesterol’ level--also known as HDL.  HDL carries the cholesterol away from the body tissue and returns it to the liver for recycling.  For those individuals who want to maintain a healthy body weight, and those who have low HDL or high insulin levels, our research indicates that this type of low-fat eating plan may aggravate their metabolic abnormalities and increase risk for coronary heart disease," she added.
<p>	During Protocol I of the DELTA study, researchers recruited 103 healthy adults--46 males and 57 females--ranging in age from 22 to 67 years.  They included 26 African Americans, 18 post-menopausal women and 16 men older than 40 years.  During Protocol II, researchers selected subjects who were deemed to be at risk for potential negative effects of a low-fat eating style.
<p>	"The large sample size of this landmark study enabled us to simultaneously obtain results in African Americans, in pre- and post-menopausal women and in younger and older men," explained Wahida Karmally, R.D., director of nutrition at Columbia University’s Irving Center for Clinical Research, New York City.
<p>	In one experiment, Karmally and her co-researchers examined the effects of three eating plans that differ in total fat and fat composition. The three eating plans were:<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> an average American style, with 37 percent of a day’s calories coming from fat--16 percent being saturated fat;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> The American Heart Association (AHA) recommended plan, which calls for no more than 30 percent of daily total caloric intake from fat, with less than 10 percent from saturated fat;<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> a low-fat eating program with 26 percent of daily calories from fat--five percent saturated fat.<P>
	In the second experiment, researchers studied a new eating plan--a high-fat, low saturated fat program, which consisted of 37 percent of the day’s calories from fat, nine percent from saturated fat and 28 percent from monounsaturated fat.<p>
	"The results from both experiments confirm that a low saturated fat eating style reduces total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)--the bad cholesterol that transports cholesterol to the cells and causes excess plaque to accumulate in the arteries," said Kris-Etherton.  At the same time, the study also indicates that a relatively high level of total fat intake achieved by replacing saturated fat with monounsaturated fat is equally effective in combating high blood cholesterol levels, especially for people with metabolic abnormalities.
<P>	"The key message we get from this study is that health professionals cannot recommend one single eating plan for everybody.  We have to individualize eating plans based on each individual’s physical condition so that optimal results can be achieved in controlling total blood cholesterol levels," Karmally said.<p>
	The DELTA study, sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, was conducted at Columbia University, Louisiana State University, The Pennsylvania State University, University of Minnesota and the University of North Carolina.<p>

<H2>Alcohol's Role in Weight Management Stimulates Research Interest</H2>

<h3>SAN ANTONIO, October 21, 1996<br>

<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">
Perhaps people who believe they have developed a beer belly from drinking too much alcohol should reconsider their assumption.  Researchers say the keg around their middle may not be caused by alcohol and studies show that the chronic consumption of substantial amounts of alcohol is not associated with expected levels of weight gain.<p>
	"If alcohol evokes dietary energy compensation like other types of foods, we might expect some displacement of alcohol by foods or foods by alcohol.  However, clinical research indicates that replacing dietary carbohydrates with alcohol causes body weight loss, and adding a moderate amount of alcohol to an adequate diet causes little weight gain," said Richard Mattes, Ph.D., R.D. (registered dietitian), associate professor at Purdue University, West Lafayette, Ind., during a session titled <i>The Positive, Negative and the Unknown Nutritional Implications of Alcohol Ingestion </i>at the 79th Annual Meeting & Exhibition of The American Dietetic
Association (ADA), at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center (October 21-24).  He added, epidemiological studies indicate that light to moderate drinkers weigh the same or less than those who abstain.<p>
	"Alcohol contributes to about five percent of U.S. per capita energy consumption.  This macronutrient can account for 50 percent of the energy in the diets of alcoholics.  However, we still don’t know how the energy in alcohol is utilized.  During metabolism of alcohol, is energy from alcohol wasted or discarded in some manner that leaves it undetected or uncompensated?" Mattes continued, noting the need for more research in this area.<p>
	Charles Lieber, M.D., section chief of Liver Disease and Nutrition, Alcohol Research and Treatment Center at Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center, The Bronx, N. Y., attributed this energy deficit in alcoholics possibly to damaged liver and the consequential inefficient energy utilization of fat as well as other nutrients.  Moreover, Dr. Lieber said it can be a type of enzyme in the liver--hepatic microsomal enzymes--that increase metabolic rates and oxidize alcohol without associated chemical energy production.
<p>	Despite the fact that alcohol may not contribute to weight gain, Dr. Lieber said that restricting alcohol consumption is still sound advice for weight watchers.  "For social drinkers--two drinks a day for men and one for women--there is no evidence that a significant energy wastage occurs.  Alcohol is apparently utilized efficiently."
<p>	Dr. Lieber also said that in the treatment of alcoholism, an eating plan rich in carbohydrates to help alleviate the impairment of energy utilization from dietary fat may be beneficial.

<H2>For Older Adults, Flavored Foods Add Life to Their Years

<TD>
<H3>SAN ANTONIO,  October 21, 1996</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Special eating plans rich in a variety of flavors and textures may counteract age-related taste and smell losses in elderly persons, improve their digestive processes and elevate their immune status, said researchers during a session at the 79th Annual Meeting & Exhibition of The American Dietetic Association (ADA), at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center (October 21-24).<p>

	"Presently, the number of people age 65 years and older in the U.S. is more than 54 million.  A large segment of this population has age-related sensory losses, which must be compensated for if they are to remain healthy," said Susan Schiffman, Ph.D., Duke University, Durham, N.C.<P>
	On average, people start to experience sensory losses in their mid-50s, according to Schiffman. The losses become more pronounced when they reach the age of 60 or 70.  Studies show that taste detection and recognition thresholds in healthy older people for sweet, sour, salty and bitter tend to be 2.5 times higher than those in younger adults.  Losses are far greater in older adults with sicknesses.  For smell perception, detection thresholds in the elderly are 11 times higher than those in younger adults.
<p>	Schiffman said these sensory losses not only arise from normal aging, but also from diseases and certain medications, such as antirheumatic and antiproliferative drugs.
<p>	"Decreases in taste and smell can be very troublesome for the elderly because they can reduce the quality of life, impair food intake and lead to inadequate nutrition, especially in the sick," said Schiffman.
<p>	Schiffman said sensory systems of taste and smell have closer anatomical connections to the neural pathways involved in digestion than the other senses.  Therefore, enhancing the flavors of foods and beverages can generate salivary and gastric acid, which in turn will boost the digestive process and may increase food intake, Schiffman added.
<p>	Moreover, special eating programs for persons with cancer, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other age-related illnesses that account for sensory losses of these groups are more successful in meeting nutritional needs than programs that ignore sensory factors.

<H2><i>Haute Cuisine</i> in Outer Space? Astronaut Says Food's Fine Up There
</H2>

<TD>
<H3>SAN ANTONIO, October 21, 1996
</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">Here’s your chance to ask an astronaut what you <i>really</i> want to know about space travel.
<p>


What’s it like to chow down in orbit?<p>
	"I think the food is great--but of course, I’m a bachelor," deadpanned Martin J. Fettman, Ph.D., D.V.M., during a session titled <i>Applications of Space Flight Research</i> to Human Health at the 79th Annual Meeting & Exhibition of The American Dietetic Association (ADA), at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center (October 21-24).<p>
	Fettman, a veterinary pathologist who spent two weeks on the space shuttle Columbia in 1993, praised NASA’s provisions for keeping astronauts well fed.  He chatted with astronaut Shannon Lucid shortly before she returned from six months in space, "and she seemed pretty happy," Fettman said. "She got some of her favorite foods.  But she <i>has</i> asked repeatedly for Twinkies," he added with a laugh.<p>
	Lucid also asked for (and got) Jell-O and M&M’s, said Helen W. Lane, Ph.D., R.D. (registered dietitian), chief scientist in the medical science division at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.  In addition to the occasional indulgence of comfort foods, Lane said, astronauts’ nutritional needs include, surprisingly, the same number of calories they need on earth.<p>
	"You’d think if they’re floating, they wouldn’t use as much energy or burn as many calories," Lane said.  "But, probably due to stress, they need just as much.  Also probably stress-related is their need for more protein.  Bone loss is accelerated in space, so they need extra calcium.  And since there’s no sunlight to activate vitamin D, we have to supplement that."<p>
	Astronaut cuisine has improved dramatically since early missions, when astronauts ate bite-size cubes of pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables from collapsible metal tubes, said research dietitian Barbara L. Rice, R.D., of Krug Life Sciences at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.<p>
	What never changes is the need for careful organization, both to ensure optimal nutrition and to manage limited weight and space efficiently.  "All the astronauts’ food has to be planned because we need special packaging, and vigorous attention to safety, sanitation and the various shelf lives of different things," Rice said.<p>
	Mission menus are most often freeze-dried, irradiated, vacuum-packed and/or dehydrated foods, including military MREs (meals ready to eat). Surprisingly, "about 90 percent of what flies is common, ordinary foods," Rice said.  "The goal of the shuttle program has been to take foods and packaging that are already in use.  Many things come from commercial companies, although maybe not in the standard packaging."<p>
	"Space flight is pretty hard on packaging," she explained.  "Take canned pudding, for example, you have to overwrap so that if it’s crushed, it won’t mess up the whole package--and the whole meal."<p>
	Of the foods popularly thought of as "space food," Rice said, "not many are up there after all.  That freeze-dried ice cream you see--I don’t think that ever flew," she said.  "You don’t fly things that are crumbly."  As for the blast from the past, space food sticks, "I remember them, I think,"  she said.  "But sticks do not fly."<p>
	Some fresh foods go along on each mission, "but it’s like camping," Fettman said.  "You can take some fresh stuff, but pretty soon it’s gone.  And even your favorite Danish, at the end of two weeks, is not as fresh as you’d want it to be."<p>
	The shrimp cocktail, he remembers fondly, was "as good as anything on earth--once you put water on it and it got plumped up."  Vacuum-packed irradiated steaks were great too, he said--although most astronauts’ appetites drop during the first day or two of weightlessness.  "It’s pretty weird when your stomach’s floating against your diaphragm," he said.<p>
	Interestingly, nutritional supplements are used only rarely, Rice said, "because if there’s any motion sickness, the last thing you want to do is swallow a pill."  Astronauts do need reminders to drink enough water, Lane added, "because they don’t get as thirsty.  And they’re not getting the fluid you normally would from many foods."<p>
	During preparation for a mission, "a dietitian works with the astronauts," Rice said. "We invite them [astronauts] to our lab and have a tasting of all the available foods, prepared as served in flight."  Sample menus are based on the astronauts comments’.  Sometimes they ask for another round of samples, or else they just ask the dietitian to go ahead and plan their daily meals.<p>
	Rice added that Fettman "was one of our very best subjects, because of his background in nutrition."  Fettman liked the tortillas, crackers, cereals and pretzels that constitute an astronaut’s grain intake.  His only special request came as no surprise:  more fresh fruits and vegetables.<p>

<H2>Vegetarians Need to Identify Calcium-Rich Foods to Lower the Risk of Osteoporosis

</H2> 
</TD>

<TD>
<H3>SAN ANTONIO, October 21, 1996           </H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> With vegetarianism becoming increasingly popular among Americans, researchers warn that vegans--those who exclude all animal and dairy products in their eating plans--may be at risk of not meeting their calcium needs, especially teenage vegans during their rapid growth years.
 
<p>

	"Obtaining sufficient amounts of absorbable dietary calcium is a protective measure to lower the risk of osteoporosis," said Connie Weaver, Ph.D., chair of the department of foods and nutrition, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Ind., during a session titled<i> Meeting Calcium Needs on Plant-based Diets</i> at the 79th Annual Meeting & Exhibition of The American Dietetic Association (ADA), at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center (October 21-24).<p>
	Weaver said osteoporosis, a disease that deteriorates bones and leads to fractures, affects 25 million people in the U.S., 80 percent of whom are women.  The cost to society has been estimated at $7 billion to $10 billion a year.<p>
	Robert Heaney, M.D., professor at Creighton University, Omaha, Neb., said vegans may have reduced calcium needs because of their moderate protein intake.  However, food components like phytate and oxalate contained in many plant foods, can sometimes substantially reduce the availability of the calcium in these sources.  Also, to some extent, caffeine and fiber can both reduce the body’s calcium absorption.  Therefore, based on the current knowledge, it is sometimes difficult to build a fully adequate calcium intake only from the generally available plant-based foods.  Some calcium-added products like calcium-set tofu or calcium-fortified fruit juices are helpful.<p>
	Mark Messina, Ph.D., former program director at the National Cancer Institute, now a nutrition consultant and co-author of <i>The Dietitian’s Guide to Vegetarian Diets,</i> said some vegans may be misled by the fact that plant-based diets are associated worldwide with lower osteoporosis rates. Messina pointed out that it is important to take into account the role of total lifestyle in supporting bone health.<p>
	"Populations in agrarian societies in developing countries may consume low-sodium diets and be much more physically active than Western vegans.  They may also have more sun exposure and, therefore, higher blood levels of vitamin D.  Consequently, Western vegans will have higher calcium needs than people in other parts of the world, although Western vegans’ calcium needs are likely to be lower than those of Western omnivores because of their more moderate protein intake," said Messina.<p>
	However, Messina said that vegans can achieve adequate calcium intake from plant foods with planning.  He advised vegans to follow the recommended daily allowances for calcium on food labels by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Apart from that, Messina also suggested that vegans consider eating foods rich in calcium, such as almonds, figs, broccoli, calcium fortified-soy and rice milk, kale and collards; getting adequate sun exposure or using vitamin D-fortified foods; and avoiding excess intake of salt.
<p>	Dr. Heaney stressed exercise as a strong stimulant for bone mass accumulation, indirectly increasing the efficiency of calcium absorption and conservation, and thereby lowering the body’s calcium requirement.<p>

<H2>ADA Calls on Parents to Set Heathful Eating and Active Lifestyle Role Models for Children </H2> </TD><TD>
<B>CHICAGO, August 22, 1996</B>
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> New school supplies, clothes and shoes.
<p>
It must be back-to-school time.  To help children start the school year right, The American Dietetic Association (ADA) is appealing to adults to be positive role models for healthful eating and active lifestyles.
<p>
“Everyday actions of parents and caregivers can make a great impact on the health and well-being of youngsters,” says Doris Derelian, Ph.D., R.D. (registered dietitian), immediate past-president of ADA and co-chair of the association’s Child Nutrition and Health Campaign.  “Children often do what they see.  So, if mom and dad are careful to take time out for physical activity and not to skip meals, their children are more likely to develop the same habits.”
<p>
ADA is urging parents and caregivers to make sure children start the day with breakfast.  “Research shows hungry children can’t do their best work and that breakfast actually helps children do better in the classroom and on the playground,” Derelian says.  
<p>
Early evidence shows skipping breakfast affects the way the brain works and can diminish school performance, especially in children who are at nutritional risk, according to ADA.
<p>
“Breakfast time doesn’t have to be a chore -- it can be a fun time to hear everyone’s plans for the day ahead, get quizzed for that day’s spelling test, or reminisce about the good time you had on summer vacation,” Derelian says.  “A child who grows up watching adults eat breakfast will be more likely to carry the habit into their teen years and on through adulthood.”
<p>
<b>Tips on making breakfast easy</b>
<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Stock a “breakfast bar” that includes several kinds of ready-to-eat cereals, raisins, fruit, juice, milk, yogurt and breads.  Kids will enjoy preparing their own breakfast just like the adults.
<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Encourage children to help plan a breakfast menu each week that includes a variety of healthful and fun foods—take a break from the ordinary and try some not-so-traditional breakfast foods.  It’s not what you eat, but when you eat that makes it breakfast.
<p>
It’s also important to set an example for kids by making physical activity a part of everyday life, Derelian adds.  Physical activity offers a long list of benefits:  increased stamina and energy, improved motor coordination, strength, dexterity, balance, flexibility, and increased self-esteem, according to ADA.  
<p>
Participation in organized activities can also teach valuable lessons about discipline and sportsmanship.  “Volunteering with children for after-school programs,
clubs and teams that promote physical fitness is a great idea,” Derelian says
“Remember to always be positive—talk about the days you do exercise, rather than the days you miss, and encourage participation, not just performance,” Derelian stresses.
<p>
<b>Tips for fun fitness</b><p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">  make walking the dog a family outing<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">  let kids wash the family car or minivan<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">  walk or bike to the store;  park away from the mall and walk<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">  hold birthday parties at a skating rink or bowling alley<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">  let kids keep a family fitness calendar<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">  plan family fitness outings at least once a week<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">  plan active indoor activities

<H2>More Schools Offer Meal Vital To School Performance
</H2> </TD><TD>
<B>CHICAGO, August 22, 1996</B>
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Breakfast meal counts on the rise
<p>
As school bells ring in the start of a new year, The American Dietetic Association (ADA) encourages more children to fuel their bodies and minds with breakfast each day.  The association points to research showing that children increasingly have access to a nutritious breakfast at school.<p>
	A recent survey of the nation’s 100 largest school food service operations, conducted by <i>FoodService Director</i> (a leading trade publication), indicates that schools are serving more breakfast meals.  Nationwide, the number of breakfasts served grew in all areas of the country, and accounted for approximately 21 percent of all school meals.<p>
	According to ADA, children who eat breakfast perform better in school through increased problem-solving ability, memory, verbal fluency and creativity.  Additionally, ADA says school breakfast programs reduce tardiness and absenteeism, particularly for those students nutritionally at risk.<p>
	“There are two ways breakfast affects learning.  One involves physical changes to a child’s body as their overnight fast continues, the other is the
impact the nutrients supplied through a healthful morning meal can make to a child’s overall nutritional status,” according to Sheah Rarback, R.D. (registered dietitian), director of nutrition at The Mailman Center for Child Development and assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Miami Medical School, Miami, Fla.  “Breakfast is an essential meal, especially for growing children.”<p>
	School food service directors and educators have long known that the morning meal provides children with the nutrition to start the day off right,  according to Sandra Baxter, R.D., nutrition educator for the Bryan Independent School District, Bryan, Texas, and member of ADA’s School Nutrition Services dietetic practice group.<p>
 	“We wouldn’t attempt to drive a car for long distances when the fuel gauge reads empty, so why should we expect children to be at peak performance without fueling their bodies,” said Baxter.  “It’s important that nutrition education in schools be tied to the breakfast table, not just the lunchroom.”<p>
	Increasingly, schools are testing innovative ideas to encourage students to eat breakfast.  “In our elementary schools, we work closely with classroom teachers to introduce a variety of foods and allow children to touch, taste, and sample them before they might appear in the cafeteria.  Once children are familiar with new foods, they are more likely to try them for breakfast, “ Baxter added.<p>

	As part of ADA’s Child Nutrition and Health Campaign, the nation’s dietitians urge parents and caregivers to make sure children start their day with a healthful breakfast.  “Breakfast doesn’t have to be traditional, routine or boring.  What’s important is that children start their day well nourished, whether eating cereal and milk at home, a bagel and fruit on the school bus, or a great meal in the school cafeteria,” Rarback says.<p>
	With nearly 70,000 members, the Chicago-based American Dietetic Association is the world’s largest food and nutrition organization.  ADA serves the public through the promotion of optimal nutrition, health and well-being.

<H2>Nutrition Guidance for Child and Adolescent Athletes</H2>
</TD>
<TD>
<H3>CHICAGO, June 14, 1996</H3><P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Nutrition Guidance for Child and Adolescent Athletes Addressed
by the American Dietetic Association<br>
<p>
Nutrition needs of both child (ages 6 -12) and adolescent (ages 13 -18) athletes are addressed in
two new statements from The American Dietetic Association (ADA) published in the June issue of
the  Journal of the American Dietetic Association.  <p>
	Both papers support sound nutrition practices that promote children's and young adults'
optimal growth while meeting the added requirements of physical activity through participation in
organized sport(s).  Key points outlined in these statements include:
<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">  Plain water is the best and most economical source of fluid for
young athletes, who often do not tolerate temperature extremes as well as adults.  Diluted fruit
drinks or sports drinks can also be appropriate fluid choices, and younger children may be more
likely to drink sufficient amounts of fluids if they are flavored.
<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">  Although vitamin and mineral supplementation may improve the
nutritional status of persons consuming marginal amounts of nutrients from foods, and may
improve performance in persons with nutrient deficiences, no scientific evidence supports the
general use of supplements to improve athletic performance; nor do scientific data support the
use of other ergogenic substances, such as amino acids, protein mixtures, and chromium.
<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">  Percent body fat and weight should not be used as criteria for
sports participation or to set stringent weight requirements for individual sports.
<p>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif">  Eating plans for all healthy children should emphasize intake of
complex carbohyrdates and moderate amounts of fat to support growth and physical activity.
Adolescent athletes, as well as non-athletes,  have increased risks of iron deficiencies and lower
calcium intakes.
<p>
	"The nutrition needs of child and adolescent athletes do not directly mirror those of adults.
Parents, coaches and teachers should encourage healthful food choices whether a child is
involved in simple exercise, training or advanced competition," said Ronni Chernoff, Ph.D., R.D.,
FADA, president of ADA.  <p>
	As part of ADA's Child Nutrition & Health Campaign, ADA members encourage adults to
be nutrition and activity role models for children."Children should get moving for the fun of it, and
be encouraged to start the day with a healthful breakfast to fuel their bodies and minds," Chernoff
added.<p>
	A special Child Nutrition & Health Campaign fact sheet is available free of charge to
parents, coaches, teachers or others concerned with the nutritional health of children.  To obtain a

<H2>ADA Offers Americans Tips on Putting Revised Dietary Guidelines into Practice
</H2> 
</TD>

<TD>
<H3>CHICAGO, January 2, 1996</H3>
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> The nation’s largest organization of food and nutrition professionals today endorsed the just released Dietary Guidelines for Americans, Fourth Edition, and offered suggestions for putting the guidelines into practice.
<p>
	“This is a great opportunity for nutrition and health professionals to show people just how easy it is to make good nutrition choices,” said Doris Derelian, Ph.D., R.D. (registered dietitian), president of the 66,500-member American Dietetic Association.  “The Dietary Guidelines are the bottom line--the cornerstone for the recommendations made by health and nutrition professionals.  We commend the government for providing such a valuable tool.”<p>
	From the ADA, here are some day-to-day applications of the revised Dietary Guidelines for Americans:<br>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Eat  a variety of foods.  Incorporate new foods into your eating plan. At the supermarket, buy one new fruit and vegetable each week. At home, try one new recipe or prepared food a week.  Keep in mind that you don’t need to give up favorite foods to enjoy healthful eating.  Balance a variety of selections from all food groups over the course of a day and week.<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Balance the food you eat with physical activity; maintain or improve your weight.  Gradual changes go a long way toward healthy, life-long habits.  So when adding physical activity to your routine or working toward healthy body weight, start with small steps.  For example, take stairs instead of the elevator.  If healthy body weight is your goal, pay special attention to portion sizes.  You might be surprised to learn that the bowl of cereal you had this morning actually adds up to three or four servings.
<P>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol.  Again, make small changes you can live with.  One easy step is to choose foods in the same food category with less fat.
For example, don’t give up milk because of the fat content.  Instead drink two-percent,
low-fat or skim milk.  And remember, the guideline is for your total diet, not individual foods.  Foods with higher and lower amounts of fat should balance each other as part of a healthful eating plan.<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Choose a diet with plenty of grain products, vegetables and fruits.  Think of your plate as a pie.  Seventy-five percent of the pie should be made up of fruits, vegetables and grains,  25 percent of other foods such as dairy products or protein foods.<p>
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> Choose a diet moderate in sugars, in salt and sodium.  These are the ‘extras’ that can liven up your diet, but should be added to foods in moderation.  Keep in mind that sugars and sodium are found in a variety of foods from the food groups.  So, get to know the Food Guide Pyramid and use the Nutrition Facts panel on food labels.<p>
	The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, as well as tools such as the Food Guide Pyramid and Nutrition Facts food label, play a vital role in helping the public apply nutrition science to everyday food practice, according to ADA.  The association pointed out, however, that the guidelines are population-based, and are not a general prescription for each and every person.<p>
	“The guidelines are a set of instructions on which to base food and nutrition decisions once individual needs are determined,” Derelian said.  “For example, if someone has a family history of premature heart disease, that person should probably pay particular attention to the guideline stating ‘choose a diet low in fat, saturated fat and cholesterol."<p>
	If you have questions about the Dietary Guidelines for Americans or other food and nutrition issues, call ADA’s Consumer Nutrition Hot Line at 800/366-1655 to <a href="finddiet.html">locate a registered dietitian</a> in your area or to listen to recorded messages.  Recorded messages are available from 8 am to 8 pm Central Time.  Referrals to RDs are available from 9 am to 4 pm Central Time.  For customized answers to your food and nutrition questions, dial 900/CALL-AN-RD or 900/225-5267 from 9 am to 4 pm Central Time.

<h2>Food Still Is The Best Strategy To Improved Health</H2><P>

<H3>CHICAGO, January 9, 1996</h3> 
<img src="gifs/marker2.gif"> The American Dietetic Association (ADA)</B> said today
that eating a wide variety of foods is the best way to obtain essential
nutrients.  While recognizing the sincere interest of supplement users in promoting good health, ADA cautions against vitamin and mineral
supplementation as a complete nutrition strategy.
<P>
 ADA&#039;s position, published in the January issue of <i>The Journal of the
American Dietetic Association,</i> acknowledges supplementation may be one way to help some Americans stay healthy and avoid certain illnesses, but says additional scientific research on the safety and effectiveness of many vitamin and mineral supplements is still required.  In addition, ADA suggests that fortification of foods and revision of recommended nutrient intakes may improve the nation's nutritional health.
<P>
Approximately 3,400 different vitamin and mineral products are available to consumers and $4 billion is spent annually on supplemental vitamin and mineral purchases.  For those who choose to use supplements, ADA strongly recommends taking low levels of nutrients that do not exceed the recommended daily allowance (RDA).  ADA also actively supports revising the RDAs when new research expands existing nutrition information to warrant changes in current levels.
<P>
<H3>Food Irradiation Can Enhance Safety of Nation&#039;s Food Supply</H3>
<P>
The American Dietetic Association (ADA) said today that food irradiation is one way to enhance the safety and quality of the food supply in the United States.  Estimates place the number of cases of foodborne illnesses that occur domestically between 6.5 to 33 million; about 9,000 of these resulting in death.
<P>
ADA acknowledges that many consumers are not familiar with food
irradiation or the dangers of foodborne illnesses from pathogens,
mishandling and improper cooking techniques.  In it&#039;s most recent position, published in the January issue of <i>The Journal of the American Dietetic Association, </i>the association encourages the government, food manufacturers, food commodity groups and dietetics professionals to continue working together to educate consumers about this technology and food safety.
<P>
Despite repeated endorsements and regulatory approval, irradiated foods are not widely available in the United States.  Worldwide, 38 countries permit food irradiation, and in Europe more than 28 billion pounds of food is irradiated annually.
<P>
ADA cautions that food irradiation does not replace proper food handling.
<P>
And, the association concludes that irradiation cannot enhance the quality of food that is not fresh, or prevent contamination that occurs after irradiation during storage or preparation.
<P>
With more than 66,500 members, the Chicago-based American Dietetic Association is the world&#039;s largest organization of food and nutrition professionals.  ADA serves the public by promoting optimal nutrition, health and well-being.
<P>
<i>The Journal of the American Dietetic Association </i>is the most widely-read, peer-reviewed periodical in the dietetics field.  Published monthly, it brings original research, critical reviews and reports, authoritative information and expert commentary to nutrition and dietetics professionals throughout the world.

New Study Says Intervention to Reduce Coronary Heart Disease Would 
Save Billions of Dollars</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>

<h3>CHICAGO,  February 8, 1996</h3>
<P><IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> Poor nutritional habits cost Americans health and wealth
<p>
Tens of thousands of cases of coronary heart 
disease could be prevented and billions of dollars in related costs could be 
saved through interventions to help Americans reduce intake of saturated 
fat, according to a study published in February 1996 in <em>The Journal of the American 
Dietetic Association </em>(JADA).<p>
     The Economic analysis used data from a variety of sources, including 
the Framingham Heart Study and National Health and Nutrition Examination 
Surveys, to estimate the effects of intervention on CHD incidence.  In 
addition, it analyzed the cost savings associated with reducing saturated 
fat intake by as little as one to three percentage points of the total diet.
     The study found that if Americans reduced saturated fat intake from 
current levels to nine percent of total energy, about 100,000 first-time 
coronary events could be averted by the year 2005, with associated cost 
savings of approximately $13 billion.<p>
     "For years, public and private health and medical organizations have 
recommended that American follow a low-fat, low-calorie diet as part of a
healthful lifestyle," said David Thompson, Ph.D., senior economist at Policy 
Analysis, Inc., Brookline, Mass., and co-author of the JADA study.  "But the 
nutrition community and policy makers have had a difficult time translating 
the health benefits of low-fat eating into economic benefits for 
individuals, insurers, and society as a whole."<p>
     The study determined CHD risk for population subgroups defined 
according to age, gender, and cholesterol levels.  It also reviewed 
estimates of annual medical care expenditures and earnings losses associated 
with alternative manifestations of CHD, such as sudden death and myocardial 
infarction.  The study used existing scientific data on benefits of 
cholesterol reduction and updated earlier disease costs estimates from 1980 
to 1993 levels, using the medical care component of the Consumer Price 
Index.<p>
     Based on these figures the authors conclude that, in the absence of 
direct intervention to reduce coronary risk factors--such as high levels 
of saturated fat intake--three million Americans between the ages of 35 
and 64 years of age who are currently free of CHD, will develop the disease 
in the next ten years.<p>
     "Our cost-savings figures probably underestimate the full economic 
benefits of reducing dietary fat intake," said Thompson.  "Our figures 
relate only to adults who are currently disease free, and we focused 
attention on coronary heart disease--even though reducing fat intake has 
been linked to reductions in the incidence of certain cancers as well."<p>
     "We know that patients are more successful in achieving desired diet 
goals and improving their health when they have interaction with, and 
guidance from, registered dietitians," said Doris Derelian, Ph.D., R.D., 
president of the 67,400-member ADA.  "This study is important because it 
demonstrates what many health professional have known for years, that interventions like 
comprehensive nutrition services are cost-effective forms of disease 
prevention and treatment."<p>
     In more than 2,400 patient case studies, representative of various 
disease states and conditions, ADA has demonstrated that nutrition 
intervention involving a registered dietitian saves, on average, $8,000 per 
patient.  And, a growing body of scientific research suggests that dietary 
intervention, often thousands of dollars cheaper that high-tech surgeries 
and treatments, can prevent the manifestation of nutrition-related diseases.
     <em>The Journal of the American Dietetic Association </em>is the most widely 
read, peer-reviewed periodical in the dietetics field.  Published monthly, 
it brings original research, critical reviews and reports, authoritative 
information and expert commentary to nutrition and other medical 
professionals throughout the world.<p>

Support for Medical Nutrition Therapy, Health Care Reform Addressed by Congressman Gutierrez</H2> </TD><TD>
<P><BR><BR>

<H3>CHICAGO, August 21, 1996</H3><P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> First co-sponsor of H.R. 2247 speaks at ADA Headquarters in Chicago
<p>
U.S. Congressman Luis Gutierrez (D-IL)
 discussed health care reform and his support of H.R. 2247 --
the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1995, which would provide
Medicare coverage of medical nutrition therapy as an outpatient
service, with employees of The American Dietetic Association (ADA).
<P>
 The first co-sponsor of the bill that was introduced by Rep Jose
Serrano (D-N.Y.), Gutierrez said medical nutrition therapy can
save health care costs by speeding recovery and reducing the incidence
of medical complications, resulting in fewer hospitalizations,
shorter hospital stays and reduced drug, surgery and treatment
needs. 
<P>
He spoke August 19 at ADA's Chicago headquarters.  While there,
he also received the Outstanding Legilator of the Year award from
members of the Chicago Dietetic Association.
<P>
An analysis of nearly 2,400 case studies by the association shows
that on average, more than $8,000 per patient can be saved with the intervention
of medical nutrition therapy.   It is proven to be medically necessary
and cost effective in treating and controlling many diseases and
medical conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, kidney disease,
burns and AIDS, according to ADA.
<P>
Medical nutrition therapy includes the assessment of a patient's
nutritional status followed by appropriate therapy, which can
range from diet modifications to the administration of specialized
treatment methods such as intravenous or tube feedings.
<P>
"The change that the Medical Nutrition Therapy Act advocates
is not complex," Gutierrez said.  "It's a simple, logical
and pragmatic solution to a real problem.  And it's a solution
that would have real benefits for real people."
<P>
"There is no consistent policy for covering the costs of
medical nutrition therapy, which has been recognized by medical
professionals as a key factor in improving a patient's health
or speeding recovery," said ADA President Ronni Chernoff,
Ph.D., R.D. (registered dietitian). 
<P>
While prescribed medical nutritional products are reimbursed
in inpatient settings, a dietitian's services are not.  In outpatients
settings, Medicare and some Medicaid programs cover physician-prescribed
medical nutrition therapy as part of home care therapy benefits.
 However, a professional dietitian's services are not covered
as a reimbursable expense.
<P>
H.R. 2247 specifies coverage of medical nutrition therapy provided
by registered dietitians and state-regulated nutrition professionals.
<P>
"The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1995 offers an opportunity
to correct a monumental oversight in Medicare coverage by providing
the essential nutrition services that have been recognized as
vital to the treatment of many health conditions," Chernoff
said. 
<P>
H.R. 2247 currently has 89 co-sponsors.  A companion bill, S.
1964, recently was introduced by Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) and
is co-sponsored by Sens. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) and Olymipia
Snowe (R-Maine).
<P>
In addition to Gutierrez, Illinois co-sponsors of H.R. 2247 include
Sydney R. Yates (D-9th) and Jerry R. Costello (D-12th).
<P>
The American Dietetic Association is the world's largest organization
of food and nutrition professionals.  With headquarters in Chicago,
it serves the public by promoting optimal nutrition, health and
well-being.

<H2>Bill to Save Health Care Costs Introduced in Senate</H2>
</TD>
<TD>
<H3>CHICAGO, August 1, 1996</H3><P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> The Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1996<br>
<p>
With the debate on the future of Medicare likely to carryover until next year, a bill (S. 1964) aimed at curtailing medical costs and improving health recently was introduced by Sen. Jeff  Bingaman (D-N.M.).  The bill would provide for coverage under part B of the Medicare program (outpatient services) for medical nutrition therapy services provided by or under the supervision of a registered dietitian or nutrition professional.<p>
	This bill is companion to H.R. 2247 that was introduced last year in the House by Rep. Jose Serrano (D-N.Y.) and currently has 85 co-sponsors.  To date, the senate bill is co-sponsored by Sens. Ernest Hollings (D-S.C.) and Olympia Snowe (R-Maine). <p>
	Medical nutrition therapy can save health care costs by speeding recovery and reducing the incidence of medical complications, resulting in fewer hospitalizations, shorter hospital stays and reduced drug, surgery and treatment needs, according to The American Dietetic Association’s (ADA) President Ronni Chernoff, Ph.D., R.D. (registered dietitian).<p>
	Medical nutrition therapy includes the assessment of a patient’s nutritional status followed by appropriate therapy, which can range from diet modification to the administration of specialized treatment methods such as intravenous or tube feedings.<p>
	“Medical nutrition therapy is proven to be medically necessary and cost-effective in treating and controlling many diseases and medical conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, burns and AIDS,”  said Bingaman.  “I believe this legislation should be a part of the debate on how to ensure the long-term stability of Medicare,”  he added.<p>
	An analysis of nearly 2,400 case studies by the ADA shows that on average, more than $8,000 per patient can be saved with the intervention of medical nutrition therapy.<p>
	A study conducted in 1994 by the ADA and the International Diabetes Center (IDC) in Minneapolis showed that people with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus--also known as type II diabetes--can better control their blood sugar levels, weight and cholesterol with medical nutrition therapy provided by a registered dietitian.<p>
	Hospital care of patients with diabetes costs an estimated $65 billion a year.  “The ADA/IDC study translates into billions of dollars per year in potential health care savings,” said Chernoff.  “The true savings from the increased use of medical nutrition therapy in other illnesses is also substantial,”  she added.<p>
	Dietitians are extensively trained and educated in the science of nutrition and its application to disease prevention and treatment.  “They are fundamental members of the medical team in providing effective health care delivery,” Chernoff said. <p>
	Currently, in the U.S., about 17 million patients each year are treated for illnesses or injuries that stem from or place them at the risk of malnutrition, according to the ADA.   However, Chernoff pointed out that there is no consistent policy for covering the costs for medical nutrition therapy, which has been recognized by medical professionals as a key factor in improving a patient’s health or speeding recovery. <p>
	While prescribed medical nutritional products are reimbursed in inpatient settings,  a dietitian’s services are not.  In outpatient settings,Medicare and some Medicaid programs cover physician-prescribed medical nutrition therapy as part of home care therapy benefits.  However, a professional dietitian’s services are not covered as a reimbursable expense.<p>
	“This bill offers an opportunity to correct a monumental oversight in Medicare coverage by providing the essential nutrition services that have been recognized as vital to the treatment of many health conditions. We applaud Sen. Bingaman’s leadership on this critical issue,” said Chernoff.<p>
	With headquarters in Chicago, the 69,000-member American Dietetic Association is the nation’s largest group of food and nutrition professionals.  ADA serves the public through the promotion of optimal nutrition, health and well-being.<p>

<H2>
Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
World hunger</H2><P>

<H3>Position Statement</H3>
<P>
<I>It is the position of The American Dietetic Association 
that access to adequate food is a fundamental human 
right. Hunger continues to be a worldwide problem of 
staggering proportions. The Association supports programs that 
combat hunger, allow for self-sufficiency, and are 
environmentally and economically sustainable.</I>
<P>

<H3>Environment Dictating Need For Position</H3>

<P>Food security means access at all times by all people 
to adequate food for an active and healthful life (1). 
Worldwide, a substantial number of people remain food insecure or 
hungry. (See the <A HREF="sustainability.html">Figure</a> for a key to hunger-related terms.) Data 
 indicate that approximately 20% of the world's population, 
or 1 billion people, are energy deficient (2). Micronutrient 
deficiencies are even more widespread: according to the 
World Health Organization, more than 2 billion people suffer from 
an inadequate intake of iodine, iron, and vitamin A (3).
<P>     Famine the image many people have of hunger affects relatively few people, and the amount of food needed 
to prevent it is relatively small. Famines can be caused by 
natural disasters or by war and civil strife. Early warning systems 
and humanitarian responses have virtually eliminated famine 
deaths due to natural disasters. In 1992, 157 million people, or 3%  
of the world's population, lived in countries affected by famine 
or severe food shortage (not everyone in these countries 
actually suffered from hunger) (3). 
<P>     Chronic hunger due to poverty is much more 
widespread than acute hunger due to famine. About 36% of 
preschool-aged children in developing countries are moderately or 
severely malnourished based on weight-for-age (4). Each day, 
an estimated 35,000 (14 million per year) die of malnutrition 
and related preventable disease (5). An overview of the 
current status of hunger in various regions of the world follows (3).
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>Sub-Saharan Africa Hunger</B> is widespread and 
worsening. Long-term economic decline, international debt, low 
commodity prices, poor results from structural adjustment 
policies supported by the World Bank and International 
Monetary Fund, and violent conflicts contribute to increased hunger. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>Asia-Pacific region</B> Although hunger has declined in 
the past 20 years because of economic growth and large-scale 
pub-lic investments in nutrition, health, and education, the 
region is home to most of the world's hungry people. Incidence of 
un-dernutrition among preschool children is higher than in Africa. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>Middle East Hunger</B> declined between 1970 and 1990 
as higher oil prices permitted increased food imports.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>Latin America</B> Debt and austerity policies led to 
increased hunger during the 1980s. No total regional change occurred 
in the 1990s.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>Europe</B> Structural unemployment in the 1980s and 
early 1990s led to increased poverty and homelessness and 
the proliferation of food banks. In formerly communist 
countries, violent conflicts and massive economic transition have 
created hunger and food insecurity for many people.
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"><B>United States</B> Hunger has increased since 1985 because 
of underfunding of government antihunger programs, 
long-term decline in the average worker's real wages, and 
increased poverty, especially among children.
<P><H3>Rationale</H3>
<P>The magnitude of hunger is intolerable in a world of plenty. 
In addition to human suffering, hunger and malnutrition 
have negative effects on labor productivity, cognitive 
development, and health. Hence, hunger eradication is in the world 
community's interest. Because hunger causes are typically a 
combination of individual, household, community, national, and 
international factors, however, simplistic solutions are inadequate.
<P>     In the 1950s and 1960s, emphasis was placed on 
increasing national food supplies to deal with hunger. Such an 
approach is necessary, but insufficient. In many countries where 
food availability is at or greater than 100% at the national level, 
20% to 30% of the population consumes less than 80% of 
their energy needs (1). National data on food supplies mask  
regional differences. In China, Thailand, and Indonesia, for 
example, high rates of undernutrition persist in certain regions 
despite generally effective national commitments to reducing hunger.
<P>     Furthermore, for those without control over land to 
produce their own food, increased food output does not ensure 
access to food in the absence of secure and adequate incomes 
(6). Poor and hungry people may lack the political clout to 
command public services, and more affluent people outbid them 
in the marketplace. To the extent that government policies 
increase a household's access to food (because these 
policies result in higher incomes or lower food prices, or because 
the government supports direct interventions such as 
feeding programs), household food security improves.
<P>     In many countries there are problems of access to food 
within households. Individual food intake within the household 
is affected by sex, control of income, education, age, birth 
order, and genetic endowments. For example, women and girls 
may receive less food than men and boys. In some cultures, 
women are more likely than men to allocate income to food; thus, to 
the extent that women control income, they are more likely to 
use it to ensure household members' food consumption (7,8).
<P>     Most malnourished children live in homes that have access 
to adequate quantities of food. Malnutrition can result from 
low birth weight (which may stem from poor nutrition 
during pregnancy) and bottle-feeding in inappropriate 
circumstances, such as the absence of clean water or the income to 
afford formula. But the main cause of malnutrition is illness, 
especially diarrhea and infectious diseases, which thrives in 
poor communities lacking clean water and sanitation. Chronic 
poor health saps children of nutrients and leaves them with 
poor appetites, while malnutrition can cause permanent mental 
and physical damage (9-11). Environmental sanitation and 
immunization are essential for combating childhood malnutrition.
<P>     Racism and ethnocentrism underlie much of the 
world's hunger (12). In Sudan, for example, racial and ethnic 
competition for resources has led to violent conflict and the 
world's highest rates of undernutrition. Globally, ethnic and 
political conflicts contribute to the hunger problem by diverting 
resources that could be used to meet basic human needs. In 
1994, global military expenditures were estimated at $767 
billionmore than the total income of the poorest 45% of the 
world's population (13). Conflicts also disrupt food production, 
markets, and transportation and displace workers from their 
livelihood. Warring parties may deliberately use hunger as a weapon.
<P>     Policy makers debate whether to tackle hunger 
primarily through broad-based economic policies that alleviate 
poverty or through targeted food and nutrition interventions. Often 
no single approach suffices. Particularly troublesome are 
obstacles to reducing hunger in rural areas, where food insecurity 
affects the most people. 
<P>     Policies that promote long-term, sustained increases in 
poor people's incomes provide the most viable strategy for 
permanently eradicating hunger. In the short to medium term, 
complementary targeted programs are needed to provide a 
nutritional safety net for vulnerable households.
<P>     Labor-intensive public works programs have been 
successful in increasing the income and, thus, the food consumption 
of very poor people in a number of developing countries 
(14). Targeted feeding programs, most commonly 
supplementary food programs for preschool-aged children and 
pregnant women, can also be an effective part of the social safety net.
<P>     Because the economies of many developing countries 
are based on agriculture, growth in that sector, primarily 
through technological change, is critical for general economic 
growth, poverty reduction, and elimination of hunger. The 
agricultural technologies of the 1960s and 1970s that relied heavily 
on modern seed varieties had dramatic effects on food 
production, most notably in Asia and some parts of Latin 
America (15). These technologies led to lower food prices, 
benefiting urban consumers, landless rural people, and small farmers 
who were net purchasers of food (16). As production 
increased, rural incomes increased. For example, in North Arcot, 
India, households that adopted new rice varieties more than 
doubled the real value of consumption of food and other goods 
between 1973 and 1984 (17), and diets became more varied. 
Demand for hired agricultural labor increased, boosting the incomes 
of rural poor people. But many poor farmers could not use 
these technologies because they relied on costly patterns of 
irrigation, fertilizer application, and pesticide use. Such 
technologies can also contribute to the problems of land 
degradation, which are already severe where growing poor populations 
have no choice but to intensively farm marginal land.
<P>     In much of the developing world, control over land and 
other assets is highly inequitable. Increasing poor people's access 
to assets, including credit, is essential to ending hunger. 
The Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, which offers 
microenterprise loans to very poor people, is a model of how poor people 
may access bank credit (18).
<P><H3>Key Points</H3>
<P>The end of the Cold War provides new opportunities 
for creating a hunger-free world, but also heightens the danger 
of new hunger crises. Resources previously devoted to 
arms races and ideological struggle can now go toward 
ending hunger and poverty. At the same time, the world faces 
an unprecedented explosion of regional conflicts, many of 
them based on long-standing ethnic grievances and struggles 
over control of resources. This has caused serious increases 
in short-term hunger and created relief needs that have 
overwhelmed long-term development efforts.
<P>     The global shift away from authoritarian government 
provides openings for disenfranchised groups to shape 
policies and programs (19). In this changing world order, many  
institutions are being pressed to change their roles. The 
United Nations faces new challenges to make and keep peace, 
meet humanitarian assistance needs, and uphold the right to food.
<P>     The long-term solution to hunger is sustainable 
development. This includes meeting basic human needs (basic 
health, nutrition, and education for all); expanding economic 
opportunities, especially for poor people; protecting and enhancing 
the environment so that progress can be sustained; and 
promoting pluralism and democratic participation.
<P>     Presently, global grain supplies are adequate to 
provide every person on earth with their minimum energy 
requirements. Supplies are likely to remain adequate in the 
short-term future. For developing countries as a whole, food 
supplies increased more rapidly than population in the 1970s and 
1980s, but in sub-Saharan Africa, where population is growing 3% 
 annually unprecedented in history for an entire 
continent, and in contrast to a 1% growth rate in the United States per capita food production has declined. If current 
population growth trends continue, food output could fall short of 
projected demand by 50 million metric tons by the year 2000.

<P>

Globally, growth rates in crop yields are declining, but 
even optimistic scenarios require a doubling of food 
production within the next generation to keep up with projected 
population growth. Efforts to overcome these constraints often 
degrade the environment and conflict with the 
longer-term sustainability of agriculture (20). Increased subdivision of 
land among successive generations and expansion of farms 
into ecologically fragile areas add to environmental 
destruction caused by the flight of hungry people from rural areas to 
cities and deforestation of adjoining areas. Some 1.5 to 1.7 
million acres of agricultural land in developing countries are lost 
each year to soil erosion. Overconsumption by affluent people 
diverts resources that could meet basic human needs and 
adds considerably to the strain on the environment.
<P>     Maintaining the balance among people, food, and the 
environment requires a reversal in the declining trend in 
global funding for agricultural research. Current research should 
give priority to environment-friendly technologies and 
improvements adapted for poor farmers.
<P>     Reducing population growth is also part of the 
equation. Some evidence suggests that the most effective way to 
reduce population growth is to improve the lot of women, 
especially through education for girls (Matthews J. Population 
control that really works. <I>Washington Post</I>. April 1, 1994: 21).
<P>     The world has both the food and the technical expertise 
to end hunger (3). What is lacking is the political will. 
The changes needed to overcome hunger will only occur if 
concerned citizens worldwide seek to change public policies. 
Past efforts of US antihunger activists led, for example, to 
increased funding for child survival programs, which are now saving 
the lives of some 5,000 children each day. In developing 
countries such as Zimbabwe, Brazil, and the Indian state of 
Kerala, popular organizations have pressed governments to give 
greater priority to reducing hunger and poverty (12).
<P><H3>Programs And Audiences Affected</H3>
<P>Declarations upholding the right to food security, such as 
those issued at the International Conference on Nutrition in 1992 
and the World Summit for Children in 1990, help create the 
environment for the needed shift in priorities. But reducing 
hunger will also require tangible resources. The costs are real, but 
so are the costs of failing to act. In most cases, micronutrient 
deficiencies can be ended with low-cost, readily available 
nutrition interventions (eg, salt iodization and vitamin A 
capsules). Sustainable development to overcome chronic 
undernutrition is more difficult, economically and politically, but the payoff 
is high: more people contributing to the economic, social, 
and cultural life of their communities, nations, and the world.
<P>     Presently, governments of most foreign aid donors 
and developing countries do not give high priority to 
reducing poverty and hunger. The quantity and quality of aid falls 
short of its hunger-reducing potential. Foreign aid amounts to 
about 1% of the US federal budget; no more than 35% of US 
foreign aid is focused on sustainable development (21). 
<P>     Industrialized countries need to adapt the rules of the 
global economy to encourage development in poor countries. 
The 1994 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 
will cost Africa an estimated $2.6 billion by the year 2000 
because of lost trade advantages and food aid (21,22), but 
Africa's needs barely figured in the negotiations. Barriers against 
exports from developing countries cost them an estimated 
$100 billion each year, double what they receive in aid. Further, 
the international debt crisis of the 1980s left many 
developing countries with a heavy burden of unpayable debt, and 
the macroeconomic reforms that international financial 
institutions pushed them to adopt have often been 
unnecessarily harsh on poor and hungry people (23).
<P>     Long-term solutions to hunger must address the root 
causes. Sustainable development requires political, economic, 
and social changes: empowering the disenfranchised, 
widening access to assets and other resources, narrowing the gap 
between rich and poor, and adjusting consumption patterns so 
as to foster good stewardship of nature (13). Without 
these changes, hunger will continue to plague humanity. 
Ending hunger is not only a moral question, but a practical concern 
for all of us and for future generations. It means not only 
upholding the rights and dignity of all human beings, but also 
maintaining the security and integrity of the planet on which we all live.
<P><H3>Roles And Responsibilities Of Dietetics Practitioners</H3>
<P>Hunger is a massive, but solvable problem. Nutrition 
professionals are uniquely qualified to educate elected officials 
and voters about the nutritional impact of policies and 
programs. There is an urgent need for nutrition professionals to 
become actively involved in seeing that the food assistance 
programs that support sustainable development are protected, 
improved, and expanded. When possible, nutrition professionals 
should get involved, on a long-term and short-term basis, in 
relief, development, and education activities in the developing world.

<H2>
Position of The American Dietetic Association:<br> 
Use of nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners</H2>
<P>

Sweeteners, both nutritive and nonnutritive, are often misrepresented as a cause of various health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Sweeteners have a role within the context of a diet consistent with the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans.<P>
<H3>Position Statement</H3><P>
The American Dietetic Association recognizes the appropriate use of nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners when consumed in moderation and within the context of a diet consistent with the US Dietary Guidelines for Americans.<P>
<H3>Types of Sweeteners and 
Potential Risks from Use</H3><P>
The two basic categories of sweeteners are nutritive and nonnutritive. Nutritive sweeteners include: caloric sugars, such as sucrose, fructose, dextrose, lactose, maltose, honey, corn syrup, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), molasses, invert sugars, or fruit juice concentrates; and polyols (also referred to as sugar alcohols), such as sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol and other sugar alcohols (eg, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates [HSH]). Nonnutritive sweeteners are considered intense sweeteners and include saccharin, aspartame, and acesulfame K. Approval is being sought from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for several others (alitame, cyclamates, and sucralose).<P>
	Sweeteners, both nutritive and nonnutritive, are often misrepresented as a cause of various health problems. Except in the rare cases of inborn errors of metabolism, evidence suggests that sweeteners are not an independent risk factor for any particular disease, including the development of obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes mellitus, or cardiovascular disease. Nor is there substantial evidence that sugars or other sweeteners are responsible for behavioral changes. Even dental disease is not unique to sugar, but is caused by exposure of teeth to a large number of fermentable carbohydrates in addition to sugar (1).<P>
	Even though sweeteners do not contribute to the nutritional value of the diet, other than providing energy, they frequently contribute to taste value.<P> 
	Food additives, including sweeteners, are under FDA  jurisdiction for safety review. Before any of the intense sweeteners are approved for market, they must meet rigorous FDA guidelines and have undergone years of extensive testing.<P>
<H3>Nutritive Sweeteners</H3><P>
A report from the FDA Sugars Task Force revealed that the average daily intake of added sugars for the total population was 53 g/day (1). According to the 1977-78 US Department of Agriculture (USDA) Nationwide Food Consumption Survey data, this represents 11% of the total population's average daily energy intake. This consumption estimate is lower than previously published amounts, which were based on disappearance data describing national consumption as the total amount of sweeteners available for use in the food supply.<P> 
	The average daily intake of total sugars (including naturally occurring sugars found in fruits and vegetables, but minus lactose [milk sugar]) amounts to 80 g/day for the total population or an average of 18% of total energy (1). A recent analysis of USDA's 1987-88 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey data indicates that average intakes of sugars have not changed since the FDA's 1985 report. The average daily intake of sugars minus lactose is still 80 g (2).<P> 
	Within all age groups of persons aged 4 years and older, those with a high intake of added sugars consume amounts that range from 83 to 126 g/day (3). Two types of consumers of a high intake of added sugars exist: those who add sugars to a reasonably balanced diet, probably because of extra energy needs; and those who tend to substitute certain sugar-rich foods for more nutritionally desirable foods, for example, substituting soft drinks for milk or sweets for fruit. Increased body weight is not associated with high consumption of added sugars, and, for both types of consumers of  a high intake of added sugars, percentage of dietary energy from fat was lower than that for moderate consumers (3).<P>
	Published recommendations have suggested limiting the amount of energy from added sugars to approximately 10% to15% of total caloric intake (4,5). This closely parallels the current reported consumption level. Continued moderate use of nutritive sweeteners is recommended, consistent with dietary recommendations.<P>
	Educational efforts to ensure adequate nutrient intake should be targeted toward persons who use foods high in added sugars as substitutes for more nutritionally desirable foods, rather than toward persons who apparently use added sugars to meet high energy needs. Educational strategies must also be accompanied by appropriate suggestions for foods other than those high in fat to replace the energy contributed by added sugars (3).<P>

<B>Sucrose</B><p>Sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose, was the only major sweetener used in the first half of the century. Today, the daily sucrose intake per person in the United States ranges from 14 to 60 g/day, with an average of 41 g/day, or about 1/4 cup per day. Total sucrose intake as a percentage of caloric intake ranges from 7% to 11%, with an average of 9% (1).<P>
	Although the consumer is confronted by a wide variety of sugars - sucrose, raw sugar, turbinado sugar, brown sugar, honey, corn syrups - there is no significant difference in the nutritional content or energy each provides and, thus, no advantage of one over another. Furthermore, there is no evidence to suggest that our bodies can distinguish between added and natural sugars.<P>

<B>Fructose</B> <p>Fructose, a monosaccharide, is found naturally in fruits, as an added sugar in a crystalline form, and as a component of HFCSs. Crystalline fructose (99% fructose) is produced from cornstarch in a process called isomerization, which produces a free-flowing granulated substance that looks and tastes much like sucrose. Like sucrose it provides 4 kcal/g.<P>
	HFCS generally contains 42%, 55%, or 90% fructose, the remaining carbohydrate being primarily dextrose (glucose) with a small percentage of higher saccharides. Of total sweeteners, use of HFCS rose from 4% in 1975 to slightly more than 30% in 1990 (6). This increase is attributable to the growing market for soft drinks. HFCS is a major ingredient in soft drinks, and manufacturers use HFCS rather than sugar in reformulation of soft drinks. Soft drinks most commonly contain 55% HFCS, whereas cake mixes and other desserts generally use 42% HFCS for sweetening.<P>
	Crystalline fructose is 1.2 to 1.8 times as sweet as sucrose and is most effective as a sweetening agent in cold and high-acid foods, such as citrus drinks. When used in combination with other sweeteners, including intense sweeteners, a synergistic effect results and the sweetening power of both sweeteners is enhanced.<P>
	Because fructose is a nutritive sweetener, recommendations for its use by the general public are the same as those for other sugars. It offers no caloric advantage, although some foods may require less fructose than sucrose for sweetening. When consumed in amounts greater than 50 g/day, fructose has been shown to cause osmotic diarrhea (7). (A typical fructose-sweetened cookie may have up to 3 g fructose per cookie).<P>
	Attention should be given to the fact that fructose is not the only naturally occurring sugar in fruit. Sugar content varies notably between "one fruit" serving sizes (15 g carbohydrate, 60 kcal) of common fruits. For example, 1/2 cup orange juice contains 5.7 g fructose, 6.6 g glucose, and 1.8 g sucrose, whereas 1 orange contains 3.3 g fructose, 2.9 g glucose, and 5.5 g sucrose (8).
<P>
<B>Polyols (sugar alcohols)</B> <p>Sorbitol, mannitol, and xylitol are common polyols. Sorbitol and mannitol are half as sweet as sucrose but because of a low glycemic response are often used as substitute sweeteners in food products. Along with hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, polydextrose, and maltodextrins, they are also used as food bulking agents - fillers that give form and satiety to foods and beverages.<P> 
	 Although current FDA standards list sugar alcohols as contributing 4 kcal/g, research is being conducted to determine their exact caloric value more accurately. The results of numerous studies in animals and human beings have shown that the caloric value of polyols cannot be determined precisely and that it may vary depending upon the mode of ingestion and individual factors such as gastrointestinal transit time (9). In one study, stool excretion of sugar alcohols (sorbitol, maltitol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysate) was shown to be negligible; this indicates a high digestion and absorption rate from the small intestine that would make the caloric value close to 3.5 kcal/g (10). However, the European Economic Community has recently accepted a Directive on Nutrition Labeling which defines the caloric value of all polyols as 2.4 kcal/g (11).<P>
	Because of its side effects, sorbitol is not recommended for use in large amounts. Abdominal gas, discomfort, and osmotic diarrhea can result when 30 g sorbitol or more is ingested in a single dose, depending on an individual's gastrointestinal sensitivity; an individual's tolerance levels may be as low as 10 g (12). In addition, regulations covering the labeling of foods with high sorbitol content require the statement, "Excess consumption may have a laxative effect," if reasonable and foreseeable consumption may result in a daily ingestion of 50 g. It is recommended that foods containing sorbitol be limited to portions containing 20 kcal or less (5 g sorbitol or less). Products that contain small amounts of sorbitol are hard candy, sugarless gum, jams, and jellies. For example, a small hard candy contains 3 g sorbitol.<P>
	Starch hydrolysates are formed by controlled partial hydrolysis of edible starches. Their reducing activity can be eliminated by hydrogenation, and the product then becomes a polyol (sugar alcohol). Depending on the length of the polymer chains and the parent compound, polyols may also be known as hydrogenated glucose syrup, hydrogenated sugar, or HSH. A specific HSH formulation can also include a combination of polyols of different saccharide chain lengths. Preliminary studies indicate that some HSH formulations are less well absorbed and metabolized in the small intestine than glucose, and HSH products containing large numbers of shorter chains are less available to digestive enzymes than HSH products with large numbers of longer hydrogenated saccharide chains (13). Noncrystallization is a property of some HSH products and is important in certain confectionary products.<P>
<H3>Nonnutritive Sweeteners</H3><P>
Nonnutritive sweeteners are also referred to as intense sweeteners, very low calorie, or alternative sweeteners. Since being introduced into the US food supply, their use has increased dramatically. New nonnutritive sweeteners have been introduced and they have been approved in a widening variety of food products. By the mid-1990s, per capita consumption of these sweeteners is forecast to exceed current levels by as much as 50% (14). Currently, three are used in the United States (saccharin, aspartame, acesulfame K) and FDA approval is being sought for three others (sucralose, alitame, cyclamates).
	<P>Beginning with aspartame, the FDA began establishing an acceptable daily intake (ADI) for nonnutritive sweeteners. The ADI is defined as the amount of a food additive that can safely be consumed on a daily basis over a person's lifetime without an adverse effect. It includes a 100-fold safety factor (15). Although a person is unlikely to reach the ADI on a daily basis, if reached, it would still not prove harmful.<P>

<B>Saccharin</B> <p>Saccharin, the oldest of the nonnutritive sweeteners, is currently produced from purified, manufactured methyl anthranilate, a substance occurring naturally in grapes. It is 300 times sweeter than sucrose, heat stable, and noncariogenic. Saccharin has a long shelf life, but a slightly bitter/metallic aftertaste. It is not metabolized in the human digestive system, is excreted rapidly in the urine, and does not accumulate in body tissues.<P>
	In 1977, the FDA proposed a ban on saccharin because animal research implicated saccharin as a weak carcinogen in second-generation male rats when large doses of saccharin were given. Because of intense public opposition to the proposed ban, Congress passed the Saccharin Study and Labeling Act in 1977, which permitted continued use of saccharin. In October 1991, Congress extended the saccharin ban moratorium for the fifth time, until May 1997. Then in December 1991, the FDA withdrew its 1977 proposal to ban saccharin and its salts (16). However, the consumer warning will remain on the label.<P>
	Human studies conducted in various population groups assumed to be heavy saccharin users, such as persons with diabetes and persons with bladder cancer, did not support an association between saccharin and human bladder cancer (17-19).<P>
	When saccharin received Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) status in 1955, recommended consumption limits were 500 mg/day for children and 1,000 mg/day for adults. However, when saccharin was the only nonnutritive sweetener available, actual intake ranged from 25 to 125 mg/day for nondiabetic users and from 54 to 173 mg/day for persons with diabetes (19). Approximately 40 mg saccharin (eg, one packet of Sweet `n Low [Cumberland Packing Corp, Brooklyn, NY]) has the equivalent sweetness of 2 tsp sugar.<P>  
	At current intake levels saccharin is assumed safe for the general public and is approved for use in more than 90 countries.<P>

<B>Aspartame</B> <p>Aspartame, discovered in 1965, is the methyl ester of two amino acids, L-aspartic acid and L-phenylalanine. Marketed under the brand name NutraSweet  and as Equal tabletop sweetener (The NutraSweet Co, Deerfield, Ill), the original patent for aspartame expired in December 1992, and additional brands of aspartame began appearing on the market in 1993. It has a clean, sweet taste and is 200 times sweeter than sucrose. Although technically it is a nutritive sweetener, yielding 4 kcal/g, very small amounts are necessary to achieve desired sweetness and, therefore, its caloric contribution is negligible.<P> 
	Aspartame is metabolized in the gastointestinal tract to three common dietary components: aspartic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol. These metabolites are metabolized by the same processes as when obtained from other foods. The amounts of these components are very small relative to the amounts obtained from the normal diet. For example, a glass of milk has 6 times as much phenylalanine and 13 times as much aspartic acid as a similar amount of diet soda. A glass of tomato juice has six times as much methanol as a similar amount of diet soda (15).<P>
	The FDA approved use of aspartame as a tabletop sweetener and in dry foods in 1981 and in carbonated beverages in 1983. During the 1980s it was approved for additional applications, and today it is approved for use in more than 150 food product categories.<P>
	Aspartame research included comprehensive toxicologic studies in animals (20), as well as human studies of its metabolic products and individual sensitivity (21-26). Studies documented that it could be safely used by healthy adults, children and adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, and persons with diabetes (27-32).<P>
	Information for individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU) is required on the label of all products that contain aspartame. Even for that group, aspartame is judged to pose only a small risk. There is a substantial safety gap between blood levels of phenylalanine that could occur in heavy users of aspartame and the lowest known toxic levels for PKU patients (33,34).<P>
	The FDA established an ADI for aspartame of 50 mg/kg of body weight; however, actual intake is much less than the ADI. A 150-lb adult would need to consume twenty 12-oz diet soft drinks or 97 packets of tabletop sweeteners and a 50-lb child would have to consume seven 12-oz diet soft drinks or 32 packets of tabletop sweetener to reach ADI levels. Even in clinical studies in which three to four times the ADI were given in bolus doses, adverse effects were not shown (35).<P> 
	Aspartame consumption (14-day average) in the general population of individuals who consume aspartame (including children and special subpopulations) is 2 to 3 mg/kg per day or approximately 4% of the US ADI. Ninety percent of users consume less than 5 mg/kg per day (15). The average amount of aspartame in some common foods is 170 mg per 12-oz diet soft drink, 100 mg per 8-oz serving powdered drink, 80 mg per 4-oz gelatin dessert, 124 mg per 8-oz aspartame-sweetened fruited yogurt, and 35 mg per one packet of tabletop sweetener.<P> 
	Evidence indicates that long-term consumption of aspartame is safe and is not associated with any adverse health effects (35-39). It is approved for use in more than 90 countries.<P>

<B>Acesulfame K</B> <p>Acesulfame K, or acesulfame potassium, was discovered in 1967 in Germany and approved for use in the United States in 1988. An organic salt consisting of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, sulphur, and potassium atoms, it is marketed under the brand name Sunette (Sunette Division of Hoechst Celanese) and as Sweet One (The Stadt Corp, Brooklyn, NY) or Swiss Sweet tabletop sweeteners (The Estee Corp, Parsippany, NJ). It is 200 times sweeter than sugar, has a synergistic sweetening effect with other sweeteners, and has an excellent shelf life. Because it is heat stable, it can be used in cooking and baking. Acesulfame K has no lingering aftertaste, but a slight aftertaste occurs at high levels of use (40,41). It is excreted through the human digestive system unchanged and, therefore, is noncaloric.<P>
	More than 90 safety studies (42,43), including four long-term animal feeding studies, conducted over the last 15 years were submitted to the FDA. The FDA addressed the question of tumors found in some rats fed acesulfame K during one of the long-term studies (44). A detailed analysis of the tumors showed that they were typical of what could be routinely expected in rats and were not related to acesulfame K.<P> 
	The FDA and the Joint Expert Committee for Food Additives (JECFA) of the World Health Organization set an ADI of 15 mg/ kg of body weight, which is the equivalent of a 60-kg person eating approximately 150 g (36 tsp) sugar daily. One packet of Sweet One contains 50 mg acesulfame K. Acesulfame K is used in more than 1,000 different products worldwide, including a wide range of candies, baked goods, desserts, and soft drinks. It has been approved for use in more than 40 different countries.<P>
<H3>Nonnutritive Sweeteners Not Yet Approved</H3><P> 

<B>Sucralose</B> <p>Sucralose was approved for use in Canada  in 1991 and approval is pending in the United States and Australia. It was confirmed by the JECFA in 1990 to be marketed as SPLENDAR Brand Sweetener. It is a very stable, free-flowing, white crystalline solid that can be used in baking and has a high-quality flavor (45,46). Sucralose is 400 to 800 times sweeter than sugar and is produced through a multistep process that selectively substitutes three chlorine atoms for three hydroxyl groups in the sucrose molecule. Absorption of ingested sucralose is limited; most of it passes through the body unchanged. The small amount that is absorbed is not metabolized for energy, which makes sucralose noncaloric.<P> 
	In more than 100 animal and human studies completed over the past 15 years (47), sucralose has not been found to be carcinogenic and does not cause genetic change, birth defects, brain or nerve damage, or pose any other health risks. In human clinical studies, no physiologic, biochemical, or hematologic changes were found with an intake up to 500 mg/day. Sucralose is not recognized by the body as a carbohydrate and has no effect on insulin secretion or overall carbohydrate metabolism in healthy human beings. More than 40 studies indicate it is safe for the environment - biodegradable and safe for plant and aquatic life.<P>
	Because of its sweetness, solubility in water, and stability, sucralose can be used as a sweetening ingredient in a range of processed foods and beverages. The ADI set by JECFA is 15 mg/kg per day.<P>

<B>Alitame</B> <p>A petition seeking approval for alitame was submitted to the FDA in 1986. Alitame is formed from the amino acids l-aspartic acid and l-alanine and a novel amide. The novel amide is formed from 2,2,4,4-tetramethylthieanyl amine and is the key to the very high sweetness potency of alitame. It is 2,000 times sweeter than sucrose and has a clean, sweet taste. Alitame is stable at elevated temperatures and over a broad pH range, is highly soluble in water, and provides a maximum of 1.2 kcal/g.<P>
	Alitame is hydrolyzed to release aspartic acid, which is metabolized normally. The alanine amine passes through the body with minimal metabolic changes. Alitame is well absorbed; 77% to 96% is excreted in urine and the remainder (7% to 22%) is excreted in the feces, primarily as unchanged alitame.<P> 
	More than 15 studies have indicated that alitame is safe. In all of the studies the no-effect dose was consistently above 100 mg/kg per day or >300 times the mean chronic human consumption (48). As part of the food additive process, the FDA requested that an animal study on alitame be repeated. This additional study is expected to delay approval in the United States to the mid-1990s.<P>
	Alitame would be suitable in a wide variety of products, such as beverages, tabletop sweeteners, frozen desserts, and baked goods. Permission for use has also been filed in a number of European countries.<P>

<B>Cyclamates</B> <p>A petition to reapprove the use of cyclamates is also currently under review by the FDA. In 1980, a 1973 petition to the FDA for reapproval of cyclamate was denied. A new petition was filed in 1982, which the FDA is currently reviewing.<P> 
	Cyclamate is 30 times sweeter than sucrose and is water soluble and heat stable. Cyclamate was removed from the GRAS list in 1969, principally on the basis of one experiment, when its use in a 10:1 cyclamate/saccharin mixture was related to the development of bladder tumors in rats at the highest dose used - 2,500 mg/kg per day (49). According to the FDA, however, 75 subsequent studies have failed to demonstrate that cyclamate is carcinogenic (50-52). In 1985, the National Academy of Sciences also concluded that the totality of the evidence from studies in animals does not indicate that cyclamate or its major metabolite cyclohexylamine is carcinogenic by itself (53).<P>
	An ADI will not be established by the FDA until cyclamate is reapproved. Canada and more than 50 countries in Europe, Asia, South America, and Africa have concluded that cyclamates can be used safely.<P>
<B>Use in Special Populations and Medical Conditions</B><P> 

<B>Children</B> <P>Although children tend to eat slightly more added sugar than adults (13% to 14% vs 11% of dietary energy, respectively [1]), a diet high in sugars does not predict a nutritionally inadequate diet (3). Children, like adults, need to consume both nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners in the context of a healthful, well-balanced diet. However, there is no evidence that the use of sweeteners results in deficiency of micronutrients in people (adults as well as children) eating an energy-adequate diet.<P>

<B>Behavior</B> <P>There is no substantial evidence that sugars are responsible for behavioral changes in children (54,55). In contrast, consumption of sucrose and other carbohydrates tends to have a sedative effect on the nervous system of children (56) and adults (57). Carbohydrate loads have been shown to increase brain serotonin levels in experimental animals, which has been associated with decreased activity and reduced food intake (58).<P>

<B>Obesity</B> <P>Despite some reports that indicated otherwise, nonnutritive sweeteners have not been found to increase ratings of hunger, to increase food intake, or to cause weight gain in human beings (59, 60). Researchers have found that aspartame consumption is associated with decreased ratings of hunger as well as with no change or a reduction in food intake (61-63). Furthermore, added nutritive sweeteners have also not been associated with factors related to body weight (60,64).<P>
	Although nonnutritive sweeteners can replace nutritive sweeteners in many foods at a caloric savings of approximately 16 kcal/tsp, consumers need to be careful not to overcompensate by eating other calorically dense foods. Low-calorie sweeteners can and should be used in the context of a sensible weight management program where they can aid control of caloric intake by providing palatable foods with reduced energy.<P>

<B>Dental Caries</B> <P>The causes of dental caries are reported to be multifactorial, with oral microbial flora, host factors (including resistance of teeth to dental decay and hardness of tooth surfaces) and dietary factors such as the consumption of sucrose and other fermentable carbohydrates constituting the three major factors involved (65). Evidence suggests a role for sucrose in the development of dental disease, but exposure of teeth to a large number of fermentable carbohydrates is also a factor (66).<P>

<B>Diabetes</B> <P>Sugars are not an independent risk factor for the development of impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. Furthermore, research studies clearly indicate that there is a wide spectrum of blood glucose responses to different carbohydrates - sugars and starches - with so much overlap they cannot be distinguished as separate groups. When the grams of carbohydrate are equal, the source of the carbohydrate does not appear to be the major factor in determining the effect of the food on blood glucose levels (67-73). Therefore, moderate amounts of sucrose (<10% of total energy [74]) can be substituted or used for a portion of the total carbohydrate in the meal plan and eaten within the context of a healthful diet for most persons with diabetes. Concern about the potentially deterimental effects of sucrose on various lipid fractions has been expressed (75,76). Other studies have not reported the same detrimental effect on blood lipids, including triglycerides (69-71,77). Routine monitoring of blood glucose levels and periodic lipid evaluations should be used to evaluate any adverse effects of sucrose substitution.<P> 
	The question of the use of fructose in the meal plan of persons with diabetes has been raised. Fructose, as well as sugar alcohols, does not require insulin for their initial metabolism. However, glucose newly formed from fructose and sugar alcohols in the liver requires insulin in the same way as dietary-derived glucose.<P>
	Compared with sucrose, fructose may result in a significantly lower serum glucose level and insulin response in subjects with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (78,79) and insulin-dependent diabetes (69). However, HFCS and sucrose have the same effect on blood glucose and insulin levels, and have not been shown to have a useful function in diets for persons with diabetes (80). The acute benefits of fructose on blood glucose are also limited to persons with moderately well-controlled diabetes (80). In a 3-month study, fructose in moderate amounts did not cause hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or abnormalities in triglyceride turnover in persons with non-insulin-dependent diabetes and mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia (81).<P>
	Polyols are also used as an alternative sweetener in some food products. Sorbitol and other polyols are slowly absorbed from the jejunum by passive diffusion. They enter the liver independent of insulin, are rapidly converted to fructose, and follow the same metabolic pathways as fructose.<p> 
	Fructose- or polyol-sweetened products can make a contribution to caloric intake and, therefore, must be taken into account when a desirable caloric level is planned.<P> 
	Quality of life for persons with diabetes may be perceived as improved by the use of nonnutritive sweeteners. Furthermore, no adverse effects on either acute or long-term glycemic control have been demonstrated from the use of aspartame (31,71). Nonnutritive sweeteners are safe to use and widely advocated and used by persons with diabetes.<P> 

<B>Hyperlipidemia</B><p> Studies have failed to support the hypothesis that sucrose consumption is associated with atherosclerotic heart disease (1). The effect of different carbohydrates on fasting cholesterol levels is modest and of no practical significance. Although a favorable plasma lipid and lipoprotein response has been reported for populations and individuals whose usual diet is high in carbohydrate, concern has been expressed over reports of a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and an increase in plasma triglycerides related to a high intake of carbohydrate. However, plasma triglycerides are not elevated in populations that habitually consume a high carbohydrate diet (82). Studies are needed to determine the effects of a high carbohydrate diet in general vs the type of carbohydrate (sweeteners, starch, fiber) on plasma lipid responses.<P>
	Studies suggest that whereas fructose does not appear to have notable effects on triglycerides in most normal and diabetic subjects, certain subpopulation(s) may be particularly susceptible to added fructose intake (78,83). There is little evidence that fructose consumption has adverse or beneficial effects on total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or apoproteins (84,85).<P>

<B>Pregnancy</B><p>The use of nonnutritive sweeteners during pregnancy has been investigated extensively. Saccharin can cross the placenta during pregnancy, although there is no evidence that saccharin is harmful to the fetus. However, avoiding excessive use during pregnancy would seem prudent.<P>
	Aspartame is safe for use during pregnancy, with the exception of women with phenylketonuria. Reproduction studies in laboratory animals show that consumption of aspartame at intake levels of at least three times the 99th percentile pose no risk to the mother or fetus (28-30). Of the three metabolites of aspartame, aspartate seems to be of little concern during pregnancy because it does not cross the placenta at anything less than enormous amounts. Phenylalanine does cross the placenta, but it is highly unlikely that customary intake could raise fetal levels close to the neurotoxic range. Little is known about placental transfer and fetal effects of methanol; however, the amount of methanol ingested is very small.<P> 
	In multigenerational studies, rats were fed diets containing 3% acesulfame K. Although acesulfame K crosses the placenta, reproduction studies, including teratogenicity, show reversibility and no adverse effects on fertility, number of animals per litter, birth weight, gross weight, and mortality. Thus, it can be concluded that acesulfame K is safe for use during pregnancy (42).<P>
	In two-generation rat studies, sucralose had no adverse effect on fertility or reproduction or on the developing fetus or newborn (47). When approved, it should also be safe for use during pregnancy.<P>
<H3>Conclusion</H3><p> 
Nutritive and nonnutritive sweeteners are safe to consume. Sweeteners, however, should be used in moderation and in the context of an otherwise nutritious and well-balanced diet. As new products are introduced to the market, continued monitoring of overall consumption of sweeteners would be prudent to ensure that intake levels do not rise above acceptable levels.<P>
	To take advantage of the benefits and to reduce any negative aspects of various nonnutritive sweeteners, a choice is helpful. To inform consumers, food products containing nonnutritive sweeteners should be clearly labeled with the specific type and amount, in milligrams, of nonnutritive sweetener(s) contained. Research into the possible risks of long-term use of nonnutritive sweeteners, either alone or in combination, should continue.

<br><br>
<B>Medical nutrition therapy</B> <br>Medical nutrition therapy involves the assessment of the nutritional status of patients with a condition, illness, or injury that puts them at risk. This includes review and analysis of medical and diet history, laboratory values, and anthropometric measurements. Based on the assessment, nutrition modalities most appropriate to manage the condition or treat the illness or injury are chosen and include the following:<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>Diet modification and counseling</I> leading to the development of a personal diet plan to achieve nutritional goals and desired health outcomes.<br>
<IMG SRC="gifs/marker2.gif"> <I>Specialized nutrition therapies</I> including supplementation with medical foods for those unable to obtain adequate nutrients through food intake only; enteral nutrition delivered via tube feeding into the gastrointestinal tract for those unable to ingest or digest food; and parenteral nutrition delivered via intravenous infusion for those unable to absorb nutrients (45).<p>

<B>Nutrition screening</B> The process of identifying characteristics known to be associated with nutrition problems. Its purpose is 
to pinpoint persons who are malnourished or at nutritional risk. Intervention takes place after screening occurs. The nutrition screening can be done by a health care team member (45).<p>

<B>Cost-effectiveness analysis</B> Compares two or more alternatives to achieve the same objective (46).<p>

<B>Cost-benefit analysis</B> This extends cost-effectiveness analysis by placing a dollar value on the outcomes (45,46).<p>

<P><B><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">EFFECT OF THE MEASURE ON THE EXISTING LAW:</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">On June 23, 1992, the City Council adopted Ordinance
92-5 imposing a Utility Users Tax at the rate of 3% of the charges made
for telephone, electricity, natural gas and water services. Because Proposition
218, adopted on November 5, 1996, requires such an ordinance to be approved
by the voters, the City has been holding utility taxes collected under Ordinance
92-5 in trust until the same is submitted to the voters for approval. The
City Council has placed on the ballot for the General Municipal Election
of March 4, 1997, the issue:</FONT></P>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000000">&quot;Shall Ordinance 97-1 ratifying the existing
Utility Users Tax adopted on June 23, 1992, be approved, limiting the rate
to the existing 3%?&quot;</FONT></I> <FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE=+1>(Measure
A)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A &quot;yes&quot; vote on Measure A ratifies the
existing 3% Utility Tax without any change or modification to Ordinance
92-5 which is approved retroactively to June 23, 1992.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">A &quot;no&quot; vote is a vote against continuing
the Utility Tax adopted by Ordinance 92-5. The effect of a &quot;no&quot;
vote would be to terminate the Utility Users Tax. A &quot;no&quot; vote
might result in court litigation as to the liability of the above utilities
or the City to return utility tax receipts now held in trust.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Measure A requires a simple majority vote to pass.
The Utility Tax would be limited to 3% of charges imposed for telephone,
electricity, natural gas and water services. This tax could not be increased
or imposed for any other utility service without being submitted to the
voters. The City Council, however, could at any time reduce or terminate
the tax.</FONT></P>

VOTE <BR>

The Director of Finance advises that a &quot;no&quot; vote would:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Reduce the cost of utility services to a typical
household in the approximate sum of $6.00 a month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Pending possible court litigation, require the
City to refund previously collected utility tax receipts held in trust resulting
in further reduction of City services in order to balance the budget.</FONT></P>

vote would:</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Continue the Utility Users Tax and release funds
now held in trust allowing the City to balance the City's budget, preventing
cuts in City programs or the emergency use of limited reserve funds.</FONT></P>

<TD WIDTH="72%" VALIGN="TOP"><P>A decade after federal agencies determined the  Los Angeles River will
no longer contain the runoff of a major storm, slow progress has begun on
building the parapet walls that will restore the river's flood control protection.</P>

<P>The Army Corps of Engineers has already built parapet walls on levees
that parallel a two-mile-long section of Compton Creek (see map).  Work
on the southern reach - from Ocean Boulevard to Willow Street in Long Beach
has just begun.  The next phase - from Willow Street to Long Beach Boulevard
 - is scheduled to start in mid-1997.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="graphics/map_la_river_project.gif" WIDTH="266" HEIGHT="326"
ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">If Congress had fully funded the project,
according to Chris Stone of the County Department of Public Works, it would
take five years to complete.  But, Congress has allocated only ten percent
of the project's $270 million cost.  (The federal government is supposed
to pay about 70 percent, with county residents picking up about 30 percent.)</P>

<P>At the current rate, the project could take 15 to 20 years.  As Stone
points out, costs could climb sharply due to inflation.  A longer timeline
gives Lakewood the worst of two worlds - more years in which the river might
flood and more years for the National Flood Insurance Program to collect
mandatory flood insurance premiums. </P>

<P>About half of Lakewood is in the Los Angeles River flood hazard zone.<BR>
</P>

<H3>Getting real relief</H3>

<P>Lakewood officials have been aggressive in getting real relief from the
burdens of mandatory flood insurance and building restrictions:</P>

<P>Congress passed a Lakewood-sponsored bill that lightens requirements
for property owners in an urban flood hazard zone. </P>

<P>The Federal Emergency Management Agency will release the final wording
of AR Zone regulations and flood insurance rate maps this year.</P>

<P>Lakewood has persuaded federal officials to accept the results of the
city's recent aerial survey of Lakewood neighborhoods.  It shows whole neighborhoods
and parts of blocks that are above projected flood levels.  Federal officials
have agreed to redraw flood maps to put these outside the flood zone.</P>

<P>The CityLine information service (925-4357 and press 909) has information
on the status of flood control projects.  Lakewood Online (www.LakewoodCity.org)
has in-depth reports.</P>

Lakewood residents are still waiting for publication of the final maps that
will trigger imposition of federal flood insurance. The maps, based on Corps
of Engineers' data and issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA), are tied to a new flood zone designation championed by Lakewood
and other cities on the flood plain. <BR>

Properties in Lakewood won't be hit with FEMA's draconian restrictions on
new and remodeled construction, which threatened to force construction &quot;on
stilts&quot; to keep homes and businesses above the hypothetical flood height.
And, homeowners will be able to buy federal flood insurance at a lower-cost,
subsidized rate. This Preferred Risk Policy program offers substantial savings-$170
a year for flood insurance versus $675 a year.<BR>
<BR>
Property owners in the flood zone are now bystanders in an odd sort of race.
Insurance requirements will end before the completion of the flood control
project in ten years or less. The longer FEMA takes to issue the flood insurance
rate maps, the less time property owners must pay flood insurance premiums.
Property owners can hope that the federal bureaucracy will lag behind a
faster moving flood control construction project. 
<H3><A NAME="anchor664131"></A>Flood Insurance</H3>
The requirement for federal flood insurance begins when FEMA releases a
Flood Insurance Rate Map for Lakewood. The potential good news for homeowners
is the likelihood that FEMA will not release the map for several months
-- until after Novemeber 1.<BR>
<BR>
About half of Lakewood is in the &quot;flood hazard zone&quot; that FEMA
says extends five miles from the Los Angeles River.<BR>
<BR>
All homes in the flood zone must have insurance, according to FEMA regulations,
but only those with a federally-guaranteed loan or a loan from a federally-insured
bank will be compelled to get the insurance. FEMA will encourage banks and
mortgage lenders to require their loan customers in the flood zone to buy
the insurance. FEMA's delay in implementing the flood insurance requirements
means homeowners have time to evaluate the risk to their property and make
a decision to buy the insurance. For general information on federal flood
insurance, call FEMA at 1-800-427-4661.<BR>

<P><I>(From Lakewood Living </I>Newsletter<I>, July 1995)<BR>
</I><BR>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency has announced plans to issue Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) that will trigger new flood insurance requirements
for homeowners. For many Lakewood residents, it's all a confusing jumble.
What do FIRMs and FEMA have to do with them?<BR>
<BR>
<B>Here are some of the answers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Q. Who has to buy insurance?</B><BR>
<BR>
A. The simplest answer is that homeowners with a federally-insured mortgage
(or through a federally-insured lending institution) will be required by
their lender to buy flood insurance. The requirement could come any time
after the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) publishes insurance
rate maps for the region.<BR>
<BR>
Not every homeowner in Lakewood will be affected, however: <BR>
<BR>
Homes that are paid for, and homes not financed by a federally-insured lender,
won't be required to buy the insurance, since the demand to buy insurance
comes from the lender. Homes that are not in the flood zone won't have to
buy insurance. Only about 47 percent of the city is in the flood zone (<A HREF="flood_map_page.html">see
a general zone map</A>). The rest of the city is outside.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. Should I buy insurance?</B><BR>
<BR>
A. The short answer is, you should consider buying flood insurance to get
the best rate if you live in the flood plain, if your home is not on a raised
pad, and if you want supplemental flood insurance that your home-owners'
policy doesn't provide.<BR>
<BR>
You should make the choice to buy flood insurance the same way you may have
already chosen to buy-or not buy-earthquake insurance. Consider the risk,
the cost of insurance, the deductible, and the potential extent of damage
to your home.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. Is there any way to avoid the insurance requirement?</B><BR>
<BR>
A. The Planning Section of the Community Development Department can assist
property owners by answering the basic question: &quot;Am I in the flood
zone?&quot; The department has a preliminary map that shows the boundaries
of the flood hazard area.<BR>
<BR>
Homes that are in the flood zone, but are on a raised pad that puts the
pad above the predicted flood level, won't have to buy the insurance, if
the homeowner requests a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA. City
officials are working on a process whereby they can submit a single letter
exempting about half of the homes in the Lakewood flood hazard zone. These
homes are at least three inches above the base flood elevation for 100-year
flood levels.<BR>
<BR>
Based on a detailed aerial survey the city recently conducted, less than
six thousand homes in the flood zone are likely to be subject to flood insurance
requirements and building restrictions.<BR>
<BR>
To save residents the cost of an individual field survey for each home,
Lakewood city officials are negotiating with FEMA to accept the city's aerial
survey as the basis for a LOMA. FEMA, however, hasn't yet developed procedures
for accepting the city's data without a field survey.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. What's the reason for the flood insurance and building restriction
requirements?</B><BR>
<BR>
A. When the Army Corps of Engineers found that the Los Angeles River flood
control system no longer provided protection from a so-called &quot;100-year
flood,&quot; FEMA took steps to impose insurance and building restriction
requirements.<BR>
<BR>
Lakewood is working with the Corps of Engineers, the County Board of Supervisors,
and the County Flood Control District to get work started on rebuilding
the flood protection of the L.A. River. The river project could be finished
within seven to ten years. When the river no longer poses a flood threat,
FEMA will drop the insurance requirement.<BR>

<P><B>&quot;Team Lakewood,&quot;</B> says Cavanaugh &quot;is the best way
to describe the work of the city's patrol deputies, five Specially Assigned
Officers (SAOs), civilian Volunteers on Patrol members, crossing guards,
SANE program deputies, four hundred Neighborhod Watch block captains, Lakewood
Auto Watch participants, the merchants in Lakewood Business Watch, and the
city staff in Lakewood Park Watch. These members of the Lakewood team made
city neighborhoods even safer in 1996.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Serious crime drops again.</B> Major crimes (including robbery, burglary,
auto theft, and assualt) dropped another 13 percent from January to the
end of October, 1996. The decline accelerated the previous year's 7.2 percent
drop. Compared to the same period in 1994, serious crime is down a total
of 19.7 percent.</P>

<P><B>Downward trend in crime.</B> Serious crimes of all types in Lakewood
have declined every year since 1994. Some types of crime have fallen dramatically.
Compared to the same period in 1994, car thefts fell 30.6 percent. Robbery
reports in the same period dropped 25 percent. Burglaries averaged just
1.05 a day.<BR>
</P>

<H2>Grand Theft Auto down 20%</H2>

<P><B>More deputies.</B> &quot;Team Lakewood&quot; benefitted from $170,000
in federal law enforcement funds that will expand deputies' patrol time
in Lakewood.</P>

<P><B>More volunteers.</B> The Sheriff's Community Academy in 1996 graduated
a new corps of informed Lakewood residents who now have a better understanding
of the department and its procedures. Nearly 2,000 Lakewood residents and
block captains attended the largest ever Neighborhood Watch Public Safety
Expo at Del Valle Park.</P>

<P><B>More information.</B> With computer equipment and staffing funded
by the city's three-year/$600,000 federal law enforcement grant, the Crime
Analysis Unit at the Lakewood Station began tracking career criminals in
the Lakewood region. The system sifts data collected on 30,000 crimes and
known criminals, leading to more arrests, convictions, and longer prison
terms.</P>

<P><B>30 years for Sky Knight.</B> The city's pioneering helicopter patrol
unit celebrated thirty years of aerial law enforcement and the purchase
of a new ship to replace a veteran, twenty-year-old helicopter.</TD></TR>

<H2>Information when you need it! - <A HREF="cityline_numbers.html">Try
out CityLine</A></H2>
Lakewood residents and businesses can now obtain information, services,
records and forms by telephone from city hall 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
thanks to a new automated citizen's information system (ACIS) called CityLine.<BR>
<BR>
Using any touchtone telephone, residents and businesses can access, at their
convenience, over 200 pre-recorded informational messages about everything
from dog licenses to library hours. The new CityLine service will also automatically
fax selected documents or forms to callers saving them time and needless
trips to city hall.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The CityLine system is not meant to replace person-to-person contact,&quot;
assures Don Waldie, Lakewood's public information officer. &quot;It is a
way to enhance our ability to provide important information and services
to the public.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;CityLine is part of our effort to maintain a strong relationship between
Lakewood citizens and local government. &quot;For example, a person calling
CityLine on a Saturday night could learn a great deal about our graffiti
removal policy and leave a recorded service request to have the graffiti
removed. There's no need to wait until Monday. That's more convenient, faster
service thanks to CityLine,&quot; notes Waldie.<BR>
<BR>
CityLine was developed by TeleWorks, Inc. TeleWorks has created similar
systems over the past ten years for governments in 21 states. Fullerton,
Downey, Norwalk, Rancho Cucamonga, Rialto and other southern California
communities have installed on-line systems like Lakewood's CityLine. The
city of Boulder, CO reported immediate success with its system. Boulder
received 5,200 calls tallying 323 hours the first month and 4,300 calls
the second month.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've contacted a number of communities who all report they are satisfied
with their phone system from TeleWorks,&quot; Waldie reports. &quot;We hope
Lakewood residents will explore CityLine and find it a useful resource,
too.&quot; Funding for CityLine was obtained from state grants. &quot;CityLine
will be able to provide a large amount of basic information to people and
possibly answer some or all of their questions about a given subject,&quot;
Waldie explains. &quot;Should they need to discuss their problem with someone
at city hall, it will require less time for both residents and staff to
resolve problems or fulfill requests. &quot;We hope people will appreciate
CityLine as the next best thing to keeping city hall open 365 days a year,
fully staffed around the clock...but a lot cheaper!&quot;<BR>

<H3><CENTER>A Lakewood city council 'liaison committee' is working with
grassroots organizers<BR>
to support the formation of the proposed school district</CENTER>
</H3>

|</CENTER>
<P>Grassroots community organizers and a committee of city council members
are continuing to discuss the formation of an independent school district.
It would include the city's three high schools and sixteen elementary and
middle schools. School district organizers, at the urging of the city council,
met with the city attorney to learn the results of earlier efforts to form
a Lakewood district. The city is considering hiring a consultant experienced
in school district formation. The consultant would advise the city on the
state's requirements for starting a new school district.<BR>
<BR>
Currently, Lakewood schools are part of four different districts. About
12,000 Lakewood students attend elementary and high schools in the Long
Beach school district (with 5,700 Lakewood students), the ABC district (with
3,600 Lakewood students), and the Bellflower school district (with 2,500
Lakewood students). Only 200 Lakewood youngsters attend Paramount district
schools. Another 2,000 students attend private and parochial schools.<BR>
<BR>
Community organizers and city officials have considered the formation of
a Lakewood school district before, most recently in the mid-1970s. According
to Greg Magnuson, a consultant on school district formation who is a staff
member of the Los Angeles County Committee on School District Organization,
the proposed district faces evaluation by county and state school officials
and could take three years. <BR>
<BR>
The members of the grassroots organizing committee are undismayed by the
district formation process. Lakewood organizers feel they have learned from
recent attempts at creating new district boundaries elsewhere in the county.
<H3><A NAME="anchor715337"></A><A NAME="anchor720862"></A>The process</H3>
School district organizers must make a formal request to the county school
organization committee before gathering signatures for an election. Once
the committee has validated the petition, it will be sent, along with the
committee's recommendations, to the State Board of Education.<BR>
<BR>
If the state board approves the request, it will set the boundaries of the
election area and order the county to hold an election. The state board
could make the voting area for the election as small as the area included
in the proposed boundaries of the new district or as large as the combined
area of all four existing districts.

<BR>
The state board uses nine criteria to evaluate school district boundary
proposals before ordering an election. The Lakewood organizers feel confident
that their proposal will easily meet most of the board's criteria. Less
certain, however, is the board's reaction to the new district's effect on
classroom space and school population, including changes in ethnicity, and
the possible formal opposition of city officials in Bellflower and Long
Beach.<BR>

<H2>Lakewood School District Update:<BR>
Organizers seek petition signatures</H2>
<B>Petition drive underway for Lakewood schools</B><BR>
Organizers of a Lakewood school district need more than 11,000 signatures
to convince county school officials to create a Lakewood Unified School
District.<BR>
<A HREF="school_dist_lg_map.html">Large version of school district map</A><BR>
<A HREF="school_dist_lg_map.html"><IMG SRC="graphics/map_lakewood_school_sm.gif"
WIDTH="612" HEIGHT="347" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" BORDER="0"></A><BR>
Grassroots community organizers have begun collecting the thousands of signatures
needed to<BR>
petition the Los Angeles County Committee on School District Organization
and the State Board of<BR>
Education to hold an election to create a Lakewood Unified School District.<BR>
<BR>
Registered voters who are residents of the Lakewood, Long Beach, Bellflower,
and Cerritos<BR>
neighborhoods to be included in the new district boundaries are qualified
to the sign the election<BR>
petition. The school district drive does not have a mandated deadline to
collect the 11,000 to 15,000<BR>
voter signatures that are needed. Organizers expect to collect the signatures
quickly, however.<BR>
<BR>
The proposed school district would unify Lakewood schools, currently divided
by the<BR>
boundaries of four districts. The new unified district would take in the
entire city of Lakewood,<BR>
Lakewood Village in Long Beach, and neighborhoods in Bellflower and Cerritos
near Mayfair High<BR>
School. It would be responsible for all the public schools inside the proposed
boundaries, including the<BR>
three public high schools in Lakewood.<BR>
<BR>
About 12,000 public school students attend elementary and high schools in
Lakewood. Most are<BR>
in the Long Beach school district (with 5,700 students in Lakewood schools)
and the ABC district (with<BR>
3,600 students in Lakewood). The Bellflower school district has 2,500 students
in Lakewood. Only 200<BR>
Lakewood youngsters attend Paramount district schools.<BR>
<BR>
Lakewood school district organizers are hopeful a recent change in state
law--and greater<BR>
flexibility by State Board of Education members--can make a Lakewood school
district possible. <BR>
Lakewood residents have attempted to consolidate schools, or form a Lakewood-only
school district,<BR>
several times during the city's 42-year history, most recently in the late
1970s.<BR>
<BR>
The petitions calling for a school district election are only the first
step in the multi-year process<BR>
of creating a new district. <BR>

<H1>Q &amp; A:</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2>LAKEWOOD UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT</H2>
By Greg Magnuson<I> (originally published in Lakewood Living Newsletter
6/96)<BR>
<BR>
</I><B>To assist Lakewood residents in becoming more informed about<BR>
the process of establishing a new school district, <I>Lakewood Living</I><BR>
invited Mr. Greg Magnuson, a staff consultant on school district<BR>
formation for the Los Angeles County Committee on School<BR>
District Organization, to answer a few key questions about local<BR>
control, financial, tax and public safety issues.<BR>
<BR>
Q. Has any school district formation like the one proposed in Lakewood ever
been successfully completed?</B><BR>
<BR>
A. Not in recent history. The Lakewood USD proposal has two unique characteristics:
First, the district would be an entirely new school district. Most unified
school districts evolve from an elementary district and/or a portion of
a high school district and thereby benefit by starting with the administrative
structure of the existing school district in place. There have been several
attempts in California since 1975 to form new unified school districts from
the &quot;ground up.&quot; Most recent attempts include the formation of
a Lomita Unified (L. A. County), which is currently pending hearing and
disposition before the State Board of Education; a Folsom Unified (Sacramento
County), and a Grand Terrace Unified (San Bernardino County). These latter
two proposed districts were defeated in the March 26 election.<BR>
<BR>
Secondly, the new Lakewood USD is expected to be formed from four existing
school districts. This is unique. No other new school district in recent
history has been created from more than two existing school districts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. One of the conditions required to be substantially met is that the
reorganization of the districts must not promote racial or ethnic discrimination
or segregation. What factors are considered?</B><BR>
<BR>
A. The County Committee will evaluate a number of factors to determine whether
any racial imbalance will be so disproportionate that minority students
will be isolated from other students and thus be deprived of an integrated
education experience. Assessments are made regarding the number and percentage
of pupils in each racial/ethnic group affected by the proposal; trends in
possible future population changes existing anti-segregation school board
policies, as well as the racial/ethnic make-up of staff and administration.<BR>
<BR>
In the past, the state has disallowed district formation due to small percentage
shifts in racial composition between districts. It has been indicated that
the Lakewood proposal may involve a shift of racial/ethnic ratios as much
as 20%-30%.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. The district organizing committee will draw the boundary of the proposed
school district, but the SBE will set the election boundary. Would only
voters in the Lakewood portion of the school reorganization plan vote on
it or must ALL voters in the four districts have a say?</B><BR>
<BR>
A. It's too early to say. The State Board of Education does have the authority
to establish the election area. They have policy guidelines in place to
assist them in making a determination of who will be allowed to vote on
a reorganization issue.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. What official role does the city have?</B><BR>
<BR>
A. City entities do not have an official role in the reorganization (formation)
of school districts unless the school district is, or will be subject to
a city charter, which is not the case in Lakewood. Within Los Angeles County,
school district reorganization is under the authority of the County Committee
and the SBE. The process may be initiated by an individual, community group,
school district governing board or the County Committee.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Q. Who verifies that the financial assumptions of the proposed district
are correct and that the new district can be financially successful? Is
there any guaranteed protection for Lakewood taxpayers that a new district
won't raise their taxes?</B><BR>
<BR>
A. As a part of the studies conducted by the County Committee and the State
Board of Education, the financial assumptions and probability of financial
solvency of the new and affected districts are reviewed. Both entities will
make their individual judgments known as a part of the reorganization proceedings.
There is no guarantee that the new district won't propose new taxes in Lakewood.
However, additional taxes associated with the new school district can only
be incurred with the approval of the district electorate.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In response to the growing violence perpetrated by and against California's

<P>In the most recent report issued by the task force in February, George
A. Caravalho, task force chairperson, stated:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><I>&quot;Quite simply, the policies of building more prisons and hiring
  more law enforcement officers have not stemmed the tide of rising youth
  violence and fear in our communities. The state corrections budget has
  been growing substantially more than our investment in education! In an
  era when all government budgets are becoming more limited, we must develop
  cooperative community partnerships which enable us to pool talent and financial
  resources into forward looking, preventive youth intervention programs.&quot;</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">This comes as no surprise to Lakewood. In fact, community
leaders have employed the strategy of forming cooperative community partnerships
for decades to meet the needs of kids like Joseph and their families, according
to Dave Rodda, Lakewood's director of recreation and community services.</P>

<P>&quot;In Lakewood, achieving 'Crime Prevention Through Community Service'
has been a common practice for some forty years,&quot; proclaims Rodda.
&quot;Over the years, the city council has provided the funding to meet
Lakewood's changing service needs, particularly for youth and families.
We have developed community partnerships in the delivery of services as
evidenced by the 60,000 volunteer hours the city received in 1995.&quot;
</P>

<P>Rodda insists Lakewood must continually strive to improve in the face
of societal changes. &quot;We cannot rest on past accomplishments or accept
any level of mediocrity in the services we provide,&quot; he affirms. &quot;Therefore,
in 1996, the city will focus on two special areas that will impact both
the youth and families of Lakewood.</P>

<P>&quot;First, we have designated a coordinator for youth service programs.
He will work with the middle and high school teachers and administrators
to develop a series of youth services activities. The very successful Totally
Friday Night for middle schools will be continued at the Lakewood Youth
Center at Del Valle Park.</P>

<P>&quot;Second, we are committed to providing safe and well-maintained
recreation facilities. Working with the Sheriff's Department, our park watch
program will be enhanced utilizing the Sheriff's Volunteers on Patrol. We
will increase staff supervision at parks with high use on weekends and evenings.&quot;</TD></TR>

made to athletic facilities at Bloomfield Park.</P>

<P>&quot;1996 will be a year of renewed commitment to Lakewood's young adults
and to providing recreation facilities and programs for all to enjoy,&quot;
said Rodda.</P>

<P>Apparently, more communities are looking to make increased investments
in their youth much as Lakewood has done for decades. Through such prevention
and intervention programs, it is hoped the number of youngsters caught up
in violence as victims, witnesses or perpetrators can be significantly reduced.</P>

<P>If nothing is done, according to the Investing in Our Youth Task Force,
not only Joseph, but ultimately all our children in our state should be
considered &quot;at risk.&quot; </TD></TR>

<HR></CENTER>
<H1>Listening to Lakewood</H1>
<B>1620 AM is a community information resource. In a disaster, it will become
Lakewood's lifeline.</B><BR>
<BR>
You may have seen the blue-and-white signs on street lights and at the entrances
to the city. &quot;Lakewood info/Tune radio to/1620 AM.&quot; The message
is to tune your car radio to the city's new radio service, at 1620 AM. Just
about every radio made since 1990 can receive city information broadcasts,
including portable radios and table models. Even older car radios, particularly
those in Japanese and European makes, can pull in the city's 10-watt station.
<BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="graphics/radiotow.gif" WIDTH="102" HEIGHT="135" ALIGN=

<P>Just ten watts of broadcast power hardly seem like much--the average
light bulb glows with 250 watts. Still, ten watts are enough for 1620 AM
to reach all 9.5 square miles of Lakewood from the city's maintenance yard
on Arbor Road. The city is pioneering the use of low-power radio for community
information--along with Pasadena, Burbank, and other cities.<BR>
<BR>
Although Lakewood has been cablecasting city-produced programs since 1981
on cable Channel 31, only about half the city's households are cable subscribers.
Lakewood's AM radio service, which uses the high frequency region of the
AM broadcast spectrum, can be received by any AM or AM/FM radio made since
1990.<BR>
<BR>
That's when the federal government began encouraging local governments to
use AM radio for &quot;travelers' information services&quot; or TIS. TIS
radio is already familiar at airports in the Los Angeles area, where tuning
to TIS advises motorists of parking conditions.<BR>
<BR>
As a community information service, TIS radio in Lakewood has two roles.
According to Linda Price, who oversees both the city's cable television
and radio programming, &quot;1620 AM tells residents about city programs,
offers recycling tips, advises them on disaster preparedness, and highlights
city facilities like The Centre at Sycamore Plaza. In a disaster, 1620 AM
will be Lakewood's information lifeline.&quot; 
<H3>Rumor control, disaster relief<IMG SRC="graphics/radiotow.gif" WIDTH=
"102" HEIGHT="135" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></H3>
The Northridge earthquake taught Southern California communities that regional
news media can't handle the volume of information that residents need in
the days and weeks following a disaster.<BR>
<BR>
In Burbank, the city hall switchboard was flooded with phone calls about
the need to boil contaminated water, widely reported by the news media after
the earthquake. But, that report only applied to a limited area and not
Burbank.<BR>
<BR>
Burbank city officials were never able to get the regional news media to
revise their story on water conditions, and thousands of Burbank residents
needlessly worried about the safety of their drinking water.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;A citywide radio service will broadcast Lakewood-specific information
directly to residents.&quot; notes Price. &quot;Anyone who has a car or
a battery-powered radio, made after 1990, will be able to monitor 1620 AM,
even if all electrical power is out. Our transmitter is small and tough.
It's in a protected facility supplied with backup power. And, we're training
our staff to get 1620 AM up and running almost as soon as the shaking stops.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lakewood's radio service is automated; you won't hear the banter of drive-time
DJ's on 1620 AM. You will hear a changing menu of information about recreation
programs, access to city services, and training on how to protect you and
your family in a disaster.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Until a disaster, think of 1620 AM as the city service guide on radio,&quot;
Price suggests. &quot;You could tune in for a reminder on trash collection
standards or the timing of street sweeping. You could also learn how to
schedule a picnic shelter at a city park. If you wanted to know about destinations
in Lakewood, like The Centre at Sycamore Plaza, Lakewood radio will tell
you.&quot; <BR>

<H1>State of Public Safety</H1>
<B>By Captain Marv Cavanaugh - Lakewood Sheriff's Station Commander</B><BR>
<BR>
Commanding the Lakewood Sheriff's Station makes me responsible for the safety
of 74,000 Lakewood residents and more than 120,000 in Artesia, Bellflower,
Cerritos, and Paramount. The Lakewood Station is the largest in the department;
it is the birthplace of the 42 year partnership between the Sheriff's Department
and the &quot;contract cities&quot; that depend on Sheriff's deputies for
law enforcement.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="graphics/marv.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" WIDTH="85"
HEIGHT="123"> Captain Marv Cavanaugh<BR>
Commanding the Lakewood Station is a big job by any measure. It's one I've
been preparing for during my twenty-five years of service, first as a reserve
deputy-when I was paid just $1 a year-through the Sheriff's Academy and
assignments as deputy, sergeant, and lieutenant. I've been at the Lakewood
Station since 1992, when I was assigned to oversee the Long Beach Project,
during which deputies patrolled the northern and eastern neighborhoods of
Long Beach. In 1993 I became the station's Operation's Lieutenant under
Captain John Anderson and Captain Frank Vadurro. More than half my years
with the department have been in contract cities like Lakewood.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Ahead of demand</B><BR>
I've seen the success of the &quot;Lakewood plan&quot; for contract law
enforcement. Lower-cost, flexible contracting has let Lakewood stay ahead
of community demand for new and expanded law enforcement services. But contracting
hasn't meant any loss of community identity. The city's 1995 survey showed
the Sheriff's Department has an 81 percent &quot;positive&quot; rating among
Lakewood residents.<BR>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="graphics/crimestat.gif" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM" WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="139"></CENTER>
<P>With 400 block captains in Neighborhood Watch, another thirty <A HREF="vop.html">Volunteers
on Patrol (VOP)</A> involved in &quot;Team Lakewood,&quot; and a recent
Citizen Academy graduating class, Lakewood has one of the most active crime
prevention programs in the county.<BR>
<BR>
Since 1990, Lakewood city officials have built upon neighborhood support
for Sheriff's law enforcement by increasing the number of black-and-white
patrol units on city streets, expanding the successful Specially Assigned
Officer (SAO) program to five team members, and launching new crime prevention
programs like Lakewood Business Watch.<BR>
<BR>
Their effort is paying off. Overall, serious crime is down 10 percent in
Lakewood.<BR>
Aggravated assault is down 23 percent. Auto theft is down 11 percent. Residential
and business burglary is down 6 percent. The steep drop in neighborhood
crime continues a downward trend over the past three years that matches
Lakewood's build up of the SAO program, dedicated patrol units, Neighborhood
Watch, and Volunteers on Patrol.<BR>
<BR>
<B>The year ahead - </B>Where does Lakewood law enforcement go from here?<BR>
<BR>
I want the deputies and civilian personnel of the Lakewood Station to be
ready for law enforcement in the 21st century. We've already begun a Crime
Analysis unit, with a $600,000 state grant, that will let deputies track
crime patterns throughout the region. More data means more efficient deployment
of Sheriff's units, better odds for catching criminals, and swifter and
surer conviction of those we arrest. Crime fighting isn't just about more
deputies on the street; it's also about working smarter.<BR>
<BR>
I want to deepen the tradition of &quot;community-based policing&quot; that
distinguishes Lakewood law enforcement. My mission-and the mission of the
men and women under my command-is preservation of Lakewood's quality of
life. To meet that goal, programs like Neighborhood Watch, VOPs, the city's
bike patrols, and the SAOs are bringing crime prevention and suppression
down to the neighborhood level. In 1996, the Lakewood Station will focus
even more on reflecting Lakewood's community and neighborhood values.<BR>
<IMG SRC="graphics/copcar_headon.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"
WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="124"> <BR>
We need more crime prevention volunteers. Frankly, I won't be satisfied
until every neighborhood has a Watch unit, every business owner is a member
of Business Watch, and every car is enrolled in Lakewood Auto Watch. I believe
excellence in law enforcement isn't a single act; it's a habit. Despite
the prolonged recession, Lakewood and the other contract cities have expanded
basic Sheriff's services with more SAOs, dedicated patrol units, and Community
Service Officers. As Lakewood's investment in crime prevention has gone
up, the city's crime rate has gone down. <BR>
<BR>
Lakewood has had forty-two years of excellence in law enforcement. My job
in 1996 is to keep that record of success going. <BR>

<HR>Fire Captain Clint Kaller, who helped write the fire department's disaster
preparedness plan, has another plan scaled for Lakewood neighborhoods. It's
called Community Awareness in Response to Emergencies-C.A.R.E.-and it's
showing residents how to care for themselves, their families, and their
neighbors in the critical hours after a major earthquake or other disaster.
<BLOCKQUOTE><IMG SRC="graphics/clint_kaller.gif" WIDTH="126" HEIGHT="150"
ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="1"> Fire Captain Clint Kaller</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
C.A.R.E. is the newest step in the city's fifteen-year effort to educate
Lakewood residents about emergency preparedness and earthquake survival,&quot;
Kaller points out. &quot;We train residents to manage their own family response
first, and then how to work with other neighborhood residents for mutual
aid in a disaster. Our goal is a network of trained disaster teams with
the skills needed to respond in an emergency.<BR>
<BR>
County disaster officials have been advising residents since the Northridge
earthquake that they will be &quot;on their own&quot; for the first seventy-two
hours following a major earthquake. A region-wide disaster will strain all
disaster response agencies, making self-help imperative for residents.<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="graphics/shakey_cup.gif" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="144" ALIGN="MIDDLE"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> <IMG SRC="graphics/seimicjag.gif" WIDTH="24" HEIGHT=

be prepared to be on your own for three days!</B><IMG SRC="graphics/seimicjag.gif"
WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="19" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
<BR>
&quot;C.A.R.E. is part of Lakewood's response to the county's warning,&quot;
Kaller notes. &quot;C.A.R.E. is a training program for self-sufficiency,
as well as an inventory of residents whose skills will be needed after a
disaster. As the program grows, we'll start to assign responsibilities to
residents willing to become neighborhood leaders in a disaster. We'll expect
a lot from C.A.R.E. members. I'm happy to say, the residents I've trained
so far are eager to take on the job.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Kaller has recruited block captains from the city's Neighborhood Watch program
to canvass their neighborhoods for volunteers to enroll in the four-part
C.A.R.E. course. The first C.A.R.E. graduating class included retired residents,
husbands and wives of new families, and even a geologist.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Training program</B><BR>
<BR>
The city's training program emphasizes taking care of family members first,
before turning to help neighbors. &quot;Your home . . . your family . .
. comes first,&quot; Kaller emphasizes. &quot;C.A.R.E. begins with home
and family disaster preparedness. In follow-up classes we look at fire prevention,
assessing building safety, and utility shut-off, starting with the participant's
own home.<BR>
<BR>
The four C.A.R.E. classes, offered over successive weeks, cover these topics,
along with communications in a disaster and security. C.A.R.E. also will
offer advanced courses in first aid, mass care and shelter through the Red
Cross.<BR>
<BR>
Ideally, C.A.R.E. members will be able to help each other and their neighbors
to dig out of a disaster and begin supplying basic relief until county and
federal disaster workers can take over. <BR>

<H1>Home improvement, Lakewood style</H1>

<H2>No monthly payments and easier asset rules<BR>
Fixing up the house couldn't be simpler!</H2>

<P>New asset rules now make it easier for seniors, families with moderate
incomes, and disabled residents to qualify for Lakewood's federally funded
home improvement loan programs. Since 1978, when the first of the city's
loan programs began, nearly 1,000 families and seniors have received home
improvement loans worth $5.9 million. <BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="graphics/loan_family.jpg" WIDTH="338" HEIGHT="205" ALIGN="RIGHT"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
Most of these loans have been made under the city's Single Family Residential
Rehabilitation Loan Program. The program can finance up to $9,000 in interior
and exterior repairs for owner-occupied homes.<BR>
<BR>
Even though recipients get a loan, not a grant, they find that repayment
is easy. According to Housing Specialist Michelle Ramirez, who manages the
program, &quot;These are deferred payment loans. The principle is paid in
a lump sum when the home is sold, ownership transferred, or the house refinanced.
The loan has zero-percent interest and no monthly payments.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Loan repayments keep the funding pool full; nearly $2.3 million has been
recycled into the program.<BR>
<BR>
Ramirez estimates that the single-family home loan program this year will
finance about thirty-five new loans worth $315,000.<BR>
<BR>
Because the loans are financed through a federal program, loan recipients
must meet eligibility requirements: recipients must own and occupy their
Lakewood house, the repairs must be necessary to make the house more livable,
and the recipient must meet income and asset limits.<BR>
<BR>
For example, a family of two would have to earn less than $32,850 annually
to qualify, while a family of four must earn less than $41,050 per year.
<BR>
</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><B>Applications for home improvement loans are available from the Community
    Development Department by calling 866-9771, extension 2321. <BR>
    <BR>
    The CityLine service provides an overview of the program and a copy of
    the application form that can be faxed to your home or office. Call 925-4357
    and press 391.<BR>
    </B></P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Higher asset limits now make it possible for even more homeowners to
qualify. Under the old rules, a family could have no more than $20,000 in
assets. (An asset includes stocks, checking accounts, savings accounts,
or an IRA.) The applicant's home, one automobile, and furnishings are not
counted in the asset limit. <BR>
<BR>
The asset limit went to $35,000 on July 1, and it will grow to $50,000 at
the start of the next fiscal year. The limit will be reviewed annually after
that for possible adjustment based on median family incomes for the Lakewood-Long
Beach area.<BR>

<H3>Removing Graffiti<BR>
A little background . . .</H3>

<P>Lakewood has made graffiti removal one of its major priorities. The city
spends more than $100,000 a year on removing graffiti from public and private
property.</P>

<P>City laws and tougher enforcement by Sheriff's deputies have cracked
down on graffiti vandalism.</P>

<P><B>Access Releases</B> <BR>
A customer service representative will send your request to the city Public
Works Department for action.<BR>
<BR>
Depending on where the graffiti is located, and our access to the property,
removal should take less than five working days.</P>

<P>Longer response times occur when private property owners refuse to give
city crews access to their property to remove the graffiti.</TD>

Fortunately, the city already has advance permission to remove graffiti
on nearly all business locations in Lakewood and on many residential sites.
If we have your release on file, the graffiti will be removed within five
days.<BR>
<BR>
<B>If you have not filled out a release</B>, please complete it and return
it as soon as possible. The access release gives city workers permission
to enter your private property to remove the graffiti.</P>

<P>Once your release is on file, the graffiti will be removed within five
working days.</P>

<P><B>Graffiti removal</B></P>

<P>City crews remove graffiti from areas where it is visible to the public.
<BR>
You may paint out the graffiti yourself. Removing the graffiti yourself
lets you match paint colors exactly.</P>

<P><B>City crews use color matching equipment</B> that can match most original
paint colors. Residents may, however, remove it themselves. The removal
by residents should be done in a timely manner.</P>

<P><B>Only the graffiti-marked area is painted out.</B> The remainder of
the wall or fence is left untouched. City crews generally remove graffiti
during weekday hours.</P>

<P><B>More graffiti</B></P>

<P>Call us immediately if the graffiti reappears. The access release you
signed gives us permission to remove graffiti at your location for an entire
year.</TD></TR>

<A NAME="anchor126548"></A><B>TREE MAINTENANCE</B><BR>
The city maintains the parkway trees along residential streets.<BR>
<BR>
Some trees have reached the limit of their growth and have begun to damage
sidewalks and curbs. The city is replacing these trees with more appropriate
tree species.<BR>
<BR>
Report damage to sidewalks and curbs to the Service Request Representative
at 866-9771, extension 2140. <BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor1065499"></A><B>TREES AND SEWERS</B><BR>
The sewer lateral -- which connects home plumbing to the main sewer line
-- is the responsibility of the homeowner.<BR>
<BR>
As the laterals age, they crack and leak, letting tree roots enter the pipe
to create a block. A cracked and clogged sewer lateral should be repaired
or replaced.<BR>
<BR>
You can reduce the chance of future clogs in an aging sewer lateral. Have
the roots removed by a plumber, then apply a copper sulfate solution.<BR>
<BR>
Street trees are removed when they meet the city's replacement criteria.
The city will not remove a healthy tree just because its roots have entered
a broken sewer lateral. <BR>

The sewer lateral -- which connects home plumbing to the main sewer line

the roots removed by a plumber, then apply a copper sulfate solution.<BR>

a broken sewer lateral.<BR>

locked for the night, residents' questions about city services are still
being answered, reservations are being made for recreation classes, building
permit applications are being faxed, and residents are making service requests.</P>

<P>Welcome to the &quot;virtual&quot; Lakewood City Hall, open all day,
every day, thanks to the Lakewood Online website and the CityLine telephone
information system.</P>

<P>The two new services join cable Channel 31 and 1620 AM as 24-hour resources
for information about city programs and services. Lakewood Online and CityLine
offer something more, however, than the city's cable and radio channels.
Lakewood Online and CityLine are fully interactive. The two-way, twenty-four-hour
city hall is a reality in Lakewood.</P>

<H3>How technology is paying off </H3>

<P>There are real payoffs for Lakewood residents . . . and city government
. . . in a &quot;virtual&quot; city hall. Not only do fast, relatively low
cost computers and software programs make it possible for city hall to stay
&quot;open&quot; twenty-four hours a day, but the technology also shortens
the time it takes to process residents' requests for service and information.</P>

<P>Lakewood Online has a &quot;Customer Service Counter&quot; where residents
with Internet access can e-mail a request to city hall to repair a street
light, remove graffiti, or report an abandoned vehicle. CityLine has a similar
service, requiring a touchtone phone, for recording service requests.</P>

<P>Service representatives at city hall respond to Lakewood Online e-mail
and CityLine recorded requests on the city's next business day. If you need
more information about a city program or service, staff members will call
back with the information or a referral. If we need more information from
you, we'll call you at your daytime phone number.</P>

<P>The technology payoff is improved responsiveness and greater access for
residents and cost savings for the city.</P>

<P><B>It's 'high touch' too</B></P>

<P>The technology behind our Lakewood Online website and CityLine automated
information system won't replace the &quot;human touch&quot; that residents
want and expect from city hall. As John Naisbitt points out in his book
Megatrends, &quot;Whenever new technology is introduced, there must be a
counterbalancing human response-high touch-or the 'high tech' is rejected.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;High touch&quot; complements &quot;high tech&quot; at Lakewood's
twenty-four hour city hall, because the new services are fully interactive:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><B>CityLine has a &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot;</B> section
  that directs callers to the most asked questions about city services and
  advises callers how to record a service request.</P>
  <P><B>Lakewood Online includes a powerful website search engine</B> that
  allows users to find what they are looking for by typing key words or just
  general concepts. The city's website also includes hundreds of hypertext
  links to related information elsewhere on the website or on other sites
  throughout the World Wide Web. </P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><IMG SRC="../inside/graphics/mike3dspshoplow.jpg" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT=
"170" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN="LEFT"></P>

<P>Real people will respond all day, every day, if residents have a service
emergency-a water leak or a downed stop sign, for example. After business
hours, callers with a touchtone telephone can call the main city hall number
and activate a pager carried by the city's emergency crew chief. Residents
with a rotary phone can call the Lakewood Sheriff's Station at 866-9061.
Sheriff's staff will alert the emergency crew.</P>

<P>Lakewood may have a &quot;virtual&quot; city hall, but it's staffed by
real people who know that &quot;human touch&quot; service and &quot;high
tech&quot; access are a winning combination. <BR>

  <H3>Proposed city law would limit juvenile loitering</H3>
  <P>A proposed city ordinance, tentatively approved by the City Council
  on December 19, would help Sheriff's deputies keep youngsters off the street
  during school hours.</P>
  <P>City Attorney John Todd's proposed daytime juvenile loitering ordinance
  will be the subject of a public hearing before the City Council on Tuesday,
  January 28, 7:30 p.m., in the City Council Chambers at the Lakewood Civic
  Center, 5000 Clark Avenue.</P>
  <P>If approved following the hearing, the new law would be effective in
  30 days March 2 .<BR>

<H3>City Attorney's Report on Juvenile Daytime Loitering</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>TO: City Council</P>
  <P>FROM: City Attorney</P>
  <P>SUBJECT: Minors/Daytime Juvenile Curfew Ordinance</P>
  <P>The Public Safety Committee has requested that the City Council enact
  a Daytime Juvenile Curfew Ordinance. The City presently has an Ordinance
  prohibiting night time juvenile loitering in Section 4251 of the Lakewood
  Municipal Code. This type of Ordinance has been held constitutional In
  Re: Frank, 275 Cal.Rptr. 655, and In Re: Nancy C., 28 Cal.App.3d 747, 105
  Cal.Rptr. 113. In the latter case, the Court held the constitutional standard
  applicable to a juvenile curfew ordinance is one of reasonableness, and
  when the Ordinance is attacked as unduly restrictive of personal rights,
  the test is whether the Ordinance is reasonable in view of the needs of
  the State, with reasonableness being roughly measured by the gravity of
  the evil to be corrected and the importance of the right invaded. The most
  recent case on night time juvenile curfew ordinances is In Re: Daniel W.,
  which was first heard in the Court of Appeals, Fifth District, 41 Cal.Rptr.2d
  202. The Court of Appeals, in sustaining the ordinance, applied In Re:
  Nancy and pointed out the curfew ordinances that prohibit mere presence
  or being in a particular place are unconstitutional as being over broad,
  whereas ordinances reasonably prohibiting loitering are not unconstitutional.
  After the decision of the Appellate Court, the Supreme Court granted review
  but on January 18, 1996 dismissed the case on the basis that the constitutional
  issue on which review had been granted was not raised in the trial court.
  Although not entirely clear as to the current law, it would appear that
  reasonable regulations, which do not prohibit mere presence, but rather
  prohibit loitering, will be upheld.</P>
  <P>I have been supplied with and reviewed the Ordinances of the cities
  of Norwalk, Long Beach, Bellflower, City of Los Angeles and Los Angeles
  County, and a draft prepared for the League of California Cities Annual
  Conference, October 1996. The basic approach of these Ordinances is as
  outlined in the above cases, however, there are several different treatments
  as follows:</P>
  <P>1. Most of the Ordinances prohibit daytime loitering between the hours
  of 8:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. on days when school is in session. I have adopted
  this approach.</P>
  <P>2. The ordinance drafted for the League of California Cities has a provision
  that the court may order the parents to pay the law enforcement costs under
  certain conditions. In my opinion, this is beyond the jurisdiction of the
  city and would be a matter that would have to be established by state law.</P>
  <P>3. Most of the Ordinances have a provision that the arrest of the juvenile
  in violation of the ordinance will be treated as an infraction. I have
  incorporated this provision.</P>
  <P>4. One of the Ordinances includes the state definition of truancy (Education
  Code 48260 et seq.) as evidence of loitering. I have not included such
  a provision inasmuch as it would appear that truancy is an entirely separate
  status governed by the Education Code and to be enforced by the appropriate
  school district. I think an argument could be made that the city is preempted
  in this area.</P>
  <P>Section 256 of the California Welfare &amp; Institutions Code has been
  amended to include that a violation of any provision of a local law relating
  to traffic offenses, loitering or curfew may be heard by the juvenile court
  or a traffic hearing officer. The Ordinance has a provision that the peace
  officer may issue a notice to appear in Superior Court pursuant to Welfare
  &amp; Institutions Code 256.</P>
  <P>Therefore, such an Ordinance has been prepared for your consideration
  and introduction. If introduced, it would thereafter be set for a public
  hearing and, upon its adoption, would be effective in thirty (30) days.</P>

  <P>THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF LAKEWOOD, CALIFORNIA, DOES HEREBY ORDAIN
  AS FOLLOWS:</P>
  <P>SECTION 1. The City Council of the City of Lakewood hereby declares
  and finds:</P>
  <P>A. The California Legislature has enacted statutes that subject persons
  between the ages of 6 and 18, who are not exempt under California Education
  Code Section 48200 et seq. or California Education Code Section 48400 et
  seq., to compulsory full-time education for a minimum school day as established
  by law.</P>
  <P>B. Unsupervised students absent from school without a valid excuse may
  involve themselves in unsafe activities by loitering in residential neighborhoods,
  business districts, malls and public places.</P>
  <P>C. Unsupervised students absent from school without a valid excuse may
  engage in criminal activity to the detriment of the community, such as
  residential burglaries, automobile thefts, bicycle thefts, vandalism, and
  other visible signs of disorder.</P>
  <P>D. Unsupervised students absent from school without a valid excuse may
  become a burden on police who must either return them to school or wait
  for parents or custodial persons to pick them up, and who must investigate
  any and all activity related to the minor's absenteeism.</P>
  <P>E. This Ordinance promotes and protects the public health, safety and
  welfare by preventing truancy, reducing the incidents of juvenile criminal
  activity and promoting the welfare of the juvenile who should be in school
  under supervision.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>SECTION 2. Part 5 pertaining to Loitering and Trespassing of Chapter
  2 of Article IV of the Lakewood Municipal Code is hereby amended by adding
  Sections 4251.1 - 4251.3 to read as follows:</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>&quot;4251.1 PROHIBITED DAYTIME JUVENILE LOITERING.</P>
  <P>A. It is unlawful for any minor under the age of 18 years, who is subject
  to compulsory education or to compulsory continuation education, to loiter,
  idle, wander, stroll or aimlessly drive or ride about in a vehicle, in
  or upon any public street, avenue, highway, road, curb area, alley, park,
  playground or other public ground, public place or public building or residential
  neighborhood, place of amusement or eating place, vacant lot or abandoned
  or vacant building between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. of the
  same day on days when the minor's school is in session. School as used
  herein has reference to the actual school the minor is assigned to under
  the State of California Compulsory Education System or the school to which
  he should be assigned to and otherwise attending pursuant to the State
  of California Compulsory Education System. This Section does not apply
  when:</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>(1) The minor is accompanied by his or her parent(s), legal guardian(s),
  or other adult person(s) having the legal care or custody of the minor,
  or by his or her spouse eighteen years of age or older;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>(2) The minor is upon an errand directed by his or her parent(s), legal
  guardian(s) or other adult person(s) having the legal care or custody of

  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>(3) The minor has in his or her possession a written excuse from his
  or her parent(s), legal guardian(s) or other adult person(s) having the
  legal care or custody of the minor, or from his or her spouse eighteen
  (18) years of age or older; or</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>(4) The minor has permission to leave campus and has in his or her possession
  a valid, school-issued, off-campus permit; or</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>(5) The minor is going directly to or returning directly from a public
  meeting, or place of public entertainment, such as a movie, play, sporting
  event, dance or school activity, provided such meeting, event or activity
  is a school-approved activity for the minor or is otherwise supervised
  by school personnel of the minor's school; or</P>

  <P>(6) The minor is going directly to or coming directly from a medical
  appointment or his or her place of lawful employment; or</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>

  <P>(8) The presence of such minor in said place or places is connected
  with, or required to, a business, trade, profession or occupation in which
  the minor is lawfully engaged; or</P>

  <P>&nbsp;</P>

  having legal care, custody or control of any person under the age of eighteen
  (18) years who allows or permits such a person to violate any provision
  of this Part is guilty of an infraction.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>4251.3 INFRACTION. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code,
  a violation of Sections 4251 and 4251.1 - 4251.3 shall constitute an infraction
  punishable by a fine not to exceed $250.00. The court may set aside the
  fine imposed by this Part or any portion thereof if the fine is based on
  the minor's first infraction under this Part and provided the minor produces
  proof satisfactory to the court that the following has occurred during
  the period between the initial hearing on the infraction and any subsequent
  hearing set by the court:</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>A. The minor has had no unexcused absences from school; and</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>B. The minor has performed ten (10) hours of court-approved community
  service during times other than said minor's hours of school attendance;
  or</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>C. The minor's parent(s), legal guardian(s) or other adult person(s)
  having the legal care or custody of said minor has or have attended a parenting
  class or a series of parenting classes approved by the court.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>Notwithstanding any other provisions of this code, when a person under
  the age of eighteen (18) years is charged with a violation of this Part
  and a peace officer issues a notice to appear in the Superior Court to
  the minor pursuant to Welfare &amp; Institutions Code Section 256, the
  charge shall be deemed an infraction unless the minor requests that a petition
  be filed under Section 601 or 602 of the Welfare &amp; Institutions Code.&quot;</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>SECTION 3. The City Council hereby declares it would have passed this
  Ordinance sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph and section by section,
  and does hereby declare the provisions of this Ordinance are severable,
  and if for any reason any section of this Ordinance should be held invalid,
  such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining parts of this
  Ordinance.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P>
  <P>SECTION 4. The City Clerk shall certify to the adoption of this Ordinance.
  The City Council hereby finds and determines there are no newspapers of
  general circulation both published and circulated within the City and,
  in compliance with Section 36933 of the Government code, directs the City
  Clerk to cause said Ordinance within fifteen (15) days after its passage
  to be posted in at least three (3) public places within the City. This
  Ordinance shall take effect thirty (30) days after its adoption.<BR>

<HEAD><TITLE>Help on Making Queries</TITLE></HEAD><BODY>
<A NAME="Making Queries"></A><H1>Making Queries</H1>
Excite for Web Servers gives web users access to a sophisticated concept-based
searching engine. But even though the search engine is advanced, users
can form queries without using a complicated query language. This page
will help you to choose the queries that will give you the best
results.
<P>
<A NAME="Query Basics"></A><H2>Query Basics</H2>
A query is simply a description of an information need. Unlike Boolean
systems that search for just those documents containing <I>all</I> the
words in your query, Excite for Web Servers will search for documents that are a
best match for the words in your query. Excite for Web Servers will also search for
documents that are about the same concepts that your query describes,
so sometimes Excite for Web Servers will bring back articles that don't mention
<I>any</I> of the words in your original query.
<P>
What this means is that your query -- the description of your
information need -- can be as detailed as you like. Don't worry about
providing too many words; the more words, the better. Additional words
in your query will help Excite for Web Servers figure out what concepts you're
really interested in. On the other hand, Excite for Web Servers will do a pretty
good job of figuring out what documents are interesting to you even if
your query is vague.
<P>
For example, let's say you're searching a web site for documents about
customer support for the Widget2000 product you're using. A good
starting point would be
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Widget2000
</PRE>

If you have a question about a particular feature of the Widget2000,
for example the Blurfl upgrade package, you might choose a query like
<P>
<PRE>
        customer support for the Blurfl upgrade package
        of the Widget2000
</PRE>

Even if there are no documents that are actually about the Blurfl
upgrade, Excite for Web Servers will still show you documents about Widget2000
customer support.
<P>
<A NAME="Advanced Query Tips"></A><H2>Advanced Query Tips</H2>
Here are some suggestions for getting the best results out of
Excite for Web Servers.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Only use words that are relevant to your query</B><DD>
If you're looking for documents about the Widget2000, don't enter a
query like "<CODE>Find me all documents about the Widget2000</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers
considers <I>all</I> the words in your query to be part of your
information need, so queries like the previous example will find all
documents about <I>finding all documents about</I> the Widget2000, which
may not be exactly what you want.
<P>
<DT><B>Specify multiple forms of the same phrases</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers distinguishes between hyphenated and un-hyphenated words. So,
sometimes it might be necessary to explicitly say that you want both
versions, for example "<CODE>CDROM CD-ROM</CODE>". Excite for Web Servers will try to figure
out that <CODE>CDROM</CODE> and <CODE>CD-ROM</CODE> are the same, but it never hurts to
explicitly specify multiple forms.
<P>
<DT><B>Common words are ignored</B><DD>
Excite for Web Servers doesn't index common words like <I>a</I>, <I>and</I>, or <I>the</I>.
Consequently, those words in your query will be ignored. Excite for Web Servers also
ignores numbers; however, it can find strings that happen to contain a
number, for example <I>3Com</I>.

<P>Consumer World&reg; has gathered over 1200 of the most useful consumer
resources on the Internet. Whether you want to check an airfare, find an
ATM machine anywhere in the world, file a consumer complaint with a state
agency, read 100s of consumer booklets, find a low rate credit card or mortgage,
research a law, look up thewholesale price of a car, locate a Better Business
Bureau, find a toll-free number, listen (literally) to the latest news,
contact a company's customer service department, comparison shop for bargains
and last minute travel, check stock quotes or CD rates, read a movie review
or see a preview, clip electronic coupons, or search the Internet, you can
do it in Consumer World.</TD></TR>

</P>

<P><B>FINDOUT FAVORITE:</B> Well, consumers, welcome to the Mother Church!
If you can sell it, buy it, insure it, complain about it, or save money
on it, this is the place to be. Consumer World has its own search engine
to point you to more than a thousand sites on the Net for consumers, from
discount airline ticket brokers to toll-free number directories and customer
service departments for practically every company that has one. You can
also browse its straightforward directory, which includes a <B>Consumer
Agencies</B> section that links you to federal, international, and local
associations for every widget under the sun; the <B>Company Connection</B>,
which links to the product information and customer contact sections of
company Web sites; <B>Bargains Offers</B>, which gleans the best freebies
and cheapies from all over the Web; and <B>Travel Entertainment</B>, which
can save you big bucks on airfare, hotels, and movie tickets. And that's
just the tip of the iceberg! Before you open your wallet again, you MUST
check out this bastion of bargains.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.consumerlawpage.com/"><B>The Consumer Law Page</B></A></P>

<P><B>http://www.consumerlawpage.com/</B></P>

<P>This site is sponsored by the law firm of Alexander, Rapazzini Graham.
And yes, this firm happens to handle consumer complaint actions as well
as personal injury cases. However, it's still a site worth seeing. (You
don't <I>have</I> to hire them.) The Law Page has four sections: Articles
-- too numerous to mention, but they cover a host of subjects from auto
part recalls to food pesticides; Brochures -- you can link directly to the
publishers of more than 100 publications; Resources -- Internet sites that
can help you with snafu's regarding defective products, disaster relief,
and malpractice; and Consumers Fight Back -- advice on writing and filing
complaints with the proper consumer protection agencies. A handy list of
national consumer organizations is available here as well. And don't miss
the <B>National Consumer Complaint Center</B>, which offers seven categories
of complaints (consumer products, Internet fraud, computers, autos, food
and drugs, pesticides, and meat and poultry) with which to identify your
problem, fill out a form online, and have your complaint sent to an agency
that can help you take action. We caution you about clicking on the Personal
Injury Law Page -- flashing icons abound! But it has even more articles,
brochures, and resources to peruse, so what the heck?</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.sis.org/index.html"><B>SHOP! Information Services
(SIS)</B></A></P>

<P><B>http://www.sis.org/index.html</B></P>

<P>Created by veteran female editors, SIS bills itself as the &quot;Web's
only ad-free, hype-free consumer news service for women.&quot; In the vein
of <I>Consumer Reports</I> and <I>Consumers' Research</I>, SIS vows not
to let advertisers control content as it does in the world of print periodicals.
The site is set up somewhat like an online magazine, with such departments
as <B>Consumer News Digest</B>, providing quick takes on recent trends and
legislation affecting the consumer marketplace; Econ-o-rama, urging you
to get down and thrifty; and the Wall o' Fun, an attempt at consumer humor
that lightheartedly tackles consumer concerns. If you have a consumer complaint,
you can take advantage of the <B>Consumer Hotline</B>, which promises to
address your issue and help resolve it -- this is interactivity at its finest.
You'll find scam alerts and product expos&Egrave;s (e.g., fat-free jello
was always fat free, now it just boasts a fancy label), and don't miss the
unique <B>Disturbing Product of the Month</B>. Hallmark takes it in the
gut as SIS mocks its Mother's Day cards -- the card from the pooch <I>is</I>
pretty pathetic! If you're apt to plunk down a few dollars or charge your
way through a mall, stop off at SHOP! and get penny wise.</TD></TR>

<P>A search of major computer magazines via <B><A HREF="http://search3.zdnet.com/plweb-cgi/topsearch/topsearch.pl">ZD

on how to actually find things.</P>

<P><B>Tenacity and patience are the key </B></P>

<P>As webmaster at Lakewood Online, you'd think I'd have a neat formula
for finding what I want via the Web. NOT! The information superhighway is
just as likely to give me 10,000 documents I don't want, as it is to give
me what I need. <BR>

<B>Help Doc's and Tip Sheets - Use 'em!<BR>
</B><BR>
Of the over 20 search engines listed below virtually all of them have a
&quot;tips&quot; or &quot;help&quot; link on their home page. They're invaluable
in explaining the quirks and nuances of getting the most out of that particular
search engine.<BR>
<BR>
One may use strange codes, while the other uses the &quot;and&quot; and
&quot;or&quot; of &quot;boolean&quot; search terms. Putting your search
words in quotes might help on another. What a search site might call an
&quot;advanced form&quot; may actually be an easier way to narrow your search
through using a form with choices you can pre-set. Experimenting with help
doc's may be tedious at first, but can pay big dividends in the long run.<BR>

<TD COLSPAN="2" VALIGN="TOP"><P><B>Match your interest to an existing website</B><BR>
<BR>
Set aside your specific information need for a second. Think more 'big picture.'
One of the best ways to find information on the web is to start with a website
that targets a general area of information.<BR>
<BR>
For example: <B><A HREF="http://search3.zdnet.com/plweb-cgi/topsearch/topsearch.pl">ZD
Net</A></B> for computer information, the <B><A HREF="http://www.ca.gov/">State
of California's</A></B> website is a good first stop in searching for a
particular state agency. There are a couple indexes of links to sub-agencies
that never seem to come up on the search engines. <B><A HREF="http://www.lakewoodcity.org/">Lakewood
Online</A></B> is a fine Lakewood-specific resource, while the <B><A HREF=
"http://web1.starwave.com/">ESPN Sportszone</A></B> is a good place to start
looking for sports information and links. </P>

<P><BR>
<B>National news?</B> <B>Local news? Go to the source</B></P>

<P>Lakewood is covered by two major newspapers: the <B><A HREF="http://www.latimes.com/">Los
Angeles Times</A></B> and the <B><A HREF="http://www.ptconnect.com/">Press
Telegram</A></B>. Both have search engines that will turn up past articles.
One other super source is the <B><A HREF="http://www.elibrary.com/">Electric
Library</A></B> research service. It's a search engine that looks at a range
of newspapers, magazines, professional journals and more. </P>

<P>My initial experience was with America Online. The service has a mass
of searchable magazines online. It's still a good resource. But, now many
magazines and newspapers have their own websites. They can be great sources
of information. Some of them charge a fee, but often you can check them
out on a trial basis, or by simply filling out a registration form.</TD></TR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Updated city plan adopted</H1>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Updated 'General Plan' will keep Lakewood focused on
neighborhoods and homes.</B></P>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</H2>

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>&nbsp;</H2>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<H1>&nbsp;</H1>

<P>Lakewood's General Plan just got a tune up of minor changes that bring
the planning document in line with today's community. The General Plan review
process lasted nearly four years and included a series of presentations
and public hearings before the Lakewood Planning Commission and the city
council. The city council adopted the revised plan and its environmental
impact report in November, after a final public hearing.</P>

<P>The General Plan is a state-mandated document that forecasts the physical,
social, and economic development of California's cities. It isn't a rigid
blueprint; it's more a guide to development themes, according to Director
of Planning Charles Ebner.</P>

<P>In Lakewood, the themes are single-family homes, residential neighborhoods,
plenty of parks and recreation programs, and a healthy retail economy.</P>

<P>&quot;Lakewood's General Plan has served our community nearly thirty
years,&quot; notes Ebner. &quot;Even the best of plans, however, needs updating
to bring it into conformance with state policies, new technology, and the
way the community has actually developed.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Good guide for 30 years</B></P>

<P>The city's General Plan was adopted in 1970. It included chapters (called
elements) on land use, traffic circulation, housing, recreation, public
facilities, and community design. Over time, the state legislature added
new elements: open space and conservation, noise, seismic safety, and public
safety. Some of these elements set general goals designed to keep community
and neighborhood values intact.</P>

<P>In fact, many goals set in the 1970 General Plan were exceeded years
ago. The plan originally set a goal of about seven acres of open space and
parkland per 1,000 residents. Today, that ratio is thirteen acres per 1,000
residents, one of the highest in Los Angeles County.</P>

<P>&quot;One revision to the General Plan would redesignate some open space
for other kinds of development,&quot; Ebner points out. &quot;But, that
would have no impact on the ratio of parks and residents. It's really amazing
that there is so little need for revision. It's a tribute to the vision
of those who drafted our General Plan and to the community-minded people
who implemented it.&quot;</P>

<P><B>Minor changes</B></P>

<P>The proposed changes to the land use element serve several purposes:</P>

<P>Remove some land uses, originally designated in 1970, that are unlikely
to occur</P>

<P>Align the plan with the city's existing zoning</P>

<P>Identify commercial centers where higher densities of retail development
could be allowed.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P>The update will also allow the city to incorporate optional elements
into the city's General Plan, including elements covering recreation and
community services, air quality, and economic development.</P>

<P>In the economic development element, according to Ebner, the focus is
on increasing the city's share of regional sales tax revenues. &quot;In
1970, Lakewood's regional mall had few competitors. Today, the retail environment
is increasingly competitive . . . almost cutthroat. To continue the level
of city services residents expect, Lakewood's retail economy will need to
grow.&quot;</P>

<P>Copies of the revised plan are available for review at the Iacoboni and
Nye libraries, the Planning Department at city hall, and the City Clerk's
office.<BR>

<B>A special combination of bravery, quick thinking, and tremendous skill
characterize the eighteen recipients of the 1996 Lakewood Award of Valor.
They earned the city's highest commendation for public safety officers in
incidents that ranged from the quick rescue of victims trapped in a disastrous
car wreck to preventing an attempted suicide.</B><BR>
<BR>
The Lakewood Award of Valor honors the extraordinary actions of public safety
professionals. The Mayor's Award is given to civilians who assisted public
safety officers in preventing a crime, identifying suspects, or capturing
a criminal. This year, six Lakewood area residents will receive the Mayor's
Award.<BR>
<BR>
These Lakewood heroes will be honored on Thursday, November 14 at noon in
the Weingart Ballroom of The Centre at Sycamore Plaza.<BR>
<H3>The 1996 recipients of Lakewood's public safety awards are:</H3>
<B>Staff Sergeant Jennifer Noble; Firefighter Paramedics David Larsen, Craig
Reed, Eduardo Lozano, Paul Schneider, Ritchie Salisbury, Marshall Oldham;
Firefighter Specialists James Mehl, David Gorey; Firefighter Jerry Lawrence;
Captains Stanley Bixler and Roy Spear.<BR>
<BR>
Staff Sergeant Jennifer Noble</B><BR>
<BR>
The day after Christmas at the busy intersection of Candlewood Street and
Downey Avenue, a car with four teens rolled over after a high-speed collision
with another car and driver. All five occupants of both cars were very seriously
injured. One driver was trapped; one passenger was not wearing a seat belt
and had been ejected through the windshield into the street. Fortunately,
Jennifer Noble, a U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant and medic from March Air
Force Base, witnessed the accident. She stopped her car and ran across opposing
lanes of traffic in her haste to reach the victims. Realizing emergency
help might be delayed, Sgt. Noble quickly performed a &quot;hands-on&quot;
assessment of each accident victim. Covered in blood from her examination
of the injured, she calmed two victims in shock and monitored one teen victim
with head wounds who had been thrown from the car. Lakewood Paramedic Squad
45 then arrived with fire units from Station 45.<BR>
<BR>
Due to Sgt. Noble's early assessment of the victims, valuable information
was immediately given to firefighters saving critical minutes. When Lakewood
firefighters and paramedics took over, they assessed the condition of the
injured motorists and moved quickly to rescue the trapped and injured driver
and to stabilize the condition of the other accident victims. Because of
the size and seriousness of the accident, additional County Fire Department
units were called in. Together, the firefighters paramedics prepared the
injured for transportation, directed the bumper-to-bumper holiday traffic
that filled the street, and took action when one of the accident victims
went into full cardiac arrest.<BR>
<BR>
For her heroic actions, Staff Sgt. Jennifer Nobel will receive the Mayor's
Award. For their service in rescuing the accident victims, the eleven members
of the responding fire and paramedic units each will receive the Lakewood
Award of Valor.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Deputy Bruce Cantley</B><BR>
<BR>
Some skills learned in Sheriff's training may be needed only once, but that
is often enough to save a life, as Deputy Bruce Cantley found out last October.
Deputy Cantley was the first officer to respond to an emergency medical
assistance call. He found Mr. Eugene Baker sprawled on the ground in full
cardiac arrest. Deputy Cantley immediately opened the victim's airway and
began CPR. When a bystander offered to help, Deputy Cantley quickly and
accurately instructed him in maintaining CPR. Together, they continued to
ventilate Mr. Baker until a fire unit from Station 57 and Paramedic Squad
31 arrived. Thanks to Deputy Cantley's quick thinking, and the immediate
response of County Fire Department fire fighters/emergency medical technicians,
the victim regained a pulse and began breathing on his own. Because of the
expert response of Deputy Cantley, Mr. Baker suffered no neurological damage
from his brush with death.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Deputy Frank Leal and Ms. Cynthia Harrison, R.N.</B><BR>
<BR>
There are times when extraordinary action in attempting to save a life can
only be a form of compassion. When county fire fighters and paramedics arrived
at the corner of Allington and Woodruff in Lakewood, they found a 9-year-old
girl who had been stuck down by a passing car. She was lying pulseless,
with no respiration, and with major head and facial trauma. The paramedics
also found Deputy Frank Leal from Lakewood's Sheriff Station giving mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation in a desperate attempt to save the little girl's life. With
Deputy Leal was Cynthia Harrison, an off-duty nurse from Lakewood Regional
Medical Center, who had stopped to aid the victim. Unfortunately, despite
their best efforts, the little girl died from her massive injuries. But
Deputy Leal's and Ms. Harrison's compassionate actions drew praise from
the little girl's family and from fire department personnel for their attempt
to give the little girl a chance at life.<BR>
<BR>
For her efforts, Ms. Cynthia Harrison will receive the Mayor's Award and
Deputy Frank Leal will receive the Award of Valor<BR>
<BR>
<B>Officer Ronald Grijalba</B><BR>
<BR>
Officer Ron Grijalba was off duty from his assignment as an officer in the
Los Angeles Police Department when he spotted two men who had just committed
a strong arm robbery on Del Amo Boulevard in eastern Lakewood. The two young
suspects ran from the elderly Chinese women whose purse they had snatched,
but Officer Grijalba drove in front of them, cutting off their escape. As
Officer Grijalba struggled to subdue one of the suspects, he heard something
solid bump against the grill of his pickup truck. The sound was a loaded
9mm automatic that Officer Grijalba quickly removed from the suspect's waistband.
After disarming the robber at great personal risk, Officer Grijalba held
him until Sheriff's deputies arrived. Quick action identified the other
suspect, which led to two arrests and the possible clearing of at least
one residential burglary.<BR>
<BR>
For his selfless response to a police emergency which put him in great personal
risk, Officer Ron Grijalba will receive the Mayor's Award.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Deputy Gregory Knapp and Deputy Robert Boles</B><BR>
<BR>
Deputies Boles and Knapp were called to the scene of a barricaded man holding
a knife to his own throat threatening suicide. Calming distraught family
members, the deputies entered the home and persuaded the man to unlock the
bedroom door. They found the man holding a 10-inch butcher knife to his
neck. The two deputies began the slow, patient effort to talk the man out
of his suicide plan. After talking to the man for about 40 minutes, they
convinced him to put down the knife and surrender.<BR>
<BR>
Deputies Boles and Knapp displayed calm, compassionate professionalism to
resolve this incident without harm to anyone.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Sergeant Michael Colton and Deputy Robert Boles</B><BR>
<BR>
After spotting a truck stolen during a home invasion, strong arm robbery,
and kidnaping in June, Sergeant Colton began pursuit. While the suspects
fled they fired on Sgt. Colton. Moments later, their kidnap victim crashed
through the rear window of the truck's camper shell and fell into the street
from the moving vehicle. Without their hostage, the kidnappers began firing
at Sgt. Colton. He stopped to render aid to the injured victim as Deputy
Boles in a second Sheriff's unit picked up the pursuit. The suspects fired
at Deputy Boles twice while the chase continued on Wardlow Road and into
Hawaiian Gardens. There the truck went out of control and struck a block
wall. Dep. Boles immediately took one suspect into custody and a second
was apprehended after a search by SWAT Teams and K-9 units.<BR>
<BR>
For their response in a life-threatening arrest, both Deputy Michael Colton
and Deputy Robert Boles will receive the Lakewood Award of Valor.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tom Strouse</B><BR>
<BR>
Tom Strouse spotted two employees of Great Western Bank in Lakewood chasing
three suspects in a bank robbery. He also saw their getaway car as one of
the suspects fled with the car's driver and the other two fled on foot.
Mr. Strouse made an effective tactical decision. He flagged down a Sheriff's
unit to report the crime and sent them in pursuit of the getaway car. He
returned to the scene where the suspects fled on foot and saw one of the
men. Mr. Strouse returned to the containment command post and reported the
suspect's location. Thanks to the detailed information and descriptions
Mr. Strouse gave, Lakewood deputies were able to capture all of the suspects
and recover over $48,000 of the bank's money. Mr. Strouse then served as
a key witness in the trial of the suspects, leading to their conviction
for bank robbery.<BR>
<BR>
For his uncommon presence of mind and willingness to get involved, Mr. Tom
Strouse will receive the Mayor's Award.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Dalbert Campos</B><BR>
<BR>
Dalbert Campos, staff assistant at Artesia High School, was monitoring students
leaving the campus, when he saw a boy run across Norwalk Boulevard, hide
behind a cement pillar, and start shooting at another youth. While the intended
victim fled, apparently unhurt, and other students leaving class scattered,
the boy calmly hid the gun in his pants pocket and walked toward the parked
van where Mr. Campos had concealed himself during the shooting. Mr. Campos
collared the boy as he passed, disarmed him, and kept him restrained until
deputies arrived. Investigation showed that the boy had been armed with
a 25 cal. automatic pistol and that when Mr. Campos had captured him, the
gun was loaded and the hammer pulled back, ready to fire.<BR>
<BR>
For his extraordinary bravery in arresting an armed and dangerous suspect,
Mr. Dalbert Campos will receive the Mayor's Award.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Lauren Conlisk </B><BR>
<BR>
One morning, seven-year-old Lauren Conlisk was home from school because
of a Parent/Teacher Conference Day. While sitting at the breakfast table,
she looked out the window and saw smoke coming from the house across the
street. Lauren knew how to call 911 because she had just done some homework
on what to do in case of a fire.<BR>
<BR>
Lauren dialed 911 and stayed on the phone giving the dispatcher the information
he needed. Lauren and her father went outside, with Lauren carrying her
5-year-old brother Andrew, to see if they could help. According to her father,
Lauren was &quot;the one who remained calm throughout the incident.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, no one was home in the burning house. But the fire, which was
caused by a malfunctioning coffee pot, caused a $30,000 loss--a loss that
would have been much greater had quick-thinking Lauren not been responsible
enough to know what to do.<BR>
<BR>
For her assistance to Lakewood fire units, Lauren Conlisk will receive the
Mayor's Award.<BR>
<H2>Honored for service</H2>
Also honored at the Award of Valor ceremonies are recipients of the Distinguished
Service Award, Lakewood's Block Captain of the Year, and Station Volunteer
of the Year.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Captain Clint Kaller</B><BR>
<BR>
Captain Kaller, a 17-year veteran of the Los Angeles Fire Department, is
Lakewood's Emergency Preparedness Officer. Due to Captain Kaller's dedication
and abilities, Lakewood has never been more ready for disaster. Under his
leadership, 75 Lakewood residents have been recruited and specially trained
to respond to neighborhood disaster situations through the city's Community
Awareness in Response to Emergencies (CARE) program.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Tom Vera</B><BR>
<BR>
Tom Vera has served as a volunteer at the Lakewood Sheriff's Station for
the past two years and was one of the pioneers of the city's Volunteers
on Patrol Program (VOP). He currently coordinates the activity of the station's
84 VOPs. Mr. Vera was one of the first members of &quot;Team Lakewood&quot;
(VOPs who concentrate their patrols in Lakewood). He has received seven
commendations for his service.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Hilda Stark</B><BR>
<BR>
Hilda has been a Volunteer at the Lakewood Sheriff's Station for over ten
years, assisting in making background investigations for missing persons,
processing reports of bad checks, and in keeping time records on the station's
124 volunteers. Hilda has given 7,700 hours of volunteer time, equivalent
to five years of full-time work.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Mary Robertson</B><BR>
<BR>
Mary Robertson, a block captain since 1987, has worked hard to establish
successful crime prevention programs on her block. Because of her unusual
dedication to Neighborhood Watch, Mary became one of the city's first Neighborhood

<P><B>Lakewood's community-based assistance program brings holiday cheer
to needy families and seniors. It's grass-roots giving that shows we truly
care.</B></P>

<P></P>

<P><B>FOR TWENTY-FOUR YEARS</B>, Project Shepherd has brought the gift of
Lakewood's care and concern--along with a bundle of holiday gifts--to the
neediest families in our community.</P>

<P>Primarily at Christmas time, but now throughout the year, Project Shepherd's
hometown giving helps single parents, out-of-work dads, and lonely seniors.
No other community program in Lakewood reaches so many residents with so
personal a sign of our genuine concern.</P>

<P>Project Shepherd is a simple program. At Christmas time, it gives those
least able to enjoy the holiday season a box of staple food items and the
makings for a traditional holiday dinner.</P>

<P>With the food comes simple gifts--a toy for a toddler, a warm sweater
for a lonely senior, or a CD for a teenager facing a bleak Christmas.</P>

<P>These simple gifts are enough to show that we care.</P>

<P><B>Many hands support Project Shepherd</B></P>

<P>Project Shepherd's holiday giving is the work of volunteers from the
Lakewood Rotary Club and from many Lakewood residents. They help collect
the staple food items, sort and package the gift bundles, and assist with
distribution to the needy.</P>

<P>Project Shepherd helps single mothers and their school-age youngsters
. . . out-of-work fathers and their teen-age children . . . seniors living
alone.</P>

<P>The Lakewood city family--through the city's Recreation and Community
Services Department--assists the Project Shepherd with warehouse space,
program promotion, and review of applications to receive Project Shepherd
assistance.</P>

<P>Above all, hundreds of Lakewood residents, students at Lakewood-area
schools, and Lakewood business owners support Project Shepherd with their
gifts of staple food items, canned goods, toys, clothing, and cash contributions.</TD></TR>

<TD WIDTH="78%"><P><B>Every bit helps--including the single canned item given by a youngster
just learning what it means to give from the heart.</B></P>

<P><B>Q. What does Project Shepherd need?</B></P>

<P><B>A.</B> Project Shepherd needs dry, non-perishable food items (sugar,
flour, rice and the like) and canned goods. Each Project Shepherd family
receives a bundle of holiday foods--including a frozen turkey--along with
staple items sufficient to make family meals for four or five days.</P>

<P>Project Shepherd also needs new gifts appropriate for all ages--toys
for youngsters, a CD or sports-related gift for teenagers, and practical
items (umbrellas, clothing, grooming items) for seniors.</P>

<P>And, Project Shepherd needs cash contributions and your volunteer time.</P>

<P>Volunteers pick up donations, sort and pack gift boxes, help distribute
gift boxes from the warehouse, and deliver gifts to those who cannot come
to the warehouse.</P>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Grasping hands"><B>Q. Are contributions to Project
Shepherd tax deductible.</B></P>

<P><B>A.</B> Contributions--in cash or in kind--are fully deductible on
both your state and federal income tax returns.</P>

<P>Project Shepherd's federal tax identification number is AI23-7113970.
The program's state tax identification number is D0329335.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q. How much should a cash donation be?</B></P>

<P><B>A.</B> The cash equivalent of groceries for a traditional holiday
dinner for four is a good donation amount. But, any cash gift--however small--will
directly benefit Lakewood's needy families.</P>

<P>Everything donated to Project Shepherd--100%--goes to those who need
it most. Because Project Shepherd is a year-round program, any gift you
give, whenever you give it, will help.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q. When do families register to receive Project Shepherd assistance?</B></P>

<P><B>A.</B> Applicants for Project Shepherd assistance are invited to fill
out and submit a Project Shepherd request form between Monday, November
25 and Sunday, December 8. Informational materials about the program are
distributed at city park and community centers.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Registration for Project Shepherd assistance can be made at the William
J. Burns Community Center (5510 Clark Avenue, adjacent to Mayfair Park,
phone 925-7512) and the Palms Community Center (12305 207th Street, in Palms
Park, phone 865-6414).</B></P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q. How are recipients evaluated?</B></P>

<P><B>A.</B> Request for assistance are reviewed to determine if the applicant
meets Project Shepherd's criteria. Applicants must be a Lakewood resident
(determined by a current Lakewood mailing address or utility billing) and
meet income restrictions.</TD></TR>

  <P>SEAACA's licensing and pet shelter hours are Tuesday through Friday

  <BR>
  <BR>
  <BR>
  <B>Q. What's the best thing to do to avoid losing a pet?</B></P>
  <P>Make sure your dog or cat always wears an identification tag and license
  on its collar. The chances of your pet being quickly returned are dramatically
  increased if your pet wears a tag with your name, address, home and work
  phone numbers, and your pet's license number.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>Q. What will the SEAACA animal shelter do if they find my pet?</B></P>

<P>If a lost or stray animal is found with a license or ID tag, SEAACA will
contact the owner by phone or mail. If the pet is unlicensed, SEAACA keeps
dogs and cats, depending upon space availability, from 72 hours up to seven
days.</P>

<P><B></B></P>

<P><B>Q. What will SEAACA do if my pet is lost without tags?</B></P>

<P>It takes a lot of hard work and patience to find a lost pet without identification.
SEAACA animal shelter staff cannot check over the phone for your lost pet
without identification. On a busy day, over 100 animals may arrive at the
shelter. Without tags, the only person who can positively identify your
pet is you.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q. How often should I visit the SEAACA animal shelter in Downey?</B></P>

<P>The more frequent your visits, the more new arrivals you'll see. But,
you should also make the rounds by contacting and visiting neighboring animal
shelters. If your pet is picked up outside Lakewood, it could be taken to
animal shelters in Long Beach, Downey, Gardena, or Orange.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q. How do I get my pet a license?</B></P>

<P>Licenses are required for dogs four months and older. A rabies certificate
good for the entire term of the license is also needed. License fees are
$24 for unaltered dogs and $12 for spayed or neutered dogs.</P>

<P>The SEAACA licensing department is open Tuesday through Friday from </P>

<P>10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and Saturday from 10:00 a.m. to 4 p.m. For more
licensing information, call 803-3304. </P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q. How do I report a stray dog in my neighborhood?</B></P>

<P>Call SEAACA at 803-3301 to report a stray. Do not put yourself in danger
by trying to capture an aggressive dog.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q. Will SEAACA trap the opossum in my yard?</B></P>

<P>Opossums are gentle, non-aggressive, highly beneficial animals. According
to SEAACA officials, opossums are not a health hazard and pose little threat
to humans and pets unless cornered and left with no choice but to defend
themselves. They are resistant to diseases (including rabies) and do not
destroy property.</P>

<P>SEAACA advocates peaceful co-existence between people and 'possums. They
do not encourage their trapping, removal, or relocation.</TD></TR>

Lakewood was the state's first &quot;contract city&quot; when it incorporated
in 1954.</P>

<P>Being a contract city made sense forty-two years ago because it promised
high-quality services at a lower cost to taxpayers. </P>

<H3>And, it still makes sense. </H3>

<P>Based on the State Controller's most recent report on local government
spending, contract cities spent only $442 per person for municipal services;
non-contract cities spent about $896. The &quot;taxpayer cost gap&quot;
between non-contract and contract cities is even wider for Lakewood, which
spent only $332 per person for city services.</P>

<P>Contracting's cost saving is real and not the result of fewer or lower-quality
services. Despite differences in spending, for example, both contract and
non-contract cities spend virtually the same proportion (about 20 percent
of city budgets) for law enforcement.</P>

<P>Lakewood spends more-about 22 percent of its budget-for Sheriff's law
enforcement services.</P>

<P></P>

<H3>Revenue patterns </H3>

<P>Contract cities spend less than non-contract cities, but they also take
in less. </P>

<P>According to the State Controller's report, contract cities generated
less than half the revenue per person ($442) of non-contract cities ($954
per person). Lakewood took in even less ($370 per person)-little more than
one-third the amount of non-contract cities.</P>

<P>Because they take in less, contract cities are at greater risk when economy
sensitive revenues decline or when the state diverts revenues from cities.
Between 1990 and 1995, contract cities were hit with a &quot;double whammy&quot;
of losses from declining retail sales and state takeaways of local government
revenue.</P>

<P>Sales tax, property taxes, utility user taxes, motor vehicle license
fees, and business license fees are the largest individual sources of revenue
for California cities. </P>

<P>Ranked against other revenue sources, however, property taxes in contract
cities are less important than sales tax receipts and motor vehicle license
fees, both of which declined during the recession. Property tax revenue,
which is less sensitive to recession, ranks first in non-contract cities.</P>

<P><IMG SRC="graphics/lakewood_gets_least.gif" WIDTH="425" HEIGHT="351"
ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>According to the State Controller's report, contract cities received
$36 per person in property taxes; non-contract cities took in $99. Lakewood,
with just $14 per person, got 61 percent less than the average contract
city and 86 percent less than the average non-contract city.</P>

<P>Sales tax receipts are the largest single source of revenue for most
contract cities. Sales tax represents about 21 percent of revenues for contract
cities, compared to 10 percent for non-contract cities. Lakewood's dependence
on sales tax receipts is higher than the average (23 percent).</P>

<P>Motor vehicle license fees (MVLF) are twice as important to contract
cities. They generated 8 percent of their municipal revenues from MVLF;
non-contract cities generated 4 percent. </P>

<P>Lakewood has no special assessment districts for lighting, landscaping,
or street maintenance. Lakewood's street lighting costs ($828,000 a year)
are paid entirely out of the city's general fund.</TD></TR>

<H1>The puzzle of property taxes</H1>

<H2>The city gets a fraction of your property taxes. Why so little?</H2>

and I whenever he was confounded by some perplexity of modern life.</I></H3>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</P>

<P>That's exactly how I felt when I tried to deduce how the property taxes
paid by Lakewood homeowners are distributed to pay for county services,
special district operations, schools and community colleges, and Lakewood
city services.</P>

<P>Look at your 1995-1996 tax bill, as I did, and you're confronted with
cryptic references like &quot;CB MWD STDBY CHG&quot; that leave even fiscal
experts groping to understand what a property tax bill says about local
government financing.</P>

<P>I called the County Auditor-Controller, as directed on the back of my
property tax bill. At least, I tried to call.</P>

<P>&quot;Press 0 NOW to speak to a tax specialist,&quot; the recording urged.
But all the lines were busy, and after a moment my call turned into a loud
dial tone. When I called again I got the same result.</P>

<P>When I tried after 2 p.m., I successfully reached one of the county's
tax specialists. I asked her two questions: what percentage of the county's
1 percent General Tax Levy pays for city services in Lakewood and what are
the other agencies (and their percentage of the property tax) not itemized
on my bill.</P>

<P>Silence . . . awkward silence. &quot;You'll have to write a letter to
the Auditor-Controller. We don't have that information available to us,&quot;
was the tax specialist's succinct reply.</P>

<P></P>

<P>My investigation had hit a dead-end, and I couldn't wait for an exchange
of letters with the Auditor-Controller. Instead, I asked the staff of the
Lakewood Finance Department to tell me what they could about property taxes.</P>

<H3>What I found out</H3>

<P>Here are the facts I uncovered:</P>

<P><B>From every $1 of property tax you paid in the 1995-1996 fiscal year,
just 6 cents went to Lakewood to pay for city services like law enforcement,
park programs, and senior services.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Compare this to the 14 cents Downey took in or the 22 cents Long Beach got
from each property tax dollar, although in all three cities similar houses
are assessed and taxed a similar amount. </P>

<P>The disparity reflects decisions that the state legislature made in the
wake of Proposition 13. In effect, the legislature froze the proportion
of property taxes each city received after the passage of Prop 13. </P>

<P><IMG SRC="graphics/property_tax.gif" WIDTH="239" HEIGHT="366" ALIGN=
"RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Ironically, cities that taxed their residents
higher twenty years ago still benefit today because they get a larger share
of each property tax dollar. </P>

<P>As a low-tax contract city1, Lakewood takes in about one-seventh the
property tax revenue of California's non-contract cities. Property taxes
are a distant sixth on the list of Lakewood's revenue sources. In many non-contract
cities, property tax receipts are the largest single revenue source.</P>

<P><B>44 cents</B> paid for public schools. On my bill, that includes the
independently governed Long Beach Unified School District and the Long Beach
Community College District.</P>

<P><B>30 cents </B>of each property tax dollar paid for county health, welfare,
and criminal justice programs or went to special districts for libraries,
flood control, mosquito abatement, flood control, and waste water management.
</P>

<P><B>17 cents</B> paid for county fire protection.<BR>

      <P><B>Why Lakewood Online?<BR>
      </B><BR>
      To give Lakewood residents better service and up-to-date information.<BR>
      <BR>
      Lakewood leads local government in customer service and values timely public
      information. The city website is an effort to take advantage of emerging
      technology to provide residents a convenient way to get services and information.
      It's part of being &quot;Tomorrow's City Today&quot;.<BR>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>How was the website created?</B><BR>
      <BR>
      Getting Lakewood Online onto the Web and keeping it current is a product
      of Lakewood Productions/Channel 31. The city Public Information Office
      is a major source of content. The desktop publishing expertise of the city
      printshop provides a great deal of raw graphics and text.<BR>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>Staffing?</B><BR>
      The website's design and production are overseen by webmaster Bob Brammer.
      Graphic artist Lorraine Krumm provided our initial look. Public Information
      Officer Donald Waldie is the city's content expert and much of our content
      originates with him. Print Shop staff Bill Lee and Sandy Cole create many
      printed documents which are reformatted for the Web. <BR>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>Who's in charge?</B><BR>
      Public information at the city is the responsibility of the Administration
      Department under City Administrator Howard L. Chambers. Asst. City Administrator
      Michael W. Stover has overseen the city web project.<BR>
      <BR>
      <BR>
      <B>What software and platforms were used?<BR>
      </B>Adobe <I>PageMill/Adobe SiteMill</I> running on an Apple <I>Powerbook
      540c</I> are at the core of creating the website. Bare Bone's <I>BBEdit</I>
      handle HTML PageMill can't do. Equilibrium's <I>DeBabelizer</I> graphics
      program is critically important in shrinking the size of graphics. Adobe's
      <I>PhotoShop, PageMaker</I>, shareware <I>JPEG View</I> and <I>GIF Converter</I>
      were also used. SyQuest's <I>EZ135</I> drive allows portable storage and
      large document and image transfers.<BR>

<TD WIDTH="60%"><P><B>Within the next 60 days</B>, city council members will decide the
issue of putting Lakewood's utility user tax to a popular vote. The decision
depends on answering two, thorny legal questions: when the referendum can
be held and if it should be limited to future tax collections or include
ratification of utility taxes collected since 1992.</P>

<P>Lakewood approved a 3 percent utility user tax following a public hearing
in 1992, based on a legal opinion by the City Attorney that the measure
did not require voter approval. Todd's opinion reflected what seemed to
be &quot;settled&quot; law-a series of Appellate Court rulings that declared
Proposition 62 and its requirement for local tax referenda unconstitutional.</P>

<P>Voters had approved Proposition 62 in 1986, and Lakewood, following its
provisions, had successfully taken an increase in the city's motel &quot;bed
tax&quot; to voters in 1988.</P>

<P>By 1992, however, three decisions of the State Court of Appeals had each
declared Proposition 62 unconstitutional, rulings the State Supreme Court
let stand without comment.</P>

<P>Three years later, after Lakewood had adopted a utility user tax, the
state Supreme Court unexpectedly reversed the lower court rulings. The decision
(on a proposed Santa Clara County transportation tax) again requires cities
to hold referenda on new local taxes and tax increases.</P>

<P>The court's decision left some issues unresolved, including when cities
would hold a vote and if they had to return taxes collected since 1986.
An effort to clarify the Santa Clara decision through legislation resulted
in a stalemate during the final days of the 1996 state legislature.</TD></TR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>When is $1 of city revenue not really $1?<BR>

<P><B>Transportation taxes . . . L.A. County Prop- osition A Park Bond Act
revenue . . . federal Community Development Block Grants . . . water fund
revenue. . . building permit fees.</B></P>

<P>What do these revenue sources, some with unfamiliar names, have in common?
The dollars they generate, and other taxpayer revenues, flow into Lakewood's
budget with strings attached.</P>

<P>Since 1980, revenues with strings attached have quietly diminished the
ability of Lakewood's elected officials to determine how your taxpayer dollars
should be spent. My review of funding patterns for California cities shows
the problem is statewide . . . and it's getting worse.</P>

<P>According to the most recent State Controller's report, of every $1 Lakewood
gets in revenue, roughly 50 cents is designated for a specific category
of expenditure before the city council adopts Lakewood's budget. In 1980
only 20 cents of every $1 in revenue came with similar strings attached.
</P>

<P>The trend has gone virtually unnoticed because local government financing
is a complex picture-a kind of jigsaw puzzle that is difficult even for
fiscal experts to complete.</P>

<H3><IMG SRC="graphics/logo_trimmed_dollar.GIF" WIDTH="115" HEIGHT="101"
ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">The strings on revenue</H3>

<P>There are three kinds of strings that limit how local revenue can be
spent:</P>

<P>Some strings, like those tied to the federal Community Development Block
Grant (CDBG) program, limit expenditures to specific classes of residents.
Lakewood's CDBG funding can only be spent to benefit seniors and residents
with modest incomes. Under federal regulations, CDBG-funded services generally
have an income test to ensure that only residents with low- and moderate-incomes
benefit.</P>

<P>Other strings, like those tied to the city's $1.2 million in state gas
tax revenue, require the city council to spend the money for a limited class
of projects, in this case only for highway improvements. County transit
tax revenue-about $1.5 million a year-has to be spent on mass transit-related
projects. Park bond act funding-about $700,000-has to be spent on &quot;bricks
and mortar&quot; park development, not for park operations.</P>

<P>Lakewood has other revenue sources that appear in the city budget but
which cannot be reallocated. The largest source of this &quot;designated&quot;
revenue-$5.4 million a year-comes from the city's water utility. By law,
water revenues must be spent for the operation and maintenance of the city's
water system.</P>

<P>Trash collection service charges-about $3.3 million a year-cover the
cost of the city's trash collection contract. Building permit fees, recreation
class fees, and park facility fees-about $2 million a year-offset some of
the direct costs of providing these services.</P>

<P></P>

<H3>How we got here</H3>

<P>Beginning in the 1980s, voters in Los Angeles County approved two sales
tax increases, and each time they attached strings to the money. Voters
were concerned about mass transit and traffic congestion when they approved
these tax increases. </P>

<P>Lakewood also expects to receive $2.4 million from federal grant programs
this year, but all this money is restricted by Congress to specific purposes.
</P>

<P>When city officials are presented with the bill for Sheriff's law enforcement,
emergency preparedness, street lights, park maintenance, or the operation
of city facilities, they can't pay with &quot;restricted&quot; and &quot;designated&quot;
funds. They have to reach into an ever-shrinking general fund. </TD></TR>

<TD WIDTH="81%"><B>As other documents in this special Lakewood Online section show, government
financing is a complicated puzzle that even fiscal experts find hard to
untangle. The problem is complicated by Lakewood's status as a low-tax and
low-spend contract city, California's crazy quilt of restricted funding
sources, and the effects of state legislation that gives some cities a bigger
slice of the property tax pie.</B></TD></TR>

<TD WIDTH="60%"><P><B>Consider these statistics:</B></P>

<P>Lakewood gets only 39 percent of the revenue of the average city (and
just 84 percent of the revenue of other contract cities). Lakewood's status
as a low-spend, low-tax contract city was the choice of voters forty-two
years ago. As a result, Lakewood relies on relatively few revenue sources
to pay for basic city services. For the 1996-1997 fiscal year, just 10 revenue
sources will generate $23 million of the $30 million general government
budget.</TD></TR>

<TD WIDTH="81%"><P><B>A seventeen-year-old state law (known as AB 8) froze the property
tax ratios</B><BR>
of California cities to the levels they were in the 1970s. As a result,
cities that are similar today may receive very dissimilar amounts of property
tax revenue. Long Beach took in $97 per person in property tax revenue,
according to the most recent State Controller's report. Downey took in $58.
Lakewood took in $14.38.</P>

<P><B>One myth is that Lakewood gets more than its &quot;share&quot; of
sales tax revenue<BR>
</B>In fact, Lakewood gets less. At $86 per person, Lakewood generates less
sales tax revenue than the average L.A. and Orange county city (at $92 per
person) and far less than the average contract city (at $94 per person).<BR>
<BR>
<B>Because Lakewood gets less revenue, Lakewood spends less</B><BR>
Contracting with the Sheriff's Department, for example, holds law enforcement
costs to about $73 per person per year; the average non-contract city, with
its own police department, spends $232 per person. Although Lakewood spends
less overall, the city spends more (as a percent of its budget) than the
average city for law enforcement and recreation programs-two &quot;quality
of life&quot; services that Lakewood residents say they value. <BR>

<P>If revenues from one division of a company dipped, raising prices, cutting

<P><BR>
Lakewood has the same choices. Raising our &quot;prices&quot; may soon require
voter approval under the terms of Proposition 62. More cost cutting would
be an evolutionary process, not a wholesale transformation of city priorities.
It's the third alternative-reallocating revenues to maintain important services
and programs-that is probably the hardest for residents to understand.</P>

<P><BR>
Reallocating revenues from one part of the budget to another is not always
possible. Revenue sources restricted by law or designated by policy can't
easily be shifted to pay for basic city services when economic recession
or state budget takeaways cause other local revenues to drop.</TD></TR>

Take away the city's utility user tax and Lakewood would have to cut, not

<B>$5,953,473 in revenue is collected and passed through the general fund

Sky Knight, and school crossing guards-costs $4,615,549 a year.</B> (Another
$800,000 comes from federal grants and reimbursements for the operation
of the Sky Knight helicopters.) It's not likely that anyone would favor
cutting basic public safety expenditures to make up revenue losses. That
makes the city's utility user tax 17 percent of unrestricted, undesignated
revenues.</P>

<P><BR>
Peel away the rest of the funding that is restricted or designated and Lakewood's
true discretionary revenue is just $9,686,256. This makes the utility tax
19 percent of the discretionary revenue in the city's general fund, even

<H1><CENTER>BUDGET AT A GLANCE 1996-1998</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3>CITY OF LAKEWOOD - BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS</H3>
By Howard L. Chambers, City Administrator<BR>
Larry Schroeder, Director of Finance<BR>
<BR>
<B>ECONOMIC REALITIES</B><BR>
<BR>
By most accounts, the recession which hit California in mid-1990 is over.
There are some signs that the Los Angeles area seems to be joining the rest
of the State in economic recovery. This seems to be sparked by new aerospace
projects such as the B-2 bomber, F/A-18 fighter and the C-17 transport.
However, employment has still not fully recovered and this very much affects
the local economy of Lakewood.<BR>
<BR>
In December 1995, the nation's largest retailers saw the worst holiday sales
since at least 1990. The<BR>
figures for Lakewood's retailers were generally disappointing and retail
sales of apparel items are<BR>
expected to continue to be slow. This affects Lakewood because a large part
of City revenues which<BR>
support public safety and recreation programs comes from sales tax. The
threat from the development of the Naval Hospital site into a &quot;power
center&quot; still looms on the horizon.<BR>
<BR>
Our offense is the City's Economic Strategic Planning Committee. This committee
analyzes information on the local, regional and State economy and then utilizes
this information to encourage property owners, business persons and developers
to invest in our community. Lakewood is also encouraged by the reorganization
of our local Chamber of Commerce, who is a welcome partner in our efforts
to maintain our vibrant local economy.<BR>
<BR>
Lakewood also faces a challenge from a recent court decision to its utility
user's tax. This court decision overturns many lower court rulings made
over the last ten years and contradicts direction from State legislators.
Our City Council enacted the utility user's tax when the courts still said
we could. This modest 3% tax is still necessary, especially in light of
local economic conditions, to support public safety and recreation programs.
Today, the legislature is considering action to rectify this matter.<BR>
<BR>
The State has not yet passed its 1996-97 budget. Lakewood's proposed budget
does not include any<BR>
State actions which may affect local government. Such future action by Sacramento
would require a<BR>
budgetary adjustment at the time it occurs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>REVENUES</B><BR>
<BR>
Total general government revenues are estimated at $30,041,739 for FY 1996-97
and $28,828,572 for FY 1997-98.<BR>
<BR>
<B>APPROPRIATIONS</B><BR>
<BR>
General government proposed appropriations total $31,016,140 for FY 1996-97
and $29,272,760 for FY 1997-98.<BR>
<BR>
<B>RESERVES</B><BR>
<BR>
The budget calls for the use of $175,000 in reserves for equipment replacement
for fiscal 1996-97 and $107,000 in 1997-98. <BR>
<BR>
In 1996-97, $456,009 of Prop A and Prop C will be used as well as $56,625
in Cable funds. In 1997-98, $316,913 of Prop A and Prop C reserves will
be used.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS</B><BR>
<BR>
In the proposed budget, the utility user's tax collected from October 28,
1995 through June 30, 1998 has been transferred into a trust account pending
the outcome of proposed legislation regarding Proposition 62. In 1993, the
City implemented a 3% utility user's tax to balance the budget in light
of State &quot;take-aways.&quot; Although tested by many lower court rulings
from 1986 through 1995; in late 1995, the State Supreme Court brought into
question the continued legality or the utility user's tax. Until this pending
legislation brings clarification or other action is taken, setting aside
these revenues seems the prudent course of action.<BR>
<BR>
<B>EXPENDITURE LIMIT</B><BR>
<BR>
Article XIIIB of the California Constitution limits the expenditures from
the proceeds of taxes. These expenditures may increase over the prior year
in the same percentage as inflation and population changes. Grants and non-tax
revenues are exempt.<BR>
<BR>
The preliminary budget is 62% of the expenditure ceiling. 
<H2><BR>
BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS</H2>
<B>SALES TAX</B><BR>
<BR>
Lakewood's share of the uniform state sales tax is the City's largest revenue
source, estimated at $6,625,000 for fiscal year 1996-97. This represents
an increase of 2% from 1995-96. The projection for 1997-98 is a 1% increase
over 1996-97.<BR>
<BR>
The City's &quot;top ten&quot; retail businesses as a group produced approximately
34% of the City's sales tax revenues in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
<B>STATE SUBVENTIONS</B><BR>
<BR>
For fiscal year 1996-97, state-collected local taxes (subventions) are estimated
at $4,437,306. The largest of these are: motor vehicle in lieu, $2,600,000
and state gas tax, $1,222,500. Cigarette tax was eliminated as a shared
revenue for cities in July 1992.<BR>
<BR>
In the second budget year, we project no increase in motor vehicle fees,
and gas tax receipts will increase only 2%.<BR>
<BR>
<B>REVENUE LOSSES</B><BR>
<BR>
The combination of State &quot;take-aways&quot; and the recent recession
has had a devastating effect on<BR>
Lakewood's revenues. Revenues which would have provided increased levels
of service to Lakewood residents. The losses in property tax, sales tax,
Community Development Block Grant, revenue sharing, subventions and like
revenues now amount to the tens of millions of dollars since 1978. A continuing
sluggish economy and recent court decisions continue to affect or threaten
revenues which provide services such as law enforcement, parks and recreation
programs to Lakewood citizens. <BR>
<BR>
<H2>FOCUS AREA PRIORITIES</H2>
<BR>
<B>1. ECONOMIC STRATEGY</B><BR>
<BR>
Lakewood's &quot;#1&quot; objective is the preservation and enhancement
of the economic base of the City. <BR>
Besides the impact the economic condition of the Southeast Los Angeles County
subregion has on<BR>
Lakewood, we have some influence on our own local economy.<BR>
<BR>
Lakewood's Economic Strategic Planning Committee was formed to identify
and promote economic opportunities within the City. To accomplish these
objectives, the Committee uses both information on the local, regional and
State economy, as well as communicating with property owners, business persons
and developers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>2. INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS</B><BR>
<BR>
The City's intergovernmental relations program responds to the continuing
assault on &quot;home rule&quot;<BR>
authority. Mandates, regulations and pending proposals threaten locally
allocated fiscal resources. <BR>
The City has been engaged in an intense effort to protect its property owners
against the economic<BR>
burden of purchasing Federally mandated flood insurance, which would be
deemed unnecessary when the enhancements to the Los Angeles and San Gabriel
Rivers are completed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>3. PUBLIC SAFETY</B><BR>
<BR>
The focus continues on law enforcement with full funding for general law
enforcement units to handle an estimated 30,000 calls for service annually.
We are happy to report that overall there was an 11% decrease in Lakewood's
serious crimes during 1995. This year our three-city law enforcement region
will be reduced down to Lakewood and Artesia.<BR>
<BR>
Law enforcement initiatives include funding for four specially assigned
officers, two dedicated<BR>
community service officers and the continuation of Sky Knight. This year
the Sky Knight program will be enhanced by the purchase of a new helicopter
which replaces one of our twenty-year-old aircraft.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>4. EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS</B><BR>
<BR>
Lakewood's Emergency Management Program establishes employee training and
preparation as its<BR>
focus for building employee skills as Disaster Service Workers. It includes
the &quot;I'm Prepared&quot; program and the City's &quot;First Response
Strike Team&quot; as well as specialized training in first aid/CPR and urban
search and rescue. The City is currently installing an emergency power generator
and an emergency supply container at the Civic Center.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>5. WATER RESOURCES</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In March 1996, Water Revenue Bonds were issued for the replacement of water
mains, the replacement of water storage tanks and the drilling of a new
water well. The completion of these projects will take place during the
1996-98 Budget cycle. It is projects like this and others such as the purchase
of an additional 400 acre feet of water pumping rights during 1995-96, that
assures Lakewood's citizens a reliable and adequate water supply.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>6. SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT</B><BR>
<BR>
Approximately 57,000 tons of refuse were collected during 1994-95 in the
City. State law mandates that cities develop a solid waste management plan
with a variety of components, and that cities meet certain diversion goals
by 1995 and 2000. Lakewood's plan to meet its mandated diversion goals includes
a collection center network for recyclables, formation of the citizen &quot;Recycling
Corps&quot; and a recycling program for the business community. The plan
also focuses on composting and used oil recycling. It is in part because
of these efforts that the number of tons of refuse collected during 1994-95
was reduced from the previous year.<BR>
<BR>
<B>7. INFORMATION SYSTEMS</B><BR>
<BR>
The City's local area networked used to share information amongst departments
is now fully<BR>
operational. The transfer of the City's computerized systems from its older
hardware system to an HP 9000 will be completed by June 30, 1996. <BR>
<BR>
During 1996-97, many of the City's forms will be redesigned by staff to
take advantage of the new<BR>
system's high speed laser printers. Planning for the use of geographic information
and document<BR>
storage systems will also take place during the 1996-97 Fiscal Year.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>8. COST CONTAINMENT</B><BR>
<BR>
The eighteen-member Cost Containment Committee was formed in February 1992
in recognition of the recessionary economy and the City's tight fiscal condition.
The mission of the Committee is to find new ways to reduce costs and generate
new revenues without affecting the quality of service.<BR>
<BR>
The efforts of this committee continues to result in hard dollar savings
to the City.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>9. PARK PRESERVATION</B><BR>
<BR>
The 1996-98 budget includes major improvements to Rynerson Park lighting,
as well as the construction of several picnic shelters. These park projects
will be funded from the 1992 Proposition A Recreation Grant Funds and the
Park Dedication Fund. The maintenance of safe, clean parks is one of Lakewood's
number one priorities. <BR>
<H2>MAJOR EXPENDITURES</H2>
<BR>
<B>CONTRACT SERVICES</B><BR>
<BR>
43% of the total expenditures are for contract services for fiscal year
1996-97. The same is true for fiscal year 1997-98. The major contracts for
fiscal year 1996-97 are: 
<UL>
  <LI>Law enforcement, $4,772,094 
  <LI>Refuse collection, $1,925,000 
  <LI>Refuse disposal, $1,100,000 
  <LI>Street lighting, $770,000 
  <LI>Building inspections, $428,200 
  <LI>Sky Knight, $414,928 
  <LI>Tree maintenance, $381,000 
  <LI>Street sweeping, $345,000 <BR>
</UL>
<B>CITY WORK FORCE</B><BR>
<BR>
28% of the preliminary budget is personnel expense. Although the number
of budgeted positions in<BR>
1995-96 was 164, six of these positions are currently vacant. <BR>
<BR>
Lakewood has a core of outstanding employees who have provided dedicated
service to the City during these difficult economic times.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>SUPPLIES AND EXPENSES</B><BR>
<BR>
19% of the preliminary budget is supplies and expenses. The largest of these
are: 
<UL>
  <LI>Utilities, $875,915 
  <LI>Insurance-liability/property/WC, $1,033,120 
  <LI>Vehicle/equipment maintenance, $143,950 
  <LI>Recreation program supplies, $156,045 <BR>
</UL>
<B>CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS</B><BR>
<BR>
Proposed capital improvements are projected at $3.6 million. These include
appropriations for both<BR>
years of the budget cycle. Major projects include: 
<UL>
  <LI>Prop A 1992 park improvements, $946,700 
  <LI>Slurry seal, $850,000 
  <LI>Street resurfacing, $400,000 
  <LI>Picnic Shelters, $73,510 
  <LI>Rynerson Park Lighting, $18,000 
</UL>
<BR>
<B>WATER OPERATIONS</B><BR>
<BR>
Proposed water operating expenses total $4.8 million in fiscal year 1996-97
and are expected to decrease 2.2% in fiscal year 1997-98. Major expenses
include: 
<UL>
  <LI>Underground aquifer water replenishment cost, $1,504,500 
  <LI>Electricity for pumping, $535,050 
  <LI>Depreciation, $300,000 
  <LI>Reclaimed water, $74,375 
</UL>
<BR>
The 1959 Water Revenue Bonds were paid off in March 1994. In March 1996,
new Water Revenue<BR>
Bonds were issued. The proceeds will be used for the drilling of a new water
well, the replacement of water mains and the replacement of water storage
tanks.<BR>

<H2>FY 1996-97 Lakewood budget emphasizes public safety </H2>
<B>Lakewood will buy a new Sky Knight helicopter and continue expanded crime
suppression programs. The budget also funds improvements to streets, parks,
playgrounds, and the city water system <BR>
<P><CENTER></B><IMG SRC="graphics/logo_city_budget_tiny.gif" WIDTH="108"
HEIGHT="83" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"> </CENTER>
<P>Despite buffeting from federal, state, and county funding decisions,
the Lakewood City Council has<BR>
adopted a two-year municipal budget that, for the time being, charts a steady
course through turbulent fiscal waters. Among the storm warnings issued
by City Administrator Howard Chambers in presenting his proposed budget
to the city council:
<UL>
  <LI>The possible loss of $1.8 million (or 8 percent of the city's General
Fund revenue) should the state legislature fail to clarify the state Supreme
Court's decision on municipal utility tax revenues.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>A Los Angeles County budget shortfall that may lead to increased costs
for county-provided services. 
</UL>
<BR>
<B>Budget highlights</B><BR>
<BR>
The 1996-97 FY budget continues Lakewood's focus on crime fighting that
yielded an 11 percent decrease in serious crimes in 1995. The budget also
includes park improvement projects to be built with restricted funds, extends
the city's street maintenance program, and continues water system improvements
with the proceeds of a recent revenue bond sale.<BR>
<BR>
The city council approved a $5.3 million spending plan for basic law enforcement
and extended agreements for the city's five Specially Assigned Officers,
four Community Service Officers, and the Sky Knight helicopter patrol program.
The city will purchase a new helicopter this year to replace a 20-year-old
aircraft. <BR>
<BR>
The city council also continued support for Lakewood's successful crime
prevention programs, including Neighborhood Watch, Lakewood Business Watch,
Sheriff's Volunteers on Patrol, and the school-based Substance Abuse and
Narcotics Education (SANE) program. &quot;Lakewood's focus on crime suppression
and prevention is having the impact we hoped it would,&quot; Chambers noted.
<BR>
<BR>
Overall, serious crime decreased 11 percent in 1995, thanks to targeted
enforcement at crime &quot;hot spots&quot; and new crime prevention programs
like Volunteers on Patrol.<BR>
<BR>
The budget also continues funding for the city's disaster preparedness program.
Called CARE, the program shows residents how to form neighborhood response
teams to supplement county disaster workers in the event of a major disaster.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Park improvements</B><BR>
<BR>
The 1996-97 FY budget includes improvements to park play area equipment
($73,000), athletic field renovation and game court resurfacing ($46,700),
and picnic shelters ($73,510). Funding for these projects will come from
state and federal grants and the city's share of Proposition A county recreation
bond act funds.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Restricted funds&quot; like these represent 24 percent of the city's
budget. Restricted funding can only be used for purposes mandated by county,
state, and federal governments, not for general government services such
as law enforcement. According to Chambers, &quot;In practical terms, restricted
funding reduces Lakewood's ability to spend revenues where residents see
the greatest need.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Budget priorities</B> <BR>
<BR>
The 1996-97 FY budget also focuses on: 
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>1) Economic Development</B><BR>
<BR>
The city council endorsed a strongly pro-active economic development plan
for making the city's retail centers more competitive. Chambers pointed
out that Lakewood's handicap in the race for retail dollars is the city's
limited area for development. &quot;Just 6 percent of Lakewood is available
for commercial use, in contrast to commercially zoned percentages of 13
to 15 percent in adjacent cities,&quot; Chambers noted.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2) Solid Waste Management</B><BR>
<BR>
Lakewood's plan to meet state-mandated waste diversion goals includes continuing
the city#s network of drop-off and buy-back recycling centers for residents
and recycling collection programs for Lakewood businesses.<BR>
<BR>
<B>3) Water Resources</B><BR>
<BR>
Appropriations of $2.9 million for water system improvements were continued
from the 1995-96 FY. These projects include replacement of water mains,
renovation of water storage tanks, and a new water well. Funding comes from
$5.9 million in 1996 water system revenue bonds.<BR>
<BR>
<B>4) Street Repairs</B><BR>
<BR>
The city council allocated $756,000 to resurfacing city streets.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Just the numbers</B><BR>
<BR>
The budget contains: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>General government appropriations of $31,016,140 for the 1996-97 FY.
Total spending for all city programs and services in the 1996-97 FY (including
capital projects and operation of the city's water utility) is projected
at $36,234,940. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Capital improvements of $2.4 million for the 1996-97 FY, and $321,883
in projects initiated last year. 
  <LI>Lakewood budgets over a two-year cycle, with generally minor adjustments
at the start of the budget's second year. 
</UL>
<BR>
To achieve a balanced budget, Lakewood officials are tapping a variety of
resources including:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>$714,900 in recreation class and sports program fees to offset $1.6
million in costs for city recreation programs. 
  <LI>Cost-cutting ideas to operate more efficiently and save money from
the city employee Cost Containment Committee. Since 1990, the committee
has found ways to save the city nearly $800,000. 
</UL>

<TD WIDTH="66%" VALIGN="TOP"><P>Welcoming back &quot;a familiar friend,&quot; hundreds of Lakewood, residents
descended on the Lakewood Center Mall on Sept. 18 for the grand opening
of the Lucky supermarket. The store's lot was so jammed on opening day that
customers had to use adjoining parking areas at certain times. The store
is next to Home Depot at the corner of Clark and Del Amo.</P>

<P>The debut of the 50,000-sq.-ft. freestanding store marked the return
of the powerful food retailer to Lakewood Center after an almost 10-year
hiatus.<BR>
<IMG SRC="graphics/logo_lucky.gif" WIDTH="176" HEIGHT="73" ALIGN="RIGHT"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>More over, the opening completed Macerich's redevelopment of an outparcel
that for merly housed a freestanding Bullock's department store. The supermarket
joins the 130,000-sq.-ft. Home Depot that opened on the 14-acre site last
fall. All told, the Lakewood center complex has a total of1.75 million sq.
ft. of GLA</P>

<P>Lucky previously operated a slightly smaller freestanding store closer
to Lake wood Center's 1.12-million-sq.-ft. enclosed mall. When the lease
expired in January 1987, Macerich chose to subdivide the 46,000-sq.-ft.
space into what be came the Del Amo Shops building.</P>

<P>Denoted by striking exterior colors, Lucky's new location incorporates
a full- service Bank of America branch; a full- service deli, bakery and
fresh fish depart ments; a melon bar; a floral department, and a 'warehouse
store' section.</P>

<P>Discussing the chain's return to Lakewood Center, Lucky Stores spokesperson
Judy Decker told the Long Beach Press-Telegram , &quot;The mall is a destination
point for a lot of people. That benefits us as well as the customer because
it decreases the number of trips necessary to do shopping.&quot;<BR>
<IMG SRC="graphics/photo_lucky.gif" WIDTH="285" HEIGHT="183" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P>&quot;We're pleased to have Lucky back in the fold,&quot; says Macerich
regional manager Charles Hallums. &quot;The mayor and city council were
all eager for their return, not just because of the contribution to tax
revenues, but be cause they round out the merchandise mix and provide a
service that's been gone from this end of the community for nearly 10 years.
I've received many calls from original residents who expressed their delight
about having a major supermarket back in such a convenient location.&quot;</P>

<P>Lakewood Mayor Robert G. Wagner says the opening &quot;returns a popular
retailer to the city and the center...Lucky's return is like welcoming back
a familiar friend.&quot;</P>

<P>Wagner believes that Macerich's moves in remerchandising the former Bullock's
site exemplify a larger trend in mall retailing. &quot;As regional malls
continue to vig orously reinvent themselves, they are restoring a healthy
mix of shopper choices to centers that had become almost solely devoted
to fashion,&quot; he observes.</P>

<P>&quot;Lakewood Center is leading this trend, with the open ing of Lucky
and Home Depot on the Bullock's site,&quot; Wagner continues. &quot;These
new stores anchor a fresh vision for Lakewood Center, one that is also expressed
in the major remodeling of the mall's interior now un der way. These new
additions are a clear signal that Lakewood Center intends to aggressively
maintain its leadership position in the ever-changing retail market.&quot;</TD></TR>

<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Lakewood Mall gets a new look<BR>
Major renovation done by Nov 1996</H1>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><HR><BR>
</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="graphics/lakemall.jpg" WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="251"
ALIGN="RIGHT" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></P>

<P><B>From the colorful</B> banners above to the ceramic tile flooring below,
Lakewood Center Mall will have a totally new look when this year's holiday
selling season rolls around. <BR>
<BR>
Now under way, the extensive interior renovation of the 1.16 million sq.
ft. southern California mall is scheduled to be completed in early November,
according to Brooks Sims, V.P. of Macerich's construction division and project
manager for the renovation. The general contractor, Vratsinas Construction
Company, is doing the bulk of the work after hours so as to avoid disruptions
to business. <BR>
<BR>
Key elements of the project at Macerich's flagship center include replacing
wood parquet flooring throughout the common area with Italian-style ceramic
tiling in a variety of patterns; repainting all bulkheads, columns, ceiling
and cove areas in a monochromatic, off-white color scheme; installing colorful
banners throughout the interior that will be changed on a seasonal basis;
upgrading all lighting to increase illumination levels; replacing all ceiling
tiles; and upgrading plantings, benches and other amenities throughout the
mall. <BR>
<BR>
<B>The new plantings and benches</B> will replace the mall's sculptures,
fountains and a series of tree wells. All are being removed to enhance visibility.
&quot;We're now looking to find homes for three stainless steel sculptures
in planter beds on the outside,&quot; notes Sims. <BR>
<BR>
<B>&quot;Overall, Lakewood will have a new, modern, colorful, and uncluttered
look,&quot;</B> sums up mall manager Mark Long. &quot;Three years ago, the
mall's exterior was renovated to reflect a Mediterranean-Spanish look. This
remodeling will help carry that same feeling to the inside.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="graphics/mall_crews.jpg" WIDTH="314" HEIGHT="196" ALIGN="RIGHT"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><BR>
Elaborating on the design concept, Doug Breckenridge, project designer for
Architecture+, Monroe, La., notes that the Veranda Stone replacing the parquet
floor &quot;strongly enhances the Mediterranean look of the mall's exterior
and gives it a distinctive appearance. Even benches and planters will have
the same Spanish Eclectic look in keeping with the theme.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
As part of the project, Macerich will also upgrade the look and visibility
of the mall's kiosks. All but a few of the 23 units will be fitted with
new framing systems, utilizing three prototypical styles. At the same time,
a number of the kiosks will be repositioned to provide more balanced distribution
throughout the common area. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;We're getting away from clustering the kiosks in an effort to enhance
the visibility of each unit and to encourage a cross-flow of shoppers,&quot;
explains leasing manager Mark Strain, who is working with the kiosk tenants.
&quot;Equally important, the neutral look of the new framing systems will
let the merchandise stand out.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The program will give a more uniform look and better visibility to
every kiosk operator in here,&quot; comments Jason Burns, manager of The
Key Factory. &quot;I think everyone is going to be real happy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Finny Sturrock, owner of Nuts &amp; Company, seconds those sentiments. &quot;I
love the idea of repositioning the kiosks and creating a more uniform look.
I'm also pleased with the overall plans. Mace-rich is always working on
improving the look of the mall, where many other malls don't change at all.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
As the renovation moves forward, many retailers like what they see. As Coast
Footwear V.P. Don Bernstein commented in a letter to Long: &quot;The new
flooring is attractive, colorful and does a lot to update the mall. It's
always nice to see good things happening at Lakewood Center.&quot; <BR>
<BR>

is a series of young teen dance and party nights which will be the place
to be throughout the fall. Offered to middle school age students (grades
6-8) who live in or attend one of the Lakewood area schools, TFN offers
a fresh alternative to your weekend routine. Each night will have a D.J.
with dancing, an occasional live act and special themes with prizes. Pool
tables, ping pong tables, air hockey, foosball, a snack bar and an outdoor
patio area with a fire pit will be available for your entertainment. This
is your chance to hang out with friends, meet new people from other schools
and have a great time all at once.</P>

<P>Totally Friday Nights opens its doors each scheduled night by 6:45 p.m.
Doors close at 7:30 p.m. and remain closed until 10 p.m. unless you're picked
up earlier by a parent at our front door.</P>

<P>So what do you need to do? It's simple... just pick up a Lakewood Totally
Friday Nights permission slip at your school office or in the Recreation
Department at Lakewood City Hall, 5050 Clark Ave. Bring the fully completed
permission slip and your school I.D. to the event. If your school doesn't
issue an I.D. card, have your permission slip stamped with an official school
stamp in your school office. You must be able to prove you live in Lakewood
or go to a Lakewood area school. Admission fee to the event is $3.50...
and that's all there is to it! Only the first 400 students will be admitted
each night, so be sure you're in line early.</P>

<H3>Teen Volunteer Program</H3>

<P>Out Teen Volunteer Program got off to a great start this summer and continues
this fall. There are plenty of opportunities to volunteer at a park or community
center. Set aside a few hours a week after school and help our professional
recreation staff perform duties such as crafts, sports field preparation,
office work and work on Special Olympics. Have some fun and learn new skills
which can become very beneficial as the time draws near to start job hunting.
Teens must be 12 years of age, willing to follow through on a volunteer
commitment, and interested in helping the community. If you're interested
in the program, contact the Lakewood Youth Center at (310) 429-7472.</P>

<H1><CENTER>Volunteers expand law enforcement</CENTER>
</H1>
<IMG SRC="../magazine/graphics/vopcar.gif" <BR>
Volunteers Karen Covy and Marv Maxwell begin their shift on partol<BR>
<I>(From Lakewood Living Newsletter, July 1995)<BR>
</I><BR>
Sgt. Mason Kenny of the Lakewood Sheriff's Station had a good idea to make
law enforcement even more visible on Lakewood streets. Why not, Sgt. Kenny
thought, take crime prevention into a new dimension and recruit residents
to staff a neighborhood patrol program. These &quot;volunteers on patrol&quot;
would receive extensive training in Sheriff's procedures, particularly in
handling radio calls. They would wear uniforms and drive specially-marked
Sheriff's units. But, they wouldn't be reserve deputies or be involved in
arrests.<BR>
<BR>
As it turned out, Sgt. Kenny's idea for Volunteers on Patrol wasn't just
a good idea. It was a spectacularly good idea. &quot;I don't think we realized
how popular a program like this could be in Lakewood,&quot; Sgt. Kenny notes.
&quot;The station's Volunteers on Patrol (VOP) program has already graduated
three classes since VOP began in June 1994, with more than 90 volunteers
trained and on duty.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../magazine/graphics/vopyard.gif" ALIGN=
"MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Vacation checks are part of the VOP routine.
They also work with business<BR>
<BR>
Sgt. Kenny believes the Volunteers on Patrol program closes a gap in the
opportunities available for volunteers at the Lakewood Sheriff's Station.
&quot;Block captains in the city's Neighborhood Watch program effectively
support crime prevention activities, but they focus on their own neighborhood.
And, the station's civilian volunteers handle assignments by telephone or
through office visits. Volunteers on Patrol do something more. They're uniformed
and on the streets in marked cars. The VOPs have a highly visible law enforcement
presence.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The VOP program fills another gap-an age gap. Many of the volunteers are
younger residents of the cities in the station's service area. The volunteers
include a number of recent college graduates. Some of them are looking for
careers in law enforcement. &quot;We're now developing a Lakewood focus
to the VOP program,&quot; Sgt. Kenny points out. &quot;We're training and
scheduling a cadre of VOP members who will patrol only in Lakewood and be
familiar with the city's crime prevention needs.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="../magazine/graphics/vopmay.gif" ALIGN=
"MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3">Covey and Maxwell provide a reassuring presence
at Mayfair Park<BR>
<BR>
VOP volunteers patrol in teams of two in four-hour shifts-mostly on weekends
and in the evenings, partly because those are the hours when volunteers
with jobs are free. For the volunteers, the VOP program is a way of giving
something back to their community, according to VOP volunteer Karie Cuesta,
who is the daughter of VOP volunteer Marv Maxwell.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We've been very well received by Lakewood residents,&quot; she says.
&quot;People are always thanking us.&quot; Cuesta credits her training for
the confidence she has in her VOP team members. &quot;We've been trained
what to do and not to do in emergency situations. We don't get involved
in arrests. We've learned traffic control, and what to do if we get a report
of a break-in.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
VOP training begins with 14 hours of classroom instruction. The training
is supplemented with eight hours of 911 call experience and three shifts
as a ride-along with a regular Sheriff's deputy. <BR>

</P>

<P> <B><FONT SIZE=+2>Protect the environment, and YOUR safety!<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B>The County Sanitation Districts will conduct another free, household
hazardous waste roundup for Lakewood residents between 9 am-3 pm on Saturday,
November 9.  The roundup is at Veterans Stadium in Long Beach, 5000 Lew
Davis Street, south of the intersection Clark Ave. and Carson Street. The
entrance to the Veterans Stadium parking area is south of Long Beach City
College. Materials will be collected in the stadium parking lot, next to
Douglas Aircraft.<BR>
<BR>
Paint, automotive chemicals, and household toxics from your home and garage
can be brought to the collection site. Sanitation District technicians will
process the hazardous wastes, which cannot be dumped into your regular,
weekly trash. <BR>
<BR>
Unwanted paints, solvents, batteries, motor oil, and insecticides are among
the items to be collected at the roundup. No ammunition, explosives, or
radioactive materials are accepted. You can discard old paint, used motor
oil, household cleaners, pesticides, solvents, and car batteries. </P>

<H3>To make the process as safe and convenient as possible:</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Make sure all containers are sealed. Wrap damaged or leaky containers
  in sheets of newspaper and box them securely. </LI>
  <LI>Pack your discards in a sturdy box. Keep all the containers upright.
  </LI>
  <LI>Make sure that flammable and corrosive discards are kept in separate
  boxes. </LI>
  <LI>While sorting and packing hazardous materials, keep children and pets
  at a safe distance. </LI>
  <LI>Pack small boxes in a larger, leak-free, sturdy box. Pack flammables,
  corrosives, and poisons in separate boxes. </LI>
</UL>

<H3>Name your poison</H3>

<P>Household hazardous waste comes in many forms, including:<BR>
<BR>
Poisons like flea powders, insecticides and weed killers, photographic chemicals,
and some art supplies. Acutely toxic poisons can cause severe illness or
death if ingested. Many can be absorbed directly through the skin or respiratory
system. Flammables, including some pesticides, all waste oil, brake and
transmission fluid, rug and upholstery cleaners, air fresheners, oil-base
points and enamels, solvents and thinners.<BR>
<BR>
Corrosives, such as drain openers, oven cleaners, toilet bowl cleaners,
ammonia-based cleaners, chlorine bleach, pool acids, and photographic chemicals.
These can cause severe burns on contact. Mixed with other household chemicals,
they can produce vapors that burn eyes and lungs.<BR>

<H1>Greenwaste composters <BR>
and classes available</H1>
<BR>
<B>By June Anderson - Lakewood Recycling Coordinator</B><BR>
<BR>
Composting has the potential to recycle one of the largest parts of the
city's waste stream--the 30 percent of the city's trash that is &quot;green
waste&quot; created by lawn and landscape maintenance. With the help of
beneficial bacteria, moisture, and time, composting turns leaves and grass
clippings into a rich, earth-like material that's great for the garden.<BR>
<BR>
Composting is easy in Lakewood. The city offers both classes and lowcost
composting bins. The training classes are offered conveniently at Lakewood
parks. Call 866-9771, extension 2500 to find out when the next class is
being held. The city sells backyard composting bins to Lakewood residents
for a dirt-cheap $40 and throws in a handy guide to turning your &quot;greens&quot;
into compost.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Composting is easy</B><BR>
<BR>
Most Lakewood homes can use backyard composting to reduce the amount of
green waste they generate. Nearly everyone has space where an efficient,
easy-to-use composter can be located. It takes the right blend of ingredients
to make good compost. <BR>
<BR>
The simplest recipe for a backyard bin mixes equal parts of dry and moist
materials--the &quot;browns&quot; and the &quot;greens&quot;--for a balanced
diet for the organisms that thrive in the composting process. Chopped yard
and garden trimmings are ideal for composting. So are fresh materials, such
as fruit and vegetable trimmings. You can add dry leaves, twigs, and chopped
bark.<BR>
<BR>
Wood chips can be an important compost bulking agent, especially when processing
really wet materials. Compost materials must be kept moist--about as damp
as a wrung-out sponge. The developing compost needs air--that means stirring
the material regularly, perhaps once a week.<BR>
In our climate, a well-tended compost bin will yield rich garden soil in
a month or two. <BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="anchor238873"></A><B>Grass recycling</B><BR>
<BR>
Even if you don't compost your grass clippings, they still can stay out
of the trash. You simply leave them on the lawn. Grass clippings are mostly
water, with a little nitrogen and other organic matter that decomposes quickly.
Leaving your clippings on the lawn makes great fertilizer.<BR>
<BR>
All you have to do is mow your lawn more often, so that you don't create
heaps of clippings. Lawn clippings also can be used as mulch to provide
weed control in flower beds and around shrubs. This works particularly well
over a base of cedar bark or redwood mulch. Clippings shade the soil as
they dry out, meaning you have to water garden plants less. <BR>

<H1>Water for tomorrow: Pure and plentiful</H1>

<P><B>Some background information on the water you drink<BR>
| </B><A HREF="links_water.html">Water Links</A><B> |</B><BR>
<BR>
For most Lakewood residents, a big part of local government is only a few
steps away--in the kitchen, laundry room, or bath. When someone in the 20,600
households west of the San Gabriel River turns on a tap, clean, reliable
water supplied by a city-owned utility flows out. It's been that way since
1957, when the city bought the Lakewood Water and Power Company from Lakewood's
original developers. (If you live east of the river, your water comes from
the Southern California Water Company, a private water supplier. A neighborhood
near Mayfair High School receives its supply from Peerless Water, a small,
private water company.) <BR>
<BR>
In 1995 the city paid off the bonds sold in 1957 to finance the purchase
of the water system. Due to advantageous markets the city has the opportunity,
to sell a new series of bonds to finance improvements to its water system.
The improvements will take Lakewood water through the 1990s and into the
first decades of the new century. The new water bonds won't raise taxes;
we will pay bond holders out of the income earned from water sales.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Among the improvements to the city system</B><BR>
<BR>
Lakewood is drilling a new well soon that should be completed this summer.
The $1 million project will insure access to the underground aquifers from
which the city draws all of its drinking water. Because Lakewood will have
more younger families with children, we expect water consumption to increase
slightly through the year 2005 to about 9,200 acre feet. Despite this growth,
water use in 2005 will still be much lower than the 10,000 acre feet we
consumed in 1985. In 1985 we began development of the city's reclaimed water
system for park and landscape irrigation, and we began educating residents
how to conserve water with low-flow toilets and appropriate landscape watering.<BR>
<BR>
The city needs to maintain its water storage facilities. The tanks you see
on Arbor Road and on Palo Verde Avenue are due for a major, $2.8 million
renovation including seismic improvements. The Palo Verde tank improvement
project should be done by midsummer. Lakewood will replace twelve miles
of water mains at a cost of $4.6 million. The first phase of the project,
in northern Lakewood, should be completed in August of 1996. The second
phase of water main replacement is planned for central Lakewood in 1997.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Water for Lakewood</B><BR>
<BR>
Because of effective water conservation and expansion of the city's reclaimed
water system, Lakewood has supplied the needs of its customers entirely
from city-owned wells since 1991. It hasn't had to buy costly &quot;imported&quot;
water from the Metropolitan Water District.<BR>
<BR>
Well water is a &quot;best buy&quot; for Lakewood. It costs the city about
$200 an acre foot to draw water from its wells; it would cost nearly $500
an acre foot to buy water from the Metropolitan Water District.<BR>
<BR>
Lakewood's water, however, isn't an inexhaustible resource. In fact, much
of the water ultimately drawn from Lakewood taps is brought from northern
California or the Colorado river through the state's aqueduct system. This
water is pumped into the ground to maintain the water table and make up
the shortfall in water replenishment from rain and snow runoff. The injected
water also holds back the inward flow of sea water from the Pacific. If
the water table drops too far, sea water will flow north and west and ruin
the entire aquifer. If sea water crept into Lakewood's wells, we might become
dependent forever on costly imported water.<BR>
<BR>
There's another kind of &quot;imported&quot; water that some Lakewood residents
have turned to--bottled water. Compared to tap water, bottled water is expensive.
For the $1.60-a-gallon that home delivery of bottled water costs, you can
get 1,000 gallons of tap water. And bottled water isn't necessarily better
than tap water. In fact, the head of the federal Environmental Protection
Agency recently quipped that she chooses tap water over bottled because
she knows tap water has to meet tough state and federal safety and purity
standards that bottled water doesn't.<BR>
<BR>
Lakewood's water future looks good, thanks to a conservation-minded community,
an expanded reclaimed water system, and new investment in maintaining Lakewood's
water system.<BR>

</H3>
<P><CENTER>(adapted from EPA documents)<BR>
<BR>
It's may be the biggest remaining source of water pollution nationally.
<BR>
Unlike pollution from specific locations or &quot;points&quot; like factories,
urban runoff is all the gunk <BR>
that washes off our yards, streets and highways. <BR>
<BR>
It ultimately runs to the ocean or into freshwater lakes and reserviors.
<BR>
<A HREF="hazardouswaste.html"><IMG SRC="recycling_graphics/stormfish_logo.gif" WIDTH="125" HEIGHT="123" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"></A></CENTER>
<P>All of us can make a difference in lessening urban runoff. Clearing all
our old chemicals out of the garage and taking them to a L.A. County <A HREF="hazardouswaste.html">Hazardous
Waste Roundup</A> is one way. <A HREF="oil.html">Recycling used motor oil</A>,
rather than dumping it in the back your is another. 
<H3>Helpful Tips</H3>
<UL>Keep litter, pet wastes, leaves, and debris out of street gutters and
storm drains--these outlets drain directly to lake, streams, rivers, and
wetlands.<BR>
<BR>
Apply lawn and garden chemicals sparingly and according to directions.<BR>
<BR>
Dispose of used oil, antifreeze, paints, and other household chemicals properly,
not in storm sewers or drains. If your community does not already have a
program for collecting household hazardous wastes, ask your local government
to establish one.<BR>
<BR>
Clean up spilled brake fluid, oil, grease, and antifreeze. Do not hose them
into the street where they can eventually reach local streams and lakes.<BR>
<BR>
Control soil erosion on your property by planting ground cover and stabilizing
erosion-prone areas.<BR>
<BR>
Encourage local government officials to develop construction erosion/sediment
control ordinances in your community. <BR>

<P>ENTRY PERMIT TO REMOVE GRAFFITI </P>

<P></P>

<P>RESIDENTIAL </P>

<P></P>

<P>THE UNDERSIGNED, owner of the improved real property located at:</P>

<P></P>

<P>___________________________________________________________________________,
Lakewood, California, does hereby authorize the City of Lakewood to remove
the graffiti located at said address from the _________ day of         
              _____________________________ to one year later, subject to
the following terms and conditions: </P>

<P></P>

<P>1.  The undersigned acknowledges that he has not caused, allowed or permitted
the placement of the aforementioned graffiti, and that the undersigned will
cooperate with the City of Lakewood in ascertaining the identity of the
person or persons responsible for said graffiti, prosecuting said person
or persons, and collecting from said person or persons any costs incurred
by the City of Lakewood in the removal of said graffiti. </P>

<P></P>

<P>2.  The City of Lakewood, through its authorized employees or contractual
agents, is hereby authorized to enter the aforementioned property of the
undersigned to remove graffiti from said premises.   I understand that the
process for removing graffiti is by painting over graffiti with paint matching
existing surface color to the degree possible with the City's new color
matching technology.  I understand that the painting may be done in blocks
or strips only where the lettering appears and that the affected area may
not match existing color precisely; however, the new technology owned by
the City makes most painting virtually undetectable.  Nonetheless, the City
of Lakewood assumes no responsibility if colors do not precisely match.</P>

<P></P>

<P>3.  It is also understood that this authorization is given for the removal
of the current incident of graffiti and all future incidents of graffiti
which occur within the next one (1) year so long as the undersigned is owner
of the subject property.  Only verbal verification of continued ownership
will be obtained during this one (1) year period prior to removal of any
subsequent graffiti incidents. </P>

<P></P>

<P>4.  It is understood that the undersigned shall not be charged for said
services and that in consideration of the aforementioned services, the City
of Lakewood shall not be liable to the undersigned for any damage to person
or property occasioned in the removal of said graffiti, including damage
to the person or property of the undersigned.  The undersigned acknowledges
that the City of Lakewood does not guarantee either the workmanship or the
success of the work of removal of said graffiti or the results obtained
and that the City of Lakewood, its agents and contractors are released by
the undersigned from all claims, damages and suits that the undersigned,
or his or her heirs or successors in interest may have by reason of the
failure of City to perform said work of removal in a satisfactory or workmanlike
manner or by reason of the failure of City to exercise ordinary care resulting
in damage to person or property of the undersigned.</P>

<P></P>

<P></P>

<P>Dated this ________________________ day of ______________________ , 19

<P><B>Q: How do I get my street tree trimmed?</B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="graphics/image7.gif" WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="104" ALIGN="LEFT"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><B>Georgia Quesada:</B> The city trims blocks of streets
about every four years. These trims shape the crown and thin out branches.
Individual tree trimming between block trims is meant to keep trees from
growing low over the public right-of-way. You can request inspection for
an individual trim by calling 866-9771, extension 2140.</P>

<P>The inspection will be in five to seven working days. The inspector will
leave a report advising you if the tree can be scheduled for a trim. If
your tree does not meet the criteria, the report will advise you when a
block trim in your neighborhood is planned.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q: How do I get graffiti removed from a wall?</B></P>

<P><B>Peggy Beam: </B>Lakewood has an aggressive, pro-active program of
graffiti removal. The city spends almost $100,000 a year on graffiti removal.</P>

<P>We hate graffiti! City crews paint graffiti out. With new color matching
equipment, we can match most original paint colors, even if the paint is
old or faded. Property owners only have to sign a waiver to permit a city
crew to remove the graffiti. To request graffiti removal, please call 866-9771,
extension 2140.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q: How do I get a street light fixed?</B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="graphics/dee.jpg" WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="97" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>De Augustus: </B>Before you call to report a street light, jot down
the pole number. And, note the address where the pole is located and the
cross street. Some poles are made of wood or steel and the pole numbers
are approximately seven digits long with the letter &quot;E&quot; at the
end. The pole numbers are painted on the pole or engraved on a metal tag,
placed at eye-level. Other poles are made of concrete with pole numbers
located at eye level, painted black on a white background, and shown as
a fraction like: 28/2. To report a street light out, call 866-9771, extension
2140.</P>

<P></P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q: My trash wasn't picked up. How come?</B></P>

<P><B>Georgia Quesada:</B> Lakewood's trash collection contractor is B-Z
Disposal. If B-Z did not pick up your trash, please call 866-9771, extension
2140. </P>

<P></P>

<P><B>If your trash was intentionally skipped, you may have forgotten the
city's trash rules: </B></P>

<UL>
  <LI>Put out trash containers on the night before your collection day (or
  at least by 6 a.m. on your trash day).<BR>
  </LI>
  <LI>Containers cannot weigh more than 50 pounds when full and should not
  be larger than 30 gallons. Trash bags should not weigh more than 20 pounds.<BR>
  </LI>
  <LI>No more than ten bags-or five containers and five bags-may be set out
  at one time.<BR>
  </LI>
  <LI>Only six bundles of tree trim-mings can be discarded each week. Tree
  trimmings must be cut and securely bundled so that each bundle is no longer
  than four feet and no thicker through the middle than 18 inches and no
  heavier than 20 pounds.</LI>
<BR>
  
</UL>

<P><B>Q: Can I come to city hall to pay my city water or trash bill?</B></P>

<P><IMG SRC="graphics/image8.gif" WIDTH="80" HEIGHT="98" ALIGN="LEFT" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><B>Judy Tolzman: </B>The cashier's counter in the lobby of city hall
is open from 7 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. weekdays (except closed Fridays) for water
and trash customer service, payment of Lakewood parking citations, building
permit and plan check payments, and business license applications. You can
now pay with a credit card, as well as by check. After-hours water and trash
payments can be deposited in the night box at the west entrance to city
hall.</P>

<P></P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q: How do I get a dog license?</B></P>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"><B>Peggy Beam:</B> Lakewood's animal care provider is
the Southeast Area Animal Control Authority (SEAACA). </P>

<H1>Park Facilities</H1>

<H1></H1>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P ALIGN=CENTER>Community Services Coordinator Allison Brammer provides
  <BR>
  answers to the most frequently asked questions about reserving park and
  recreation facilities.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q. Can we bring beer or wine to a party in the park?</B></P>

<P><B>A.</B> This is the question we're asked most often. Alcoholic beverages
are not allowed in any Lakewood park or meeting facility.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q. Is a live band allowed?</B></P>

<P><B>A.</B> A dj or stereo playing prerecorded music is fine, as long as
the volume can be regulated. But, city regulations do not allow live bands
to perform.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q. What about those inflatable &quot;bouncers&quot; you can rent?</B></P>

<P><B>A.</B> Sorry, bouncers or trampolines are not allowed due to insurance
restrictions.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q. We'd like to use our own caterer. Is that okay?</B></P>

<P><B>A.</B> Yes, you can. You can &quot;home cater&quot; your special event
or hire a professional caterer to provide meals for a party or a reception.
You'll have to take care of your own cleanup afterward, however.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Q. How far in advance will the city make reservations?</B></P>

<P><B>A.</B> You must secure a reservation at least seven days before your
event. You may reserve a facility six months in advance.</P>

<P></P>

<P>For more facility reservation information, call the recreation office
at 866 9771, extension 2497. For general information on park facility reservations,
call CityLine at 925-4357 and press 710.</P>

<H1>Animal Care in Lakewood</H1>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=-1>By Bob Sutton - City of Lakewood</FONT></B></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Family pets are important to the quality of life in Lakewood. They are
  a source of fun and companionship when their owners care for them properly.
  Unfortunately, some animals can be annoying when their owners neglect them;
  sometimes they may even pose a threat to public health. Occasionally pets
  need to be rescued from abusive owners.</P>
  <P>Lakewood has contracted since 1992 with the Southeast Area Animal Control
  Authority (SEAACA) to provide pet care and animal control services. SEAACA
  offers animal control services for twelve cities.</P>
  <P>The purpose of this guide is to give residents a clearer understanding
  of the scope and limits of these services.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P></P>

<P><B>What is SEAACA?</B></P>

<P><B>The Southeast Area Animal Control Authority</B> (SEAACA) is a &quot;joint
powers authority&quot; formed by cities in southeast Los Angeles County
in 1975. As SEAACA's motto affirms, the agency is Dedicated to Quality Animal
Care and Control.</P>

<P>Eight cities--Bell Gardens, Downey, Montebello, Norwalk, Paramount, Pico
Rivera, Santa Fe Springs, and South El Monte--are SEAACA's member cities.
Lakewood and three other cities--Bellflower, South Gate and Vernon--contract
with SEAACA to provide animal control services. Lakewood's contract with
SEAACA gives city officials the option to choose another animal care provider
should Lakewood need to limit costs or improve the quality of service.</P>

<P><B>SEAACA operates an animal shelter in Downey</B> for stray animals
and pets that owners can no longer keep. The shelter also offers a euthanasia
service for old or infirm pets. Pet adoptions are available at the shelter
and include the animal's first shots and spay or neuter surgery. Pet adoption
fees are currently $35 for cats, $65 for male dogs, and $75 for female dogs.</P>

<P><B>SEAACA also holds pet adoptions the first Saturday of the month in
from of the Lakewood Blvd. Petco story, and the third Saturday of each month
at Lakewood Center Mall (in front of Walden Books at the JC Penny's end
of the mall.)</B></P>

<P><B>SEAACA offers lowcost spay/neuter surgeries</B> and an outpatient
veterinarian clinic for minor treatments and vaccinations. All animals must
have a vaccination certificate before spay/neuter surgery. The spay/neuter
surgery cost for cats is $18 for males and $30 for females. Fees for dogs
begin at $29 for males and $38 for females (the actual cost depends upon
the dog's weight). There are additional fees for animals that are pregnant
or in heat. Financial assistance is available for low-income pet owners.
For an appointment, call (310) 803-3301.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>How do I get to the SEAACA shelter?</B></P>

<P>SEAACA is at 9777 SEAACA Street in Downey. The major cross streets near
this address are Imperial Highway and Firestone Blvd. The SEAACA shelter
is close to the intersection of Woodruff Avenue and Washburn Street. The
shelter itself is marked with green animal control signs.</P>

<H1>Q &amp; A</H1>

<P><B>I called SEAACA after 8 p.m., spoke to a county animal control dispatcher,
but SEAACA did not respond. Why?</B></P>

<P></P>

<P>SEAACA animal control officers are on duty twenty-four hours a day for
emergency responses. A SEAACA dispatcher advises animal control officers
in the field during business hours. After 8 p.m., calls are routed to Los
Angeles County Animal Control personnel who page SEAACA officers for emergency
response. Los Angeles County Animal Control will assess your after-hours
call and page a SEAACA officer if the call is an emergency. Nonemergency
calls are not dispatched.</P>

<P>Lakewood residents should make nonemergency requests during SEAACA's
business hours.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>When I called, the SEAACA representative gave me a &quot;control number.&quot;
Is it important?</B></P>

<P>When reporting animal control situations that require follow-up, the
SEAACA representative gives you a control number. The control number also
allows your Lakewood representative to obtain status reports from SEAACA.
If you call city hall about your animal control request, please give the
city's service representative the SEAACA control number.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>How do I get my pet a license?</B></P>

<P>Lakewood requires licenses for dogs four months and older. Pets also
need a rabies certificate good for the entire term of the license. SEAACA
manages Lakewood's dog licensing program under contract to the city. License
fees are $24 for unaltered dogs and $12 for spayed or neutered dogs. The
pet owner can provide a copy of the dog's current rabies vaccination and
a copy of its spay/ neuter certificate and pay the license fee either in
person or by mail. </P>

<P>Lakewood dog licenses are available for purchase at the SEAACA animal
shelter. The SEAACA Licensing Department may be contacted directly Tuesday
through Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
For information about pet licensing, call (310) 803-3304.</P>

<P>Licenses are renewed each July 1 and are valid for one year. There is
a 30-day grace period (July 1 to August 1) to renew a license. After August
1, a $10 late fee is added to the cost of the license.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>When can I get my dog licensed in Lakewood?</B></P>

<P>Each summer, the city, SEAACA, and Pet Vaccination Services offers two
rabies clinics and relicensing opportunities called &quot;Bow Wow and Meow
Days.&quot;</P>

<P>Call the Public Information Office at city hall at 866-9771, extension
2140 for information on the days and times of &quot;Bow Wow and Meow Days.&quot;
You also can call the CityLine 24-hour information service at 925-4357 and
press 159, or access the Lakewood Online website at www.LakewoodCity.org.
</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Do I have to get a license for my cat?</B></P>

<P>Cat licenses are not required in Lakewood, although SEAACA encourages
owners to license their cats voluntarily. A license makes it easier to find
and return a lost cat. Cat licenses are $6 for spayed and neutered cats
and $12 for unaltered cats.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>How do I report a stray dog in my neighborhood?</B></P>

<P>You may call SEAACA at (310) 803-3301 to report a stray dog. SEAACA will
impound stray dogs. SEAACA cautions residents not to put themselves in danger
by trying to capture an aggressive dog.</P>

<P>Cats must be confined before they can be picked up. A humane, box-type
cat trap is available from SEAACA. Residents must make a refundable $50
deposit and pay $1 per day to rent a cat trap. If the stray cat is caught,
the resident can call SEAACA to retrieve the animal and the trap.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Does Lakewood have a &quot;leash law?&quot;</B></P>

<P>Lakewood has a &quot;leash law&quot; which requires owners to leash their
dog when it is off the owner's property, and requires that dogs on leashes
be &quot;securely and continuously held by a competent person.&quot; Violations
of the city's ordinance may be reported by calling (310) 866-9771, extension
2140.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>How do I get a neighbor's dog to quit barking?</B></P>

<P>SEAACA will investigate complaints regarding excessive barking. Lakewood
residents can call SEAACA directly at (310) 803-3301 or the city at (310)
866-9771, extension 2140 to report a barking dog problem. At the time of
the first complaint, SEAACA will send a written notice to the problem location
and the resident who made the complaint. The notice includes a deadline
for compliance.</P>

<P>If the problem persists, the complainant should contact SEAACA or the
city again. Following a second call, another letter is sent to the dog owner
and a petition form is sent to the complainant. (If no second call is made
to SEAACA within two months, the process begins anew with the mailing of
another warning letter.)</P>

<P>If the second letter of warning is unsuccessful, the complaint petition--signed
by the complainant and two other neighborhood residents who live at different
locations--must be filed with SEAACA. With a formal complaint, SEAACA will
go to court to seek a nuisance abatement. A representative of SEAACA will
present the completed petition to the District Attorney's office at the
Los Cerritos Municipal Court for processing. A Hearing Officer at the courthouse
will schedule a hearing date for all concerned parties to resolve the nuisance.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>How will SEAACA help injured animals?</B></P>

<P>The owner of an injured animal is responsible for its veterinary care.
If the animal is delivered to SEAACA, there is a $5 fee. If SEAACA staff
must pick up the animal, the owner is charged $25.</P>

<P>An injured animal, whose owner is unknown, will be picked up the same
day they are reported to SEAACA. SEAACA treats these calls as priority calls.
Residents are not required to contain injured dogs. Injured birds should
be confined. SEAACA recommends against going near an injured dog or cat
you do not know because of the risk of being bitten.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>How does SEAACA respond to a report of a dead animal?</B></P>

<P>SEAACA picks up dead animals. The exact location of the dead animal (address
and cross streets) is helpful. Small animals should be placed in, or covered
by, a container and placed on the parkway for pickup. </P>

<P>If the dead animal belongs to you, SEAACA charges $25 for collection.
If the dead animal is a stray, there is no charge for collection. Residents
can use the night cages at the SEAACA shelter to drop off a dead animal,
for which there is no charge.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Will SEAACA trap the opossum in my yard?</B></P>

<P>Opossums are gentle, non-aggressive, highly beneficial animals. They
are not a health hazard and pose little threat humans or pets unless cornered
and left with no choice but to defend themselves. They are resistant to
diseases (including rabies) and do not destroy property. Their diet includes
insects--including cockroaches and beetles--plus slugs, snails, mice, moles
and shrews. They help maintain a clean environment by eating carrion and
overripe fruit. SEAACA advocates peaceful coexistence between people and
'possums. SEAACA does not encourage trapping, removal, or relocation of
opossums.</P>

<P>SEAACA will pick up an injured or dead opossum. However, they urge residents
not to rush to the phone, since opossums often appear dead when they are
frightened or confronted (commonly called &quot;playing possum&quot;). SEAACA
suggests waiting before reporting a &quot;dead&quot; opossum to be picked
up.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>I think my neighbor's dog is being treated badly. Can SEAACA do anything?</B></P>

<P>SEAACA investigates reports of animal cruelty. Call SEAACA at (310) 803-3301
to make a report. An officer will respond, perform an investigation, and
file a report.</P>

<P>Animals in distress--such as a dog left in a hot car or a cat caught
in a car engine--are considered emergencies and should be reported to SEAACA
immediately. Cats up trees are handled on a case-by-case basis. Assigning
personnel and equipment to rescue cats during peak workload periods is not
always possible. Do not call the fire department; call SEAACA for advice.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>I caught a stray dog. Will SEAACA come and pick it up?</B></P>

<P>SEAACA will pick up stray dogs captured by residents. Residents also
may transport strays to the SEAACA shelter themselves. Signs are clearly
posted for drop-offs. SEAACA provides cages along with instructions for
filling out the forms attached to the cage.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>How does SEAACA respond to a dog bite case?</B></P>

<P>SEAACA will pick up strays who have bitten someone.</P>

<P>If a dog bites someone and then returns to its own yard, or if the owner
of the dog is known and the dog is running loose, call SEAACA. SEAACA will
investigate and may order the dog to be quarantined. If ordered, the quarantine
will last ten days, during which the animal must be kept on the owner's
property.</P>

<P>If a dog bites a member of its owner's family, it is the family's responsibility
to deal with both the dog and the victim.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>How does SEAACA respond to a report of a vicious dog?</B> </P>

<P>SEAACA suggests that you call for an animal control officer whenever
you, your children, or your pets are threatened with biting by an aggressive
dog.</P>

<P>If SEAACA's records show that an animal has bitten any person or animal
on two or more separate occasions, it is prima facie evidence that the animal
is wild or vicious. </P>

<P>Owners of wild or vicious animals are required, under Section 4190 of
the Lakewood Municipal Code, to have a permit. These are granted by the
Lakewood Planning and Environment Commission. The Community Development
Department can provide applications for wild or vicious animal permits.
There is a non-refundable, $85 application processing fee. Applicants are
required to be fingerprinted.</P>

<P>SEAACA will conduct preliminary investigations once the Lakewood Community
Development Department has received the application. Depending upon the
severity of the situation, SEAACA may impound the vicious animal until the
time of the public hearing.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>What if my neighbor has too many animals?</B> </P>

<P>No more than two dogs and two cats may be kept as pets. Even if you have
no dog, for example, you still may keep only two cats. </P>

<P>Too many animals is a Lakewood code violation and should be reported
by calling (310) 866-9771, extension 2140.</P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Will SEAACA accept pets at the shelter and try to get them adopted?</B></P>

<P>Pet owners who can no longer keep their pets may relinquish them to SEAACA.
However, there is no guarantee that the pet will be adopted; generally the
shelter keeps pets for as long as possible, depending on the health of the
animal and the availability of space at the shelter.</P>

<P>There is a $25 fee to collect a pet from your home. If you take the pet
yourself to the SEAACA shelter there is a $5 processing fee.</P>

<P>If you would like to adopt a pet from the shelter, the fee is $35 for
cats, $65 for male dogs, and $75 for female dogs. The adoption fee includes
spaying or neutering and vaccinations.</P>

<P></P>

<H2>Finding a Lost Pet</H2>

<P>Losing a pet is like losing a member of the family. That's why Lakewood
and the Southeast Area Animal Control Authority (SEAACA) want to offer some
helpful tips to assist you in finding your lost pet as quickly as possible.</P>

<P>Pet Identification: Insurance for Pet Recovery</P>

<P>Probably the most important thing you can do to find your lost pet is
to make sure your pet dog or cat always wears ID and license tags on its
collar.</P>

<P>The chances of your pet being quickly returned are dramatically increased
if your pet wears a tag with the owner's name, address, and home and work
phone numbers, and its license. (Don't forget to buy a new ID tag for your
pet when you change residence or phone number.) It's a good idea to include
your pet's license number, too.</P>

<P>Pet ID tags may be ordered from most pet shops, veterinarians, or SEAACA.</P>

<P>A pet wearing ID and license tags will enable a kindhearted neighbor
or animal control officer to contact you immediately once your pet is found.
Giving your special pet an ID tag is the best insurance that your pet will
be returned home safely. </P>

<P></P>

<P><B>What do I do if my pet is lost?</B></P>

<P>Keep trying. Don't give up. It takes a lot of work and patience to find
a lost pet.</P>

<P>If your animal is wearing ID tags, you can call the SEAACA shelter to
find out if your animal is there. SEAACA cannot check over the phone for
animals without identification.</P>

<P>SEAACA recommends that you come to the shelter to look. On a busy day,
more than 100 animals can be brought to the shelter. Shelter workers cannot
classify or describe animals with absolute certainty over the phone. You
are the only one who can definitely determine whether an animal at the shelter
is your missing pet. If you have lost a pet, visiting the SEAACA shelter
frequently will enable you to view the new arrivals.</P>

<P>Remember, for more thorough coverage, you should visit neighboring animal
shelters to view their found animals, as well. While you are at the shelter,
you can check the lost and found bulletin board and post a notice for your
lost pet if your animal is not there. </P>

<P></P>

<P><B>Is that all I can do?</B></P>

<P>No. You should begin checking neighboring animal shelters weekly. Lost
pets don't observe city or county boundaries. That's why pet owners need
to contact other shelters.</P>

<P>For example, if a dog belonging to a Lakewood resident happened to stray
into Long Beach, it would be taken to the Long Beach animal shelter, not
the SEAACA facility in Downey. Or, it could may be picked up by Los Angeles
County Animal Care and taken to one of their shelters in Downey or Gardena.</P>

<P>SEAACA serves Lakewood and Bell Gardens, Bellflower, Downey, Montebello,
Norwalk, Paramount, Pico Rivera, Santa Fe Springs, and South El Monte, South
Gate, and Vernon. </P>

<P><B>What will the animal shelter do?</B></P>

<P>If a lost or stray animal is brought in and has a license or an ID tag,
SEAACA will contact the owner by phone and/or by mail. If the pet is unlicensed,
SEAACA will keep dogs and cats up to seven days. (Other animal shelters
have their own policies.)</P>

<P>They are issues on the minds of Lakewood homeowners and city officials.
You'd think the web would be a terrific resource of information . . . <BR>
<BR>
The answer is yes, and no. Here's a sampling of a search.</P>

behind. Searching under &quot;fema&quot; <I>(lower-case is usually a better
bet)</I> brought up a mass of 10,000 hits, and nothing close to Southern
California. It was just too wide a search.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">Topping the list were a bunch of fact sheets on
emergency water, food, and sanitation. Great if I'm working on earthquake
preparations, but we're looking for flood issue information. A lot of information
was tied to Vancouver, Washington of all places.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT COLOR="#000000">But, I wanted information for Lakewood, or at least
Southern California. So, I went to the help file at the top right of AltaVista's
page. It printed out five pages of help, and </FONT><B><A HREF="insides11_1_96_alta.html">some

<TD COLSPAN="2" VALIGN="TOP"><P>Usually, I have good luck with Alta's codes, or putting a search of several
words in quotes on most other search engines. Still, searching on variations
of &quot;fema&quot; brought up too many documents, or very obscure, technical

<BR>
One thing I noticed was while FEMA's homepage didn't specifically come up,
a lot of documents did have <B><A HREF="http://www.fema.gov/">www.fema.gov</A></B>
in their address. This pointed me to the FEMA site. </P>

<P>Another important note; by spelling out the full official name of FEMA,
searching as, <A HREF="altavista_fema.html">&quot;federal emergency management
agency,&quot;</A> I got lots of items clearly tied directly to that website.

costs, or reallocating revenue from other divisions could temper the impact
on the company.</P>

<P><BR>
Lakewood has the same choices. Raising our &quot;prices&quot; may soon require
voter approval under the terms of Proposition 62. More cost cutting would
be an evolutionary process, not a wholesale transformation of city priorities.
It's the third alternative-reallocating revenues to maintain important services
and programs-that is probably the hardest for residents to understand.</P>

<P><BR>
Reallocating revenues from one part of the budget to another is not always
possible. Revenue sources restricted by law or designated by policy can't
easily be shifted to pay for basic city services when economic recession
or state budget takeaways cause other local revenues to drop.</TD></TR>

Take away the city's utility user tax and Lakewood would have to cut, not

city services.</P>

<B>$1,047,120 is the cost of insurance. </B>Take away insurance costs that

<B>Basic pubic safety programs-including Sheriff's patrols, traffic enforcement,
Sky Knight, and school crossing guards-costs $4,615,549 a year.</B> (Another
$800,000 comes from federal grants and reimbursements for the operation
of the Sky Knight helicopters.) It's not likely that anyone would favor
cutting basic public safety expenditures to make up revenue losses. That
makes the city's utility user tax 17 percent of unrestricted, undesignated
revenues.</P>

<P><BR>
Peel away the rest of the funding that is restricted or designated and Lakewood's
true discretionary revenue is just $9,686,256. This makes the utility tax
19 percent of the discretionary revenue in the city's general fund, even

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B>Updated 'General Plan' will keep Lakewood focused on

<P></P>

<P></P>

<P>Just as the engine of a classic car requires occasional maintenance to
keep it operating at peak performance, so also does a city's development
plan. Fortunately, Lakewood's General Plan, which is currently undergoing
one of its periodic revisions, requires only a minor &quot;tune up,&quot;
not a major overhaul.<BR>
<BR>
The General Plan is a state-mandated document that forecasts the physical,
social, and economic development of California's cities. The General Plan
isn't a rigid blueprint; it's more a guide to development themes. In Lakewood,
the themes are single-family homes, residential neighborhoods, plenty of
parks and recreation programs, and a healthy retail economy.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Lakewood's General Plan has served our community for nearly thirty
years,&quot; notes Charles Ebner, Lakewood's community development director.
&quot;Even the best of plans, however, needs updating to bring it into conformance
with state policies, new technology, and the way the community has actually
developed over the years.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The city's first General Plan was adopted in 1970. It included chapters
(called elements) on land use, traffic circulation, housing, recreation,
public facilities, and community design. Over time, the state legislature
has added new elements: open space and conservation (1973), noise (1974),
seismic safety, scenic highways, and public safety (1975). Some of these
elements set general goals designed to keep community and neighborhood values
intact.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, many goals set in the 1970 General Plan were exceeded years ago.
The plan originally set a goal of about seven acres of open space and parkland
per 1,000 residents. Today, that ratio is thirteen acres per 1,000 residents,
one of the highest in Los Angeles County.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;One revision to the General Plan would redesignate some open space
for other kinds of development,&quot; Ebner points out. &quot;But, that
would have almost no impact on the ratio of parks and residents.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B>Proposed changes serve several purposes:</B> </P>

<UL>
  <LI>Remove some land uses, originally designated in 1970, that are unlikely
  to occur. </LI>
  <LI>Align the plan with existing zoning, which has changed in thirty years.
  </LI>
  <LI>Identify commercial centers where higher densities of retail development
  could be allowed. </LI>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P><I>Copies of the current General Plan are available for review at the
    Iacoboni and Nye libraries and at city hall. Up-to-the-minute information
    is available from CityLine (call 925-4357 and press 433) and through Lakewood
    Online www.LakewoodCity.org</I></P>

After an earthquake you will probably not have any power.   Your perishable
food won't last more than a few hours. You will need to store at least three
days of non-perishable food for everyone in your family. Pick items which
can be eaten at room temperature without preparation or cooking. If you
are able to heat your food, be sure to cook it outside on a fire-proof surface,
away from any hazards. <BR>
<BR>
When preparing your food supply, do not include salty food which can make
you thirsty. Do include items from all of the food groups. Store these items
away from your everyday food. Be sure to rotate your supply and check expiration
dates. Canned goods usually have a one-year shelf life. Don't forget to
include utensils, plates, bowls and cups. Before using fire to cook, make
sure there are no gas leaks anywhere near you, or in your neighborhood.

<P><B>Its focus is on how to type search words into its search form to narrow
your search and get more relevant returns from the search engine.</B></P>

<P></P>

<P><B>paris &quot;petite galerie&quot; louvre</B></P>

<P>Finds documents containing as many of these words and phrases as possible,
ranked so that documents with the most matches are presented first.</P>

<P><B>A phrase is any string of adjacent words. </B></P>

<P><B>The preferred way to link words into a phrase is to use quotes.</B></P>

<P>Lower-case search will find matches of capitalized words also. For example,
paris will find matches for paris, Paris, and PARIS. Capital letters in
a search will force an exact case match on the entire word. For example,
submitting a query for parIS will search only for matches of parIS. (Don't
be surprised if there are none.)</P>

<P><B>+noir +film -&quot;pinot noir&quot;</B></P>

<P>Matches may be required, or prohibited. Precede a required word or phrase
with + and a prohibited one with -. This query finds documents containing
film and noir, but not containing pinot noir.</P>

<P><B>antique;pump;organ</B></P>

<P>Punctuation glues words into a phrase, just as quotes do. Punctuation
is treated as white space, so this example is equivalent to &quot;antique
pump organ&quot; (that is, three words enclosed in quotes).</P>

<P><B>quilt*</B></P>

<P>This query matches pages that contain at least one word such as quilt,
quilts, quilting, quilted, quilter etc. </P>

<P><B>Hint:</B> The *-notation is also useful for searching for variant
spellings. For example, alumi*m will find matches for both aluminum and
the British English aluminium. More about its use<BR>

FOR RELEASE:   THURSDAY, DECEMBER 5, 1996

<P>

LEAD-BASED PAINT RIGHT-TO-KNOW PROGRAM EXTENDED 
TO SINGLE-FAMILY-HOME TRANSACTIONS

<P>

Friday, Dec. 6, marks the first time that all home buyers and tenants 
will have the right to know about potential lead-based paint hazards 
before they buy or rent older housing under a new U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency/U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
program.  Prospective tenants or buyers of pre-1978  residential 
dwellings -- including single-family-home owners -- now can ask for 
and receive information on known lead-based paint and lead-based paint 
hazards before purchasing or renting.  

<P>

"Today, we guarantee for the first time that all home buyers have the 
right to know about hazardous lead paint in their homes," said EPA 
Administrator Carol M. Browner.  "Today's action will greatly 
contribute to our efforts to prevent and eliminate the incidence of 
childhood lead poisoning nationwide."  

<P>

More than 1.7 million American children under the age of six have 
unsafe blood-lead levels, making lead poisoning a top environmental 
health hazard for young children.  Most of those children are poisoned 
by deteriorated lead-based paint and the contaminated soil and dust it 
generates.  Children with too much lead in their bodies can experience 
lowered IQ, reading and learning disabilities, impaired hearing and 
other problems.   More than 80 percent of the U.S. housing stock built 
before 1978 -- some 64 million residences -- contains lead paint. 

<P>

In addition to receiving specific information on known lead 
hazards in the building, home buyers and renters will receive a short 
pamphlet containing basic lead-poisoning prevention tips.   The 
pamphlet "Protect Your Family from Lead in Your Home," provides 
general information on lead inspection and risk assessment activities, 
and outlines practical, low-cost suggestions that families can use to 
identify and control lead-based paint hazards in a home.  In the case 
of sales transactions, home buyers can also request up to 10-days to 
conduct a lead-based paint risk assessment or inspection at their own 
expense prior to finalizing a sales contract.  The new requirements 
apply to sales and rentals of residences built before 1978, the year 
the sale of residential lead-based paint was banned. 

<P>

Specific notification and right-to-know language must be included 
in the contract or lease, along with signed statements from all 
parties verifying the requirements have been met.  The first phase of 
the joint EPA/HUD program took effect on Sept. 6 when owners with more 
than four residential dwellings and their agents were required to 
disclose known hazards.  This program is being administered jointly by 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development to ensure that families receive basic 
lead hazard exposure prevention information prior to purchasing or 
renting older housing.  The program was launched earlier this year in 
March when EPA and HUD released a final rule specifying the 
requirements for lead notification and disclosure.

<P>

For a copy of the pamphlet, sample disclosure forms, or the rule, 
call the National Lead Information Clearinghouse at 1-800-LEAD-FYI.  
The EPA pamphlet and rule also are available electronically through 
the Internet at <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/lead">http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/lead</A>.

FOR RELEASE:   FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1996

<P>

AGENDA FOR FINAL MEETING OF FOOD SAFETY COMMITTEE ANNOUNCED BY EPA

<P>

EPA has announced the agenda for the final meeting of the Food Safety 
Advisory Committee which will be held on Dec. 5, at the Sheraton 
Premiere Hotel near Tysons Corner, Va.  The meeting is open to the 
public.  The Food Safety Advisory Committee was formed in September as 
a subcommittee under the auspices of EPA's National Advisory Council 
for Environmental Policy and Technology.  Its purpose is to assist EPA 
with the implementation of the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) 
signed into law on Aug. 3.  The new law amends both the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and the Federal Food, Drug 
and Cosmetic Act to provide a protective regulatory scheme for 
pesticides.  The primary agenda will be a discussion of a draft 
outline of EPA's plan for implementing FQPA.  Included will be the 
approach to science assessment, the interim decision logic for 
screening risks, the tolerance reassessment program and minor uses of 
pesticides.  The Food Safety Advisory Committee is made up of 
approximately 45 representatives from the general public, 
environmental and public interest groups, the public health community, 
the chemical industry, agriculture and other pesticide user groups, 
food processors, federal and state governments, academia and others.  
Margie Fehrenbach of EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs is the 
Committee's designated federal officer and can be reached at 703-305-
7090 or by Internet: fehrenbach.margie@epa.gov.  The meeting is 
scheduled from 8:30-4:00.  The address of the Sheraton Premiere Hotel 
is 8661 Leesburg Pike, Vienna, Va., (703-448-1234).  Take I-95 
(Capital Beltway), exit at #10B from South (exit 10 from North) which 
is Route 7, go two miles (past Tysons Corner), make a left on Westwood 
Center Drive, go right to the service road and follow to the hotel 
lobby.

FOR RELEASE: WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 27, 1996

<P>

EPA PROPOSES AIR STANDARDS FOR PARTICULATE MATTER AND OZONE

<P>

Based on evidence of harm to human health and the environment, 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today proposed new national 
air quality standards for particulate matter (soot) and ground-level 
ozone (smog). 
     
<P>

Because of the significance of the proposal, EPA will seek broad 
public comment on its recommended approach and on the need for any 
changes to the particulate matter and ozone proposal.  The purpose of 
the comment period is to reach out to all stakeholders in order to 
obtain the best information available for determining the appropriate 
final standards.

<P>

"In the Clean Air Act, Congress required EPA to review and 
incorporate the best available science into public health standards to 
protect Americans from air pollution," said EPA Administrator Carol M. 
Browner. "The EPA proposal would provide new protection to nearly 133 
million Americans, including 40 million children. We will use the very 
best science to do what is necessary to protect public health in 
common-sense, cost-effective ways."

<P>

Particulate matter (PM), or soot, comes largely from combustion 
from sources like power plants or large incinerators.   Ozone is 
primarily the haze of chemicals from car exhausts and smoke-stack 
emissions that shrouds many cities on hot summer days. 

<P>

EPA and a board of independent scientists have reviewed 86 PM-
related human-health studies, covering millions of people, that showed 
harmful effects from breathing particles at the current standard. The 
proposed standard, along with clean air programs already planned, 
would reduce premature deaths by 40,000 per year, and reduce serious 
respiratory problems in children by 250,000 cases per year.

<P>

Another 185 of the latest ozone-related studies on human health 
also were reviewed. All of them showed harmful effects from ozone at 
the current standard, including more than 1.5 million incidences a 
year of significant respiratory problems, such as loss of lung 
capacity and exacerbation of both childhood and adult asthma.  In 
addition to threatening health, ozone and PM can damage agricultural 
crops, and diminish visibility in national parks, in some cases by as 
much as 77 percent.

<P>

Browner said, "EPA has based its proposal on a thorough review of 
the best available science.  We are now hoping to hear from a wide 
range of the American people, from scientists and environmentalists to 
industry experts, small business owners, doctors and parents, to 
receive the broadest possible public comment and input on this important issue."

<P>

The PM standard currently calls for regulation of particles the 
size of 10 microns or smaller (PM- 10) in concentrations of 50 
micrograms per cubic meter annually and 150 micrograms per cubic meter 
daily.  The proposed PM standard calls for 2.5 microns or smaller (PM 
2.5) in concentrations of 15 micrograms per cubic meter annually and 
50 micrograms per cubic meter daily.  EPA today also proposed 
maintaining the current standards for PM-10 so that larger, coarse 
particles would continue to be regulated. The current ozone standard 
is .12 parts per million measured over one hour.  EPA's proposed 
standard calls for .08 parts per million measured over eight hours.  
EPA also is seeking comment on several other options, including an 
ozone concentration of .09 parts per million measured over eight 
hours, as well as a range of ozone concentrations from .07 parts per 
million measured over eight hours to .12 parts per million measured 
over one hour, the current standard.  On both proposed standards, EPA 
has also specified the way in which attainment of these standards 
would be measured.  

<P>

EPA believes that the standards being proposed are consistent 
with the work of the independent scientists on the Clean Air Science 
Advisory Committee, which is part of EPA's long-standing Science 
Advisory Board.  EPA will be taking comment on the scientific evidence 
during the comment period.

<P>

Browner today also expanded the membership and the mandate of an 
implementation advisory committee, to ensure that any plans to carry 
out the standards will include the advice and participation of state 
and local governments, industry, small business and environmental 
groups in order to identify common-sense, cost-effective options for 
implementation of the standards.

<P>

Plans to meet any finalized standards would be due in 2002 for 
PM, and in 2000 for ozone control strategies.  Deadlines for achieving 
full compliance would occur several years thereafter for both types of 
pollution.

<P>

Congress specifically named six air pollutants under the Clean 
Air Act to be regulated by EPA's national air quality standards.  They 
are ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, 
sulfur dioxide, and lead.  Congress directed that such standards 
should be reviewed at least every five years by EPA to keep up with 
current science, and that proposals to revise them should be based 
solely upon the best current scientific opinion on public health 
effects, not economic impacts.  Since initially setting standards in 
the early 1970s, EPA has changed the standards only twice:  Once, in 
1979, and once in 1987.  During the Bush Administration, a decision 
was made not to review the current science regarding the health 
effects of ozone.

<P>

There is a 60-day comment period on the proposal. Once a final 
regulation is issued in June 1997, it will be among the first major 
environmental rules reviewed by Congress under the new Small Business Regulatory Enforcement and Fairness Act.

<P>

Today's action will appear soon in the Federal Register, but will 
be computer-accessible earlier through EPA's electronic bulletin board 
system, the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) at <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/airlinks">http://www.epa.gov/airlinks</A>. The TTN can be reached at 919-541-5742 (backup number for access problems is 919-541-5384). The notice will 
appear on the TTN's Clean Air Act Amendments Bulletin Board under 
"Recently Signed Rules." For further technical information, contact 
Jeff Clark of EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards at 
919-541-5557.

<P>

<H3>Scientific Review Process for Proposed Air Quality Standards</H3>

<P>
   
EPA's proposals to revise the standards for ozone and fine particle pollution are based on a scientific review required by Congress under the Clean Air Act, which mandates that the EPA Administrator determine every five years 
whether the nation's air quality standards are adequate to protect public health.  Following is the scientific review process that led to EPA's proposals:

<P>

<H4>Broad Range of Peer-Reviewed Scientific Evidence Examined:</H4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>To review the health standards for ozone and fine particle pollution, EPA began by conducting a wide-ranging literature search, covering all aspects of ozone and particulate pollution.   The Agency then selected for review those studies relevant to human health effects.
</LI>
<LI>Over three years, EPA and two independent scientific review panels identified 185 studies on the human health effects of ozone pollution and 86 studies on the links between particulate matter pollution and human health.  Studies examined included controlled human studies, epidemiological studies, and toxicological studies.
</LI>
<LI>A broad range of studies reviewed indicated that the current standards for both ozone pollution and particulate pollution do not adequately protect public health, as required by law.  The studies show that serious health effects would occur even if the current standards were being met, indicating the need for stronger health protection.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H4>EPA Relied on Independent, Peer Reviewed Scientific Research:</H4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Under the Clean Air Act, Congress requires EPA to rely on the advice of an independent scientific review panel, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, made up of nationally recognized experts in a wide range of disciplines -- physicians, toxicologists, epidemiologists, and atmospheric scientists -- from academic research, industry and the states.  Two panels were assembled, one for each type of pollution.
</LI>
<LI>A review document summarizing published, peer reviewed research on both types of pollution and their health effects was prepared for the advisory panel.  A separate panel of national scientific experts then peer-reviewed individual chapters in the summary document before the advisory panel began its review.
</LI>
<LI>The scientific advisory panels supported EPA's basic findings, supporting the conclusion that a proposal to revise the ozone standard should be made to reflect the health consequences of more prolonged exposures, and endorsing the range of ozone concentrations EPA considered.  The vast majority of panel members agreed on establishing a new standard for fine particle pollution.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H4>EPA Opens Extensive Public Comment Period on New Proposals</H4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>EPA has launched a 60-day public comment period on the proposed new standards as well as the scientific evidence supporting them.  In addition, the review process has been a public one, with scientific advisory panel meetings open to the public, and all review documents publicly available prior to panel meetings.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>

<H3>Public Health Effects of Ozone and Fine Particle Pollution</H3>

<P>

Every American adult breathes in 13,000 liters of air each day, on average, and children breathe in 50 percent more air per pound of body weight than adults do -- making public health protection from harmful air pollutants a top priority.  As required by Congress in the Clean Air Act, EPA has reviewed and proposed new standards to reduce two of the most widespread forms of harmful air pollution -- particulate matter and ground-level ozone (smog).  Taken together, they contribute to acute health effects ranging from premature deaths to preventable respiratory problems.

<P>
  
Following are facts about these types of pollution, related health effects, and results expected from the new proposed standards, if they are finalized in their current form:
       
<P>

<H4>Particulate Matter:</H4>  Particulate matter is a mix of coarse and fine particles that can't be seen individually by the naked eye, but often appear as haze, dust clouds or sooty emissions.  Sources of coarse particles include industrial crushing and grinding operations, materials handling, vehicle travel on unpaved roads and windblown dust.  Fine particles result from industrial, motor vehicle and power generating fuel combustion, as well as burning wood and brush.  Pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds also can form fine particles.

<P>

Effect on Public Health:    Fine particles can penetrate deep into the lungs.  On a smoggy day, a single breath can take in millions of fine particles.   Some 74 million Americans -- 28% of the population -- are regularly exposed to harmful levels of particulate air pollution.  In recent studies, exposure to fine particle air pollution -- either alone or with other air pollutants -- has been linked with many health problems:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>An estimated 40,000 Americans die prematurely each year, according to peer-reviewed studies, from respiratory illness and heart attacks linked with particle exposure, particularly elderly people;
</LI>
<LI>Children and adults experience aggravated asthma.  Asthma in children increased 118% between 1980 and 1993, and it is currently the leading cause of child hospital admissions;
</LI>
<LI>Children become ill more frequently and experience increased respiratory problems, including difficult and painful breathing; and
</LI>
<LI>Hospital admissions, emergency room visits and premature deaths increase among adults with heart disease, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and other heart and lung diseases.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

Increased Public Health Protections from EPA Proposal:   The current standard covers reductions of coarse particles of 10 microns in diameter.  If finalized in its current form, EPA's proposal would increase public health protection by helping to reduce fine particles of 2.5 microns in diameter,  as well as coarse particle pollution. This approach was recommended by an overwhelming majority of independent scientists who reviewed the standard for EPA, based on 86 new health studies that indicate the need for a stronger standard.  If finalized as proposed, the new standard would:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Cut premature deaths linked with particulate air pollution by 50%, or approximately 20,000 deaths; with acid rain controls currently underway, an additional 20,000 deaths will be avoided;
</LI>
<LI>Reduce aggravated asthma episodes by more than a quarter million cases each year;
</LI>
<LI>Reduce incidence of acute childhood respiratory problems by more than a quarter million occurrences each year, including aggravated coughing and painful breathing;
</LI>
<LI>Reduce chronic bronchitis by an estimated 60,000 cases each year;
</LI>
<LI>Reduce hospital admissions due to respiratory problems by 9,000 each year, as well as reduce emergency room visits and overall childhood illnesses in general; and
</LI>
<LI>Cut haze and visibility problems by as much as 77% in some areas, such as national parks.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H4>Ground-level Ozone:</H4>   Ground-level ozone -- the prime ingredient in smog in our cities -- is easily formed in the atmosphere, usually during hot weather. Smog results from a reaction between such gases as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds that are emitted from motor vehicles and a wide range of industrial air pollutants. Ozone also makes plants more susceptible to diseases and pests, and reduces agricultural crop yields for many economically vital crops such as wheat, cotton, soybeans and kidney beans.  

<P>

Effect on Public Health:   Studies show that repeated exposure to ozone pollution for several months may cause permanent structural damage to the lungs, a serious issue for the 122 million Americans -- 46% of the population -- who are regularly exposed to harmful levels of ozone pollution.  Because ozone pollution usually forms in hot weather, anyone who spends time outdoors in the summer is at risk, particularly children, moderate exercisers, and outdoor workers.  Even when inhaled at very low levels, ground-level ozone prompts a variety of health problems:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Children and adults experience aggravated asthma;
</LI>
<LI>Healthy adults' lung capacity is temporarily reduced by 15 to 20 percent;
</LI>
<LI>Hospital admissions and emergency room visits increase.  In the northeastern U.S., 10 to 20 percent of all summertime hospital visits for respiratory problems are linked with ozone pollution;
</LI>
<LI>Lung tissues are inflamed, and acute respiratory problems develop; and
</LI>
<LI>Immune defenses are reduced, leaving people more susceptible to respiratory illness, including pneumonia and bronchitis.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

Increased Public Health Protections from EPA Proposal: Because it has not been revised since 1979, and because current science indicates that many Americans still appear to be at risk from ozone pollution, EPA is proposing to revise the standard to provide increased health protection.  If finalized in its current form, the new proposal would reduce ground-level ozone concentrations from .12 parts per million measured over one hour to .08 parts per million measured over eight hours, and change to a more accurate measurement that will better reflect the actual health effects of ozone. This approach was reviewed by a panel of independent scientists and based on 185 new health studies.  If finalized in its current form, the new proposal is expected to:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>Result in over 1.5 million fewer cases of significant breathing problems (those where lung function is reduced up to 20%);
</LI>
<LI>Significantly reduce the need for hospital admissions, missed school and work days, restricted activity, and emergency room visits for respiratory problems;
</LI>
<LI>Cut illness in children overall, and reduce conditions ranging from inflamed lungs to irreversible lung damage in children;
</LI>
<LI>Reduce episodes when asthmatic children require medication or medical treatment; and
</LI>
<LI>Reduce by nearly $1 billion agricultural crop losses caused by ozone.
</LI>

FOR RELEASE:  TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 19, 1996

<P>

EPA ADMINISTRATOR, INTEL CORP. SIGN FINAL PROJECT XL AGREEMENT 

<P>

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol M. Browner 
today signed a five-year final Project XL agreement with Intel 
Corporation officials and community leaders.  The new agreement is 
one of the most significant examples of progress in the Clinton 
Administration's efforts to reinvent the environmental regulatory 
system.

<P>

Speaking at Intel's new computer chip manufacturing plant in Chandler, 
Ariz., Browner said, "Today's agreement is one of the most significant 
results of Clinton Administration efforts to build a new generation of 
environmental protection to meet the challenges of  the 21st century.  
This agreement with Intel is proof that we can make our environmental 
regulatory system as affordable as it is protective."

<P>

Project XL (for Excellence and Leadership) is a national pilot program 
that gives a limited number of regulated entities the flexibility to 
adopt alternative strategies to the current system of regulations on 
the condition that they produce greater environmental results.  Under 
Intel's agreement, the company will adopt a five year Environmental 
Management Plan which outlines specific steps to meet tough standards 
of superior environmental performance. The agreement provides strong 
public health and environmental protections, while cutting red tape, 
increasing public information, and allowing Intel to compete in a 
fast-paced industry. 

<P>

In exchange for meeting more stringent air pollution standards, 
Intel will receive an air pollution permit that eliminates the usual 
modification process each time Intel changes its manufacturing 
operations.  Under the agreement, Intel will also be allowed to file a 
single, consolidated report for all pollution to Arizona's Department 
of Environmental Quality, instead of separate reports for air, water, 
and land pollution to several regulatory agencies.

<P>

"The results promise to be good for the health of this community, 
good for the environment, and good for business," Browner said. "As 
President Clinton has said, our philosophy of reinvention is simple: 
Protect people, not bureaucracy.  Promote results, not rules.  Get 
action, not rhetoric."

<P>

Dr. Craig Barrett, Intel's Executive Vice-President and Chief 
Operating Officer, said, "This historic agreement will allow Intel 
environmental engineers to concentrate on achieving even higher levels 
of environmental performance.  As a result, the regulatory community, 
the public and Intel will all benefit."

<P>

Also as part of the Environmental Management Plan, Intel commits 
to go beyond the regulatory requirements at this plant by limiting air 
pollution through the use of cleaner manufacturing operations, 
reducing water use through recycling, and protecting groundwater by 
reducing stormwater runoff.  Specifically, Intel's planned goals for 
the five-year project include:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>recycling up to 65 percent of the fresh water used at the 
facility;
</LI>
<LI>recycling up to 60 percent of the solid waste generated;
</LI>
<LI>recycling up to 70 percent of the non-hazardous chemical waste;
</LI>
<LI>reducing hazardous waste generated at the site according to appropriate milestones; and,
</LI>
<LI>establishing limits below existing requirements for air pollutants---carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, PM-10 (particulate matter such as dust and soot) and toxic air pollutants.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

Intel has agreed to cap the overall level of pollution -- no more 
than 50 tons annually for each criteria pollutant and 10 tons annually 
for organic and inorganic hazardous air pollutants. Intel also is 
required to model routine toxic air emissions and remain below 
Arizona's strict guideline for public and worker exposure.  Since 
Intel is bringing new processes on line every two years, pollution 
prevention will be built into process designs.  A 40 percent reduction 
in the emission of volatile organic compounds is expected from new 
processes employed by Intel.

<P>

The XL project also calls for specific risk-based limits and 
emission limits within the permit and for community benefits, such as 
Intel's agreement to provide a beneficial 1,000 foot environmental 
buffer zone between the manufacturing facility and nearby homes and 
schools. 

<P>

In a letter to President Clinton, members of Intel's Arizona 
Community Advisory Panel said, "We believe that Intel's XL project 
will enhance environmental protection for our community and encourage 
Intel to achieve even higher levels of performance (at the Chandler 
plant)."

<P>

"Project XL provides a fresh look at overall environmental 
performance," said Jo Crumbaker of Maricopa County's Department of 
Environmental Services.  "It includes commitment and reduces paperwork 
and other procedural burdens that do not provide value-added 
contributions to its aggressive environmental goals."

<P>

During the project development, community members were 
extensively involved.  Information on the Intel project was made 
available to the public from EPA, state and local agencies and several 
public meetings were held during the development of the project.  
Throughout the five-year implementation period, updates and quarterly 
public meetings will be held.

EPA INVITES COMMENT ON REQUEST BY ROSE GROWERS 
FOR EXCEPTION TO WORKER PROTECTION STANDARD 

<P>

EPA is inviting comments on a request from rose growers to allow 
workers to harvest roses by hand earlier than would otherwise be 
permitted under the Worker Protection Standard (WPS).  Among other 
things, the WPS prohibits agricultural workers from entering 
pesticide-treated areas for specified periods of time ranging from 
four to 72 or more hours (depending upon the toxicity of the 
pesticide) following pesticide applications.  The WPS is intended to 
reduce the risk of pesticide poisonings and injuries among 
agricultural employees who may be exposed to pesticides while 
performing hand-labor operations in or on farms, forests, nurseries 
and greenhouses, as well as pesticide handlers who mix, load or apply 
pesticides. The request by Roses Inc. covers all cut-rose production 
in greenhouses throughout the United States.  According to Roses Inc. 
without an early-entry exception allowing for harvest of cut roses two 
times per day, cut-rose growers will lose a significant portion of 
their crop and therefore suffer substantial economic harm.  Roses Inc. 
also maintains that health risks to workers would not be increased.  
In l994, EPA granted an exception that allowed, under specified 
conditions, early entry into pesticide-treated areas to harvest roses 
by hand for a maximum of three hours during a 24-hour period.  The 
exception expired in June of this year.  In granting the 1994 
exception, EPA noted that if rose growers needed an  exception beyond 
the two years, the industry would need to provide additional 
information concerning economic hardship, as well as measures to 
mitigate risks to workers.  EPA is soliciting comments on whether the 
data submitted are adequate to support granting the requested 
exception.  Comments on the request by Roses Inc. are due to the 
Agency by Nov. 29 and should be sent to: Public Response and Program 
Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), U.S. EPA, 401 M 
St. S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460.  The Federal Register notice of

EPA HOLDS PUBLIC MEETING ON THE DEFINITION OF SOLID WASTE

<P>

EPA will hold a public meeting on Nov. 19 to make information 
available on a project underway to revise the Resource Conservation 
and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations governing hazardous waste 
recycling. The meeting will be held at the Airport Hilton, 2399 
Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, Va., from 8:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. 
on Nov. 19.  Under RCRA, EPA has promulgated regulations governing 
management of hazardous waste known as "Definition of Solid Waste."  
EPA is working on a rulemaking to modify the current federal hazardous 
waste recycling scheme to meet two goals: develop a clearer, simpler 
regulatory system for hazardous waste recycling that adequately 
protects people and the environment; and to remove disincentives to 
the safe recycling of hazardous waste. The purpose of the meeting is 
for EPA to present and explain the draft rulemaking options the Agency 
is considering.  EPA believes the issues involved in this project are 
complex and difficult and an early discussion of the Agency's 
direction will benefit interested parties.  EPA anticipates publishing 
a proposed rulemaking in the spring of 1997. Written materials will be 
handed out at the meeting.  Materials will not be available prior to 
the meeting.  Copies of the materials can be obtained by calling the 
RCRA/Superfund Hotline at 1-800-424-9346 or 703-412-9810.

WASTEWI$E PARTNERS ACHIEVE IMPRESSIVE RESULTS

<P>

Under EPA's voluntary waste reduction program, "WasteWi$e," 208 
reporting companies quadrupled reported waste reduction over 1994 
amounts, eliminating 344,000 tons of material through waste 
prevention, and recycling an additional 4.2 million tons of material.  
This represents a substantial conservation of natural resources and a 
significant diversion of materials from landfills.  In 1995 WasteWi$e 
partners saved about $59 million in purchasing costs through efforts 
to reduce transport packaging.  Reduction in transport packaging is a 
key cost-cutting opportunity for many companies.  EPA's "Second-Year 
Progress Report" highlights the 1995 achievements of WasteWi$e 
partners and contains sections devoted to waste prevention, collection 
of recyclables and buying or manufacturing recycled products.  The 
report includes examples to illustrate the wide range of strategies 
available to reduce waste and cut costs.  WasteWi$e partners are 
located nationwide and span 35 industrial sectors, a third of these 
partners are Fortune 500 manufacturing and service companies. EPA's 
"Second-Year Progress Report,"(Document Number: EPA530-R-96-016) is

U.S-CANADA REPORT SHOWS PARTICULATE HEALTH DANGERS, ACID RAIN PROGRESS

<P>

The United States and Canada today jointly released their third 
biennial Progress Report on acid rain and other air quality issues 
under the 1991 United States/Canada Bilateral Air Quality Agreement. 
The report  contains the first five-year review of the Agreement to 
determine its effectiveness in addressing transboundary air pollution. 
Since the last progress report, health effects studies indicate that 
acidic aerosols and other types of particulate matter have adverse 
health effects in both countries.  Both governments also report 
substantial progress in reducing emissions and effects of acid rain. 
The 110 biggest sulfur dioxide (SO2)-emitting power plants and other 
utilities in the United States were in compliance with the acid rain 
reduction requirements of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments in 1995, 
the first year of the program (SO2 is one of the prime ingredients in 
the formation of acid rain). SO2 emissions in this country also 
declined sharply in 1995, decreasing to 5.3 millions tons annually 
from 1980 levels of 10.9 million tons(a 51 percent decline).  The 1995 
SO2 levels were 3.4 million tons better than required under the Clean 
Air Act. The report cites studies showing reduction in surface water 
sulfates, leading to water quality improvement in the northeastern 
United States and Canada, as well as a decrease in lake nitrate 
concentrations in the Adirondacks; however, the report cites other 
studies indicating that nitrogen deposition at current levels could 
reduce the benefits of acid rain reduction in the long term.  In 
addition, the study finds no evidence of widespread forest decline 
from acid deposition, with some exceptions in some especially 
sensitive regions. The five-year review of the Air Quality Agreement 
in the report concludes that, overall, both governments have been 
successful in fulfilling their obligations under the pact, 
particularly regarding acid rain control. The Air Quality Agreement, 
signed by the United States and Canada in March 1991, was established 
to address transboundary air pollution issues between the two 
countries. For further technical information, contact Rosemary Wolfe 
of EPA's Acid Rain Division at 202-233-9176.  For copies of "The 1996

NEW LABELING REQUIREMENTS PROMOTE SAFER USE 
OF PESTICIDE PRODUCTS ON CATS AND DOGS

<P>

EPA is requiring improved label directions on pesticide products (such 
as flea and tick dips, sprays, powders and collars) used on cats and 
dogs to reduce risk to pets as well as the pet owners.   The new 
requirements include more specific use directions aimed at ensuring 
that pet pesticide products are used safely, reducing potential 
adverse effects on animals and people.  Reports of adverse effects 
from veterinarians, consumers and manufacturers of pet pesticide 
products have indicated that improved labeling is necessary.  EPA's 
revised policies reflect comments received on a draft proposal issued 
last year.  Since that time, EPA has been working with the Chemical 
Specialities Manufacturers Association, public interest groups and 
other interested parties to improve the label language on these pet 
products.  To promote safer use of these products, the following are 
some of the label statements that will be required on all pesticide 
products used on cats and dogs:

<UL>
<LI>Read the entire label before each use.
</LI>
<LI>Use only on cats (and/or dogs as appropriate).
</LI>
<LI>Do not reapply product for (insert number of days, weeks, 
   months).
</LI>
<LI>Do not repeat treatment for (insert number of days, weeks, or 
   months).
</LI>  
<LI>Do not use on (dogs or cats) under 12 weeks (only a few products 
 can support use for cats or dogs under age 12 weeks).
</LI> 
<LI>Consult a veterinarian before using this product on debilitated, 
 aged, pregnant or nursing animals.
</LI>
<LI>Sensitivities may occur after using any pesticide product for 
 pets.  If signs of sensitivity occur, bathe your pet with mild 
soap and rinse with large amounts of water.  If signs continue, 
consult a veterinarian immediately.
</LI>
</UL>
The new regulations are contained in a notice issued to pesticide 
registrants, manufacturers and formulators (PR Notice 96-6).  All cat 
and dog pesticide products released after Oct. 1, 1998 must include 
the additional statements outlined in the notice.  Reporters can 
obtain a copy of the PR notice from Al Heier at 202-260-4374.  Others

EPA ISSUES FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICE REGARDING 
THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF NON-COMPLIANCE

<P>  

On Oct. 9,  EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance 
issued a Federal Register Notice that initiates a public comment 
period on how it calculates the "economic benefit of non-compliance," 
i.e., the amount of money a violator saves as a result of its 
noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations. The "economic 
benefit of non-compliance" then becomes the Agency's minimum civil 
penalty in that case.  The Federal Register Notice identifies three 
categories of issues for which the Agency is seeking comment: 1) what 
is the most effective mechanism for recapturing the economic benefit 
of non-compliance; 2) the methodology and assumptions incorporated 
into the Agency's BEN computer model; and 3) the BEN model's precision 
and user-friendliness.  Written comments must be received by Jan. 1, 
1997, and should be submitted in triplicate to: U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, 
Economic Benefit Docket Clerk, Mail Code 2248-A, 401 M St. S.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20460.

<P>  

The comments should reference this docket.  During this review period, 
the Agency will hold two public meetings in which interested parties 
may offer oral comments.  The first one will be held in EPA's 
Education Center at 401 M St. S.W., Washington, D.C. on Nov. 6.  The 
second public meeting will be held in San Francisco, Calif., at the

ENFORCEMENT INITIATIVE GIVES EPA ADDITIONAL DATA ON CHEMICAL RISKS

<P>

EPA has completed a major milestone in its efforts to gather reports 
of substantial risks from toxic chemicals. The Agency is closing out 
its one-time Compliance Audit Program (CAP) initiated under TSCA 
section 8(e).  Congress enacted this reporting requirement so that the 
government would have information concerning the potential dangers of 
certain chemicals. Closure of the program comes five years after its 
inception as one of the Agency's first industry compliance incentive 
initiatives which offered companies substantially reduced penalties in 
exchange for submitting previously unreported risk information.  Under 
the CAP program, EPA received over 11,000 previously unreported 
studies or reports from 89 companies on chemicals that present a 
substantial risk of injury to health or the environment.  The Agency 
assessed $19,032,000 in civil penalties against 73 companies.  The 73 
companies will pay penalties as provided in the CAP.  The remaining 16 
companies are under review for appropriate enforcement action.  One 
hundred twenty-three companies, including those engaged in chemical 
production and importation, petroleum refining, aerospace and 
electronic manufacturing, signed up under the CAP to conduct internal 
chemical data audits.  Of those companies, 34 had no outstanding 8(e) 
information due the Agency.  The 11,000 studies submitted during the 
CAP account for about 80 percent of all submissions received 
throughout the program's history.  EPA is currently reviewing this 
information to determine whether particular chemicals or mixtures of 
chemicals warrant further assessment and regulation.

EXPERT REVIEW OF EPA CHEMICAL INVESTIGATION REPORT ON TERRA INDUSTRIES INC. RELEASED

<P>

EPA today released the report "Expert Review of EPA Chemical Accident 
Investigation Report, Terra Industries Inc., Nitrogen Fertilizer 
Facility, Port Neal, Iowa'" (EPA 550-R-96-002).  The review was 
conducted by a panel of five outside experts assembled by EPA to 
comment on the Agency's report.  The review is meant to assure the 
integrity of the EPA report and to obtain insight into the means of 
best preventing chemical accidents in the future.  The "Chemical 
Accident Investigation Report on Terra Industries Inc. Nitrogen 
Fertilizer Facility Port Neal, Iowa," was prepared by EPA Region VII 
and released in January 1996, which was conducted under authority of 
the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and CERCLA.  EPA Region VII 
conducted an investigation to determine the cause of the explosion at 
the Terra Industries Inc., Port Neal Complex and to develop 
recommendations to prevent similar occurrences.  The explosion killed 
four people and injured 18 others.  The explosion resulted in the 
release of approximately 5,700 tons of anhydrous ammonia to the air 
and secondary containment, approximately 25,000 gallons of nitric acid 
to the ground and lined chemical ditches and sumps, and a large volume 
of liquid ammonium nitrate solutions into secondary containment.  Off 
site ammonia releases continued for about six days following the 
explosion and drifted several miles.  Chemicals released as a result 
of the explosion have resulted in extensive environmental 
contamination including groundwater under the facility.  The expert 
review of EPA's investigation report was to assess the plausibility of 
the report's findings based on all evidence collected by the Agency 
and to make recommendations on procedure, technique and report 
formulation to improve future Agency accident investigation products.  
Copies of both reports can be obtained through the RCRA/Superfund 
Hotline at 1-800-535-0202.  Executive summaries of the EPA Chemical

EPA has set an agenda for the second meeting of the Food Safety 
Advisory Committee which will meet in Washington on Oct. 22-23.  The 
committee, recently formed as a subcommittee under the auspices of 
EPA's Advisory Council for Environmental Policy and Technology, was 
established to assist the Agency with the implementation of the Food 
Quality Protection Act (FQPA), signed into law on Aug. 3.  The new law 
amends both the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Federal 
Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act to provide a protective 
regulatory scheme for pesticides.  The two-day meeting, which is open 
to the public, will be held in the Washington Marriott, l221 22nd St. 
N.W., 9 a.m. - 5 p.m. on Oct. 22, and 9 a.m. - 3 p.m. on Oct. 23.  
Among the agenda items are the following: consideration of pesticide 
benefits under FQPA; reduced risk, IPM (Integrated Pest  Management) 
and Pollution Prevention; minor use pesticide issues; communication 
and right-to-know requirements; and human health risk issues 
associated with exposure from various pesticide products that have a 
common mode of action, as well as  aggregate exposure to pesticides 
(e.g., dietary, drinking water, swimming pools, residential aggregate 
exposure including dietary, drinking water, in the home, lawns, 
gardens and recreational areas).  Chaired by Fred Hansen, EPA Deputy 
Administrator and Co-chaired by Lynn Goldman, Assistant Administrator 
for Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances, the Food Safety 
Advisory Committee is made up of approximately 40 representatives from 
the general public, environmental and public interest groups, the 
public health community, the chemical industry, agriculture and other 
pesticide user groups, food processors, federal and state governments, 
academia and others.  A third meeting is now planned for Nov. 14-15.  
The first meeting of the committee was held on Sept. 26.  Margie 
Fehrenbach of EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs is the Committee's

EPA RETAINS NITROGEN DIOXIDE STANDARD

<P>

EPA today announced a final decision that, based on the latest 
scientific evidence, revisions to the existing national ambient 
(atmospheric) air quality standards (NAAQS) for nitrogen dioxide (NO2) 
are not appropriate at this time.  The Agency has concluded that the 
current standards are adequate to protect public health and the 
environment from the direct effects of NO2.  The current NAAQS for NO2 
will remain at 0.053 parts per million, measured as an annual average.  
NO2 belongs to a family of highly reactive gases that form when fuel 
is burned at high temperatures and that are emitted primarily from 
motor vehicle exhaust and power plants. Although no areas of the 
country have violated the NO2 NAAQS for the past three years, EPA 
remains concerned about emissions of this gas, which can contribute to 
other environmental problems, such as ground-level ozone (smog) and 
acid rain.  To combat these emissions, EPA has already:  1) introduced 
tighter tailpipe emission standards for 1994-96 cars (and is currently 
developing regulations in partnership with California and heavy-duty 
engine manufacturers to cut emissions from buses and trucks); 2) 
required stringent controls on large NO2 sources, such as power 
plants, in areas failing to meet smog standards; and 3) finalized acid 
rain rules for coal-fired utility boilers that will slash NO2 
emissions 1.2 million tons annually by the year 2000.  In addition, 
the Ozone Transport Commission (made up of 11 northeastern states and 
Washington, D.C.)  signed a memorandum of understanding in 1994 to 
reduce NO2 emission levels up to 75 percent by the year 2003.  The 
Clean Air Act requires that EPA review the criteria upon which the  
NAAQS are based every five years and decide whether revisions are 
appropriate.  EPA currently sets NAAQS for six pollutants, including 
NO2, smog, particulate matter (dust, dirt, smoke), lead, sulfur 
dioxide and carbon monoxide.  Today's action will appear soon in the 
Federal Register and will also be computer-accessible  through EPA's 
electronic bulletin board system, the Technology Transfer Network 
(TTN) at 919-541-5742 (backup number for access problems is

EPA ISSUES INTERIM UTILITY REPORT

<P>

As required by Section 112(n)(1)(A) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 
1990, EPA is required to conduct a technical assessment of  toxic air 
pollutant emissions from power plants.  EPA has completed an interim 
version of the study and has submitted it to Congress.  The study is 
entitled "Study of Hazardous Air Pollutant Emissions from Electric 
Utility Steam Generating Units, Interim Final Report,"October 1996 
(EPA-453/R-96-013abc).  It does not make any regulatory determinations 
regarding electric utilities.  A final report to Congress will be 
issued at a  later date.  The executive summary of the interim report 
can be accessed by computer through EPA's electronic bulletin board 
system, the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) at 919-541-5742 (backup 
number for access problems is 919-541-5384) under "Recently Signed 
Rules" on the TTN's Clean Air Act Amendments Bulletin Board.

ASBESTOS DUMPING CONVICTION LEADS TO FIVE YEARS OF PROBATION FOR PHILADELPHIA COMPANY

<P> 

On Sept. 25,  T.G.P. Co. (TGP) of Philadelphia, which formerly did 
business as Grant Paper Co., was sentenced to five years probation 
after entering a plea agreement to felony charges of  knowingly
violating the Clean Air Act.  The company admitted to dumping 
asbestos-containing waste on a parcel of land behind homes
in a southwest Philadelphia neighborhood.  Pursuant to the plea 
agreement, TGP spent $1.3 million to clean up the land where the 
asbestos was dumped and has allocated $50,000 to cover any property
damages to adjacent homes.  The violations by TGP occurred in April 
and May of 1992, when the company failed to notify EPA of its plans 
and then directed a subcontractor, Philadelphia Construction Equipment 
Co., to demolish warehouses in Philadelphia which contained at least 
445 linear feet of asbestos pipe wrap and 10,775 square feet of other
regulated asbestos materials. This case was investigated by EPA's 
Criminal Investigation Division, the FBI and the City of Philadelphia.

PRESIDENT/OWNER OF OREGON ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP COMPANY SENTENCED

<P>
                                    
On Sept. 23,  Robert Cyphers was ordered to serve five months 
incarceration and five months home detention as a result of his  June 
1996  guilty plea to violating  the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA).  Cyphers, the former president and owner of UST 
Environmental Services, operated  a company whose primary
business involved removing leaking underground storage tanks and 
cleaning up contaminated soil and groundwater after the tanks had been 
removed.  Cyphers admitted to falsifying laboratory analyses  
performed by his company regarding soil and groundwater contamination 
at the removal sites.  The reports were submitted to the Oregon 
Department of Environmental Quality as required under RCRA.  Cyphers 
benefited financially from his illegal acts by fraudulently billing 
his customers for the laboratory analyses which were not performed. 
As a consequence, many of these sites might still be contaminated. The 
State of Oregon has resampled several tank removal sites declared free 
of contamination by Cyphers and has found petroleum contamination at 
some of them.  Petroleum products from leaking underground storage 
tanks can seep into groundwater used to supply drinking water and 
cause a variety of illnesses including cancer.  As part of his 
agreement with the government, Cyphers will pay the State of Oregon 
over $500,000 to help cover cleanup costs at the contaminated sites.  
This case was investigated by EPA's Criminal Investigation Division.

ABANDONMENT OF PCBS AND OTHER HAZARDOUS WASTES 
AT UTAH FACILITY LEADS TO INDICTMENT OF UTAH MAN

<P>

On Sept. 18,  Roy Hart, owner of North American Environmental (NAE), 
Inc., was named in a four-count criminal indictment by a federal grand 
jury in Salt Lake City for violations of the Toxic Substance Control 
Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) that 
occurred at a commercial PCB storage facility operated by NAE in 
Clearfield, Utah.  Hart was charged with one-count of storing PCBs 
without a permit; one-count of storing PCBs in excess of a year; one-
count of storing hazardous waste without a permit and one-count of 
disposing of hazardous wastes by abandonment at an unpermitted 
facility.  In December 1990, EPA officials notified NAE that it  no 
longer had legal status under RCRA to operate its commercial PCB 
storage facility and was told not to accept any further waste at the 
facility and to dispose of the existing on-site waste within 30 days.  
NAE continued to accept PCB waste for storage after the 30-day period 
expired and failed to dispose of the waste already stored there.  The 
company claimed it was financially unable to comply with EPA's 
directives.  NAE later abandoned the site.  When EPA inspected the NAE 
site in July 1991, it found an estimated one million pounds of PCB oil 
and debris and hazardous wastes stored in drums at the closed 
facility.  The government later cleaned up the site at a cost of over 
$118,361 to taxpayers.  This case was investigated by EPA's Criminal 
Investigation Division.

MISSOURI FOUNDRY AND ITS PLANT MANAGER PLEAD GUILTY 
TO VIOLATING ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS

<P>

On Sept. 13,  Midwest Alloys Foundry of O'Fallon, Mo., and Vern Kneib, 
its plant manager, pleaded guilty in St. Louis, Mo., to multiple 
felony and misdemeanor charges involving environmental violations, 
violations of immigration laws, and providing false statements to the 
government.  Midwest Alloys pleaded guilty to one felony count of 
illegally disposing of hazardous waste, one felony count of violating 
the Clean Water Act, one misdemeanor count of hiring unauthorized 
aliens for employment, one felony count of making a false statement to 
a material fact in a document required by immigration laws, and one 
felony count of willfully providing a false statement to the Tennessee 
Valley Authority (TVA).  The offenses which Midwest Alloys pleaded to 
involved the ordering of employees to dump hazardous waste on company 
property, during which an employee was injured; the unpermitted 
discharge of cooling water into Buleau creek in 1995; the false 
reporting of alloys used in the composition of rocker washers produced 
for the TVA;  knowingly engaging in the hiring of unauthorized aliens; 
and knowingly providing false statements in reference to the hiring of 
unauthorized aliens.  Kneib admitted to directing employees to dump 
two drums of hazardous waste, and he also admitted to engaging in the 
practice of hiring unauthorized aliens.  Midwest Alloys has agreed to 
pay fines and restitution totaling $150,000.  Of that amount, $9,000 
will go the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service; $25,000 
will go to the TVA; $100,000 will go to the Missouri Department of 
Natural Resources; and $16,000 will go to the U.S. government.  The 
company is also required to replace all defective rocker washers 
supplied to the TVA.  Midwest Alloys has also entered into a site 
remediation cleanup plan agreement with EPA.  In addition, Kneib faces 
a maximum sentence of up to five years imprisonment and/or a maximum 
fine of up to $250,000.  The case was investigated by EPA's Criminal 
Investigation Division and the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
with the support of  EPA's National Enforcement Investigations 
Center.

EPA MOVES TOWARD MAJOR EXPANSION OF 
COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION
ABOUT CHEMICAL USE BY INDUSTRY

<P>

To provide American communities with a more complete picture of local 
pollution and public health risks, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today announced its first formal action toward giving communities the right to know how local industrial facilities use toxic chemicals.   This is called chemical use reporting.EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner said, "Today's step to expand the Community Right-to-Know program would provide 
Americans with more information than ever before about toxic chemicals -- and how they are used by industrial facilities -- in communities all over the country.   The expansion we are considering would give the public the right to know not just which chemicals come out of local industrial facilities, but which chemicals go into their neighborhoods and how they are used.   Putting information about local pollution into the hands of the public is the single most effective, common-sense tool available for protecting public health and environment."

<P>

EPA today is issuing an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to notify the public and take comment on consideration of new requirements for chemical use reporting under the Community Right-to-Know program.  Reporting on chemical use (also referred to as materials accounting) would expand public information available on toxic chemicals that enter local industrial facilities; the amounts of chemicals transformed into products and waste; and toxic chemicals that leave the facility.  This information on chemical use would provide the public with a more comprehensive picture of industrial environmental performance and toxic chemical releases in local communities.

<P>

Today's action responds to President Clinton's Aug. 8, 1995, commitment to expand Community Right-to-Know reporting.  Proposals in the House of Representatives during the fiscal year 1996 and fiscal year 1997 appropriations process attempted to block this particular phase of CommunityRight-to-Know expansion by directing the Agency -- through budget riders and report language -- to expend no funds for this purpose.  

<P>

Expanding the Community Right-to-Know program has been a Clinton Administration priority since 1993.  In August 1993, President Clinton issued an Executive Order requiring federal facilities to report toxic emissions for 
the first time.  In other actions to broaden public information about local pollution, in November 1994 the Clinton Administration nearly doubled the list of chemicals that industry is required to report and issued an August 1995 Pollution Disclosure Executive Order requiring companies doing business with the federal government to report on toxic emissions.  In June 1996, the Clinton Administration proposed to expand by nearly one-third -- including seven additional industries --  the number of facilities that must report.  EPA intends to finalize this action for reporting year 1997.

EPA'S FIRST NATIONAL VOLUNTARY PROGRAM MARKS ITS END

<P>

EPA's 33/50 Program, the Agency's first national voluntary program, 
set national goals of 33 percent reduction in 17 priority toxic 
chemicals by 1992 and 50 percent reduction by 1995.  The 1,300 
corporations which voluntarily signed up to participate in the 33/50 
Program collectively reduced their emissions by more than 50 percent, 
a total of 757 million pounds of pollutants, by 1994 -- a year ahead 
of schedule.  The program, established in 1991, was measured by the 
emissions data companies reported to the Toxics Release Inventory, 
data collected from 23,000 industrial facilities on the amount of 
toxic chemicals they release to the environment annually. An EPA 
conference, "Putting Pollution Prevention into Action", held this week 
in Washington, marked the successful completion of the program and 
provided the opportunity for pollution prevention advocates to forge 
partnerships for new initiatives.

EPA REINVENTS REQUIREMENTS TO EXPEDITE THE APPROVAL OF PHEROMONE (BIOLOGICAL) PESTICIDES

<P> 

EPA has completed a series of regulatory reinvention measures to 
speed-up the registration of new, safer insect pheromone pesticides, 
resulting in the approval of new products in record time.  Pheromones 
are naturally occurring compounds used by insects to communicate and 
mate with one another.  The use of these compounds can achieve pest 
control by confusing normal insect behavior and preventing 
reproduction.  Pheromones are good for human health and the 
environment because they pose fewer risks than traditional chemical 
pesticides.  They are effective at very low doses and fit well into 
integrated pest management programs, reducing the need for 
conventional insecticides.  EPA's new common sense measures, a series 
of rules published between 1993 and 1996, have reduced both the time 
and cost of bringing new pheromone pesticides to market.  Approval 
times have been reduced from over two years to as little as two 
months, contributing to the development and marketing of a record 
number of safer products mainly used to control moth and caterpillar 
pests in the past three years.  Specific measures include exempting 
most pheromone pesticides from requirements for the establishment of 
tolerances (maximum permissible levels for residues in food).  This 
exemption is appropriate because no harmful residues result from 
pheromone use.  EPA is also allowing research and testing of most 
pheromone products to proceed on up to 250 acres of land without 
requiring prior Agency approval, compared to the 10-acre limit that 
applies to conventional pesticides.  A larger area is required to test 
the effectiveness of pheromone products, and their low risk justifies 
an exemption from the 10-acre limit.  The 250-acre exemption saves 
both EPA and pheromone developers time and money.  Many of the 
registrants of these products are small companies with limited 
resources and savings will allow them to free-up capital for product 
development and for technical assistance to growers on how to use 
these safer products to replace chemical insecticides.  EPA's 
pheromone reinvention measures are one of a number of initiatives 
being implemented by the Agency in response to President Clinton's 
charge to reinvent government processes and reduce regulatory burdens 
wherever possible while preserving public health protection.

EPA ISSUES NOTICE ON PESTICIDE POLICIES REGULATING 
RODENTICIDE BAITS AND OTHER VERTEBRATE PRODUCTS

<P>

EPA has issued a draft notice consolidating and clarifying Agency 
policies for registering rodenticide baits and other vertebrate 
pesticides used to kill, repel or  mitigate damage from mammals, 
birds, reptiles or fish pests.  In the past, these policies may have 
been difficult to understand due to the absence of a single, 
consolidated reference.  Therefore, with this notice, the Agency is 
encouraging registrants to review their registrations to make sure 
they are in compliance.  Depending on the gravity of the violation, 
and consistent with previously announced guidance, EPA will 
substantially reduce or eliminate penalties for violations that are 
discovered, promptly disclosed and corrected within six months or 
less.  The notice also proposes to allow registrants to obtain a 
single registration number that would cover different sizes of 
rodenticides which have a common formulation and are sold in 
"placepacks" (plastic or paper bags containing measured amounts of dry 
rodenticide baits intended to be applied unopened).  The policy 
requires that distinct names be used for each placepack size and 
should result in some savings to registrants, without affecting health 
or the environment.  Reporters can obtain copies of the draft notice 
(PR Notice 96-X) by contacting Al Heier at 202-260-4374;  others 
should contact EPA's Pesticide Communications Branch at 703-305-5017.  
Comments on the proposed action to permit sales of different sizes of 
placepacks under one registration number are due within 60 days of 
publication of the Federal Register notice announcing the PR Notice 
(expected within five days).  Address comments to Public Response and 
Program Resources Branch, Field Operations Division (7506C), Office of

On Sept. 4, Roland Wood, Diane McNally, Lisa Salazar and Refrigeration 
U.S.A. Inc., were named in a 164-count indictment alleging violations 
of the Clean Air Act, anti-smuggling laws and conspiring to defraud 
the Internal Revenue Service.  According to the indictment, the 
defendants unlawfully imported more than four thousand tons of CFC-12, 
an ozone-depleting refrigerant gas commonly known as Freon, into the 
United States and failed to pay more than $22 million in excise taxes.  
The defendants allegedly submitted false bills of lading to EPA by 
asserting that the imported Freon had been re-exported, when, in fact, 
it was sold domestically by the defendants or their agents.  Wood was 
also charged with violating money laundering statutes and with tax 
evasion; McNally with perjury and Salazar with making false statements 
to a government agency.  If convicted on all charges, the individuals 
charged as defendants each face potential sentences of over 625 years 
imprisonment and maximum individual fines exceeding $30 million.  The 
case was investigated by agents from EPA's Criminal Investigation 
Division, the U.S. Customs Service and the Internal Revenue Service.

On Sept. 9, EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner will recognize 87 
companies and individuals for their outstanding accomplishments in the 
WasteWi$e program at a ceremony at the WasteWi$e Forum.  The ceremony 
will be held at noon at the Crystal Gateway Marriott Hotel, 1700 
Jefferson Davis Highway, Grand Ballroom, Salons A & B, Arlington, Va.  
The Administrator will also honor 82 new companies that joined the 
program in 1996.  EPA launched WasteWi$e in January 1994 as a 
voluntary partnership program, which is designed to help businesses 
find practical methods for reducing municipal solid waste.  In 1995 
WasteWi$e partners conserved nearly 344,000 tons of materials through 
waste prevention activities, which is a 40 percent increase over 1994 
efforts.  In addition, partners quadrupled the reported amount of 
materials collected for recycling to more than four million tons.  
These actions saved these companies an estimated $75 million in 
avoided purchasing and operating costs.  Close to 480 companies are 
currently members of the program, one-third of which are Fortune 500 
manufacturing or services companies.  Partners are located nationwide 
and span 35 industrial sectors.  Upon joining the program, WasteWi$e 
partners commit to achieve results in waste prevention, recyclables 
collection and purchase or manufacture of recycled products.

<A NAME="Recycling"><B>Hazardous Waste Recycling May Get Easier</B></A>

<P>

Can EPA develop a clearer, simpler regulatory system for hazardous waste recycling that adequately protects human health and the environment?  Can the agency remove disincentives to the safe recycling of hazardous waste?  These are two of the goals of a draft proposal for the modification of EPA's solid waste definition.  This proposal could eliminate the distinction that currently exists between the types of secondary recycled materials (i.e., spent materials, by-product, sludge, and commercial chemical product) and adopt a view point that any material that is recycled has not truly been discarded.  At a public meeting held November 19, 1996, the agency stated they expect to submit a proposal to the White House Office of Management and Budget by March 1997 and propose that it be placed into effect by July 1997.

<P>

The draft poses two different options (an "in-commerce" and a "transferred-based" option) under which hazardous waste would be exempt from the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Subtitle C hazardous waste management regulation if it is recycled.  EPA is also considering a variance for "commodity-like" materials.

<P>

The "in-commerce" option would consider all legitimate recycling, on-site or off-site, by the same company or by a third party, as on-going production.  This option focuses on the value of the spent material to a recycler in the making of a marketable product and assumes that other statues, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA), the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), consumer product safety laws, and product liability claims, rather than RCRA, will address potential risk to human health and the environment.

<P>


The "transfer-based" option would allow a RCRA exemption if the secondary material is legitimately recycled by the same company that generated the waste.  Under the transfer-based option, since waste would fall under a broad definition of secondary materials, the exemption would be based on:  1) who does the recycling, 2) where it occurs, and 3) how the material is recycled.  Presumably, on-site recycling is more closely attached to production and the waste generator has more control over the secondary material than third-party recycling facilities.  Unlike the in-commerce option, the exemption would only apply to recycling by the same company that generated the waste.  Under the transfer-based option, secondary materials that are not exempt from the definition of solid waste when recycled and that are stored prior to being recycled by a third-party facility would still be subject to RCRA permitting.  However, third-party recycling facilities would be eligible for a streamlined approach to the permitting process.  EPA is proposing a streamlined permitting process using a nationally issued general permit rather than individual permits in order to reduce administrative burdens and time constrains typically associated with individual RCRA Subtitle C TSDF permits.   In order to obtain coverage under the general permit, the facility owner or operator would need to submit:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>A Notice of Intent (NOI) to be covered by the general permit;
</LI>
<LI>The Part A information required under 40 CFR 270.13;
</LI>
<LI>A summary of the meeting with the public; and
</LI>
<LI>Certifications that the applicable technical standards have been met and that supporting documents are available for review.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

Under both options, EPA is considering a variance for "commodity-like" materials that would be exempt from RCRA.  Commodity-like exclusions would apply to secondary materials such as pulping liquors, spent sulfuric acid, spent wood preserving solutions, processed scrap metal, and others.  Generators could petition the agency to include other secondary materials which could be recycled in normal production and whose recycling does not pose an increase in risk.  To determine an automatic exclusion, EPA and the states would consider the following:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Economic value of the material;
</LI>
<LI>Degree to which the material replaces or serves as a substitute for non-waste material;
</LI>
<LI>Degree of assurance that the material will be recycled;
</LI>
<LI>Economic value of the end product and the extent to which the material will be recycled material;
</LI>
<LI>Degree to which the material will be managed to prevent environmental releases; and
</LI>
<LI>Extent to which management practices demonstrate a close stewardship by the generator.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

In addition to recordkeeping and inventory control (i.e. volume generated or received, recycled, and product marketed), the agency poses several conditions under both options.  The secondary material must not be:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Burned for energy recovery or used to produce a product for energy recovery,
</LI>
<LI>Stored or managed on the land in piles or surface impoundments prior to recycling,
</LI>
<LI>Speculatively accumulated,
</LI>
<LI>Used in a manner constituting disposal, or
</LI> 
<LI>Designated by the agency as inherently waste-like.
</LI> 
</OL>
<P>
 
In this latest proposal, except for commodity-like materials, EPA dropped the economic test as the primary criteria for determining whether a material would be excluded from RCRA.  Under the economic test, generators had to consider whether there was a market for the material, whether there was a substitute for the secondary material, and, if there was a substitute, that it served the same function.

<P>

In both options EPA makes a distinction between legitimate recycling and "sham recycling."  According to EPA, for a material to be considered legitimately recycled, the secondary materials must:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Significantly contribute to the product or the process,
</LI>
<LI>Be a product that is sold in commerce that must result from the recycling process,
</LI>
<LI>Be managed to minimize losses, and
</LI> 
<LI>Result in no significant increases in the levels of toxic constituents in either feedstock or product.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

What does "significantly contribute" mean?  According to EPA, it does not necessarily mean that a majority of the secondary material must be incorporated into the product, nor does it necessarily mean that the contribution the secondary material makes to the product or process is so substantial that the product could not be produced otherwise.  The intent is not to set quantifiable levels of recyclable constituents, but rather, to disallow sham-recycling.  EPA will continue to seek public opinion and solicit comments from stakeholders as they reevaluate current criteria in an effort to develop regulations that generators and recycling facilities should use in their determination of RCRA exemptions for secondary materials that are recycled.

<B>EPA AND OSHA WORK TOGETHER TO INVESTIGATE CHEMICAL ACCIDENTS</B>

<P>

EPA and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) are 
working together to identify and publicize root causes of chemical 
accidents and develop recommendations for preventing similar accidents 
in the future.  Both OSHA and EPA have authority to investigate major 
chemical accidents.  Under a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the 
two agencies, EPA and OSHA will cooperate to jointly investigate major 
chemical accidents and releases for root causes and will publish the 
results of these investigations in joint reports.  Chemical accidents 
or releases characterized by one or more of the following 
circumstances will be candidates for joint investigation:  1) one or 
more fatalities; 2) hospitalization of three or more people; 3) 
property damage estimated at $500,000 or more; 4) a serious threat to 
worker health or safety, public health, property or the environment; 
5) significant off-site consequences such as large-scale evacuations, 
closing of major transportation routes, substantial environmental 
contamination or injury to domestic or wild animals; or 6) significant 
public concern.  The MOU establishes general policy for procedures and 
coordination between the two agencies to ensure effective 
investigation and reporting and to avoid duplication of effort. EPA 
will pursue supplemental agreements with states having OSHA-approved 
State Plans in order to coordinate investigations where the state 
administers their own occupational safety and health program.  Joint 
reports developed by the two agencies will include a description of 
the accident and response; observations and findings; any laboratory 
test results; discussion of the accident's probable root causes and 
contributing factors; a list of further planned activities; and 
recommendations for enhancing chemical safety, increasing emergency 
preparedness and preventing chemical accidents.  Copies of the 
EPA/OSHA Memorandum of Understanding on chemical accident 
investigations will be available on EPA's Internet home page at 
<A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/swercepp/">http://www.epa.gov/swercepp/</A>. 

<P>

To assist you in dealing with the complexities of root cause analysis, 
there is an exciting software application called Reason.  This easy-to-use 
product is the most advanced root cause analysis and problem solving 
application available and has helped countless environmental, safety, 
operations, and quality professionals in conducting a root cause problem 
solving process.  

<P>

Reason is a Windows-based, expert system that guides the user through 
the entire process.  It is designed to identify all root causes, complete 
the investigation and analysis process quickly, and document your work 
so that a prompt and informed decision can be made.

<P>

Reason is a rule based system, so it does not require you to select from 
a list of pre-written causes.  Instead, Reason uses a set of logic rules to 
guide the process.  You do not have to know the rules, the expert system 
leads you through each step and then helps you verify the accuracy and 
completeness of your work.  

<P>

Reason breaks down a problem into its essential parts, orders those parts 
into a logical model that can be measured, and then uses the results to help 
make the right decisions.  Although most commonly used for accident investigation, REASON can also be used on practically any business or operational problem: a defective product, a severe laceration, a late delivery, a vehicle accident, a radioactive exposure, the loss of a valuable employee, a notice of violation received from a regulatory inspection, and more.

<B>EPA PROPOSES AIR STANDARDS FOR PARTICULATE MATTER AND OZONE</B>

<P>

Based on evidence of harm to human health and the environment, 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today proposed new national 
air quality standards for particulate matter (soot) and ground-level 
ozone (smog). 
     
<P>

Because of the significance of the proposal, EPA will seek broad 
public comment on its recommended approach and on the need for any 
changes to the particulate matter and ozone proposal.  The purpose of 
the comment period is to reach out to all stakeholders in order to 
obtain the best information available for determining the appropriate 
final standards.

<P>

"In the Clean Air Act, Congress required EPA to review and 
incorporate the best available science into public health standards to 
protect Americans from air pollution," said EPA Administrator Carol M. 
Browner. "The EPA proposal would provide new protection to nearly 133 
million Americans, including 40 million children. We will use the very 
best science to do what is necessary to protect public health in 
common-sense, cost-effective ways."

<P>

Particulate matter (PM), or soot, comes largely from combustion 
from sources like power plants or large incinerators.   Ozone is 
primarily the haze of chemicals from car exhausts and smoke-stack 
emissions that shrouds many cities on hot summer days. 

<P>

EPA and a board of independent scientists have reviewed 86 PM-
related human-health studies, covering millions of people, that showed 
harmful effects from breathing particles at the current standard. The 
proposed standard, along with clean air programs already planned, 
would reduce premature deaths by 40,000 per year, and reduce serious 
respiratory problems in children by 250,000 cases per year.

<P>

Another 185 of the latest ozone-related studies on human health 
also were reviewed. All of them showed harmful effects from ozone at 
the current standard, including more than 1.5 million incidences a 
year of significant respiratory problems, such as loss of lung 
capacity and exacerbation of both childhood and adult asthma.  In 
addition to threatening health, ozone and PM can damage agricultural 
crops, and diminish visibility in national parks, in some cases by as 
much as 77 percent.

<P>

Browner said, "EPA has based its proposal on a thorough review of 
the best available science.  We are now hoping to hear from a wide 
range of the American people, from scientists and environmentalists to 
industry experts, small business owners, doctors and parents, to 
receive the broadest possible public comment and input on this important issue."

<P>

The PM standard currently calls for regulation of particles the 
size of 10 microns or smaller (PM- 10) in concentrations of 50 
micrograms per cubic meter annually and 150 micrograms per cubic meter 
daily.  The proposed PM standard calls for 2.5 microns or smaller (PM 
2.5) in concentrations of 15 micrograms per cubic meter annually and 
50 micrograms per cubic meter daily.  EPA today also proposed 
maintaining the current standards for PM-10 so that larger, coarse 
particles would continue to be regulated. The current ozone standard 
is .12 parts per million measured over one hour.  EPA's proposed 
standard calls for .08 parts per million measured over eight hours.  
EPA also is seeking comment on several other options, including an 
ozone concentration of .09 parts per million measured over eight 
hours, as well as a range of ozone concentrations from .07 parts per 
million measured over eight hours to .12 parts per million measured 
over one hour, the current standard.  On both proposed standards, EPA 
has also specified the way in which attainment of these standards 
would be measured.  

<P>

EPA believes that the standards being proposed are consistent 
with the work of the independent scientists on the Clean Air Science 
Advisory Committee, which is part of EPA's long-standing Science 
Advisory Board.  EPA will be taking comment on the scientific evidence 
during the comment period.

<P>

Browner today also expanded the membership and the mandate of an 
implementation advisory committee, to ensure that any plans to carry 
out the standards will include the advice and participation of state 
and local governments, industry, small business and environmental 
groups in order to identify common-sense, cost-effective options for 
implementation of the standards.

<P>

Plans to meet any finalized standards would be due in 2002 for 
PM, and in 2000 for ozone control strategies.  Deadlines for achieving 
full compliance would occur several years thereafter for both types of 
pollution.

<P>

Congress specifically named six air pollutants under the Clean 
Air Act to be regulated by EPA's national air quality standards.  They 
are ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, 
sulfur dioxide, and lead.  Congress directed that such standards 
should be reviewed at least every five years by EPA to keep up with 
current science, and that proposals to revise them should be based 
solely upon the best current scientific opinion on public health 
effects, not economic impacts.  Since initially setting standards in 
the early 1970s, EPA has changed the standards only twice:  Once, in 
1979, and once in 1987.  During the Bush Administration, a decision 
was made not to review the current science regarding the health 
effects of ozone.

<P>

There is a 60-day comment period on the proposal. Once a final 
regulation is issued in June 1997, it will be among the first major 
environmental rules reviewed by Congress under the new Small Business Regulatory Enforcement and Fairness Act.

<P>

Today's action will appear soon in the Federal Register, but will 
be computer-accessible earlier through EPA's electronic bulletin board 
system, the Technology Transfer Network (TTN) at <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/airlinks">http://www.epa.gov/airlinks</A>. The TTN can be reached at 919-541-5742 (backup number for access problems is 919-541-5384). The notice will appear on the TTN's Clean Air Act Amendments Bulletin Board under "Recently Signed Rules."

<H3>Scientific Review Process for Proposed Air Quality Standards</H3>

<P>
   
EPA's proposals to revise the standards for ozone and fine particle pollution are based on a scientific review required by Congress under the Clean Air Act, which mandates that the EPA Administrator determine every five years 
whether the nation's air quality standards are adequate to protect public health.  Following is the scientific review process that led to EPA's proposals:

<P>

<H4>Broad Range of Peer-Reviewed Scientific Evidence Examined:</H4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>To review the health standards for ozone and fine particle pollution, EPA began by conducting a wide-ranging literature search, covering all aspects of ozone and particulate pollution.   The Agency then selected for review those studies relevant to human health effects.
</LI>
<LI>Over three years, EPA and two independent scientific review panels identified 185 studies on the human health effects of ozone pollution and 86 studies on the links between particulate matter pollution and human health.  Studies examined included controlled human studies, epidemiological studies, and toxicological studies.
</LI>
<LI>A broad range of studies reviewed indicated that the current standards for both ozone pollution and particulate pollution do not adequately protect public health, as required by law.  The studies show that serious health effects would occur even if the current standards were being met, indicating the need for stronger health protection.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H4>EPA Relied on Independent, Peer Reviewed Scientific Research:</H4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Under the Clean Air Act, Congress requires EPA to rely on the advice of an independent scientific review panel, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, made up of nationally recognized experts in a wide range of disciplines -- physicians, toxicologists, epidemiologists, and atmospheric scientists -- from academic research, industry and the states.  Two panels were assembled, one for each type of pollution.
</LI>
<LI>A review document summarizing published, peer reviewed research on both types of pollution and their health effects was prepared for the advisory panel.  A separate panel of national scientific experts then peer-reviewed individual chapters in the summary document before the advisory panel began its review.
</LI>
<LI>The scientific advisory panels supported EPA's basic findings, supporting the conclusion that a proposal to revise the ozone standard should be made to reflect the health consequences of more prolonged exposures, and endorsing the range of ozone concentrations EPA considered.  The vast majority of panel members agreed on establishing a new standard for fine particle pollution.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<H4>EPA Opens Extensive Public Comment Period on New Proposals</H4>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>EPA has launched a 60-day public comment period on the proposed new standards as well as the scientific evidence supporting them.  In addition, the review process has been a public one, with scientific advisory panel meetings open to the public, and all review documents publicly available prior to panel meetings.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>

<H3>Public Health Effects of Ozone and Fine Particle Pollution</H3>

<P>

Every American adult breathes in 13,000 liters of air each day, on average, and children breathe in 50 percent more air per pound of body weight than adults do -- making public health protection from harmful air pollutants a top priority.  As required by Congress in the Clean Air Act, EPA has reviewed and proposed new standards to reduce two of the most widespread forms of harmful air pollution -- particulate matter and ground-level ozone (smog).  Taken together, they contribute to acute health effects ranging from premature deaths to preventable respiratory problems.

<P>
  
Following are facts about these types of pollution, related health effects, and results expected from the new proposed standards, if they are finalized in their current form:
       
<P>

<H4>Particulate Matter:</H4>  Particulate matter is a mix of coarse and fine particles that can't be seen individually by the naked eye, but often appear as haze, dust clouds or sooty emissions.  Sources of coarse particles include industrial crushing and grinding operations, materials handling, vehicle travel on unpaved roads and windblown dust.  Fine particles result from industrial, motor vehicle and power generating fuel combustion, as well as burning wood and brush.  Pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds also can form fine particles.

<P>

Effect on Public Health:    Fine particles can penetrate deep into the lungs.  On a smoggy day, a single breath can take in millions of fine particles.   Some 74 million Americans -- 28% of the population -- are regularly exposed to harmful levels of particulate air pollution.  In recent studies, exposure to fine particle air pollution -- either alone or with other air pollutants -- has been linked with many health problems:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>An estimated 40,000 Americans die prematurely each year, according to peer-reviewed studies, from respiratory illness and heart attacks linked with particle exposure, particularly elderly people;
</LI>
<LI>Children and adults experience aggravated asthma.  Asthma in children increased 118% between 1980 and 1993, and it is currently the leading cause of child hospital admissions;
</LI>
<LI>Children become ill more frequently and experience increased respiratory problems, including difficult and painful breathing; and
</LI>
<LI>Hospital admissions, emergency room visits and premature deaths increase among adults with heart disease, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and other heart and lung diseases.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

Increased Public Health Protections from EPA Proposal:   The current standard covers reductions of coarse particles of 10 microns in diameter.  If finalized in its current form, EPA's proposal would increase public health protection by helping to reduce fine particles of 2.5 microns in diameter,  as well as coarse particle pollution. This approach was recommended by an overwhelming majority of independent scientists who reviewed the standard for EPA, based on 86 new health studies that indicate the need for a stronger standard.  If finalized as proposed, the new standard would:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Cut premature deaths linked with particulate air pollution by 50%, or approximately 20,000 deaths; with acid rain controls currently underway, an additional 20,000 deaths will be avoided;
</LI>
<LI>Reduce aggravated asthma episodes by more than a quarter million cases each year;
</LI>
<LI>Reduce incidence of acute childhood respiratory problems by more than a quarter million occurrences each year, including aggravated coughing and painful breathing;
</LI>
<LI>Reduce chronic bronchitis by an estimated 60,000 cases each year;
</LI>
<LI>Reduce hospital admissions due to respiratory problems by 9,000 each year, as well as reduce emergency room visits and overall childhood illnesses in general; and
</LI>
<LI>Cut haze and visibility problems by as much as 77% in some areas, such as national parks.
</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H4>Ground-level Ozone:</H4>   Ground-level ozone -- the prime ingredient in smog in our cities -- is easily formed in the atmosphere, usually during hot weather. Smog results from a reaction between such gases as nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds that are emitted from motor vehicles and a wide range of industrial air pollutants. Ozone also makes plants more susceptible to diseases and pests, and reduces agricultural crop yields for many economically vital crops such as wheat, cotton, soybeans and kidney beans.  

<P>

Effect on Public Health:   Studies show that repeated exposure to ozone pollution for several months may cause permanent structural damage to the lungs, a serious issue for the 122 million Americans -- 46% of the population -- who are regularly exposed to harmful levels of ozone pollution.  Because ozone pollution usually forms in hot weather, anyone who spends time outdoors in the summer is at risk, particularly children, moderate exercisers, and outdoor workers.  Even when inhaled at very low levels, ground-level ozone prompts a variety of health problems:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Children and adults experience aggravated asthma;
</LI>
<LI>Healthy adults' lung capacity is temporarily reduced by 15 to 20 percent;
</LI>
<LI>Hospital admissions and emergency room visits increase.  In the northeastern U.S., 10 to 20 percent of all summertime hospital visits for respiratory problems are linked with ozone pollution;
</LI>
<LI>Lung tissues are inflamed, and acute respiratory problems develop; and
</LI>
<LI>Immune defenses are reduced, leaving people more susceptible to respiratory illness, including pneumonia and bronchitis.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

Increased Public Health Protections from EPA Proposal: Because it has not been revised since 1979, and because current science indicates that many Americans still appear to be at risk from ozone pollution, EPA is proposing to revise the standard to provide increased health protection.  If finalized in its current form, the new proposal would reduce ground-level ozone concentrations from .12 parts per million measured over one hour to .08 parts per million measured over eight hours, and change to a more accurate measurement that will better reflect the actual health effects of ozone. This approach was reviewed by a panel of independent scientists and based on 185 new health studies.  If finalized in its current form, the new proposal is expected to:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>Result in over 1.5 million fewer cases of significant breathing problems (those where lung function is reduced up to 20%);
</LI>
<LI>Significantly reduce the need for hospital admissions, missed school and work days, restricted activity, and emergency room visits for respiratory problems;
</LI>
<LI>Cut illness in children overall, and reduce conditions ranging from inflamed lungs to irreversible lung damage in children;
</LI>
<LI>Reduce episodes when asthmatic children require medication or medical treatment; and
</LI>
<LI>Reduce by nearly $1 billion agricultural crop losses caused by ozone.
</LI>

EPA ISSUES FEDERAL REGISTER NOTICE REGARDING 
THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT OF NON-COMPLIANCE  
</B>

<P>

On Oct. 9,  EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance 
issued a Federal Register Notice that initiates a public comment 
period on how it calculates the "economic benefit of non-compliance," 
i.e., the amount of money a violator saves as a result of its 
noncompliance with environmental laws or regulations. The "economic 
benefit of non-compliance" then becomes the Agency's minimum civil 
penalty in that case.  The Federal Register Notice identifies three 
categories of issues for which the Agency is seeking comment: 1) what 
is the most effective mechanism for recapturing the economic benefit 
of non-compliance; 2) the methodology and assumptions incorporated 
into the Agency's BEN computer model; and 3) the BEN model's precision 
and user-friendliness.  Written comments must be received by Jan. 1, 
1997, and should be submitted in triplicate to: U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, 
Economic Benefit Docket Clerk, Mail Code 2248-A, 401 M St. S.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20460.  

<P>

The comments should reference this docket.  During this review period, 
the Agency will hold two public meetings in which interested parties 
may offer oral comments.  The first one will be held in EPA's 
Education Center at 401 M St. S.W., Washington, D.C. on Nov. 6.  The 
second public meeting will be held in San Francisco, Calif., at the 
Holiday Inn Golden Gateway at 1500 Van Ness Ave., on Nov. 13.  Both 
meetings will run from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.  Copies of the BEN computer 
model and the BEN Users Manual may be obtained from the National 
Technological Information Service by calling 703-487-4650.  Callers

EPA MOVES TOWARD MAJOR EXPANSION OF COMMUNITY RIGHT-TO-KNOW INFORMATION ABOUT CHEMICAL USE BY INDUSTRY</B>

<P>

To provide American communities with a more complete picture of local 
pollution and public health risks, the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency today announced its first formal action toward giving 
communities the right to know how local industrial facilities use 
toxic chemicals.   This is called chemical use reporting.

<P>

On September 25, EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner said, 
"Today's step to expand the Community Right-to-Know program 
would provide Americans with more information than ever
before about toxic chemicals -- and how they are used by 
industrial facilities -- in communities all over the country.   
The expansion we are considering would give the public the 
right to know not just which chemicals come out of local
 industrial facilities, but which chemicals go into their 
neighborhoods and how they are used.   Putting information 
about local pollution into the hands of the public is 
the single most effective, common-sense tool available 
for protecting public health and environment."

<P>

EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to 
notify the public and take comment on consideration of 
new requirements for chemical use reporting under the
Community Right-to-Know program.  Reporting 
on chemical use (also referred to as materials accounting) 
would expand public information available on toxic 
chemicals that enter local industrial facilities; 
the amounts of chemicals transformed into products and waste; 
and toxic chemicals that leave the facility.  This 
information on chemical use would provide the public with 
a more comprehensive picture of industrial environmental 
performance and toxic chemical releases in local communities.

<P>

This action responds to President Clinton's Aug. 8, 1995, 
commitment to expand Community Right-to-Know 
reporting.  Proposals in the House of Representatives during 
the fiscal year 1996 and fiscal year 1997 
appropriations process attempted to block this particular 
phase of Community Right-to-Know expansion by directing 
the Agency -- through budget riders and report language -- 
to expend no funds for this purpose.  

<P>

Expanding the Community Right-to-Know program has been a 
Clinton Administration priority since 1993.  In August 1993, 
President Clinton issued an Executive Order requiring federal 
facilities to report toxic emissions for the first time.  In other 
actions to broaden public information about local pollution, 
in November 1994 the Clinton Administration nearly doubled 
the list of chemicals that industry is required to report and 
issued an August 1995 Pollution Disclosure Executive Order 
requiring companies doing business with the federal government 
to report on toxic emissions.  In June 1996, the Clinton 
Administration proposed to expand by nearly one-third -- 
including seven additional industries --  the number of 
facilities that must report.  EPA intends to finalize this action 
for reporting year 1997.

Compliance with SARA reporting requirements can be a 
time consuming process.  Maintaining accurate records and 
keeping pace with a constantly changing set of regulations 
is just the beginning. Converting all materials into a 
consistent unit of measure, determining reportable quantities, 
and selecting the proper formulas for analyzing releases can 
significantly complicate these tasks. The Material Inventory 
Report System, or MIRS, is designed to organize your hazardous 
materials information and satisfy all SARA reporting 
requirements in a fraction of the time it has probably taken in 
the past. Compliance software is of little value if it is not current, 
so MIRS is updated as changes occur and sent annually to EPA for 
review to ensure the software reflects regulatory changes and 
meets all SARA reporting requirements.

DUMPING OF LANDFILL LEACHATE INTO RIVER LEADS
TO $5,000 FINE FOR WEST VIRGINIA CITY

<P>

On Sept. 4 , the City of Elkins, W.Va., was fined $5,000 as a result 
of its agreement to plead guilty to a one-count criminal indictment 
from Aug. 7,  charging it with discharging landfill leachate directly 
into a tributary of the Tygart Valley River in violation of the Clean 
Water Act.  The violation occurred when city employees took leachate 
from ponds at the Elkins/Randolph County Landfill and pumped it into 
the river in December 1995.  The leachate was supposed to be hauled 
to a sewage treatment plant to have pollutants removed prior to 
discharge.  The case was investigated by EPA's Criminal Investigation 
Division in coordination with members of the West Virginia 
Environmental Crimes Task Force.

NEVADA HAZARDOUS WASTE DUMPER 
SENTENCED TO 30 MONTHS IN PRISON

<P>

On Sept. 6, in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Calif., Louis 
Alphonse Lefave, a resident of  Las Vegas, Nev., was sentenced to 30 
months imprisonment following his conviction for illegally dumping 
hazardous waste in the newly created East Mojave National Preserve and 
on lands administered by the Bureau of  Land Management.  In addition, 
he was ordered to pay restitution of $25,793 to the National Park 
Service and $14,105 to the Bureau of Land Management.  At the 
sentencing hearing, the judge found that the waste dumped by the 
defendant was hazardous and that the illegal dumping resulted in an 
ongoing release of a hazardous and toxic substance into the 
environment.  Two other defendants, Gene Marion Lefave, also a 
resident of  Las Vegas, and Fluid Polymers Inc., a Nevada corporation, 
are scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 17.  Gene Lefave is the 
president of Fluid Polymers.  Both defendants and the company pleaded 
guilty in December 1995 to disposing of industrial wastes at four 
different locations into arroyos or washes, which come within the 
protection of the U. S. Clean Water Act.  The defendants admitted in 
court that between April 1, 1995 and Aug. 16, 1995, in East San 
Bernardino County, they unlawfully transported and disposed of 
industrial waste, including hazardous wastes, causing pollution and 
harm to the East Mojave National Preserve.  This case is the result of 
an  investigation conducted by EPA's Criminal Investigation Division, 
EPA's National Enforcement Investigations Center,  the U.S. Department 
of Interior, the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, 
the FBI, the California Department of Fish and Game, the California

ILLEGAL ASBESTOS REMOVAL AND DUMPING NETS SIX MONTHS
IN PRISON AND THREE YEARS PROBATION FOR NEW JERSEY MAN

<P>

On Sept. 6, John P. Sochocky, an owner, operator and project manager 
of A'Quality Environmental Services of Hammonton, N.J., was sentenced 
to six months incarceration and three years  probation for violating 
federal law and regulations for the safe removal and disposal of 
asbestos.  Sochocky also was required to seek mental health 
counseling.  The criminal offenses began in May 1992, when Sochocky 
entered into a contract with Consolidated Rail Corp. to remove 
asbestos from a gantry next to a grain elevator located in 
Philadelphia, Pa.  Workers were exposed when  asbestos was removed 
from pipes inside the gantry without adequately wetting it to prevent 
the asbestos fibers from becoming airborne.  During the removal, 500 
bags of asbestos material were abandoned by the defendant from June 
1992 through early 1993.  Neighborhood children were exposed to the 
asbestos when they entered the unsecured gantry area through an open 
gate and dropped bags of asbestos through holes in the floor of the 
grain elevator to watch them splatter as they hit the ground.  Conrail 
has since cleaned up and razed the site.   EPA discovered the 
violations following a citizen complaint.  This case was investigated 
by EPA's Criminal Investigation Division and the Philadelphia 
Environmental Crimes Task Force.

On Sept. 9, Arthur Sumner of Memphis, Ind., Vice President in charge 
of manufacturing for Kelley Technical Coatings Inc.(KTC) of 
Louisville, Ky., was sentenced to 21 months in prison, 2 years 
supervised release and ordered to pay $5,000 for violations of the 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.  KTC is a manufacturer of 
swimming pool paints and industrial coatings.  Sumner and KTC were 
found guilty by a jury on March 28, of storing and illegally disposing 
chemical wastes which were used as solvents to clean paint 
manufacturing equipment.  In July 1992, state inspectors discovered 
over 600 drums of waste-paint related materials at one of KTC's 
plants.  Many drums were rusty, leaking or open and contained 
ignitable materials.  Federal and state law prevents the storage of 
hazardous waste for more than 90 days.  The wastes contained a variety 
of hazardous chemicals  including xylene, ethyl benzene and toluene. 
The case was investigated by EPA's Criminal Investigation Division, 
EPA's National Enforcement Investigations Center, the FBI and the 
State of Kentucky Cabinet for Natural Resources and Environmental 
Protection.

MISHANDLING OF HAZARDOUS WASTES LEADS TO HOME DETENTION AND 
FINE FOR SPOKANE, WASH., CONTRACTOR

<P>

On Aug. 26,  Donald Buster, owner of Hydrocarbon Specialty Contractor 
Inc. (HSCI) in Spokane, Wash., was charged, pleaded guilty and 
sentenced on one felony count of illegally treating, storing and 
disposing of hazardous waste.  Buster's sentence included a fine of 
$5,000, six months home detention and two years of supervised release.  
HSCI was in the business of decommissioning underground storage tanks.  
The waste sludge from the tanks was brought to the HSCI facility in 
Spokane, where it was stored for several years before it was dumped on 
the ground and mixed with sawdust.  Buster then illegally disposed of 
the sawdust and sludge mixture, which contained 30 times the allowable 
levels of lead, by burning it at the Spokane city incinerator.  Over 
400 drums of waste and a large pile of the sawdust sludge mixture were 
identified during the execution of a criminal search warrant at the 
HSCI facility.  The EPA Superfund Program was required to conduct an 
emergency response and removal at the facility due to the threat of 
explosion at the site and the potential for contamination of a nearby 
drinking water well owned by the city. A private party conducted 
further cleanup of the HSCI site at a cost of over $200,000 and has 
reimbursed the federal government $70,000 for emergency response and 
oversight. Donald Buster has contributed $120,000 towards the cleanup 
and has agreed to pay the remainder of the cleanup costs.  The case 
was investigated by EPA's Criminal Investigation Division.

ILLEGAL DISPOSAL OF HAZARDOUS AND LOW LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTES LEADS TO GUILTY PLEA FOR FORMER IDAHO LABORATORY TECHNICIAN

<P>

On Aug. 26,  Jay A. Johnson, formerly of Shelley, Idaho, pleaded 
guilty to one count of making a false statement to the Department of 
Energy and one count of improperly disposing of  a hazardous waste.  
Johnson was employed in the Environmental Monitoring Unit at the Idaho 
National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) which is a facility run by 
Lockheed Idaho Corp. on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy.  
Johnson admitted to making false statements to a government auditor 
during an official audit of INEL to cover up the improper disposal of 
approximately 145 mixed waste laboratory samples containing hazardous 
waste, low level radioactive waste and mixed waste.  Johnson also 
admitted to illegally disposing of a TCLP cadmium filter in a dumpster 
at INEL.  Johnson is scheduled for sentencing on Nov. 25 and faces up 
to five years imprisonment and a fine of up to $250,000 on each of the 
two counts.  The case was investigated by EPA's Criminal Investigation 
Division, the FBI and the Department of Energy Office of Inspector 
General.

COMPANY CHARGED WITH ILLEGAL DISPOSAL OF 
HAZARDOUS WASTES IN PENNSYLVANIA 

<P>

On Aug. 27,  Keystone Helicopter Corp. of West Chester, Pa., was named 
in a one count indictment alleging the disposal of tetrachlorethylene 
and trichlorethylene without a permit.  Tetrachlorethylene and 
trichlorethylene are ignitable chemicals and are classified as 
hazardous wastes by EPA.  These chemicals were used as solvents to 
clean, degrease and strip engine parts in the engine cleaning room at 
Keystone's helicopter repair facility in West Chester.  The charges 
allege that used solvents were dumped into a pit in the engine 
cleaning room floor.  The pit was fitted with a drain pipe that led to 
a buried septic tank located outside of the repair building.  The 
septic tank was designed to leach its chemical waste contents into the 
ground, creating a potential risk of ignition and ground water 
contamination.  Keystone Helicopter Corp. did not have a state or 
federal permit to treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste at its 
West Chester facility or anywhere else.  The case was investigated by 
EPA's Criminal Investigation Division.

On Aug. 28, Timothy McKenna, a state certified wastewater treatment 
plant operator from Barnhart, Mo., was named in a one-count federal 
indictment which alleged that he knowingly operated a bypass system 
that allowed partially treated wastewater to enter a tributary of Bear 
Creek in Jefferson County, Mo.  The bypass was constructed at a  
treatment plant managed by McKenna for House Springs Sewer Co.  The 
facility has an average flow of approximately 18,300 gallons of 
wastewater each day from over 250 hookups at the Bear Creek Estates in 
Jefferson County.  If convicted, McKenna faces a maximum sentence of 
three years imprisonment and/or a maximum fine of not less than $5,000 
nor more than $50,000 per day of violation.  The case was investigated 
by EPA's Criminal Investigation Division in cooperation with the 
Missouri Department of Natural Resources and the Missouri Attorney 
General's Office.

In Response to Explosion Resulting in Deaths of Five Workers, 
OSHA is Considering Expanding List of Hazardous Chemicals
</B>
<P>

As a result of an investigation into a New Jersey plant fire that killed 
five workers, OSHA has launched a thorough review of chemicals that 
can pose a serious risk to U.S. workers.

<P>

"In reopening the process safety management standard, OSHA will take a 
hard look at adding reactive chemicals to its list of
hazardous chemicals," Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational 
Safety and Health Joseph A. Dear said. "We're taking
this action today to ensure that other U.S. workers will be protected 
from the same kind of tragic accident that resulted in the
death of these five workers."

<P>

OSHA's action follows its analysis of an April 1995 explosion at Napp 
Technologies in Lodi, N.J.

<P>

Napp Technologies manufactured pharmaceuticals and performed custom 
blending of chemicals for other companies. The explosion (which 
destroyed the facility) occurred while the firm was blending sodium 
hydrosulfite, aluminum powder, potassium carbonate and benzaldehyde 
for another company. None of these chemicals are on the list of highly 
hazardous chemicals covered by the OSHA process safety standard, 
but employers need to analyze materials being mixed for any possible 
chemical hazards or incompatibilities. Mixing larger quantities of 
chemicals may pose hazards that are not present in smaller quantities. 
Also, mechanical equipment used in mixing must be thoroughly checked.


<P>

Expanding OSHA's list of hazardous chemicals would bring it into harmony 
with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) list, required by the 
Risk Management Rule, which implements 1990 amendments to the 
Clean Air Act (see the note below). Dear also said
that OSHA is considering possible means to address requirements 
under its hazardous waste and emergency response standard
regarding the circumstances under which employers facing 
emergency conditions must contact local fire or other 
appropriate emergency authorities. OSHA received a request 
from several union petitioners urging the agency to pursue these
actions.

<P>

NAPP Technologies has agreed to pay OSHA $101,600 in penalties for 
citations from OSHA's investigation of the April 21, 1995 chemical 
explosion and fire that killed five workers. The incident also injured 
eight workers and forced the evacuation of
400 community residents. OSHA issued citations to Napp Technologies 
for one willful and 12 alleged serious violations on Oct. 18, 1995, 
and proposed penalties totaling $127,000. The settlement agreement 
changes the willful violation against
Napp Technologies to an unclassified violation. However, NAPP has agreed, 
should it rebuild, to institute the following safety measures:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>conduct a comprehensive review of all operations to ensure 
compliance with applicable workers safety and health
standards;
</LI> 
<LI>engage an independent safety and health professional to conduct 
periodic comprehensive safety and health audits and
develop action plans to abate all hazards found;
</LI> 
<LI>contract with a qualified safety professional to train Napp 
Safety Council members (including supervisory, technical 
and employee representatives) to perform their duties 
effectively;
</LI> 
<LI>review all facility processes to identify those that should 
undergo a more detailed process hazard analysis; and
</LI> 
<LI>designate a responsible management official as a safety 
director, whose primary responsibility will be to oversee
Napp's safety and health program, worker health and safety 
issues, and compliance with applicable health and safety
standards.
</LI>
</OL> 

<P>

On July 3, OSHA sent a hazard information bulletin to its compliance 
officers describing the Napp Technologies explosion
and fire. The document recommends that employers conduct process 
safety analyses for all materials with catastrophic
potential, even if the chemicals are not covered by the process safety 
standard. The hazard information bulletin is available on
the Internet at <A HREF="http://www.osha.gov">http://www.osha.gov</A> under Other OSHA Documents, Hazard Information Bulletin.

<B>26 August 1996</B>
The following was adapted from an Internet posting by Sid Lawrence.  We have added our suggestions for promoting safety at the end.

<P>

There are many "common sense" beliefs about safety at work in a large organization that are not quite true.  The real situation is often more complicated than common sense.  Following is a comparison between some of those ideas and reality.

<P>

<I>Half-Truth:</I>  The Safety Manager is responsible for safety.

<P>

<I>Reality:</I>  Supervisors are responsible for safety. The people who plan and lead an organization's operations are the people who plan and lead the safety program of the organization.  The safety manager is an in-house advisor, facilitator, and consultant to the supervisors-who are the ones who make safety happen!

<P>

<I>Half-Truth:</I>  Management commitment is the key to a good safety program.

<P>

<I>Reality: </I> Management action is the key to a good safety program.
Management can put words and money into safety, but if they don't "walk
the talk," then employees aren't likely to either.  Real management commitment is action - planning and leading on safety and health issues.

<P>

<I>Half-Truth:</I>  Unsafe employee acts cause 80% to 90% of accidents.

<P>

<I>Reality:</I>   Management failure causes 95% of accidents
Practically every accident is the result of inadequate worker training,
inadequate procedures or working conditions, or inadequate enforcement
of safety rules and policies.  These problems are management failures.
A few accidents result from "Acts of God" or deliberate employee actions
but by and large, accidents can be prevented with proper management.

<P>

<I>Half-Truth: </I> Complying with OSHA requirements assures a good safety program.

<P>

<I>Reality:</I>  OSHA compliance is only part of a good safety program.
OSHA standards are minimal, generic requirements and do little to prevent
accidents that occur at a facility.

<P>

<I>Half-Truth:</I>  Safety First is the goal.

<P>

<I>Reality:</I>  High quality, low cost production (or service) without employees being injured or becoming ill from the job is the goal. An organization is not managed with the goal of increasing personal safety.
Every organization is in business to provide a service to the public and
the goal should be to provide the highest quality, lowest cost service
possible without injuring employees.  However, remember that from 
the individual worker's viewpoint, nothing is more important than safety.  
The worker must think, "I'm not going to risk my finger, my hearing or 
my life to get this job done faster."  When employees think about the 
possible dangers and prepare for them, safe and quality production
will automatically be the first priority.

<P>

<B> 19 August 1996, ISO Approves Environmental Standard for Companies</B>

<P>


Nikkei English News via Individual Inc.: The International Organization for 
Standardization (ISO) has adopted the first global standard for corporate 
measures for environmental conservation, it was learned last Thursday. 
The standard was approved by an overwhelming majority in a vote by 36 countries.

<P>

The ISO 14001 standard, to become effective from late September, sets 
specific goals for reducing industrial waste, saving energy and other resources, and recycling. It also requires each company to appoint personnel to prepare an activities plan to be carried out by each division and monitored by experts.

<P>

Companies that meet the goals would be certified by each country's screening 
and registration body.

<P>

The ISO 14000 series is the first set of generic standards developed by ISO 
to provide business management with a structure for managing the environmental impacts of their activities. The standards cover a wide rangeof environmental disciplines, including-

<P>

<UL>
<LI>	Environmental Management Systems (EMS)
</LI>
<LI>	Auditing
</LI>
<LI>	Environmental Performance Evaluations (EPE)
</LI>
<LI>	Labeling
</LI>
<LI>	Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA)
</LI>
<LI> Environmental Aspects in Product Standards (EAPS).
</LI>
</UL>
As of mid-1996, ISO intends the initial 14000 series standards to be organized as shown below:

Environmental Resource Center had previously reported that informed 
sources believed that the final 14001 and 14004 environmental management 
system standards would be published by mid-October. Nikkei EN states that 
the ISO 14001 standard will become effective from late September, 
which is in substantial agreement with these estimates. It is not clear when, 
or whether, further action is planned for ISO 14004.

<P>

It is expected that, like ISO 9000 certification, ISO 14000 certification 
will become a de facto requirement for doing business in some markets. 
In the United States, several federal and state agencies are examining 
methods to encourage certification or registration under the standards. 
Proposed incentives include regulatory relief, reduced inspections, and 
reduced permitting requirements. The DOE has stated that certified 
companies may be given preference in the bidding process. President Clinton 
has established a policy for environmentally preferred products which 
closely resembles the ISO standards for life cycle assessments.

<P>

The best way to plan for conformance with the new standards is to begin the 
ISO five-step process described in Environmental Resource Center's new 
ISO 14000 Handbook: <I>Preparing for Certification or Registration under 
ISO 14001</I>. The steps are-

<B>29 JULY 1996, EPA'S ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS</B><BR>

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency recently announced  that it referred a record number of criminal enforcement actions to the U.S. Department of Justice in Fiscal Year 1995, reflecting EPA's stepped-up targeting of the worst polluters and the most significant threats to public health and the environment.  These actions are part of the Agency's common-sense approach to increasing compliance with environmental laws by taking aggressive actions against flagrant polluters while providing assistance for those businesses that seek to comply.

<P>

EPA also reported today on enforcement actions during the first two quarters of FY 1996, the period in which the federal government was affected by the shut down.

<P>

"These record criminal enforcement actions are highly significant because criminal cases typically involve the greatest risks to public health and the environment," said EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner.  "We will continue our dual policy of making sure that recalcitrant polluters are punished while those who want to achieve compliance receive assistance to meet tough standards and requirements," Browner added.

<P>

The results, detailed in EPA's "1995 Enforcement Accomplishments Report," show 256 criminal cases referred to the Justice Department and 562 new criminal investigations started and $23 million in penalties for environmental crimes.  Most significantly, EPA as a result of targeted civil enforcement secured almost $1.65 billion that will directly benefit the environment by funding pollution control equipment and other environmental projects.  Moreover, EPA collected over $70 million in civil penalties and took over 3,200 civil enforcement actions.  There was $851 million collected for Superfund private party cleanups.

<P>

EPA took fewer than 600 civil actions during the first two quarters of FY 1996, compared to 1400 in the first two quarters of FY 1995.  While enforcement actions were down during the first two quarters of FY 1996, a number of major actions were taken to abate serious environmental problems. Among them were the largest penalty ever for auto emissions in a $45 million settlement with General Motors Corp. and the historic settlement of the Love Canal toxic waste site, in which Occidental Chemical Co. agreed to pay $129 million in cleanup costs.

<P>

"EPA's enforcement actions have increased long-term compliance while punishing polluters who put profit above public health and the environment," said Steve Herman, EPA Assistant Administrator for Enforcement Compliance and Assurance.  "The 1996 figures released today show the devastating impact of the Government shutdown.  Fortunately, funding for EPA enforcement is back at viable levels, and we will continue to protect the health and environment of the American people."

<P>

Among the new strategic approaches to increasing compliance undertaken by EPA in 1995 are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Establishment of a new policy on environmental audits to encourage and reward responsible companies that discover violations, disclose them promptly and correct them.  Under the new policy, 65 companies have already come forward with disclosures.
</LI>
<LI>Expanded assistance for small businesses through a policy that allows small businesses  seeking assistance to come into compliance without facing enforcement penalties.
</LI>
<LI>Four new compliance assistance centers to help more than one million small businesses in metal finishing, printing, automotive repair and farming industries more easily comply with the law.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

If you were inspected today, would EPA or the state find any environmental violations?  One way to find out is to have an audit conducted by Environmental Resource Center.  We can help you identify potential noncompliance problems before they become enforcement issues.

<B>16 JULY 1996, EPA HONORS WINNERS OF GREEN CHEMISTRY CHALLENGE</B>

<P>

EPA has honored five organizations for their accomplishments in "green chemistry."   The Green Chemistry Challenge was announced in March 1995 by President Clinton and Vice President Gore as part of the Administration's Reinventing Environmental Regulations initiative to promote pollution prevention and industrial ecology.  EPA, working with partners from industry, the states and other federal agencies solicited nominations for the Challenge in October 1995.   More than 70 entries were reviewed by a technical panel selected by the American Chemical Society.  The winners are: 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Monsanto Corp., for creating a new process to manufacture the widely used consumer pesticide "Round-Up."   Monsanto switched from a well-established process using extremely hazardous substances including formaldehyde, ammonia and cyanide-based chemicals to a new, highly innovative process that eliminates these hazardous substances from the pesticide, replacing them with more benign chemicals.  (Category: Reducing waste from manufacturing and reducing toxicity of materials used in manufacturing)
</LI>

<LI>Dow Chemical Co., for finding a replacement for chlorofluorocarbons and other volatile organic compounds used in the manufacture of foam products.  The Dow process now uses carbon dioxide, a completely harmless substance to humans, in the manufacture of high-volume commercial foam products.  (Category: Using alternative solvents and reaction conditions associated with chemical manufacturing)  
</LI>

<LI>Rohm and Haas Corp., for designing its product "Sea-Nine," a marine anti-foulant used in coating boats and ship hulls to prevent the accumulation of marine life, as a safer chemical.  Sea-Nine is significantly less toxic to humans than existing products, thus reducing hazards to workers who manufacture it, but also does not persist in or harm aquatic environments.  (Category:  Designing safer chemical products)
</LI>

<LI>Donlar Corp., for developing polyaspartates, a new class of polymer products that can be used in products including fertilizer and personal hygiene products.  Polyaspartates are very effective substitutes for some toxic chemicals used in these products and, because they are derived from naturally occurring aspartic acid, are biodegradable.  (Category: Small business)
</LI>

<LI>Texas A&M University, for research in using agricultural wastes (biomass) for use in  animal feed, fuels and high value chemicals.  Through these innovative processes, waste materials are being converted to useful products and replacing toxic chemicals.  (Category: Academia)
</LI>
</UL>

<HR>
<B> 10 JULY 1996 EPA ISSUES REGULATIONS FOR NON-MUNICIPAL, 
NON-HAZARDOUS WASTE DISPOSAL UNITS</B>

<P>

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act requires EPA to revise the  existing standards for non-hazardous waste disposal facilities that may receive conditionally exempt small quantity generators (CESQG) waste or household hazardous waste. 

These regulations require any new or existing non-municipal, non-hazardous waste disposal unit that receives CESQG waste to comply with new technical standards.  

Units that receive CESQG hazardous waste will be subject to location restrictions, groundwater monitoring requirements  and corrective action standards.  

Three types of facilities that may receive CESQG waste may be affected by this rule:

<UL>
<LI>Off-site commercial industrial units, which generally are stringently designed and monitored;
</LI>
<LI>Industrial units that may be co-disposing of CESQG waste with industrial, non-hazardous waste on site; and
</LI>
<LI>Construction and demolition waste units that receive CESQG hazardous waste.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

This regulation uses the Municipal Solid Waste Landfill Criteria (Part 258) as a baseline for the technical standards.  The criteria are standards that provide adequate environmental protection and can be applied to non-municipal, non-hazardous waste disposal units that receive CESQG waste.  The criteria incorporate substantial flexibility for EPA-approved states to allow owners/operators to meet the performance standards on a site-specific basis.  

<P>

For more information, contact the RCRA/Superfund Hotline at 1-800-424-9346 or in the Washington, D.C., area at 703-412-3323.

If your facility generates hazardous waste, you must comply with detailed regulatory requirements for waste characterization, container marking and labeling, waste minimization, manifesting, transportation, emergency response, and land disposal certification. Annual hazardous waste management training is required. 

<P>

At this two-day seminar, you will learn the latest requirements of the law, how to comply with both EPA and state regulations, and how to properly identify, accumulate, minimize, and ship hazardous waste. Additionally, you will learn how to develop a contingency plan, how to comply with the new phase III land disposal universal treatment standards, and how to comply with the new organic air emission standards for hazardous waste generators. You will take an in-depth look at the latest regulatory requirements, waste exemptions and exclusions, corrective action requirements, new universal waste requirements, VOC standards for hazardous waste generators, waste minimization, the proposed hazardous waste identification rule (HWIR), and more. Also covered is information on the modifications and new rules that affect your facility's hazardous waste management program. 

<P>

The handbook for the course, the <I>Handbook for the Management of Hazardous Waste</I>, includes step-by-step instructions for waste characterization, land disposal notices, determining the proper shipping name for hazardous wastes, manifesting, placard selection, recordkeeping, and report deadlines and instructions for each essential report.

<P>
<BR>
The Department of Transportation Docket HM-126F (49 CFR 172.700) now makes training mandatory for almost anyone who manages hazardous materials, regardless of the amount. This affects employees that select or fill hazardous materials packages, label containers, fill out shipping papers, load or unload vehicles, move hazardous materials, or operate transportation vehicles. At the same time, under HM-181 and HM-215A, DOT is changing virtually all the rules for hazardous materials containers, labels, shipping papers, placards, and shipping names. 

<P>

Receive the required training and learn how to comply at this comprehensive seminar. The course handbook, <I>Hazardous Materials Management: Compliance with the New DOT Requirements</I> takes you through every step in the management of hazardous materials.

Increasing public concerns and government regulations have created a demand for greater environmental, health, and safety stewardship. Whatever your responsibilities within your organization, you must know which laws and regulations apply to your facility and to your job in order to help keep your facility in compliance. Environmental Resource Center's common sense approach to compliance with environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations breaks down a seemingly daunting task into practical steps and procedures which can help any size organization understand and comply with applicable regulatory requirements. The manual for the course, <I>Environmental and Safety Compliance Handbook</I>, includes the history and purpose of the laws and regulations, permitting, recordkeeping, monitoring, training requirements, and enforcement strategies for each law and regulation.

EPA's Environmental Leadership Program could be in place as early as 1997, making companies with environmental management systems eligible for fewer inspections, expedited permitting, and reduced reporting and monitoring. At this seminar, environmental managers will learn how to: implement an Environmental Leadership Program by integrating sound environmental policies into daily business decisions and practices; implement state-of-the-art compliance and environmental management systems; develop and implement verification procedures to ensure facilities comply fully with all applicable federal, state, local, and international standards, including ISO 14000; implement management accountability systems; actively educate and involve employees in compliance and environmental management; and serve as mentors for other companies and small businesses. The course handbook, <I>How to be an Effective Environmental, Health, and Safety Manager</I>, goes beyond compliance with the laws and regulations to encompass the integration of sound environmental practices into daily business decisions.

<TITLE>PIT Concept Paper Published</TITLE>

<P>

On July 26, 1996, the EPA Permits Improvement Team (PIT) published in the Federal Register (61 FR 41251) its "Concept Paper on Environmental Permitting and Task Force Recommendation." The paper proposes a new approach to environmental permitting to streamline the processes.

<P>

EPA Administrator Carol Browner created PIT in July 1994 to improve environmental permitting processes. Their task was to make recommendations of reform after soliciting input from interested parties on specific media permitting programs (e.g., air, wastewater, hazardous waste). 

<P>

The PIT concept paper seeks to untangle the various interests of the public and facilities requiring environmental permits through the new approach, public performance-based permitting. PIT concluded, "Too much time and resources are spent reviewing the technical means by which a permittee will comply with permit conditions. While detailed technical reviews were warranted 25 years ago, sufficient progress has been made in verifying technology and increasing corporate environmental responsibility that it is now appropriate to re-evaluate this approach." 

<P>

The new approach incorporates the concepts of establishing a defined level of performance to be achieved by the permittee and providing the public with the necessary information to allow them to monitor the permitting process and compliance of permitted facilities. 

<P>

The most immediate effects of the proposed new approach are likely to be seen in the New Source Review and Title V Operating Permit programs under the Clean Air Act. The proposed uniform permitting process will help EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) to attain it's goal of streamlining the processing of permit applications in several areas, including the prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) of air quality, nonattainment area source construction, and Title V permits for ongoing operation of major sources. 

<P>

The concept paper helps to make its point about the confusing nature of the existing permit processes by comparing current permit program timetables with a proposed uniform timeline for all major and minor federal permits. See Figure 1 for the proposed new timeline.

<P>

Before you tear up your existing permits, note that this is a long-term project on EPA's part. We will not see these changes tomorrow, although many of them will be integrated into the air pollution permits process as soon as practicable. In some cases, laws may have to be changed. 

<P>

After final EPA approval of the concept paper, it will be used by the agency's permit programs as official guidance on environmental permitting. Other environmental permitting programs, such as those of state, tribal, or local governments, will also be encouraged to adopt these principles where appropriate.

<P>

<TITLE>Is Your SWPPP Complete?</TITLE>

<P>

Sites with storm water affected by industrial activities are required to obtain a permit and develop and implement a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP). The SWPPP identifies sources of storm water pollutants at your site and ways you can reduce and prevent pollutants from coming into contact with storm water. Although there is not a federal requirement that you submit your plan to your regulating agency, your SWPPP must be maintained at your facility.

<P>

<IMG SRC="SWPPP.GIF" BORDER=1 ALIGN=LEFT>Typically, the language of your storm water permit will identify the particular elements you must include in your facility's SWPPP. Facilities covered under a general permit can expect to develop and implement an SWPPP based on four elements: team formation, assessment of potential pollution sources, selection and implementation of pollution prevention measures and controls, and documentation of procedures to follow in order to periodically evaluate your plan for compliance with the terms of your permit. 

<P>

Your objective should be to eliminate, or to the best of your ability, minimize contact between storm water and pollutants. First, you should decide who will develop and implement the SWPPP plan. The number of people required to perform this work will depend upon the size and complexity of the site and the operations carried out. Document each member's selection and list their qualifications. Qualifications could include work experience, knowledge of a specific process, knowledge of the physical facility, or the ability to communicate with other employees.

<P>
 
To complete the next phase, site assessment, assess your site for areas where there is a potential for storm water to come into contact with pollutants and create a site map of your facility detailing areas where pollutants are located. Conduct a materials inventory, evaluate past spills and leaks, identify non-storm water discharges and illicit connections, and collect and evaluate any existing storm water quality data. Use the site map to guide the selection and use of pollutant control measures, then summarize the results of the assessment.

<P>

The next step, selection and implementation of pollution prevention measures and controls, starts with identifying your facility's Best Management Practices (BMPs). BMPs may include processes, procedures, schedules of activities, administrative controls, or other management practices to prevent or reduce water pollution. BMPs can be just about any measure you identify that is effective in preventing a toxic or hazardous substance from entering the environment.

<P> 

<B>Your plan should include, at a minimum, the following BMPs measures and controls:
</B>
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Good Housekeeping
</LI>
<LI>Preventive Maintenance
</LI>
<LI>Visual Inspections
</LI>
<LI>Spill Prevention and Response
</LI>
<LI>Employee Training
</LI>
<LI>Sediment and Erosion Control
</LI>
<LI>Management of Runoff
</LI>
<LI>Recordkeeping and Reporting
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

Effective implementation of strong programs at the employee level will produce significant reductions of discharged storm water pollutants. Many facilities already have existing programs and controls such as good housekeeping, employee training, and spill prevention that can be extended to manage and control pollutants. You may have many of these measures in place already as a part of quality control programs, accident and fire prevention, and safety programs required under other regulations. 

<P>

Employee training teaches personnel at all levels of responsibility the components and goals of the plan. Develop a schedule for the training and a course outline that identifies the topics covered. Most permits require annual training, but it can be incorporated into existing training programs, such as monthly safety meetings, SPCC training, or hazardous waste management training.

<P>

Sediment and erosion control should be a part of your overall storm water management program because when soil is unprotected, dirt and sand particles are easily picked up by wind or washed away by rain, causing storm water pollution. Focus on areas at your facility with construction activities, steep slopes, and sandy soils.

<P>

As part of your storm water management program, EPA requires you to keep records of all spills and discharges, all monitoring information and sampling data, all inspections, all work performed to correct noted deficiencies, and any reports made to regulatory authorities regarding spills or releases. These records must be maintained for a period of three years from the date of their generation. Facilities subject to state and local regulations should be careful to check the recordkeeping requirements of those programs. 

<P>

You must amend the plan if there are changes in your outdoor industrial activities which increase potential exposure to storm water pollutants.
Environmental Resource Center's, EPA's Storm Water Permits and Pollution Prevention Plans seminar will teach you to control the costs of sampling and analysis required to comply with the storm water regulations and learn how to meet all of your permitting requirements. You will also be able to develop your own pollution prevention plan and meet training requirements.

<CENTER><H5><A HREF="mailto:jmartindale@ercweb.com">Jack Martindale<BR>Environmental Consultant</A></H5></CENTER>

<P>

States that are authorized to implement their own hazardous waste program are still revising their rules to obtain authorization to implement the Universal Waste Rules, promulgated by EPA on May 11, 1995 as an amendment to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulations.

<P>

The Universal Waste Rule (40 CFR 273) established an alternative waste management program for certain high volume, low risk hazardous wastes. These wastes include used batteries, pesticides, and thermostats that contain mercury.

<P>

EPA defines "universal hazardous wastes" as the vast category of wastes which may be incorporated into the proposed part 273 regulations. The rule established an alternative waste management program for certain high volume, low risk hazardous wastes. Part 273 also includes criteria for the addition of new universal wastes in the future such as mercury containing lamps, paint wastes, and antifreeze.

<P>

Because the Universal Waste rule is less stringent than the preexisting hazardous waste regulations, states that are authorized to implement their own hazardous waste program must revise their rules to obtain authorization to implement the Universal Waste rules. As states are obtaining approval to implement this program, some are adopting the original three materials (batteries, thermostats, and pesticides) while others are adding other wastes to their list. The table to the left indicates the status of most of the states' implementation of the universal waste program and whether any additional items were added.

<P>
 
The rule is designed to reduce the amount of hazardous waste items in the municipal solid waste (MSW) stream, encourage recycling and proper disposal of certain common hazardous wastes, and reduce the regulatory burden on businesses that generate these wastes. By reducing administrative requirements, this rule is expected to save companies more than $70 million per year in compliance costs and reduce the amount of time spent on paperwork requirements by over 500,000 hours per year.

<P>
 
Administrative reductions also would help encourage collection and recycling programs, thereby reducing the amount of these common hazardous items that are thrown into the trash by households and small businesses. Removing these materials from municipal landfills and incinerators will prevent a potential threat to public health and the environment.

<P>
 
Annual RCRA training is required to keep you up-to-date with the latest changes in the regulations. Environmental Resource Center's knowledgeable consultants make it easy to understand at Hazardous Waste Management: The Complete Course.

<TITLE>Confused About EPA's Mixture Rule?</TITLE>

<CENTER><H1>Confused About EPA's Mixture Rule?</H1></CENTER>
<CENTER><H5><A HREF="mailto:mrandall@ercweb.com">Micheal Randall<BR>Vice President, Training</A></H5></CENTER>

<P>

<IMG SRC="WITCH.GIF" BORDER=1 ALIGN="RIGHT" ALT="Confused?">EPA regulations at 40 CFR 261.2(a)(2)(iii) define a hazardous waste as a solid waste "if it is a mixture of a solid waste and a hazardous waste that is listed in subpart D of this part solely because it exhibits one or more of the characteristics of hazardous waste as identified in subpart C of this part, unless the resultant mixture no longer exhibits any characteristic of a hazardous waste identified in subpart C of this part, the resultant mixture no longer exhibits any characteristic of the hazardous waste identified in subpart C of this part for which the hazardous waste listed in subpart D of this part was listed." Still confused?

<P>

<B>Must a mixture of a hazardous waste listed in subpart D (i.e. F, K, P, or U-list) and a solid waste always be treated as listed waste?</B>
<BR>
A mixture of a solid waste and a hazardous waste that is listed is a listed hazardous waste unless the resultant mixture no longer exhibits the characteristic for which the hazardous waste was solely listed. Remember though, with the exception of F003, this must be demonstrated with a formal delisting petition submitted to EPA or an authorized state. Also keep in mind, the deliberate mixing of a solid waste and hazardous waste to render the mixture nonhazardous, may be considered treatment per section 260.10 and may require a permit and compliance with Part 268 land disposal restrictions.

<P>

<B>What is a solid waste?<BR> 
Or perhaps more appropriate, what is not a solid waste?</B>
<BR>
According to EPA document #11707, (available by EPA faxback service 202-651-2060) solid waste does not include contaminated soil or other environmental media (i.e. groundwater) when they contain a hazardous waste and must, therefore, be treated as a hazardous waste until the media no longer contains the listed waste. However, many states will, generally on a case by case basis, determine that soil or other environmental media is below a state specified "exit" threshold, much like the exit criteria proposed by EPA under the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR).

<P>

<B>Does solid waste include other contaminated environmental media and debris?</B>
<BR>
The term debris is defined in 40 CFR 268.2 and applies to manufactured objects, plant or animal matter, and natural geologic material exceeding 60 mm particle size (approximately 2.5 inches). Typical examples are wood, rock, concrete, glass, cloth, plastic, and metal.

<P>

According to EPA, solid waste does not include contaminated debris as a result of the contained-in policy. Therefore, it must be treated as a hazardous waste. However, there is an alternate land disposal treatment standard for debris. Generators have the option of complying with the customary treatment standards or applying alternate treatment standards.

<P>

40 CFR 268.45 contains the alternative treatment standards for hazardous debris. Seventeen alternative treatment technologies for debris are grouped into three technology types: extraction, destruction, and immobilization.

<P>

When extraction or destruction technology is used, the contaminants are removed from the debris, but may be transferred or contained in treatment residues. Treatment residues constituting hazardous waste, either because they were derived from the treatment of a listed waste or because they exhibit a hazardous characteristic, must be separated from the debris and treated to regularly applicable treatment standards. The clean debris, which is no longer a hazardous waste, can then be disposed of in a Subtitle D, non-hazardous waste landfill.

<P>

Immobilization technologies qualify the treated debris for land disposal in a Subtitle C, hazardous waste landfill.

<P>

Not all alternative treatment technologies are appropriate for all contaminants. Generators must carefully review the restrictions listed in the table in 40 CFR 268.45. When column three indicates a restriction, that technology can not be used for that debris type. Additionally, generators must be cautious when dealing with "inherently hazardous" debris such as metals. Preferably, such metals should be recycled, but if that is not possible, they should be immobilized and disposed of in a hazardous waste landfill.

<P>

<B>What about laboratory waste?</B>
<BR>
If the laboratory of a facility discharges certain listed wastes into the facility's wastewater treatment system, the mixture rule states that mixtures of laboratory wastes that are listed for being toxic (T) are excluded from classification as a hazardous waste provided the concentration of laboratory wastes is less than 1 ppm of the total wastewater flow in to the headworks of the wastewater treatment facility (40 CFR 261.3 (a)(2)(iv)(E)).

<P>
 
<B>Are laboratory wastes that are listed because they are acutely hazardous (H) or toxic and characteristic ((I,T), (C,T) or (R,T)) also exempt from the mixture rule?</B>
<BR> 
According to an EPA verbal guidance, wastes listed for being acutely hazardous (H) or both toxic and characteristic ((I,T), (C,T) or (R,T)) are also eligible for the wastewater treatment exemption from the mixture rule. This exemption does not apply, however, to wastewaters which were listed solely because they exhibit any characteristic.

<P>

Sludges generated from the treatment of listed wastes that exhibit any characteristics of a hazardous waste (including the characteristics for which the waste may have been listed) or sludges derived from any non-laboratory listed wastes not otherwise excluded must be handled as hazardous waste.

<P>

<TITLE>Why Did the Hazardous Waste Cross the Road?</TITLE>

<CENTER><H5><A HREF="mailto:sbirchfield@ercweb.com">Scott Birchfield<BR>Senior Environmental Consultant</A></H5></CENTER>

<P>

Hidden in a proposed rule that dealt with the management of military munitions published on November 8, 1995, EPA introduced a new definition for what would be considered "on-site" for purposes of hazardous waste management. The new definition would allow generators to transport their waste a short distance on a public road without filling out a manifest.

<P>

Many facilities that generate hazardous wastes own or operate on large properties split by public roads. Under current regulations, a generator who produced waste at one location and moved the waste along the road for temporary storage or accumulation would be moving the waste "off-site" if the waste were transported along rather than directly across a public road. 

<P>

Currently, EPA requires a manifest for transporting hazardous waste along the highway. With few exceptions, manifested shipments must be destined for a permitted or interim status facility. If the wastes are transported directly across the road, the requirement does not currently apply. EPA's proposal would expand the definition of "on-site" to allow transportation without a manifest between contiguous properties controlled by the same person regardless of how access is gained from one parcel to another when such contiguous property is cut by a public or private right-of-way. 

<P>

Within DOT's Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR parts 171 through 180), all EPA hazardous wastes are regulated by DOT while in transportation. These regulations define a hazardous waste as any material that is subject to the Uniform Hazardous Waste Manifest Requirements of the EPA specified at 40 CFR 262. If a material is not subject to EPA's manifest requirements, it is not considered a "hazardous waste" by DOT, and therefore may not be subject to the hazardous materials regulations (unless the material would otherwise meet the definition of a hazardous material).

<P>

Whether a waste no longer subject to manifesting requirements would continue to be subject to DOT requirements will depend on an evaluation of the hazards of the waste. Therefore, for these shipments, generators must decide if the waste falls under any of the other DOT hazard classes in order to determine if compliance with the DOT requirements under CFR parts 171 through 180 is required. DOT also regulates the transportation of hazardous substances and marine pollutants.

<P>

Keep in mind that this proposal has not yet gone final, and some good proposals like this one never see the light of day.

<P>

Have you recently been given the responsibility for employee hazard communication training and don't know where to begin? Maybe you're an experienced safety professional, but need to add some new ideas or variety to your training. Are you responsible for ensuring that the Hazard Communication Standard program implemented by your company meets all the requirements? If so, Environmental Resource Center's new audiotape series on the Hazard Communication Standard is the answer to your Right-To-Know training problems.

<P>

We'll send you six audiotapes, broken into three categories, and an employee guide to the Hazard Communication Standard.  

<P>

The tapes are delivered one at a time, once a month, allowing you to listen and absorb the information thoroughly. The convenient handbook that comes with each tape provides a written reference to the tape's content and may provide other materials and graphics to illustrate the material.

<P>

The first tape in this six tape series gives you the who and what of the Hazard Communication Standard. It provides an overview of the Hazard Communication Standard and covers the ten basic requirements designed to protect your employees from the dangers of hazardous chemicals. You will also learn how the standard applies to your business, what types of facilities are required to comply with the standard, and which materials are considered hazardous. 

<P>

Tape two discusses the physical and health risks that make chemicals hazardous. The seven step process included helps you determine the chemical hazards of either a substance or a mixture. 

<P>

On tape three you will hear about material safety data sheets (MSDSs) and information on how employers must comply with the MSDS requirements of the standard. The Hazard Communication Standard's labeling requirements are also explained.

<P>

Tape four completes the compliance requirements component of this audiotape program with a discussion of the information, training, and documentation requirements of the Hazard Communication Standard, including: who must receive training, what needs to be included in your training program, when training must be provided, and how to document your training. The importance of a written hazard communication program is also discussed.

<P>

Tape five is specifically designed for those responsible for hazard communication training and includes many valuable ideas for developing and presenting an effective HAZCOM training program.

<P>

Tape six, the final component of this series, is titled "An Employee Guide to the Hazard Communication Standard," and can be incorporated into your hazard communication training program. This tape focuses on the employee and meets the "information" training requirements of the standard.

<P>

This all new Hazard Communication Standard audiotape series is available for the incredibly low price of $99. Each month you will receive a new tape that will explain procedures and methods that you can immediately put into action. You will benefit not only by meeting all the requirements of OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard, but also by ensuring a better and safer workplace for yourself and your co-workers. Backed by our 30-day, money back guarantee, this series has been created to be used at your convenience. 

<P>

As an alternative, you can order Tape 1 in the series for $18.95 (plus $4.95 for shipping and handling). Either way, it is a no risk purchase. Order today by calling 1-800-537-2372 ext 223.

<H2>ISO 14001 Information Services Available</H2>

Organizations involved in the ISO 14001 environmental management system certification or registration process are required to, in section 4.2.1 of the standard, have a "procedure to identify and have access to legal, and other requirements to which the organization subscribes  . . . applicable to the environmental aspects of its activities."

<P>

For many organizations it is not practical to maintain an up-to-date library of federal, state, and local regulations.  Environmental Resource Center will assist you in meeting this requirement by acting as your reference center for these documents, as well as industry standards, corporate policy requirements, etc. We will establish a file specific to your needs, keep it continuously updated, and provide ready access via phone, fax, web site, or e-mail.  

<P>

We also offer extensive ISO 14000 consulting and training services that can help you develop the programs and procedures needed to obtain certification.  Please contact Ed Walsh at 919-469-1585 ext. 230 or <A HREF="mailto:ewalsh@ercweb.com">ewalsh@ercweb.com</A> for additional information on these services.

<H2>Regulation Relief for Certain Hazardous Materials</H2>

Recently approved DOT Docket HM-222B revised the Small Quantity Exceptions effective October 1, 1996. Prior to that date, paragraph (a)(11) prohibited certain materials, identified by their UN numbers (about 25 entries), from eligibility for these exceptions. By removing these prohibitions, DOT said in its preamble to HM-222B, "the changes are intended to ease burdens on industry and facilitate international transportation of hazardous materials in very small quantities."

<P>

HM-222B also made Divisions 4.2 and 4.3 (PG II and III) materials eligible for these exceptions, but will allow Divisions 4.2 and 4.3, PG I materials, only if specifically approved by the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety. DOT will continue to require the marking statement on the outside of the package certifying the shipper's conformance with Section 173.4. The statement, "This package conforms with the conditions and limitations specified in 49 CFR 173.4" may be used until October 1, 2001.

<HR>

<H2>OSHA Issues New Policy for Dealing with Field Complaints</H2>

OSHA's new complaint policy essentially states that if a worker complains to OSHA about a workplace hazard, and the company takes adequate measures to rectify the situation, there may not be a follow up inspection.

<P>
  
If a report is received over the "imminent danger" hotline, 1-800-321-OSHA, OSHA will first call the employer and discuss the alleged hazard.  Then, there will be a follow up letter or fax.  The employer is supposed to respond to this letter or fax identifying any problems found and noting corrective actions which were taken. If OSHA is satisfied with the response, an on-site inspection will generally not be conducted.

<P>


Inspections will be done if a written complaint is received from an employee or the employee's representative and there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a violation is taking place, the complaint alleges that physical harm or illness occurred and the hazard still exists, the employer does not provide an adequate response to the complaint, or if the company has a history(based on the past three years) of egregious, willful, or failure-to-abate citations.

<HR>
ASCII text cannot capture graphics and images and tabular material often loses integrity when converted to ASCII. Also, files in other formats can only be viewed using the application that was used to create them. The solution to these problems is portable document software (PDS).

<P>

Portable document software takes the original file, including images,
graphics, tables and rich text (text that is bolded, underlined, italicized,
and displayed with multiple font sizes and appearances) and converts it from
the original application to a specially coded file. The particular type of
PDS we are using is Adobe&#153; Acrobat&#153;. Acrobat's specially coded file format is called Portable Document Format (PDF). This PDF file contains all the information needed to display the original file just as originally created, complete with all nuances of the original document.

<P>

TO VIEW A PDF FILE, A READER PROGRAM MUST BE INSTALLED ON YOUR MACHINE TO DISPLAY, PRINT AND NAVIGATE THROUGH THE PORTABLE DOCUMENT FORMAT FILE. THE ADOBE ACROBAT READER IS AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOADING AT NO COST FROM ADOBE'S FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL SITE AT <A HREF="ftp://ftp.adobe.com">ftp.adobe.com</A>, OR FROM THEIR WEB SITE AT <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com">www.adobe.com</A>. ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE CENTER DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT EITHER IN THE PROCUREMENT OF THE PRODUCT OR IN ITS USE. PLEASE CONTACT ADOBE OR YOUR MERCHANDISER DIRECTLY.

<P>

<A HREF="BC0996/REASSCR.HTM"><IMG SRC="http://www.ercweb.com/BC0996/REASON2.GIF" ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="Click here to view a sample screen"></A>If you are a safety, operations, or quality professional who is responsible for root cause problem-solving, then you should consider REASON. This Windows-based software is a powerful, expert system that guides you through the entire problem-solving process. It is designed to thoroughly identify all root causes, complete the investigation and analysis process quickly, and clearly document your work so that a decision can be made and implemented promptly.

<P>

REASON breaks down a problem into its essential parts, orders those parts into a logical model that can be measured, and then uses the results to help make informed decisions. Although most commonly used for accident investigation, REASON can be used on any business or operational problem:  a defective product, a severe laceration, a late delivery, a vehicle accident, a radioactive exposure, the loss of a valuable employee, a notice of violation received from a regulatory inspection, and more.

<P>
  
REASON can do this because it is a rule-based system, using a set of logic rules to guide the process. You do not have to know the rules because the expert system leads you through each step, then helps you verify the accuracy and completeness of your work.

<P>
 
For those environmental and safety professionals responsible for occurrence reporting, REASON provides a consistent and thorough analysis to identify both common deficiencies and prevention options. For those in Total Quality Management, REASON fulfills the "management by fact" mandates seen in the Malcom Baldridge Award and ISO 9000 certification.

<CENTER><H1>EASY HAZCHEK for Windows</H1></CENTER>

<P>

<H2>For Your Product Safety Manager.....</H2>
<B>A valuable but inexpensive resource for hazard information.  A regulatory "LIST OF LISTS"!</B>  

<P>

EASY HAZCHEK contains a database of approximately 3600 chemical substances and is continually growing because of our regular data updates.  The Hazardous Substances Database is composed of the chemicals on most of the regulatory lists needed for label and MSDS compliance.  You can access this database easily by entering the CAS Number or the first few characters of either the common or chemical name of the substance.    

<P>

For each of the substances on this comprehensive list, the screen will show CAS Number, DOT Hazard Number (UN/NA), the chemical and common names of the substance, and any special hazards such as carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, teratogenicity, flammability, corrosivity and reactivity.  It also shows the SARA Section 313 status and de minimis level, the California Proposition 65 status and "No Significant Risk Level", New Jersey Substance Number, New Jersey Special Hazards List hazard data, current OSHA and ACGIH exposure limits data (both Adopted Values and Intended Changes for the coming year), RCRA P & U Waste Numbers, CERCLA Reportable Quantities (RQ), and carcinogenicity ratings of both ACGIH and National Toxicology Program (NTP).  A click on the print button gives you a <A HREF="HZCHKRPT.HTM">printed report like the one on the next page</A>.  Please note that these printed reports (as well as the screen reports) show the date the data file was last updated.  

<P>


<H2>For Your Boss's Purse Strings.......</H2>
<B>Having current regulatory data available at the touch of a key at all times need not be a burdensome expense!</B>  

<P>

The low initial price of the EASY HAZCHEK  package includes the current database files.  the database is updated three times per year, and annual update subscriptions are available to registered users at a very low cost.  Compare EASY HAZCHEK`s features with others costing thousands!  Divide our low cost annual subscription price by 12 and you will see that you can have current data available all year long for $10.00 a month.

<TD>

The 1996 North American Emergency Response Guidebook (NAERG96) was developed jointly by Transport Canada, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation of Mexico for use by fire fighters, police, and other emergency services personnel who may be the first to arrive at the scene of a transportation incident involving dangerous goods.

<P>

This is the first complete update since the 1993 edition.  NAERG96 incorporates dangerous goods lists from the most recent United Nations Recommendations as well as from other international and national regulations.  It has a dramatic set of changes including a new organization for ERG data, HM-215A amendments, guidelines that apply from Mexico to Canada, updates to placard tables, protective action distance table changes, a critical term glossary, and more.  Get these invaluable new books hot off the presses by calling 800-537-2372 today!

<IMG SRC="MSDSX.GIF" WIDTH="242" HEIGHT="177" ALT="MSDS Express!"></CENTER>

<P>

You've put off automating your MSDSs because of concerns about extensive
data entry, problems resulting from inaccurate representations of vendors'
MSDSs, and an inability to find the right system to meet the needs of your
entire organization.<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>YOUR WAIT IS OVER.</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B><I>Easy to use with accurate information.</I></B><BR>
MSDS Express is a Windows-based program that utilizes image scanning to
accurately capture your vendors' MSDSs. This protects the integrity of the
original document while reducing the time and errors involved in data entry.
An affordable Hewlett-Packard Scanjet scanner (or any TWAIN-compatible scanner) captures the MSDSs which are automatically compressed by MSDS Express to reduce storage requirements.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Enter an MSDS into your computer in two minutes!</I></B><BR>
With each scan, the operator is prompted to enter a small amount of information from the MSDS such as product name, CAS number, chemical nomenclature, and vendor data. This information is catalogued in the program's database and linked automatically to the scanned MSDS for quick and easy look-up. A majority of the search fields are user defined.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Provide MSDSs to employees instantaneously.</I></B><BR>
Employees can use the MSDS Express easy-to-use query function to instantaneously
pull up the MSDS they need. MSDS Express includes security protection so
that you may assign different levels of access depending on job function,
location, or any other criteria you define. MSDS Express also includes a
built-in reporting function to simplify your right-to-know reporting requirements.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Minimum Operating Requirements &amp; Specifications:</B> IBM compatible PC (386 or higher) running Windows 3.1 or later, 8 MB RAM, VGA monitor, Hewlett-Packard Scanjet or TWAIN-compatible scanner, and sufficient hard disk space for your requirements (100 MB = approx. 500 4-page MSDSs).<BR>

<B>MSDS Chemical Collection on CD-ROM</B> offers an extensive resource of approximately 1000 MSDSs with the speed and accuracy needed during emergency situations.  Once found, MSDSs can be viewed on the screen or sent to a printer and you can cut and paste information to a word processing program for use in management reporting.  The collection can be searched by a variety of criteria including chemical name, synonym, CAS number, and DOT number.  The collection is now using the recently developed and easy to use Chemical Manufacturer's Association 16-part MSDS format for all new and updated MSDS's

To speed up the process of downloading these files, they have been "Zipped."  This conserves space and saves you time on the download, but makes the file unusable.  In order to use these demos at your site, you will have to have a program to "Unzip" them.  If you do not have one, make sure you download a copy of PKUNZIP.EXE.  All files run on the PC platform and are Windows 95 compatible.

<LI>Click on the link for the file you want to download
<LI>If prompted by your browser, choose to save directly to your hard drive
<LI>Once the download is complete, make sure that the ZIP file for your demo and the UNZIP application are in the same directory, or that you have a suitable PATH set up
<LI>Enter the name of your unzip file and the name of the file you want to load at the DOS prompt. (If you are using our unzip file to get the Safety Tracker demo, you would type UNZIP SAFTRKDM.ZIP)

<IMG SRC="MONYHAND.GIF" WIDTH=250 HEIGHT=184 ALIGN=LEFT ALT="Now it's easier to hold on to your money">On December 22, 1995 (60 FR 66706), EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance published its final policy titled "EPA Incentives for Self-policing: Discovery, Disclosure, Correction and Prevention of Violations." The purpose of the policy is "to enhance protection of human health and the environment by encouraging regulated entities to discover voluntarily, disclose, correct and prevent violations of federal environmental law."

<P>

As of January 21, 1996, EPA will not seek gravity-based penalties (i.e., penalties not related to economic benefits of not complying) and will generally not recommend criminal prosecution against the regulated entity for violations found through voluntary environmental audits or efforts reflecting due diligence. The regulated entity must promptly disclose and correct the violation in a timely way. EPA will reduce gravity-based penalties by 75% for violations that are voluntarily discovered, and that are promptly disclosed and corrected, even if they are not found through a formal audit or a due-diligence process. The new policy restates EPA's long-standing policy and practice of refraining from routine requests for environmental audit reports to trigger enforcement investigations.

<P>

The latest version of the EPA policy includes safeguards that the agency considers necessary to deter irresponsible behavior and to protect the public and the environment. Besides prompt disclosure and speedy correction, the policy requires companies to act to prevent recurrence of violations, and to remedy any environmental harm that may have occurred. Repeated violations or those resulting in actual harm or imminent and substantial endangerment are not eligible for relief. EPA stresses that companies will not be allowed to gain an economic advantage over their competitors by "delaying their investment in compliance." You may still be criminally liable for violations that result from conscious disregard of environmental obligations under the law.

<P>

EPA published the policy as a result of an assessment that began in July 1994 to find the best ways to encourage companies to examine and control their own environmental compliance while preserving the agency's enforcement powers and options. Several states had already adopted laws barring the results of environmental compliance audits from being introduced as evidence in court and preventing state enforcement agencies from charging regulated organizations with violations discovered through self-auditing. The incentives, conditions and exceptions announced by EPA reflect input from the Department of Justice, state attorneys general and local prosecutors, state environmental agencies, the regulated community, and public interest organizations. EPA will conduct a study within three years to determine the effectiveness of the new policy.

<P>

The new policy provides formal definitions for terms that have up to now been used informally in this field, including: environmental audit, regulated entity, due diligence, environmental audit report, and gravity-based penalties.
The definition of <B>"environmental audit"</B> repeats that in EPA's 1986 audit policy: "A systematic, documented, periodic and objective review by regulated entities of facility operations and practices related to meeting environmental requirements."

<P>

A <B>"regulated entity"</B> is any entity regulated under federal environmental laws, including federal, state, or municipal agencies or facilities.

<P>

<B>"Due diligence"</B> for the purposes of the self-policing and disclosure policy consists of the regulated entity's systematic efforts, appropriate to the size and nature of its business, to prevent, detect and correct violations through all of the following:
<UL>
<LI>Compliance policies, standards, and procedures-
<UL>
<LI>identifying how employees and agents meet the requirements of laws, regulations, permits, and/or any other sources of authority;
<LI>assigning overall responsibility for overseeing compliance with policies, standards, and procedures; and
<LI>assigning specific responsibility for assuring compliance at each facility or operation.
</UL>
<LI>Mechanisms for systematically assuring that compliance policies, standards and procedures are being carried out, including monitoring and auditing systems and means for reporting violations of environmental requirements without fear of retaliation.
<LI>Efforts to communicate effectively the regulated entity's standards and procedures to all employees and other agents.
<LI>Incentives to managers and employees to perform in accordance with compliance policies, standards and procedures, including consistent enforcement and appropriate discipline.
<LI>Procedures for prompt and appropriate correction of violations and program modifications to prevent future violations.
</UL>

<P>

The <A HREF="DOWNLOAD.HTM">full text of the policy</A> is available for downloading, and a complete explanation will soon be added to our Environmental Auditing and Compliance Manual.

<P>

The best way to take advantage of EPA's new audit policy is to conduct periodic audits that meet the requirements described in the policy, determine whether your facility is out of compliance, and take immediate steps to correct areas of non-conformance. Environmental Resource Center's environmental audit team is ready to help you in every step of the process.

<IMG SRC="FLAMABLE.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="Flammable">Are you confident that your facility is in compliance with OSHA's storage requirements for flammable and combustible liquids? Do you know if your hazardous waste must be stored in accordance with OSHA's requirements for flammable and combustible liquid storage?

<P>

 
OSHA's regulations for storing flammable and combustible liquids are found at 29 CFR 1910.106. Some of the topics addressed in the standard include tank storage, container and portable tank storage, industrial plants, bulk plants, service stations, processing plants, refineries, chemical plants, distilleries, and piping, valves, and fittings.

<P>

<IMG SRC="DNGRFLMB.GIF" ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT=61 WIDTH=144 ALT="Danger: Flammable">In general terms, 29 CFR 1910.106 applies to the handling, storage, and use of flammable and combustible liquids with flashpoints below 200&degree;F. To understand the standard, you should know the OSHA definitions for "flammable" and "combustible." (See definitions at the bottom of the page)

<P>

<IMG  SRC="NOFLAME.GIF"  ALIGN=RIGHT ALT="No Open Flame">The "container and portable tank storage" requirements of 29 CFR 1910.106(d) apply to the storage of flammable or combustible liquids in drums or other containers (including flammable aerosols) that do not exceed 60 gallons of individual capacity and those portable tanks that do not exceed 660 gallons of individual capacity. Exceptions to these requirements include:
<UL>
<LI>Storage of containers in bulk plants, service stations, refineries, chemical plants, and distilleries;
</LI> 
<LI>Class I or Class II liquids in the fuel tanks of a motor vehicle, aircraft, boat, or portable or stationary engine;
</LI> 
<LI>Flammable or combustible paints, oils, varnishes, and similar mixtures used for painting or maintenance when not kept for a period in excess of 30 days;
</LI> 
<LI>Beverages when packaged in individual containers not exceeding 1 gallon in size.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
 
The size of flammable and combustible liquid containers must be in accordance with the table below, except that in certain circumstances (e.g., if containers are intended for direct export outside the United States), glass or plastic containers of no more than 1-gallon capacity may be used for Class IA or IB flammable liquids. In general terms, only DOT approved containers and portable tanks are acceptable, and each portable tank must meet the emergency venting requirements specified in the standard.

<P>

The design, construction, and capacity specifications for storage cabinets are also included in paragraph (d) of the standard. These storage cabinet requirements address maximum capacity, fire resistance, labeling, and specifications for the construction of metal and wooden cabinets. For example, not more than 60 gallons of Class I or Class II liquids, nor more than 120 gallons of Class III liquids may be stored in a storage cabinet; and the cabinets must be labeled in conspicuous lettering, "Flammable-Keep Fire Away."

<P>

Fire control measures are also addressed in the "container and portable tank storage" requirements of paragraph (d). Suitable fire control devices, such as extinguishers or small hoses must be available at the location where flammable and combustible liquids are stored. Additionally, the fire control provisions address sprinklers, open flames and smoking (which are not permitted in flammable or combustible liquid storage areas), and storing water reactive materials in the same room with flammable and combustible liquids is prohibited.

<P>

Attend Environmental Resource Center's OSHA Hazard Communication Standard Training for Trainers to learn the latest OSHA Hazard Communication requirements. If you have specific concerns about materials present at your facility which meet the definitions for flammable or combustible liquids under this standard, you can <A HREF="http://www.osha-slc.gov/OshStd_data/1910.0106.html">obtain the full text of 29 CFR 1910.106 online</A> to ensure that you are in compliance with the standard and are prepared for an OSHA inspection.

<P>
EPA has delayed the effective date again to June 5, 1996, for the new regulatory standard that would add requirements for the control of volatile organic emissions from hazardous waste containers, tanks, and surface impoundments.

<P>

The final rule was originally scheduled to become effective in June 1995, but due to the short compliance time and cost to industry, the effective date was delayed until December 1995. Resistance from industry and technical problems in the rule resulted in a court challenge to the originally published rule and subsequently forced EPA to delay the effective date again.

<P>

Within the original rule, wastes with greater than 100 ppmw average concentration of volatile organic chemicals (VOC) qualified for emission controls. One of the technical problems associated with the final rule was that EPA did not publish a list of compounds that are considered a VOC. In a February 29th EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards memo to plaintiffs in a lawsuit challenging the VOC standard, EPA indicated that the qualifying level of VOCs might be raised to 500 ppmw. EPA also said that they are going to issue a list of compounds that will be regulated as volatile organics.

<P>
 
Another requirement in the original final rule that resulted in strong resistance from the regulated community was the requirement for all VOC control devices to achieve a "no detectable emission level." In the February 29th memo, EPA stated that tanks which are in compliance with the Clean Air Act maximum achievable control technology standards will be considered to meet the RCRA VOC standard. Also in the memo was an exemption for wastes where the concentration of VOCs in the waste are below the published land disposal restriction levels of those compounds. EPA said that a reduction efficiency rate of 95% will still be achieved with the modifications.

<P>
 
EPA regulations are constantly changing, and it can be difficult to keep up with them. Rely on Environmental Resource Center's seminars  to do that for you. Our course manual updates containing the latest changes to the regulations are free with your tuition via the Internet.

<IMG SRC="HPYWRK2.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT>Do you spend thousands of dollars a year to train employees in hazardous waste management? Despite these efforts, do self-inspections and audits reveal open containers, drums in poor condition, unmarked drums, evidence of spills on the outside of containers, errors on shipping papers, and reporting and recordkeeping deficiencies? While training is essential and required by 40 CFR 262.34(a)(4) and 265.16, it is not the secret to compliance.

<P> 

<H2>...the secret is employee participation.</H2>

<P>

The secret to compliance is employee participation. Traditional training, which requires employees to read material, listen to lectures, view videos and slides presentations, and even participate in hands-on exercises, will not guarantee employee participation. 

<P>

<IMG SRC="HPYWRK3.GIF" ALIGN=RIGHT>While computer-based training does not ensure employee participation, it does incorporate the elements necessary for employees to master complicated tasks, including reading, hearing, seeing, and interactive hands-on exercises. Also, computer based training is self-paced and a cost-effective training method, ensures consistent messages, simulates experiences relevant to the work experience, is interactive, provides a variety of learning experiences, allows alternative presentations that provide opportunities for learners of all abilities and skills, allows for evaluation, gives immediate feedback, and minimizes interference with job functions.

<P>
 
One traditional training technique that may be effective in enlisting employee participation is train-the-trainer. Train-the-trainer programs are effective in conveying training techniques and subject material to some; still, train-the-trainer programs depend of the motivation and skills of the trainer to ensure employee participation.

<P>

<H2>. . . cooperative learning is the secret to employee participation.</H2>

<P>

The first step in cooperative learning involves developing teams of trained experts in accumulation point management, satellite accumulation point, recordkeeping and reporting, hazardous waste identification, container selection, and marking and labeling. Computer-based training programs will facilitate training your teams of experts. Following successful CBT, team members should be given certificates of training and recognized as experts in their areas. The second step in cooperative learning is to share knowledge; one expert from each team teaches the other teams about what they have learned. The third step is to change hats, when each year, employees are given an opportunity to become experts in other areas. 

<CENTER><IMG SRC=HPYWRK1.GIF></CENTER>

Employees develop a sense of importance, involvement, and ownership through cooperative learning techniques. Further, employees can turn to each other for help and support. Cooperative learning promotes an overall improvement in employee attitudes, cooperation, and job performance in other areas.
Contact <A HREF="mailto:bstrong@ercweb.com">Bob Strong</A> at (919) 469-1585 or <A HREF="mailto:bstrong@ercweb.com">send him e-mail</A> if you would like more information about how Environmental Resource Center's computer-based training programs can help you develop a cooperative learning program to ultimately bring your facility into complete compliance.

<P>

<IMG SRC="DOTSLIDE.GIF" ALIGN=LEFT HEIGHT=143 WIDTH=219>Often overlooked in the Department of Transportation's (DOT) Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) is the mandate for shippers to comply with certain loading requirements published in the modal (carrier) parts of 49 CFR. In particular, the requirements of Part 177 need to be examined closely.

<P>

For instance, if the objective of regulatory compliance is the safe transportation of hazardous materials, then both shipper and carrier must share in the responsibility to accomplish this objective. However, it is the obligation of the shipper to ensure that hazardous materials are properly loaded and unloaded, as spelled out in &#167;173.30 as follows:

<P>

"A person who loads or unloads hazardous materials into or from a transport vehicle or vessel shall comply with the applicable loading and unloading requirements of Parts 174, 175, 176, and 177 of this subchapter."

<P>

This regulation imposes upon each shipper the entire range of modal requirements which are essentially identical as to their intended purpose. As published in 49 CFR 177.834, in the trucking mode, if you combine the regulation in &#167;173.30 with the following provision in paragraph (a) of &#167;177.834, you can understand the importance of bracing and blocking for all hazardous materials offered in non-bulk containers. 49 CFR 177.834 reads:

<P>

"Any tank, barrel, drum, cylinder, or other packaging, not permanently attached to a motor vehicle, which contains any Class 3, Class 2, Class 8, Division 6.1, or Class 7 material, must be secured against movement within the vehicle on which it is being transported, under conditions normally incident to transportation."

<P>

There are two important points to consider. The first is that the regulation is performance-oriented and does not include any direction as to how this requirement is to be carried out; it is left to the shipper to determine the most appropriate and effective means of accomplishing the requirement.

<P>
 
The second point to consider concerns what is meant by "conditions normally incident to transportation." These include, among others, the number of handlings encountered en route to a destination, the distance to be traveled, the nature of the material itself, and the less-than-truckload (LTL) environment in general. 

<P>

Notice also that not all classes of hazardous materials are covered by the  standard at &#167;177.834. Part 177 contains separate sections for the care and protection of Classes 1, 4, and 5 materials in sections 835 and 838. 

<P>

Many shippers struggle with this requirement because of past practices or their belief that it is the carrier's responsibility to brace the shipment. Keep in mind that in addition to proper hazardous material loading, the successful transportation of hazardous materials without incident from origin to destination also requires compliance with many DOT regulations, including communication and documentation requirements.

<P>

For guidance in the loading of hazardous materials attend Environmental Resource Center's Hazardous Materials Handling Certification seminar, or refer to Pamphlet 6-C "Approved Methods for Loading and Restraining Shipments of Hazardous Materials for Trailer/Container on Flat Car (TOFC - COFC) Movements, including less than Trailer/Container Loads and Mixed Loads," available from the Bureau of Explosives (BOE), Association of American Railroads, 50 F Street, NW, Washington, DC 20001.

In late 1994, John Brooks joined the Chaparral Boats team as Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) Manager and took on the task of ensuring that Chaparral's commitment to excellence was reflected in its compliance with local, state and federal environmental regulations.

<P>

As a retired Naval Aviation Maintenance Officer, Brooks appreciated the effectiveness of technology-based management systems and attention to detail. He attended seminars on Hazardous Waste Management, SARA Title III and Community Right to Know and Practical Pollution Prevention conducted by Environmental Resource Center. At the seminars, he received comprehensive instruction on the regulations covering hazardous waste and EPCRA, and gained valuable insight into how those regulations affected operations at Chapparal.

<P>

Environmental Resource Center consultant, <A HREF="EMPL.HTM#Mike">Mike Randall</A>, told Brooks about the information management software program, MIRS, a suite of modular computer programs designed to satisfy environmental data management requirements. Impressed with the answers to his questions about MIRS, Brooks sent for the demo disk. The base MIRS, MSDS+, Inventory and Form R modules seemed to be what Chaparral needed.

<P>

The first objective was to develop a chemical product database. MIRS allowed the rapid development of a comprehensive chemical database, complete with storage/usage locations, storage codes, annual usage, and maximum and daily average quantities on hand. Transferring the chemical database to the MSDS+ module (which took less than two minutes, start to finish), Brooks then entered Chaparral's employees into the MSDS+ personnel files, using the same chemical storage codes as work station codes. This allowed the generation of correlated lists of employees and the chemicals with which they worked. The module's training documentation feature makes it a solid foundation for the company's Hazard Communication Program.

<P>

The next step was to transfer the same chemical inventory data to the SARA module, another quick, painless process thanks to MIRS' modular nature. "I used our production supervisor's estimates of average chemical usage, and historical purchasing records to set my initial yearly usage and initial on-hand quantities," stated Brooks. "That's close enough for filing Tier I and Tier II reports, but with a year's actual data in the Inventory module, we won't have to settle for "close enough," and we won't have to cross reference against purchasing's records."

<P>

The base MIRS module uses the material inventory, which lists each product's chemical composition by weight percentage, and "talks" to the Inventory module, which tracks product inventory and usage. The SARA and Form R modules contain reportable chemical databases; they "talk" to the base module and Inventory module, and compare the material inventory to the appropriate lists to identify potentially reportable chemicals. Brooks likes the modular nature of the system saying that it allows a "phased" implementation as resources, priority and management strategy dictate, "Because each module merges seamlessly with the others," says Brooks, "you don't get any useless redundancy, you can use everything you pay for."

<P>

Potential expansion of the system will involve assessment of the multi-user option to allow coordinated MSDS access and material/training management at the using plant level, as well as evaluating the AIR and Permit modules for suitability in the Title V permit compliance certification process. He expects the ready availability of statistical usage data to greatly aid the development of the company's Title V Air Permit application and provide real-time visibility and forecasting of their compliance posture. "We will be able to extrapolate the effects of proposed process and material changes on the conditions of our permit," stated Brooks, who envisions also using MIRS as a major building block in the company's coming ISO 14000 certification program.

<P>

Environmental Resource can solve your compliance needs, too. For more information on seminars, MIRS, or other compliance products and services, call 800-537-2372.

AGENCY: Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

<P>

<B>ACTION:</B> Final rule.

<P>

<B>SUMMARY:</B> The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is promulgating

the list of regulated substances and thresholds required under

section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act as amended. The list is composed

of three categories: a list of 77 toxic substances, a list of

63 flammable substances, and explosive substances with a mass

explosion hazard as listed by the United States Department of

Transportation (DOT). Threshold quantities are established for

toxic substances ranging from 500 to 20,000 pounds. For all listed

flammable substances the threshold quantity is established at

10,000 pounds. For explosive substances the threshold quantity

is established at 5,000 pounds. The list and threshold quantities

will identify facilities subject to chemical accident prevention

regulations promulgated under section 112(r) of the Clean Air

Act as amended; a proposed regulation for such requirements has

been published in the Federal Register on October 20, 1993, entitled

<I>Risk Management Programs for Chemical Accidental Release Prevention</I>.

EPA is also promulgating in this regulation the requirements for

the petition process for additions to, or deletions from, the

list of regulated substances. EPA is deferring action on a proposed

exemption from regulation for listed flammable substances when

used solely for facility consumption as fuel. For a document relating

to the proposed exemption, see a supplemental notice published

elsewhere in this issue.

<P>

<B>DOCKET:</B> Supporting information used in developing both

the proposed and the final rule is contained in Docket No. A-91-74.

The docket is available for public inspection and copying from

8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, at the EPA's Air

Docket Section, Waterside Mall, Room M 1500, U.S. Environmental

Protection Agency, 401 M Street, S.W., Washington D.C. 20460.

<P>

<I>A. Statutory Authority</I>

<P>

This final rule is being issued under sections 112(r) and 301

of the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) as amended (42 U.S.C. 7412(r),

7601).

<P>

<I>B. Background</I>

<P>

Public awareness of the potential danger from accidental releases

of hazardous chemicals has increased over the years as serious

chemical accidents have occurred around the world (e.g., the 1974

explosion in Flixborough, England, and the 1976 release of dioxin

in Seveso, Italy). Public concern intensified following the 1984

release of methyl isocyanate in Bhopal, India, which killed more

than 2,000 people living near the facility. A subsequent release

from a chemical facility in Institute, West Virginia, sent more

than 100 people to the hospital and made Americans aware that

such accidents can and do happen in the United States.

<P>

In response to this public concern and the hazards that exist,

the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) began its Chemical

Emergency Preparedness Program (CEPP) in 1985, as part of the

Agency's Air Toxics Strategy. CEPP was a voluntary program to

encourage state and local authorities to identify hazards in their

areas and to plan for chemical emergency response actions. In

1986, Congress adopted many of the elements of CEPP in the Emergency

Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (EPCRA), also

known as Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization

Act of 1986 (SARA Title III). EPCRA requires states to establish

state and local emergency planning groups, namely the State Emergency

Response Commissions (SERCs) and the Local Emergency Planning

Committees (LEPCs), to develop emergency response plans for each

community. EPCRA requires facilities to provide information on

the hazardous chemicals they have on-site; the information collected

is available to the public through the SERC/LEPC structure. This

information forms the foundation of both the emergency response

plans and the public-industry dialogue on risks and risk reduction.

<P>

Congress required EPA, under EPCRA (SARA Title III) section 305(b),

to conduct a review of emergency systems to monitor, detect, and

prevent chemical accidents. The final report to Congress, <I>Review

of Emergency Systems</I> (EPA, 1988), concluded that the prevention

of accidental releases requires an integrated approach that considers

technologies, operations, and management practices. The report

emphasized the importance of management commitment to safety.

<P>

In 1986, EPA established a chemical accident prevention program

to collect information on chemical accidents and work with other

groups to increase knowledge of prevention practices and encourage

industry to improve safety at facilities. Under this program,

EPA developed its Accidental Release Information Program (ARIP)

to collect data on the causes of chemical accidents and the steps

facilities take to prevent recurrences. EPA also developed a program

for conducting chemical safety audits at facilities. Through the

audit program, EPA headquarters and regional staff, as well as

state and local officials, learned about integrated approaches

to process safety from facilities. EPA has also worked with trade

associations, professional organizations, labor, environmental

groups, and other Federal agencies to determine how best to reach

smaller operations, which the section 305(b) study indicated are

less aware of risks than larger facilities. EPA has also been

an active participant in international efforts related to chemical

accident prevention, particularly through the Organisation for

Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which has held five

international workshops from 1989 through 1991 to discuss issues

related to accident prevention, preparedness, and response, and

has developed guidelines for member countries.

<P>

In addition to EPA's work in this area, other agencies and states

have developed programs related to chemical accident prevention.

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) promulgated

a final rule on chemical process safety management amending 29

CFR 1910.109 and adding 29 CFR 1910.119 (57 FR 6356, February

24, 1992) as required under section 304 of the Clean Air Act Amendments

of 1990 (CAA Amendments). Four states -- New Jersey, California,

Delaware, and Nevada -- have operational risk management programs.

Additional states have begun to address accidental release prevention

as part of their air toxics program development.

<P>

Professional and trade organizations have also developed programs

in this area. For example, the Center for Chemical Process Safety

of the American Institute of Chemical Engineers has published

guidance on the management of chemical process safety. The Chemical

Manufacturers' Association has adopted a Responsible CareTM program,

which all members must comply with to maintain membership. The

American Petroleum Institute has developed a similar program,

Management of Process Hazards; Recommended Practice 750 (RP 750),

for its members. In 1982, the European Community adopted the Seveso

Directive (82/501/EEC, as amended), which requires facilities

handling certain chemicals to develop a safety report that is

similar to a risk management plan.

<P>

<B>II. Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 </B>

<P>

<I>A. Prevention of Accidental Releases</I>

<P>

In the CAA Amendments, signed into law on November 15, 1990, Congress

added subsection (r) to CAA section 112 for the prevention of

chemical accidents. The goals of the chemical accident prevention

provisions are to focus on chemicals that pose a significant hazard

to the community should an accident occur, to prevent their accidental

release and to minimize the consequences of such releases. 

<P>

Section 112(r) of the CAA has a number of provisions. Under section

112(r) owners and operators of stationary sources who produce,

process, handle, or store substances listed under section 112(r)(3)

or any other extremely hazardous substances have a general duty

to initiate specific activities to prevent and mitigate accidental

releases. The general duty requirements apply to stationary sources

regardless of the quantity of substances managed at the facility.

Activities such as identifying hazards which may result from accidental

releases using appropriate hazard assessment techniques; designing,

maintaining and operating a safe facility; and minimizing the

consequences of accidental releases if they occur would be essential

activities to be taken as necessary to satisfy the general duty

requirements. As a matter of business practice, owners and operators

of these stationary sources have a duty to conduct these activities

under section 112(r) in the same manner and to the same extent

as an employer's duties under OSHA's general duty clause in section

654 of Title 29 of the United States Code.

<P>

Section 112(r)(3) of the CAA requires EPA to promulgate an initial

list of at least 100 substances (&quot;regulated substances&quot;)

that are known to cause, or may be reasonably anticipated to cause,

death, injury, or serious adverse effects to human health or the

environment if accidentally released. EPA is required to set threshold

quantities for each listed substance. Under CAA section 112(r)(7),

the Act requires EPA to promulgate reasonable regulations and

appropriate guidance to provide for the prevention and detection

of accidental releases and for responses to such releases. The

accident prevention regulations will apply to stationary sources

that have present more than a threshold quantity of a regulated

substance. These regulations shall address, as appropriate, the

use, operation, repair, and maintenance of equipment to monitor,

detect, inspect, and control releases, including training of personnel

in the use and maintenance of equipment or in the conduct of periodic

inspections. The regulations shall include requirements for the

development and submission of Risk Management Plans (RMPs) by

regulated sources. The RMP shall include a hazard assessment,

a prevention program, and an emergency response program. The proposed

rule for accident prevention, <I>Risk Management Programs for

Chemical Accidental Release Prevention</I>, was published on October

20, 1993 (58 FR 54190).

<P>

The Act establishes a Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation

Board to investigate (or cause to be investigated) chemical accidents

at facilities and recommend to Congress, Federal, state, local

authorities, and the public actions that can be taken to improve

chemical safety. Under the Act, EPA is authorized to conduct studies

related to accidental releases, including research on hazard assessments,

hydrogen fluoride, and air dispersion modeling. A report to Congress

on hydrogen fluoride was completed and published by the Agency

in September 1993, entitled <I>Hydrogen Fluoride Study, Report

to Congress, Section 112(n)(6) of the Clean Air Act as Amended</I>.

<P>

The Clean Air Act also addressed the approval of state programs

and delegation of Federal authorities for all section 112 requirements

in section 112(l). Thus, state Accidental Release Prevention programs

are approved through the authorities in section 112(l). The approval

provisions of section 112(l)(5) include a determination that:

a state program contains the authorities to assure compliance

by all sources within the state with each applicable standard,

regulation, or requirement; adequate resources are available to

implement the program; an expeditious implementation schedule

is in place to ensure that affected sources achieve compliance;

and the state program is otherwise in compliance with the objectives

of the Act and guidance published under section 112(l)(2).

<P>

The Agency promulgated a final rule in November 1993 which addresses

the approval requirements of section 112(l) entitled <I>Approval

of State Programs and Delegation of Federal Authorities</I>. These

requirements can be found in 40 CFR Part 63 - Subpart E. Section

63.95 specifically address the required components of an accidental

release prevention program. The Agency is currently working on

developing further guidance to states in regard to the development

of an accidental release prevention program.

<P>

Under section 304 of the CAA Amendments OSHA was required to promulgate

a chemical process safety management standard to protect employees

from hazards associated with accidental releases of highly hazardous

chemicals in the workplace. OSHA promulgated a final rule amending

29 CFR 1910.109 and adding 29 CFR 1910.119 (57 FR 6356, February

24, 1992) that requires a chemical process safety management (PSM)

program for any process involving a highly hazardous chemical

at or above a specified threshold quantity. The rule applies to

a list of highly hazardous toxic and reactive substances at particular

threshold quantities, flammable liquids or flammable gases in

quantities of 10,000 pounds or more and to the manufacture of

explosives and pyrotechnics.

<P>

<I>B. List of Substances and Thresholds; Petitions for Additions

and Deletions</I>

<P>

1. Legislative Requirements

<P>

The Act requires EPA to promulgate an initial list of at least

100 substances that, in the event of an accidental release, are

known to cause or may reasonably be anticipated to cause death,

injury, or serious adverse effects to human health or the environment.

An accidental release is defined under CAA section 112(r)(2)(A)

as &quot;an unanticipated emission...into the ambient air from

a stationary source.&quot; In developing this list, EPA was required

to consider, but was not limited to, the list of extremely hazardous

substances (EHSs) promulgated under EPCRA (SARA Title III) section

302.

standard has been established may be included on the list, with

the exception of anhydrous sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide,

which must be included. No substances regulated under Title VI

of the Act as amended may be included on the list. Title VI covers

ozone depleters, primarily chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons.

The Act requires EPA to review, and if necessary revise, the list

of regulated substances under section 112(r) at least every five

years. EPA may also review and if necessary revise the list as

a result of petitions. EPA is required to develop procedures for

petitions to the Agency for the addition of substances to, and

deletion of substances from, the list; these petition procedures

are to be consistent with those applicable to the list of hazardous

air pollutants found in CAA Amendments section 112(b).

<P>

2. Summary of Proposed Rule

<P>

On January 19, 1993 (58 FR 5102), EPA proposed a list of 100 toxic

substances and threshold quantities, a list of 62 flammable substances

(gases and volatile liquids) with threshold quantities of 10,000

pounds, and commercial explosives defined by the Department of

Transportation (DOT) as Division 1.1 (explosives with mass explosion

hazard) with a threshold quantity of 5,000 pounds. EPA also proposed

requirements for a petition process to add or delete chemicals

from the list.

<P>

Toxic substances were included on the list based on their toxicity,

physical state, vapor pressure, production volume, and accident

history. Toxicity criteria used to identify chemicals as extremely

hazardous substances (EHSs) under EPCRA were used as criteria

for the proposed list. The acute toxicity criteria are: (a) Inhalation

LC50 0.5 milligrams per liter of air (for exposure time 8 hours),

or

<P>

(b) Dermal LD50 50 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, or

<P>

(c) Oral LD50 25 milligrams per kilogram of body weight

<P>

where LC50 is the median concentration in air at which 50 percent

of the test animals died, and LD50 is the median lethal dose that

killed 50 percent of the test animals. In the absence of LC50

or LD50 data, LCLo or LDLo data were used for listing, where LCLo

is the lethal concentration low, or lowest concentration in air

at which any of the test animals died, and LDLo is the lethal

dose low, or the lowest concentration at which any of the test

animals died. Additional substances on the EHS list meet the secondary

EHS toxicity criteria in light of production volume (see Appendix

B of EPA's <U>Technical Guidance for Hazards Analysis</U>, December

1987, which is in the docket for this rulemaking). A vapor pressure

criterion of 0.5 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) was used as a

baseline, based on the vapor pressure of toluene diisocyanate,

a substance mandated for the initial list by Congress; toxic gases

and liquids with a vapor pressure of 0.5 mm Hg or higher under

ambient conditions were considered for listing. Only toxic chemicals

in commercial production, verified through EPA's Toxic Substances

Control Act (TSCA) Chemical Inventory, were included on the list.

By applying these criteria to the 360 chemicals on the EPCRA EHS

list, the Agency identified 87 potential regulated substances

for the CAA Amendments section 112(r) list. The Agency also looked

at other data sources (including the OSHA highly hazardous chemical

list) to identify 9 more substances for the section 112(r) list.

Four additional substances were identified for listing based on

a combination of toxicity, high production volume, and history

of accidents involving death or injury. Threshold quantities were

set for toxic substances based on a ranking method that considers

toxicity and volatility of the chemicals. EPA assigned identical

thresholds to chemicals with similar ranking scores, ranging from

500 pounds to 10,000 pounds.

<P>

Flammable gases and volatile flammable liquids were included on

the list based on the flash point and boiling point criteria used

by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) for its highest

flammability hazard ranking (flash point below 73oF (22.8oC) and

boiling point below 100oF (37.8oC)) (<I>Fire Protection Guide

on Hazardous Materials</I>, 1984, 8th edition). Only flammable

substances in commercial production were listed. The threshold

quantity for flammable substances was set at 10,000 pounds, based

on the potential for a vapor cloud explosion.

<P>

Explosives in Division 1.1 were proposed for listing based on

their potential to detonate. The threshold quantity for explosives

was set at 5,000 pounds because a detonation of this quantity

could yield blast wave overpressures of 3.0 pounds per square

inch (psi) at a distance of 100 meters from the blast site and

could have potentially lethal effects in the community beyond

the fenceline.

<P>

EPA proposed to apply the threshold quantity to the maximum total

quantity of a substance in a process. This definition would apply

to the maximum total quantity, at any one time, in a single vessel,

in a group of interconnected vessels or in several vessels that

could potentially be involved at one time in an accidental release.

Substances in mixtures would be exempted from the threshold determination

if they represent less than one percent of the mixture by weight.

EPA also proposed to exempt substances if (1) they are part of

articles; (2) if they are used as structural components; (3) if

they are used for janitorial maintenance; or (4) if they are found

in consumer products, process water, or in water or air from the

environment or municipal sources. Activities in laboratories were

also proposed for exemption. In addition, an exemption was proposed

for flammable substances present at a facility to be used solely

for consumption as fuel at the facility.

<P>

The Agency also proposed requirements for petitions to add or

delete regulated substances under section 112(r). The Agency proposed

to establish that the burden of proof be on the petitioner to

demonstrate that the criteria for addition and deletion are met.

Basic administrative and documentation requirements for petitions

were also included in the proposal.

<P>

<B>III. Public Participation</B>

<P>

A hearing was held on the proposed rule in the EPA Auditorium,

401 M Street, S.W., Washington D.C., on Tuesday, April 12, 1993.

The hearing was held to provide interested parties the opportunity

for oral presentation of data, views, or arguments concerning

the proposed rule. This hearing was open to the public; a transcript

of the public hearing is available in the docket. A total of 272

letters were received during the public comment period on the

proposed rule (an additional 18 were received after the close

of the public comment period); copies of all comment letters received

are available for public inspection in the docket. A response

to comments document, entitled <I>Proposed List of Substances

and Thresholds for Accidental Release Prevention: Summary and

Response to Comments</I>, includes a summary of comments received

and the Agency's responses; the document is available in the docket.

<P>

<B>IV. Discussion of Comments and Major Regulatory Changes</B>

<P>

This portion of the preamble discusses comments on major issues

received on the proposed list and thresholds rule and the principal

regulatory changes made in the final rule in response to public

comments. Included in the discussion is the rationale for these

changes and the Agency action on the comments. Where the proposed

regulation has not been changed in the final rule, the Agency

continues to rely on the rationale provided in the proposal notice,

supplemented as appropriate by additional discussion in this preamble

and in the response to comments document.

<P>

<I>A. List of Substances and Thresholds</I>

<P>

The list of substances and thresholds promulgated today identifies

sources that are subject to accident prevention regulations promulgated

under section 112(r)(7) of the Act. The list of substances is

intended to focus accidental release prevention efforts on those

stationary sources and substances that pose the most significant

risks to the community. These risks may be established either

by the potential of the chemical to cause harm (the inherent hazards

and physical/chemical properties), known incidents (accident history),

or a combination thereof. EPA strongly emphasizes that the substances

promulgated in today's listing are not the only substances that

may pose a threat to communities upon release. There are large

numbers of compounds and mixtures in commerce in the U.S. that

in specific circumstances could be considered dangerous to human

health or the environment; however, it would not be feasible to

include all such substances and circumstances. This list should

serve to focus prevention efforts and is not a list of all substances

that could be considered for accident prevention. Similarly, the

threshold quantities established today may not always represent

a level below which no hazard exists. Although stationary sources

will be required to comply with the accidental release prevention

regulations under section 112(r)(7)(B) only if they have listed

substances in quantities exceeding the threshold quantity, it

does not mean that these substances in smaller quantities represent

no potential hazard to the community in certain circumstances.

In support of this principle Congress included general duty provisions

under section 112(r)(1) of the Act.

<P>

Several commenters objected to the listing of classes of substances

such as explosives or particular substances such as various flammable

natural gases because these commenters claimed that categorizing

these chemicals as regulated substances would also make these

chemicals subject to the general duty clause of section 112(r)(1),

and that without such listing these chemicals would be outside

the scope of section 112(r)(1). The general duty provision in

section 112(r)(1) applies to &quot;any substance listed pursuant

to section 112(r)(3) or any other extremely hazardous substance.&quot;

The Agency believes the scope of substances covered by section

112(r)(1) is not affected by this rulemaking except that by including

a substance on the regulated substance list, the Agency unambiguously

specifies that the general duty provisions apply to such chemicals.

The plain language of section 112(r)(1) applies not only to the

regulated substances listed today but also to &quot;any other

extremely hazardous substance.&quot;

<P>

In discussing nearly identical language in the Senate's Clean

Air Act Amendments bill of 1989, the Environment and Public Works

Committee expressed the intent that the term &quot;extremely hazardous

substance&quot; would include not only listed substances under

the accident prevention provisions and extremely hazardous substances

under EPCRA (SARA Title III) section 302 but also &quot;other

agents which may or may not be listed or otherwise identified

by any Government agency which may as the result of short-term

exposures associated with releases to the air cause death, injury

or property damage&quot; (Senate Committee on Environment and

Public Works, Clean Air Act Amendments of 1989, Senate Report

No. 228, 101st Congress, 1st Session 211 (1989) - &quot;Senate

Report&quot;). Regardless of whether a substance is listed under

today's rule, the general duty to identify and assess hazards

associated with accidental releases (as defined in section 112(r)(2)),

to design and maintain a facility to prevent such releases, and

to minimize the consequences of such releases that do occur, extends

to owners and operators of any facility that may cause such impacts

due to short-term exposures. As the Senate makes clear, &quot;the

release of any substance which causes death or serious injury

because of its acute toxic effect or as a result of an explosion

or fire or which causes substantial property damage by blast,

fire, corrosion or other reaction would create a presumption that

such substance is extremely hazardous.&quot; Senate Report at

211. No revision to the list promulgated today negates the applicability

of the general duty provisions.

<P>

1. Toxic Substances

<P>

<I>a. Listing Criteria</I>

<P>

Several commenters suggested that EPA modify its listing criteria,

largely so that EPA's list would be more consistent with OSHA's

list of Highly Hazardous Substances for its Process Safety Management

Standard, but also because commenters believed EPA's list includes

some chemicals that do not pose the greatest hazards to the public.

Some commenters suggested the proposed 0.5 mm Hg vapor pressure

cut off was too low. Others suggested an alternative method of

choosing the list of toxics, namely the &quot;Substance Hazard

Index&quot;. Several commenters also objected to EPA's use of

accident history as a criterion for listing substances. EPA's

proposed toxics list was based on the EHS list under SARA Title

III, with additional consideration of the vapor pressures and

accident histories for each substance. The proposed list included

50 toxic substances that are not listed by OSHA.

<P>

<I>Substance Hazard Index:</I> Some commenters suggested replacing

EPA's proposed listing criteria with another method labeled the

&quot;Substance Hazard Index&quot; (SHI). The SHI is the ratio

of a substance's vapor pressure to its acute toxicity; all substances

would be ranked by their SHI and a cut-off would need to be selected

to determine the substances to be listed. An SHI value of 1,000

was suggested by commenters as a cut-off, but commenters did not

provide a technical basis, or any other rationale, for why this

cut-off was selected. The SHI value of 1,000 would derive a list

of toxic substances that more closely approximates OSHA's PSM

list than EPA's proposed list; provided that the Agency considers

only those substances initially proposed for listing as toxics.

<P>

EPA generally disagrees with the comments concerning the use of

the SHI as a listing criterion. The Agency had considered this

approach during the proposed rule development, but decided not

to include it as an alternate listing methodology option. EPA

instead considered toxicity and vapor pressure separately in identifying

chemicals for listing; the SHI combines these factors. EPA believes

that using separate toxicity and vapor pressure criteria is a

more valid method of identifying chemical candidates for listing.

Both EPA's method and the SHI approach consider properties related

to the severity of acute health effects (toxicity) and the likelihood

of accidental releases of the substances (volatility), as required

by the Act. However, as required by the Act, EPA's approach is

based on the list of EHSs as a starting point for identification

of toxic substances (see Senate Report at 218; listing factors

used in EHS list are appropriate for accidental release program).

EPA's approach limits toxic chemicals to those meeting the acute

toxicity criteria for the EHS list and then applies a vapor pressure

cut-off. The SHI approach does not include specific toxicity or

vapor pressure cut-offs but instead specifies a cut-off value

for a factor combining toxicity and vapor pressure. To identify

all chemicals meeting the specific SHI cut-off of 1,000 as recommended

by commenters, chemicals with a much wider range of toxicity than

those represented by the EHSs would have to be considered. Chemicals

that are far less toxic than the EHSs would be potentially included,

improperly characterizing the risk associated with them. Moreover,

EPA does not believe the SHI method has been systematically applied

to all substances for development of any current chemical list.

The state of Delaware used the SHI approach to develop a list

of substances for its risk management regulation; the SHI methodology

was applied to existing lists of substances identified by use

of toxicity criteria and not all substances. The Agency considers

the SHI to be more appropriate for determining the relative ranking

of substances in an already established list. The Agency's threshold

quantity methodology for listed toxics is similar on the toxicity/volatility

ranking principle; it differs from the SHI in that the vapor pressure

is only part of the factor used to account for the potential dispersability

of the listed substances. For these reasons, the Agency will not

adopt the SHI criteria for listing toxic substances.

<P>

<I>Acute Toxicity Criteria:</I> Commenters generally supported

EPA's consideration of acute toxicity hazards as a basis for listing

toxic substances under section 112(r). Some commenters, however,

recommended other measures of toxicity, such as the Emergency

Response Planning Guidelines (ERPGs) developed by the American

Industrial Hygiene Association, or data developed by the National

Academy of Sciences among others. The Agency recognizes the value

of these other measures and guidelines for purposes of emergency

preparedness and prevention activities. However, these measures

are consensus exposure levels judged by the developing organizations

to represent concentrations above which there may be serious irreversible

health effects, or death, as a result of a single exposure for

a relatively short period of time. In addition, the methodology

for most of these measures is still in the developmental stages,

with recommended guidelines or acute exposure levels presently

available only for a limited number of potentially hazardous substances.

The Agency believes using acute toxicity data as proposed is more

appropriate for the review and selection of hazardous substances

for listing under section 112(r) because acute toxicity data directly

reflects results of valid mammalian testing and thus is more objectively

verifiable than judgmental standards.

<P>

Concerns were also expressed about the Agency's focus on acute

toxicity rather than on chronic toxicity effects as a basis for

listing. Some commenters also opposed the Agency's consideration

of acute exposures by the dermal and oral routes. EPA believes

that chemical accident prevention efforts should focus on those

chemicals that, because of their inherent toxicity, are most likely

to cause immediate severe, irreversible health effects following

exposures during an accidental release. Consequently, for purposes

of this rulemaking, the Agency is primarily interested in substances

that are acutely toxic, rather than in substances that could generate

a future health effect after repeated long term or chronic exposures.

Furthermore, acute toxicity and lethality data are often readily

available and the most commonly reported information generated

by animal toxicity testing. A greater number of potentially hazardous

substances can therefore be screened on the same basis using these

values. For purposes of this rule, the listed toxic substances

are expected to rapidly become airborne, thus human exposure by

the inhalation route is of primary concern. The Agency believes

that using data on oral and dermal acute lethality, in addition

to inhalation lethality, is appropriate for this listing.

<P>

<I>Vapor Pressure Cut-off:</I> Other commenters suggested that

EPA should use a higher vapor pressure level as a listing criterion.

EPA's vapor pressure criterion of 0.5 mm Hg was based on the properties

of toluene diisocyanate, a substance with relatively low volatility,

which was mandated for the initial list by Congress. Commenters

noted that Congress listed toluene diisocyanate because it has

been involved in accidents, not because of its properties, and

that its properties do not necessarily provide a valid basis for

EPA's vapor pressure criterion. Several commenters suggested a

vapor pressure of 20 mm Hg (18 mm Hg is the approximate vapor

pressure of water) but did not provide a basis for choosing this

or any other vapor pressure criterion.

<P>

EPA has considered the comments concerning the proposed vapor

pressure criterion of 0.5 mm Hg and generally agrees that this

low vapor pressure level may lead to an overly conservative listing

of chemicals that pose a relatively lower potential for air releases.

EPA has decided to set the vapor pressure criterion at the higher

level of 10 mm Hg. In selecting this new vapor pressure cut-off,

the Agency examined the substances on the proposed list that have

vapor pressures of less than 10 mm Hg and compared the rate of

volatilization expected in a large release to the rate expected

for substances with a vapor pressure greater than 10 mm Hg. As

expected, volatilization rates increase with increasing vapor

pressure and increasing pool sizes. The Agency believes that a

timely facility response after the onset of an accidental release

will likely limit the amount that could volatilize for substances

with vapor pressures lower than 10 mm Hg, thereby reducing the

potential public or off-site impact. The Agency believes that

a greater amount of substances with vapor pressures above 10 mm

Hg is likely to be volatilized and released, even after a timely

facility response occurs, potentially causing off-site impacts.

The Agency also reviewed accident history and production volume

information on the substances that would be delisted at this vapor

pressure. This review has led the Agency to conclude that the

accident histories or production volumes associated with the delisted

substances do not warrant their listing under this rulemaking

at this time. The Agency believes that this revised vapor pressure

criterion focuses the list on chemicals that present a greater

potential for accidental release than would a list using a 0.5

mm Hg criterion.

<P>

The new vapor pressure criterion will drop from the list some

chemicals that may have a lower likelihood of accidental release

to air. Using the new vapor pressure criterion, the following

18 chemicals proposed for listing (shown with their CAS Registry

numbers) will not be included in the list promulgated today:

<P>

Acetone cyanohydrin (75-86-5)

<P>

Aniline (62-53-3)

<P>

Antimony pentafluoride (7783-70-2)

<P>

Benzal chloride (98-87-3)

<P>

Benzenamine, 3-(trifluoromethyl)- (98-16-8)

<P>

Benzotrichloride (98-07-7)

<P>

Benzyl chloride (100-44-7)

<P>

Benzyl cyanide (140-29-4)

<P>

Chloroethanol (107-07-3)

<P>

Dichloroethyl ether (111-44-4)

<P>

Dimethyl phosphorochloridothioate (2524-03-0)

<P>

Formaldehyde cyanohydrin (107-16-4)

<P>

Hydrogen peroxide (concentration &gt; 52%) (7722-84-1)

<P>

Lactonitrile (78-97-7)

<P>

Pyridine, 2-methyl-5-vinyl- (140-76-1)

<P>

Thiophenol (108-98-5)

<P>

Trans-1,4-dichlorobutene (110-57-6)

<P>

Trichloroethylsilane (115-21-9)

<P>

EPA will be reevaluating the list periodically and as a result

of petitions. If additional information is submitted on the accident

history or production volume of these substances, EPA may list

these substances at a later time. In addition, these substances,

as well as any other extremely hazardous substance, are subject

to the section 112(r) general duty clause.

<P>

<I>Accident History:</I> The Agency disagrees with several commenters

who claimed that the Agency lacked authority to list substances

based on accident history. The accident history associated with

the use of a substance, in combination with toxicity, physical/chemical

properties, and production volume considerations, is a permissible

basis for the Administrator to list substances under section 112(r).

Data from recorded accidents relate to each of the factors identified

in section 112(r)(4). Such data can provide information on the

severity of impacts when impacts occur, as well as on the likelihood

and magnitude of exposure. Substances that &quot;are known to

cause ... death, injury, or serious adverse effects on human health

or the environment&quot; may be included on the list under section

112(r)(3). It would be a strained reading of the statute to say

the Administrator must ignore documented accidental releases of

substances in deciding which chemicals shall be the focus of the

accidental release prevention program.

<P>

The listing criteria established for toxic substances considers

not only acute toxicity, but also physical/chemical properties

(physical state, vapor pressure), and accident history. Several

commenters argued that in analyzing accident histories EPA should

not consider: (1) transportation accidents; (2) accidents not

involving death and/or injuries; (3) accidents involving fires

and explosions; (4) accidents involving reactions with other chemicals;

and (5) accidents involving elevated temperatures and pressures.

The Agency disagrees with these comments. Accident history may

indicate, beyond vapor pressure or other physical/chemical properties,

unique qualities or circumstances that warrant accident prevention

efforts. Evidence from transportation accidents may indicate the

potential for airborne releases. For example, chemicals may be

supplied in containers, such as tank cars, holding the chemical

in similar conditions to storage conditions at stationary source.

A failure of a container while in transit may indicate the potential

for release while at a fixed location, since it may be stored

under similar conditions. Quantities of chemicals are also commonly

held at facilities for some period of time in trucks, tank cars,

and other shipping containers. Accidents that did not result in

off-site deaths or injuries may still indicate the serious potential

for off-site impacts; e.g., evacuations may indicate that there

was concern that people could suffer adverse effects from exposure.

Furthermore, other effects, such as environmental damage, are

appropriate to consider as well. While the factors to be considered

under section 112(r)(4) do not specifically direct EPA to consider

environmental effects, section 112(r)(3) directs the Administrator

to consider &quot;substances which pose the greatest risk of causing...serious

adverse effects to...the environment from accidental releases&quot;.

As noted at several points in this preamble, EPA believes that

its decision to consider reported accidental releases involving

fire and explosions as events of concern is supported by both

the statute and legislative history. See also 136 Congressional

Record S16992 (daily ed., Oct. 27, 1990) (statement of Senator

Reid addressing the explosion in Henderson, Nevada); 136 Congressional

Record H12931 (daily ed., Oct. 26, 1990) (statement of Representative

Barton addressing releases from burning material); H.R. Conf.

Rep. No. 952, 101st Congress, 2nd sess., 340 (1990) (Board to

investigate fires and explosions). It may also be appropriate

to consider chemical reactions with common materials such as water;

e.g., it may be important to consider whether the reaction of

an acid with water, producing heat, could lead to formation of

an acid vapor or mist (the Bhopal accident involved a reaction

of methyl isocyanate with water, generating heat). Accidents resulting

from conditions of elevated temperatures and pressures in chemical

processes may provide important information regarding the potential

for accidental releases having an effect off-site.

<P>

The legislative history of section 112(r) contains extensive discussion

of historical accidents and accident history data to support the

need for enacting section 112(r) and the particular provisions

included in the legislation. See 136 Congressional Record H12940

(daily ed., Oct. 26, 1990) (statement of Representative Richardson);

136 Congressional Record S16921, S16925 - 26 (daily ed., Oct.

27, 1990) (statement of Senator Durenberger); 136 Congressional

Record S16979 (daily ed., Oct. 27, 1990) (statement of Senator

Baucus). Incidents such as the explosion in Henderson, Nevada

and the releases documented in the Acute Hazardous Events database,

as well as statistics concerning the number of releases and evacuations

were seen as demonstrating the need for an accident prevention

program. See H.R. Rep. No. 490, 101st Congress, 2nd sess., 154

- 157 (1990); Senate Report at 211 - 221. The Agency will continue

to consider accident history, in conjunction with acute toxicity

and vapor pressure, to determine which substances need to be listed

under section 112(r), and will consider these same elements in

any revisions to the list promulgated today. When determining

whether to list a substance based on its accident history, the

Agency will analyze and explain the relevance of the accident

history to the potential for a stationary source to accidentally

release the substance.

<P>

<I>b. Specific Substances</I>. Sulfuric acid, phenol, parathion,

and nitrobenzene, proposed to be listed because of accident history,

were the focus of a number of comments. As stated above, the Agency

believes that accident history, as well as toxicity, physical/chemical

properties, and current commercial production volume, are all

appropriate elements to be considered in determining the substances

to be listed. The Agency reserves the flexibility to consider

the listed substances in light of a combination of, or all of

these criteria elements. Accident history was targeted by several

commenters as not being a valid criteria to use in listing these

substances. As discussed above, the Agency disagrees. The Agency

has listed substances that meet two or three elements of the criteria

only; e.g., there are acutely toxic substances listed that meet

the high vapor pressure considerations but have no accident history

associated with them. By the same token, the Agency also believes

that commercially produced substances that meet the acute toxicity

criterion and have an accident history, still could present a

high potential for an impact beyond the fenceline even though

they do not meet the vapor pressure consideration.

<P>

A number of commenters objected to the inclusion of sulfuric acid

on the list of substances, noting that because of its high boiling

point and low vapor pressure under ambient conditions, it is unlikely

to become airborne in a release. EPA recognizes that sulfuric

acid does not meet the vapor pressure criterion. EPA originally

proposed for listing sulfuric acid because of its toxicity, high

production volume, and because it has been involved in a number

of accidental releases with reported migration of a vapor cloud

off-site; some of these incidents also resulted in worker deaths

and injuries on-site. Several commenters indicated that the accidents

cited by EPA did not provide a valid basis for listing for a number

of reasons. First, some of the accidents, according to commenters,

actually involved fuming sulfuric acid (oleum), which is a mixture

of sulfuric acid and sulfur trioxide, and vapor clouds reported

from these accidents were attributable to sulfur trioxide rather

than sulfuric acid. Second, commenters stated that the injuries

in some accidents were caused by direct contact with sulfuric

acid rather than inhalation of vapor. Third, according to some

commenters, some accidents involved reactions of sulfuric acid

with other substances. Finally, comments were received which indicated

there have been no accidents involving vapor clouds of sulfuric

acid that caused off-site deaths or injuries, and that, in fact,

the low vapor pressure of sulfuric acid makes it impossible for

an accidental release to have any effect beyond the fenceline.

<P>

EPA is well aware that sulfuric acid has a low vapor pressure

and is unlikely to be released into the air under ambient conditions.

However, as noted above, EPA also believes that, exclusive of

vapor pressure, accident history can provide a valid basis, in

combination with toxicity and/or physical/chemical properties,

for adding a substance to the list. The Agency also notes that

nothing in the statute limits EPA to consider solely the effects

of vapor inhalation as a consequence of a release. As noted above,

the EHS toxicity criteria endorsed by the Senate are not limited

to inhalation. Furthermore, death, injuries, and environmental

impacts caused by direct contact are relevant to the risks posed

by a chemical.

<P>

While believing the EPA has the authority to list sulfuric acid

if its accident history, in conjunction with its toxicity and

significant production volume, warrants listing, the comments

received by the Agency have created doubt about the accuracy of

what has been reported as air releases of sulfuric acid. For purposes

of today's rulemaking, the Agency has been unable to determine

from accident history whether sulfuric acid has generated an air

release that has caused impact off-site. Because of the uncertainty

associated with past reported accidental release information and

the common confusion between oleum and sulfuric acid in such reporting,

the Agency has decided not to list sulfuric acid at this time.

Although sulfuric acid is not specifically listed, facilities

handling sulfuric acid are still subject to general duty requirements.

The Agency will continue to monitor and review sulfuric acid accident

reports to determine the need for listing at a future time. EPA

also seeks data on the off-site impacts of sulfuric acid that

could be used to evaluate whether sulfuric acid should be added

to the list.

<P>

Related to the sulfuric acid issue are comments suggesting that

the Agency specifically list oleum (fuming sulfuric acid), CAS

number 8014-95-7. Oleum is a mixture of sulfuric acid and sulfur

trioxide. In the proposed rule, the Agency believed oleum would

be subject to section 112(r) requirements because both of its

components, sulfuric acid and sulfur trioxide, were proposed for

listing, and because of the Agency's proposed de-minimis concentration

for mixtures. However, two commenters noted that it is &quot;reasonable

to include oleum as a regulated chemical&quot; and that &quot;oleum

and sulfuric acid must be listed separately, since the fuming

effects of an oleum release make it potentially much more serious.&quot;

The Agency agrees with commenters that oleum should be include

in this listing because of its accident history, toxicity, and

production volume. Furthermore, the Agency has reviewed the accident

history data relevant to oleum and sulfuric acid and agrees with

commenters that some of the accidents the Agency had relied on

to list sulfuric acid in fact involved oleum. Furthermore, because

of the revisions on the de-minimis concentration provisions and

the Agency's decision not to finalize the listing of sulfuric

acid at this time, oleum would no longer be subject to 112(r)

provisions without a specific listing. In order to continue the

coverage of oleum in the accidental release prevention provisions,

EPA is specifically listing all forms of oleum in the section

112(r) list of substances.

<P>

Phenol (in liquid form only), parathion, and nitrobenzene are

also included on the proposed list based on accident history.

Several commenters objected to the inclusion of these chemicals,

for reasons similar to those concerning the listing of sulfuric

acid, i.e., the low vapor pressure of these substances and the

lack of sufficient supporting accident history to provide a basis

for listing. The Agency generally agrees with the comments regarding

these three specific substances. Having considered the comments

and having conducted further review of accident history for these

chemicals, the record indicates that there are not a clearly significant

number of accident reports with effects, or potential effects,

beyond the fenceline to merit listing at this time.

<P>

Several commenters objected to the listing of other specific substances

for a variety of reasons, including low vapor pressure, low toxicity,

existing safety regulations, and accident history. The chemicals

mentioned include hydrogen peroxide, acrylonitrile, and hydrochloric

acid, among others. EPA has reviewed the comments on these chemicals

and categories of chemicals that were recommended for deletion

and has decided to, except as noted, retain them on the list of

regulated substances under section 112(r). As noted above, EPA

is revising the vapor pressure criterion and not proceeding to

list 18 chemicals with vapor pressures below 10 mm Hg. In addition,

the Agency has determined that section 112(r)(3) prohibits it

from listing methyl bromide because the substance has been listed

by regulation as an ozone depleting chemical under CAA Title VI

(see 58 <U>FR</U> 65018, December 10, 1993).

<P>

The Agency disagrees with commenters that seek deleting substances

because of other existing regulations. The listing of substances

and thresholds, as mandated by Congress, reflects the potential

for these listed substances to cause serious adverse effects to

human health or the environment. The Agency believes that considerations

of other regulations applicable to these regulated substances

are appropriately accounted for in accident prevention requirements

developed for facilities handling the regulated substances above

the threshold quantities, rather than in determining whether any

listed substance poses a potential hazard.

<P>

Several commenters recommended the deletion of substances that

were mandated for listing by Congress, including ammonia, toluene

diisocyanate, and anhydrous sulfur dioxide. The Agency believes

that the language of section 112(r)(3) precludes it from omitting

these chemicals from the initial list. The Agency will consider

petitions to delist these chemicals if such petitions comply with

the petition criteria announced today.

<P>

Several commenters recommended adding other specific substances,

such as chlordane and tetraethyl lead, to the list of regulated

substances. The Agency will consider these at the time it revises

the list promulgated today, or through the petition process. However,

the Agency notes that notwithstanding today's listing, these substances

are still subject to the general duty provisions, particularly

if they are in commercial production and use.

<P>

In the list rule proposal, EPA requested information to determine

the need and appropriateness of including radionuclides under

this rulemaking. Some commenters objected to including radionuclides

while others recommended inclusion. Still other commenters recommended

the inclusion of only some radionuclides. However, none of the

commenters provided sufficient technical information to assist

the Agency in determining whether or not radionuclides should

be listed. Due to the uncertainty associated with gaps in EPA's

data and the appropriate criteria for listing, the Agency has

decided not to include radionuclides in the initial list of regulated

substances.

<P>

<I>c. Other List Options Considered</I>. EPA considered the option

of adopting the entire list of 360 toxic chemicals regulated under

EPCRA (SARA Title III) section 302. A small number of commenters

favored this option, believing that consistency with EPCRA is

desirable, that having a single list would help avoid confusion,

and that listing additional toxic substances would be more protective

of the public. EPA did not propose to adopt the entire EHS list

because it includes a number of solids and non-volatile liquids

for which an effect beyond the fenceline in the event of an accidental

release is expected to be less likely than for gaseous or volatile

liquids. It also includes substances that are not currently in

commercial production. Congress did not direct EPA to list all

EHS substances. Instead, Congress provided that the Administrator

could include as few as 100 substances on the initial list under

section 112(r). In directing the Administrator to &quot;use&quot;

the EHS list, but not to be &quot;limited to&quot; this list,

and in providing that &quot;such modifications as ... appropriate&quot;

be made, the CAA provides the Agency with the flexibility to cull

from the EHS list and other sources a more focused list of substances

for accidental release prevention regulations. Most commenters

supported EPA's decision to propose for listing only those EHSs

that best reflect the statutory criteria of likelihood and magnitude

of release. For these reasons, EPA is not adopting the entire

EHS list.

<P>

<I>d. Threshold Quantities</I>. EPA's proposed thresholds were

lower than OSHA's for 15 of the substances listed by both OSHA

and EPA. A number of commenters stated that EPA's thresholds should

not be lower than OSHA's for any listed substances, since in general,

workers face a more immediate threat of exposure in an accidental

release than would the public. Several commenters indicated that

EPA should adopt the OSHA thresholds for chemicals which EPA had

assigned lower thresholds. Conversely, there were other comments

supporting the lower thresholds proposed by EPA for several chemicals,

based on the commenters' experience with these chemicals.

<P>

EPA has reviewed the threshold quantities for the listed substances

and the OSHA thresholds for the substances on both the EPA and

OSHA lists prior to and after the proposal of EPA's rule. EPA

recognizes the practical importance of consistency with the OSHA

list to the extent possible, but also believes it is necessary

to have a sound methodology for assignment of threshold quantities;

the CAA requires the Agency to include an explanation of the basis

for establishing the list, and to account for specified factors

in setting threshold quantities. OSHA's thresholds were not required

to reflect the factors EPA must consider. The statute also provides

for petitions to add new chemicals, and requires the development

of thresholds for such chemicals when listed. A sound methodology

is essential for making changes to the list and thresholds after

promulgation. The methodology adopted today considers the factors

required by the CAA under section 112(r)(5). No other methodology

was identified that EPA could use to derive thresholds that would

be consistent and equally applicable to the current listed substances

and to those that may be added in the future. Therefore, EPA is

not adopting the OSHA thresholds.

<P>

Nevertheless, EPA agrees with commenters that EPA should review

its proposed threshold methodology and quantity categories to

ensure that they accurately reflect the range of risks posed by

the listed toxic substances. Based on this review, EPA has decided

to retain its threshold methodology but revise the range of threshold

quantities for toxics. The minimum quantity remains at 500 pounds,

representative of drum-size containers, but the maximum threshold

quantity is raised to 20,000 pounds, replacing the proposed 10,000

pound maximum. This higher upper limit expands the range of threshold

quantities to better reflect the relative hazards among the listed

toxics; the upper limit of 20,000 represents typical handling

quantities, and would still be protective of the public for those

substances which now have the higher thresholds. Threshold quantity

categories for toxic substances are now: 500 pounds, 1,000 pounds,

2,500 pounds, 5,000 pounds, 10,000 pounds, 15,000 pounds, and

20,000 pounds.

<P>

Using this revised range, higher thresholds have been assigned

for most of the toxic substances listed based on the revised vapor

pressure criterion. Several toxic substances also meet the flammability

criteria, and thus could be assigned two thresholds. Toxic substances

that also meet the criteria for listing as flammable substances

are assigned the lower of the thresholds. Under the revised methodology,

the only substance that has a threshold quantity that is lower

under EPA than OSHA's PSM standard is methyl chloride, which meets

the criteria for listing for flammability and, therefore, is assigned

a threshold quantity of 10,000 pounds, rather than the 20,000

pounds that would apply under the methodology for toxics. The

OSHA threshold for methyl chloride is 15,000 pounds. This is to

account for those hazards presented by the substance that are

considered in this rulemaking; the lowest threshold quantity is

assigned to be more protective.

<P>

A number of commenters suggested that site-specific factors should

be considered in setting or modifying thresholds, such as population

density, ecosystem sensitivity, safety devices, experience, uses

of the substance, and handling conditions. EPA recognizes that

these and many other site-specific factors could affect the likelihood

of occurrence or the effects of a release. Accounting for these

factors has the advantage of more specifically tailoring threshold

quantities based on common use patterns of the substances and

on the particular site in which they would be used. One serious

disadvantage of applying site-specific factors to setting thresholds

would be that such an approach would be inappropriate for ubiquitous

chemicals, such as chlorine and ammonia, because of the innumerable

applications that would have to be considered. A greater disadvantage

to this approach is that the intrinsic hazard of a chemical will

still be present even when it is used outside of a &quot;typical&quot;

scenario. As stated in the proposed rule, EPA believes it is not

feasible to develop a methodology for establishing threshold quantities

based on site-specific factors that would be applicable uniformly

nationwide. Therefore, EPA did not incorporate site-specific factors

in setting or modifying thresholds. As discussed in the preamble

section <I>IV.B. Threshold Determination</I>, substance-specific

factors and use scenarios are considered in determining whether

there is a threshold quantity on-site. Also, site specific factors

will more appropriately be accounted for in the accidental release

prevention regulations under section 112(r)(7). This Agency rationale

is also applicable to similar comments for establishing thresholds

for flammable and explosive substances.

<P>

<I>e. Other Threshold Quantity Options Considered</I>. In addition

to the proposed methodology for setting thresholds for toxic substances

and the use of OSHA thresholds as discussed above, EPA requested

comment on several other options. One option was use of the vapor

quantity method, based on air dispersion modeling, to determine

the quantity in air needed to equal the &quot;Immediately Dangerous

to Life and Health&quot; (IDLH, published by the National Institute

for Occupational Safety and Health) concentration level at 100

meters from the point of release. This option was not generally

supported by commenters. A second option was to adopt the threshold

planning quantities (TPQs) under EPCRA section 302. A small number

of commenters favored this option, believing that consistency

with EPCRA would help to avoid confusion. EPA did not propose

this option because the TPQs are intended to represent a level

at which the chemical hazards should be considered by localities

for discretionary community planning purposes. As mentioned in

the preamble of the proposed rule, the thresholds established

under this rule have a different purpose, i.e., to indicate which

facilities must comply with mandatory facility-based prevention

requirements. Any confusion that results from two different threshold

quantities applying to the same chemical under two EPA emergency

preparedness and prevention programs is mitigated by the fact

that the more onerous and detailed planning requirements are triggered

when greater, and presumably more dangerous, quantities are present.

<P>

The third threshold option considered for toxics was adoption

of the OSHA thresholds for all substances listed by both EPA and

OSHA. A number of commenters favored this option. As noted above,

EPA recognizes the importance of consistency with OSHA. However,

because of EPA's statutory obligation to establish a methodology

based on specified factors, the Agency has elected not to adopt

the OSHA thresholds. The thresholds adopted in today's rule for

chemicals listed by EPA are, with the exception of methyl chloride,

equal to or higher than OSHA's.

<P>

2. Flammable Substances

<P>

EPA's listing of flammable gases and volatile flammable liquids

was generally supported by commenters, although a few commenters

maintained that, because OSHA regulates flammable substances,

EPA should not list them. The Agency disagrees that flammable

substances should not be listed for accident prevention and potential

effects off-site, since such substances pose a potential off-site

hazard (namely, a vapor cloud explosion) because of their inherent

properties. The proposed threshold for flammables, 10,000 pounds,

was generally supported as well. EPA is finalizing the proposed

listing for flammables and their threshold quantities.

<P>

Commenters also focused on specific flammable substances, including

methane, ethane, propane, and butane (some components of natural

gas). Commenters argued that special factors (e.g., the low density

of methane gas) justify not listing or modifying the listing of

these substances. EPA has reviewed the comments on specific flammable

substances and disagrees with the commenters. EPA believes there

is sufficient information, from both accident reports and modeling

results, to support the conclusion that flammable substances that

meet the listing criteria, in quantities above the threshold quantity

of 10,000 pounds, could present a hazard to the public from a

vapor cloud explosion. EPA recognizes that, as noted by commenters,

some situations in which these substances are handled may present

a lesser hazard than others. However, these substances still pose

a potential threat beyond the fenceline in case of an accidental

release. Therefore, in order to be protective of the public, EPA

is maintaining the same application of the criteria for flammable

substances as proposed for all listed flammable substances. EPA's

listing decision is based on the substances' demonstrated or potential

effects in the event of an accidental release, not on existing

regulations, standards, or recommended practices applicable to

the listed substances; these factors may more appropriately be

accounted for when accident prevention regulations are promulgated

under section 112(r)(7).

<P>

Several commenters recommended that EPA provide an exemption,

similar to the exemption under OSHA's PSM Standard, for flammable

liquids kept in atmospheric tanks below their normal boiling points.

Unlike OSHA, EPA is listing only flammable gases and volatile

flammable liquids. EPA considers these substances to be intrinsically

hazardous, regardless of conditions of storage, and, therefore,

does not believe it is appropriate to provide an exemption for

atmospheric storage.

<P>

3. Explosives

<P>

Explosives classified by DOT as Class 1, Division 1.1 and listed

as such in 49 CFR 172.101 (the <I>Hazardous Materials Table</I>)

are covered by this rule with a threshold of 5,000 pounds. In

49 CFR Part 173.50, DOT defines the term &quot;explosive&quot;

as any substance or article, including a device, which is designed

to function by explosion (i.e., an extremely rapid release of

gas and heat) or which, by chemical reaction within itself, is

able to function in a similar manner even if not designed to function

by explosion, unless the substance or article is otherwise classed

under DOT provisions. Division 1.1 consists of explosives with

a mass explosion hazard; a mass explosion is one which affects

almost the entire load instantaneously. The Agency proposed to

list all substances that met the definition of Division 1.1 (58

FR 5110). The Agency is clarifying and modifying its listing of

explosive substances to include only those substances listed in

49 CFR Part 172.101 (DOT's Hazardous Material Table), which is

a subset of all substances and mixtures of substances that would

meet DOT's Division 1.1 definition.

<P>

EPA noted in the preamble to the proposed rule that it believed

this threshold would apply primarily to manufacturers of high

explosives (58 FR 5112). More than 100 commenters, primarily explosives

distributors and users, objected to the listing of explosives

in general. These commenters maintained that explosives are regulated

adequately by a number of agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol,

Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF), DOT, OSHA, the Mine Safety and Health

Administration (MSHA), and the Department of Defense (DOD). The

commenters believe the requirements of the existing regulations

serve to prevent accidents and cited the safety record of the

explosives industry as evidence. The commenters believe the American

Table of Distances, used by BATF to set distances for storage

of explosives, provides protection for the community from the

effects of an accidental explosion; this table is based on a lower

overpressure level than the 3.0 psi used by EPA to set the threshold

for explosives and, therefore, is more protective of the public.

In addition, a number of commenters said the 5,000-pound threshold

proposed by EPA would not restrict the effects of the rule to

manufacturers, as suggested by EPA, but would also cover many

distribution and use sites. They noted that, for example, blasting

may require only a small quantity of high explosive (Division

1.1), but that the entire quantity of explosives on-site used

in blasting is treated as a high explosive; the high explosive

portion serves to initiate the reaction involving the entire quantity.

<P>

EPA acknowledged in the proposed rule that explosives are already

regulated by a number of agencies. However, these existing regulations

do not negate the properties of these substances. The explosives

listed in today's rule meet the criteria of section 112(r)(3)

and (4) because the inherent properties of the listed explosives

plainly indicate that such chemicals may have a severe impact

in the event of a detonation. The listed explosives represent

the category of explosives that may most easily detonate. In the

event of an accidental detonation these substances pose an inherent

risk of off-site effects. Industry requirements under other applicable

regulations, or recommended standards, are more appropriately

accounted for in the development of accidental release prevention

requirements. The requirements for accident prevention in section

112(r)(7) specifically allow for recognition of industry-specific

circumstances, including voluntary prevention measures, in EPA's

prevention regulations. No similar provision is set forth in sections

112(r)(3), (4), or (5), which covers the development of this list

of substances and thresholds quantities. Section 112(r)(7) implementing

rules, as appropriate, will allow for industry specific circumstances

to be considered. Other regulatory requirements, and other practices

already in place aimed specifically at protecting the public from

adverse effects in case of accidental releases are expected to

be integrated with accident prevention requirements of rulemaking

under section 112(r)(7).

<P>

In particular, EPA's review of existing regulations indicates

that public safety would be enhanced if additional information

about explosives, such as hazards assessments, were available

to emergency response agencies and local emergency planners. Public

safety would also be enhanced if there were additional coordination

between facilities handling explosives and the local emergency

planners and responders. The listing of explosives will make information

available under section 112(r) rulemaking and facilitate this

coordination. Furthermore, current regulations do not provide

for public communication of potential off-site hazards, as do

CAA Amendments requirements under section 112(r)(7). Currently,

only information related to the quantity and location of explosives

is available to the public under sections 311 and 312 of EPCRA.

Under the risk management provisions of the CAA, the public will

also have available to them information about the measures being

taken by the facility to prevent off-site consequences from accidental

detonations.

<P>

The Agency has noted that the practice of treating the entire

quantity of mixtures of high explosives with other explosives

as high explosives, coupled with the Agency's proposed threshold

determination rule for mixtures, creates the potential for coverage

of explosive formulations that are intended to be released (exploded)

on-site. The Agency did not intend such coverage in its proposal.

In response to this problem identified by the commenters, the

Agency is modifying the listing of explosives in today's final

rule so that specific explosives on the Hazardous Materials Table

are identified as the regulated substances. This avoids the potential

circularity in the proposed definition. Mixtures with substances

listed on the Hazardous Materials Table are potentially covered

only through the operation of the explosive mixture provision

in the threshold determination portion of today's rule. The Agency

is also clarifying the coverage of explosive mixtures to be used

for intentional on-site detonations (not an accidental release)

when determining if a threshold quantity is present in a process.

This clarification is discussed later in today's preamble.

<P>

<I>B. Threshold Determination</I>

<P>

Section 68.115 was originally proposed as section 68.5. It has

been consolidated with other subpart C provisions that relate

to covered substances and applicable thresholds. This section

of the regulation establishes how to estimate the presence of

a threshold quantity. Exemptions of those quantities that need

not be accounted for in determining a threshold are also included.

<P>

1. Basis for Threshold Determination

<P>

Comments on the proposed rule generally supported a threshold

quantity determination that is based on the quantity of a regulated

substance in a process. Some commenters, however, suggested that

determining threshold quantities should be based on the quantity

on-site, the average annual usage, or on-site specific factors.

EPA generally disagrees with these statements. The total quantity

on-site, while consistent with other regulations in determining

threshold quantities (particularly EPCRA, section 302) does not

necessarily represent the quantity that could be involved in an

accident. The total quantity on-site may include quantities in

separate processes, buildings, and locations within the same facility.

The average annual usage measures the quantity used by a facility

in a year and is not related to the maximum quantity that could

be released at a given time. Site-specific factors are appropriately

accounted for both in defining the process for which a threshold

calculation must be undertaken and in assessing the hazards and

preparing the risk management plan for the particular facility.

As recommended by most commenters, EPA is retaining the threshold

determination based on the total quantity in a process, using

the same process definition as OSHA. This approach focuses on

the quantity of a substance that might be released in a single

accident, and that could be reasonably anticipated to cause effects

of concern as a result of an accidental release. This threshold

determination approach is consistent with OSHA's PSM standard.

<P>

2. Mixture Exemption

<P>

<I>a. Toxic Substances</I>. The proposed rule included a de-minimis

concentration of one percent by weight for all listed substances

present in a mixture; i.e., quantities of a regulated substance

in a mixture did not have to be accounted for purposes of the

threshold quantity if the substance were present at concentrations

below one percent by weight. A number of comments were received

on this exemption for solutions and mixtures.

<P>

Several commenters suggested providing a threshold determination

method for mixtures based on the SHI. The partial pressure of

the listed substance in solution and its toxicity would be used

to determine the value of the SHI for the solution; the index

value would be compared to a cut-off value (commenters recommended

a cut-off of 1,000). EPA does not agree that the SHI criteria

should be used to determine the mixture cut-off. Because the SHI

approach was not used in determining which chemicals to list,

a mixtures score based on this index would not relate to whether

a chemical met the listing criteria. EPA also remains concerned

about the lack of a basis for the recommended 1,000 SHI cut-off.

In addition, EPA believes the SHI approach would be difficult

to implement within the structure of section 112(r), especially

for facilities outside the chemical manufacturing industry.

<P>

Most of the commenters believed the one percent concentration

cut-off is too low for solutions of toxic substances; their position

being that one percent mixtures of a regulated substance pose

essentially no threat to the public. Several commenters also suggested

that EPA should provide specific concentration cut-offs for solutions

of certain listed substances, such as hydrogen fluoride, nitric

acid, and sulfuric acid. Several commenters suggested that the

concentration cut-offs should be raised for hydrochloric acid

(listed for concentrations of 25 percent or greater) and ammonia

(listed for concentrations of 20 percent or greater).

<P>

The Agency agrees with commenters that the one percent cut-off

may prove to be too conservative in certain circumstances, and

that it may not adequately reflect the decreased potential for

air release of most regulated substances in dilute mixtures or

solutions; at very low concentrations some of these mixtures or

solutions fail to meet the listing criteria. The Agency also believes,

however, that no justification would exist to exclude the quantities

in mixtures or solutions from the threshold calculation if it

is uncertain that these mixtures or solutions fail to meet the

original listing criteria.

<P>

In response to these comments, EPA has modified the one percent

mixture exemption to reflect the amount of the regulated substance

that may reasonably be anticipated to cause an effect of concern

in an accidental release. The Agency has reassessed the concentration

at which certain dilute solutions of regulated substances may

pose a hazard to the community, sufficient to warrant treatment

as a regulated substance, for purposes of determining whether

a threshold quantity is present in a process. As part of this

modification, EPA has decided to provide specific cut-off concentrations

for certain chemicals. These chemicals, in mixtures or solutions

with concentrations below the specified cut-off, will not have

to be considered in determining whether a threshold quantity is

present. For other chemicals, a method, rather than a specific

cut-off, will be provided to determine whether mixtures should

be considered in the threshold determination. The following chemicals

are now listed with concentration cut-offs (in addition to those

already proposed with concentrations cut-offs) as shown for weight

percent of the substances in water solution:

<P>

Hydrogen fluoride/Hydrofluoric acid (concentration 50 percent

or greater); the listing of hydrogen fluoride has been clarified

to reflect that it includes the aqueous form of hydrogen fluoride,

hydrofluoric acid.

<UL>

<LI>Nitric acid (concentration 80 percent or greater) 

</UL>



<P>

The concentration limits for hydrofluoric and nitric acid are

based on the partial pressures of these substances in water solution.

At the concentrations listed, the partial pressures of the solutions

would meet the vapor pressure criterion of 10 mm Hg. Also, EPA

is raising the proposed concentration cut-off for hydrochloric

acid from 25 to 30 percent, based on water solutions, to meet

the revised vapor pressure criterion. EPA is not changing the

concentration cut-off for ammonia because the partial pressure

of ammonia in a 20 percent solution still exceeds the 10 mm Hg

vapor pressure criterion.

<P>

Other listed toxic substances in solutions or mixtures must be

included in threshold determination if the partial pressure of

the substance in the solution or mixture is equal to, or exceeds,

10 mm Hg. If the partial pressure of the regulated toxic substance

in the mixture is determined to be below 10 mm Hg under all conditions

in process handling or process storage, the solution or mixture

need not be considered in the threshold determination. If the

partial pressure of the regulated toxic substance in the mixture

equals or exceeds 10 mm Hg in portions of the process, then the

quantity of the listed substance contained in the mixture at these

portions of the process shall be included in determining whether

a threshold is met. The facility will be required to use the one

percent de-minimis concentration in determining threshold quantities

unless it can measure or estimate, and document, that the partial

pressure of the regulated substance in the mixture or solution

is less than 10 mm Hg.

<P>

The methodology for determining the amount of a regulated substance

in a mixture to apply to thresholds does not apply to oleum, toluene

2,4-diisocyanate, toluene 2,6-diisocyanate, and toluene diisocyanate

(unspecified isomer). These substances have vapor pressures less

than 10 mm Hg.

<P>

<I>b. Flammable Substances</I>. The proposed rule included the

same de-minimis concentration of one percent by weight for all

listed substances present in a mixture for flammable substances.

A number of commenters noted that mixtures of flammable substances

in concentrations above one percent may not be flammable. They

suggested that a listed flammable substance in a mixture should

be included in threshold determination only if the mixture meets

the flammability criteria for listing. Other commenters suggested

that the entire mixture containing a listed substance should be

treated as a regulated substance if the mixture meets the listing

criteria for flammable substances. EPA agrees that a mixture containing

a listed flammable substance should only be considered in a threshold

determination if the mixture itself meets the criteria for an

NFPA flammability rating of 4, i.e., flash point below 22.8o C

(73o F) and boiling point below 37.8o C (100o F). Again, as for

the toxics in mixtures or solutions, a facility is required to

use the one percent de-minimis concentration for threshold quantity

calculations unless it can measure or estimate, and document,

that the mixture or solution does not have a flash point below

22.8o C (73o F) and a boiling point below 37.8o C (100o F).

<P>

The Agency agrees with commenters who suggested that a mixture

containing a flammable regulated substance should be treated as

the regulated substance for purposes of determining whether a

threshold quantity is present if the mixture itself meets the

boiling point and flash point criteria of today's rule. EPA believes

the hazards associated with such highly flammable mixtures make

it appropriate to treat such mixtures as regulated substances

when such mixtures meet the flammability listing criteria. EPA

recognizes that counting the entire quantity of a flammable mixture

for threshold determination differs from the proposed rule and

from the treatment of mixtures containing regulated toxic substances.

However, the Agency believes this different treatment is appropriate

because, for flammable substance mixtures, the mixture is known

to display the flammability hazard at levels that meet the listing

criteria, while for toxic substance mixtures, the mixture is not

known to meet the acute toxicity criterion. For toxic substance

mixtures, EPA requires counting towards a threshold only the portion

of the mixture that would meet the acute toxicity criterion (i.e.,

the amount of the actual substance).

<P>

<I>c. Explosive Substances</I>. A number of comments were received

regarding the threshold calculations for explosives, particularly

for mixtures of division 1.1 explosives with low explosives or

blasting agents at use sites. In the proposed rule, the Agency

had established a de-minimis concentration applicable to all listed

substances. Commenters pointed out problems with this mixture

consideration, in light of EPA's listing of all explosives meeting

DOT's definition of Division 1.1 hazardous materials. This definition

treats the entire quantity of a mixture containing a high explosive

as a Division 1.1 explosive, hence negating the de-minimis calculation

for purposes of threshold quantity determinations. This affected

particularly those mixtures formulated on-site, prior to intentional

detonations, following BATF regulations. To minimize the potential

for accidents, these mixtures generally are made shortly before

intentional on-site explosions. The Agency recognizes that the

intentional release (or controlled release) in an explosion of

mixtures containing a regulated substance is not an accidental

release. Thus, the Agency believes that the amount of an explosive

in such a mixture cannot be reasonably anticipated to cause effects

of concern as a result of an accidental release when such quantities

are intended to be released on-site. Therefore, in addition to

clarifying the listing of explosives only to include those substances

listed by DOT in 49 CFR 172.101, the Agency is also clarifying

the applicability of the mixture concentration provision for explosives.

For purposes of determining whether a threshold quantity is present

in a process involving explosives, mixtures of Division 1.1 explosives

listed by DOT in 49 CFR 172.101 (Hazardous Material Table) and

other explosives need not to be included when the mixture is intended

to be used in an on-site non-accidental release in a manner consistent

with applicable BATF regulations. Quantities of explosive regulated

substances in mixtures that are not intended to be used on-site

in an intentional explosion would not be exempt if such mixture

would be treated as a Division 1.1 explosive under 49 CFR parts

172 and 173.

<P>

The following two examples demonstrate how this threshold determination

provision would operate. An owner or operator of a stationary

source receives a mixture, or prepares a mixture, that combines

a small quantity of an explosive listed as Division 1.1 hazardous

material in 49 CFR 172.101 with a large quantity of a blasting

agent, so that the total quantity is above the 5,000 lbs threshold

quantity established for listed explosives. If the owner or operator

intends to detonate the high explosive/blasting agent mixture

at the stationary source in a manner that is consistent with applicable

BATF regulations, then the owner or operator need not count the

weight of the mixture in determining whether the source has a

threshold quantity of the regulated substance on-site. If the

owner or operator intends to store, and then transport off-site

the high explosive/blasting agent mixture, and the entire mixture

would be treated as Division 1.1 explosive under applicable DOT

regulations, then the weight of the entire mixture would need

to be calculated to determine whether a threshold quantity is

present.

<P>

3. Other Threshold Exemptions

<P>

Except as noted below, all other threshold exemptions in the proposed

rule are retained in the final rule. All comments received concerning

these exemptions favored the Agency's proposal. The Agency continues

to believe that the forms of regulated substances exempted in

today's rule cannot reasonably be anticipated to cause effects

of concern in the event of an accidental release.

<P>

<I>Use for facility consumption as fuel:</I> The Agency has deferred

a decision on the proposed exemption for listed flammable substances

when used solely for facility consumption as fuel. For a document

relating to this proposed exemption, see a supplemental notice

published elsewhere in this issue. The Agency intends to decide

on whether to promulgate this exemption on or before the date

the final risk management program rule is promulgated.

<P>

<I>C. Petition Process</I>

<P>

Section 68.120 of the rule establishes the specific administrative

and technical requirements for the submission of petitions to

add or delete substances from the list of regulated substances.

<P>

Several comments were received on the criteria for determining

whether a substance that is the subject of a petition should be

listed or delisted. Two commenters said the listing criteria are

too narrow. For example, it was argued that EPA should allow petitioners

to develop a case for listing toxic chemicals that do not meet

the acute toxicity criteria. Another commenter said the listing

criteria are too broad, and the standards for delisting are too

stringent; delisting requires demonstrating that the substance

&quot;will not&quot; cause death, injury, or environmental harm.

<P>

EPA believes the acute toxicity criteria for listing toxics, as

well as the volatility and accident history, provide a valid basis

for identification of chemicals that pose hazards to the community

in case of acute exposures resulting from an accidental release

and is retaining these criteria for petition review. The Agency

is also retaining the selection criteria for listing flammables

and explosives. EPA agrees that the petition requirements for

delisting may be too stringent and will delete substances from

the list if it can be determined that the substance, in case of

an accidental release, &quot;is not known or anticipated to&quot;

cause death, injury, or serious adverse effects to human health

or the environment.

<P>

One commenter said the decision not to accept additional petitions

unless new data become available should be modified so that petitions

that present significant data not previously considered (whether

or not the data are new) can be accepted. The petition process

provides that when a petition is received, EPA will publish a

notice in the FEDERAL REGISTER requesting additional, pertinent

scientific information that was not identified by the petitioner.

Interested parties will have the opportunity to present significant

data not included in the petition. Therefore, EPA believes it

is appropriate to accept additional petitions on a substance only

if new data become available.

<P>

Another commenter said the 18-month period proposed for review

of petitions should be shortened to six months. EPA believes the

18-month review period is not excessive for carrying out a thorough

review of the petition and any public comments and publishing

a decision concerning the petition. Denials shall be published

in the Federal Register within 18 months of the Agency receiving

the petition; for petitions granted, the Agency will publish a

proposed new listing within 18 months.

<P>

<I>D. Definitions</I>

<P>

Section 68.3 of the regulation sets forth the definitions that

will apply to all regulations published under section 112(r).

Some of the terms used in other parts of the CAA are also applicable

to section 112(r). In addition, a number of terms new to the CAA,

resulting from the implementation of section 112(r), are defined

in section 68.3 for purposes of all accidental release prevention

regulations. These definitions include terms necessary to communicate

effectively the new regulatory requirements.

<P>

<I>Accidental Release:</I> The definition proposed for accidental

release has been taken directly from the legislative language.

Several commenters, however, thought it appropriate that the Agency

clarify this definition to better focus on EPA's intent through

this regulation. Several commenters submitted that the definition

of accidental release should be clarified not to include routine

emissions to the environment. The Agency believes that the definition

is clear in specifying that and accidental release is an &quot;unanticipated

emission&quot; of a regulated substance and that this would not

include routine emissions. Several commenters also had concerns

regarding the inclusion of the term &quot;other extremely hazardous

substances&quot; in the definition of accidental release. This

term has also been taken directly from the legislative language

and the Agency believes it to be an important component of this

definition. Under section 112(r)(1) the owners and operators of

stationary sources have a duty to initiate specific activities

to prevent and mitigate accidental releases of any regulated substance

under 112(r)(3), or any other extremely hazardous substance.

<P>

<I>Process:</I> There were a number of comments related to EPA's

definition of process. The proposed definition was consistent

with OSHA's definition of process under their PSM standard, and

included any activity involving a regulated substance including

any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site movement

of such substances, or combination of these activities. Any group

of vessels that is interconnected, or separate vessels that are

located such that a regulated substance could be involved in a

potential release, were proposed to be considered a single process.

Because of the need to maintain as much consistency as possible

with OSHA, EPA is retaining this definition and is providing,

in this preamble, some clarification prompted by comments submitted

on this issue.

<P>

Many commenters argued that the proposed definition included terms

that were not clear, such as interconnected vessels and single

processes. The commenters indicated, for example, that in some

cases vessels may be connected in indirect ways and still present

a low probability that they could be involved in a single release.

The Agency believes that this was already accounted for through

the proposed definition of process. To serve as clarification,

interconnected vessels that could be involved in a single release

would include vessels physically connected so that an event could

lead to an accidental release involving all these vessels at one

time. The Agency still believes that the facility is responsible

in accounting for any quantity of a regulated substance that could

potentially be released from one or more vessels, whether these

are connected or not.

<P>

<I>Stationary source:</I> Several commenters requested clarification

regarding pipelines and whether listed flammable substances in

pipeline transfer stations would be covered by the rule under

the stationary source definition. Other commenters had questions

regarding the inclusion in this definition of transportation containers

not under active shipping orders. The Agency is clarifying the

definition of stationary source. For purposes of regulations under

section 112(r), the term stationary source does not apply to transportation

conditions, which would include storage incident to such transportation,

of any 112(r) regulated substance. Pipelines, transfer stations,

and other activities already covered under DOT as transportation

of hazardous substances by pipeline, or incident to such transportation,

under 49 CFR Parts 192, 193 and 195 would not be covered. Transportation

containers that are not under active shipping papers are not considered

by EPA to be storage incident to transportation; the Agency considers

the definition of stationary source to include such containers.

<P>

<I>E. Exemptions</I>

<P>

The Agency is retaining the proposed exemption from this part

for ammonia used as an agricultural nutrient, when held by farmers.

This exemption was authorized by statute, and it was also generally

supported by commenters.

<P>

A number of commenters suggested that an exemption should be added

for natural gas, mainly because of other existing regulations.

As discussed previously in this preamble, EPA's listing of a substance

is based on the demonstrated or potential effects in the event

of an accidental release. Existing regulations may be targeted

to reduce a potential release, or the effects of a release, but

do not negate the hazards presented by the substances regulated.

Existing requirements under other regulations, standards, or recommended

practices are to be accounted for though the requirements of the

risk management program and any other prevention regulations under

section 112(r).

<P>

<I>F. Scope</I>

<P>

An issue of concern to a number of commenters were the general

duty requirements under section 112(r)(1). Generally, commenters

voiced some confusion regarding what the requirements would be,

and particularly about which substances would be included. Because

of similarities with OSHA's general duty clause, commenters expressed

the need for EPA to develop guidance along the OSHA Field Operations

Manual to assist facilities in evaluating their compliance with

these requirements.

<P>

The CAA identified the following activities as part of the general

duty requirements: identification of hazards which may result

from an accidental release using appropriate hazard assessment

techniques, designing and maintaining a safe facility taking such

steps as necessary to prevent accidental releases, and actions

which minimize the consequences of an accidental release once

it has occurred. Section 112(r)(1) specifically indicates that

the general duty provision applies in the same manner and to the

same extent as OSHA's general duty clause under section 654, Title

29 of the U.S. Code. The Agency is investigating the relationship

between requirements under section 112(r) and OSHA's general duty

provisions.

<P>

Comments were also received on the separate issuance of the list

and thresholds rule and the risk management program rule. The

comments focused on the difficulties for the regulated community

to evaluate and comment on the full impact of the list and thresholds

without specific information on the accident prevention requirements.

The Agency agrees that the separation of these rules does not

allow the regulated community the optimum opportunity to comment

on the proposed regulation. While the Agency recognizes that the

two rules comprise a single program, the statute allows for proposal

and promulgation of the list and thresholds rule prior to the

proposal and promulgation of the section 112(r)(7) rule. Because

EPA's duty to publish the list and thresholds rule arose before

the duty to publish the risk management program rule, the Agency

was obligated to publish the proposed list and thresholds rule

before the section 112(r)(7)(B) proposed rule was publishable.

The Agency has just published a proposed notice for the prevention

requirements applicable to facilities having the listed substances

above the threshold quantities (<I>Risk Management Programs for

Chemical Accidental Release Prevention</I>, 58 FR 54190, October

20, 1993). The comment period for the risk management program

rule will be open at the time this rule is finalized. This will

give commenters the opportunity to comment on the risk management

program with the knowledge of what substances are covered.

<P>

<B>V. Summary of Provisions of the Final Rule</B>

<P>

EPA is adding part 68 to title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations,

including the list of regulated substances and threshold quantities,

as well as the requirements for the petition process to add regulated

substances to the list or to delete regulated substances from

the list.

<P>

Section 68.1 establishes the scope of the Part 68 chemical accident

prevention provisions.

<P>

Section 68.3 establishes definitions applicable to all Part 68

regulations.

<P>

Section 68.100 establishes the purpose of the subpart as the designation

of regulated substances and their threshold quantities, and establishment

of the requirements for petitions to add substances or delete

substances from the list.

<P>

Section 68.115 (proposed 68.5) establishes the procedures to determine

whether a threshold quantity of a regulated substance is present

at a stationary source. Specific exemptions to the threshold determination

procedure are also included for mixture concentrations, articles,

and certain uses and activities.

<P>

The final rule includes several exemptions for mixtures that have

been revised from the proposed rule. These are: (1) for toxic

substances present in a mixture or solution at a concentration

of one percent or greater by weight, the facility has the option

of demonstrating that the partial pressure of the regulated substance

in the solution under any or all storage or handling conditions

is less than 10 mm Hg; in this case, the quantity of the regulated

substance in the mixture in the portion of the process with a

partial pressure of less than 10 mm Hg would be exempt from threshold

determination; (2) mixtures containing regulated flammable substances

are exempt from threshold determination if the facility demonstrates

that the mixture itself does not meet the criteria for flammability

(flash point below 73oF (22.8oC) and boiling point below 100oF

(37.8oC); and (3) mixtures of Division 1.1 explosives listed in

49 CFR 172.101 and other explosives need not be considered when

determining whether a threshold quantity is present, provided

that the mixture is intended to be intentionally released (i.e.,

a non-accidental release) in a manner consistent with DOT and

BATF regulations.

<P>

Section 68.120 specifies the requirements for petitions to the

Agency to add substances to the list, and to delete substances

from the list. Petition requirements have been modified slightly

to read that a substance may be deleted from the list if adequate

data are available to determine that the substance, in the case

of an accidental release, is &quot;unlikely to cause&quot; (rather

than &quot;will not cause&quot;) death, injury, or serious adverse

effects to human health or the environment. 

<P>

Section 68.125 exempts ammonia used as an agricultural nutrient

when held by a farmer.

<P>

Section 68.130 establishes the list of regulated substances, including

a list of toxic substances, a list of flammable substances, and

a list criterion for commercial high explosives. This section

also establishes the threshold quantities for all listed substances.

<P>

The final rule includes several changes to the proposed list and

thresholds. Eighteen substances, with vapor pressures below 10

mm Hg, have been deleted from the proposed list of toxic substances,

and one substance (vinyl chloride) has been moved from the list

of toxic substances to the list of flammable substances. One substance,

methyl bromide, has been deleted because it is listed under Title

VI of the CAA. Four substances on the proposed list, included

partly because of their accident history, have been deleted while

another, oleum, has been specifically listed. The final list contains

77 toxic substances. Concentration cut-off levels have been specified

for solutions of two additional substances, hydrogen fluoride

and nitric acid. The concentration cut-off level has been raised

for hydrochloric acid from 25 to 30 percent by weight. Threshold

quantities have been raised for 71 of the 77 toxic substances

listed. The final list contains 63 flammable substances, with

the threshold quantity remaining at 10,000 lbs. The listing of

explosive substances has been modified only to include those substances

listed by DOT in 49 CFR 172.101; the Agency is also clarifying

the applicability of the mixture concentration provision for explosives.

<P>

<B>VI. Required Analyses</B>

<P>

<I>A. E.O. 12866</I>

<P>

Under Executive Order 12866, 58 Federal Register 51735 (October

4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action

is &quot;significant:, and therefore subject to OMB review and

the requirements of the Executive Order. The Order defines &quot;significant

regulatory action&quot; as one that is likely to result in a rule

that may:

<P>

(1) have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more

or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of

the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment,

public health or safety, or state, local, or tribal government

or communities;

<P>

(2) create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with

an action taken or planned by another agency;

<P>

(3) materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants,

user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients

thereof; or

<P>

(4) raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates,

the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the

Executive Order.

<P>

Pursuant to the terms of the Executive Order 12866, it has been

determined that this rule is a &quot;significant regulatory action&quot;.

Even though the list and thresholds rule, by itself, imposes no

cost on facilities, the cost impact of the list and thresholds

derives from compliance with the risk management program regulations

and other reasonable regulations, which are triggered by the presence

of a regulated substance above its threshold quantity. The annual

effect on the economy for the accidental release prevention regulations

that will be triggered by this rule is expected to exceed $100

million. As such, this action is submitted to OMB for review as

part of a larger accidental release prevention program. Changes

made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be

documented in the public record.

<P>

The Agency developed a draft Regulatory Impacts Analysis (RIA)

for the proposed rule that considered the cost for the accidental

release prevention program envisioned under section 112(r); this

draft RIA includes the list and thresholds and the risk management

program requirements. The list rule, by itself, imposes only very

minimal costs associated with the petition requirements for additions

to, and deletions from, the list and for the documentation of

mixtures; the majority of costs relate to actions that facilities

with listed chemicals must undertake as a result of the risk management

program rule.

<P>

The requirements under the OSHA Process Safety Management Standard,

which parallels the EPA risk management planning requirements,

have now been in place for some time, and information is becoming

available on the costs to facilities working to comply with OSHA.

An addendum to the draft RIA was developed for the proposed risk

management program rule to reflect public comments and the new

information. The Agency estimate of the universe of facilities

covered by the final list and thresholds rule has since been revised.

EPA now estimates that approximately 118,000 facilities will be

covered by the final list and thresholds rule. The distribution

of facilities covered includes 11,000 manufacturers and 107,000

non-manufacturers (i.e., refineries; public drinking water and

waste treatment systems; cold storage facilities; wholesalers;

agricultural retailers; service industry facilities; private utilities;

propane retailers, propane users, explosives manufacturers, and

gas extraction and processing facilities). The average number

of regulated substances per facility varies from one for cold

storage facilities to six for highly complex manufacturing facilities.

<P>

EPA estimates that the petition process under this rulemaking

will cost a facility submitting a petition an average of $5,000.

EPA estimates that there will be 11 petitions a year. EPA anticipates

that the cost to the Federal government for processing and reviewing

the petitions will be approximately equal to the cost to facilities

for filing a petition. The total annual cost is estimated to be

$110,000 ($5,000 x 2 x 11 petitions).

<P>

<I>B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</I>

<P>

Pursuant to the <I>Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980</I>, 5 U.S.C.

601 <I>et seq.</I>, when an agency publishes a notice of rulemaking,

for a rule that will have a significant effect on a substantial

number of small entities, the agency must prepare and make available

for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that considers

the effect of the rule on small entities (i.e., small businesses,

small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions).

<P>

The list rule, by itself, imposes only very minimal costs associated

with the petition requirements for additions to, and deletions

from, the list and for the documentation of mixtures; the majority

of costs relate to actions that facilities with listed chemicals

must undertake as a result of the risk management program rule.

The risk management program regulation was proposed by EPA on

October 20, 1993 (58 FR 54190); a discussion of the impacts on

small entities is included on page 54212. The initial Regulatory

Flexibility Analysis is contained in the combined economic analysis

entitled <I>Regulatory Impact Analysis in Support of Listing Regulated

Substances and Thresholds and Mandating Risk Management Programs

for Chemical Accident Prevention, as Required by Section 112(r)

of the CAA</I>, available in the docket. A revised economic analysis

will be developed in conjunction with the final risk management

program regulation.

<P>

<I>C. Paperwork Reduction Act</I>

<P>

The information collection requirements contained in this rule

have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)

under the provisions of the <I>Paperwork Reduction Act</I>, 44

U.S.C. 3501 <I>et seq.</I> and have been assigned control number

2050-0127.

<P>

Public reporting for this collection of information in the petition

process is estimated to be approximately 138 hours per response,

including time for reviewing instructions, searching existing

data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing

and reviewing the collection of information. EPA estimates that

there will be 11 petitions a year. The total annual burden is

estimated to be 1,518 hours (138 hours x 11 petitions).

<P>

Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect

of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing

the burden, to:

<P>

Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S., Environmental

Protection Agency, 401 M St. S.W., Washington, D.C. 20460; and

to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of

Management and Budget, Washington, D.C. 20503, marked &quot;Attention:

Desk Officer for EPA.&quot;

<P>

<I>D. Display of OMB Control Numbers</I>

<P>

EPA is also amending the table of currently approved information

collection request (ICR) control numbers issued by OMB for various

regulations. This amendment updates the table to accurately display

those information requirements contained in this final rule. This

display of the OMB control number and its subsequent codification

in the Code of Federal Regulations satisfies the requirements

of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <I>et seq.</I>)

and OMB's implementing regulations at 5 CFR 1320.

<P>

The ICR was previously subject to public notice and comment prior

to OMB approval. As a result, EPA finds that there is &quot;good

cause&quot; under section 553(b)(B) of the Administrative Procedure

Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B)) to amend this table without prior notice

and comment. Due to the technical nature of the table, further

<P>

<B>68.1 Scope.</B>

<P>

This Part sets forth the list of regulated substances and thresholds,

the petition process for adding or deleting substances to the

list of regulated substances, the requirements for owners or operators

of stationary sources concerning the prevention of accidental

releases, and the State accidental release prevention programs

approved under section 112(r). The list of substances, threshold

quantities, and accident prevention regulations promulgated under

this part do not limit in any way the general duty provisions

under section 112(r)(1).

<P>

<B>68.3 Definitions.</B>

<P>

For the purposes of this Part:

<P>

<I>Accidental release</I> means an unanticipated emission of a

regulated substance or other extremely hazardous substance into

the ambient air from a stationary source.

<P>

<I>Administrator</I> means the administrator of the U.S. Environmental

Protection Agency.

<P>

<I>Article</I> means a manufactured item, as defined under 29

CFR 1910.1200(b), that is formed to a specific shape or design

during manufacture, that has end use functions dependent in whole

or in part upon the shape or design during end use, and that does

not release or otherwise result in exposure to a regulated substance

under normal conditions of processing and use.

<P>

<I>CAS</I> means the Chemical Abstracts Service.

<P>

<I>DOT</I> means the United States Department of Transportation.

<P>

<I>Process</I> means any activity involving a regulated substance

including any use, storage, manufacturing, handling, or on-site

movement of such substances, or combination of these activities.

For the purposes of this definition, any group of vessels that

are interconnected, or separate vessels that are located such

that a regulated substance could be involved in a potential release,

shall be considered a single process.

<P>

<I>Regulated substance</I> is any substance listed pursuant to

section 112(r)(3) of the Clean Air Act as amended, in 68.130.

<P>

<I>Stationary source</I> means any buildings, structures, equipment,

installations, or substance emitting stationary activities which

belong to the same industrial group, which are located on one

or more contiguous properties, which are under the control of

the same person (or persons under common control), and from which

an accidental release may occur. A stationary source includes

transportation containers that are no longer under active shipping

papers and transportation containers that are connected to equipment

at the stationary source for the purposes of temporary storage,

loading, or unloading. The term stationary source does not apply

to transportation, including the storage incident to transportation,

of any regulated substance or any other extremely hazardous substance

under the provisions of this Part, provided that such transportation

is regulated under 49 CFR Parts 192, 193, or 195. Properties shall

not be considered contiguous solely because of a railroad or gas

pipeline right-of-way.

<P>

<I>Threshold quantity</I> means the quantity specified for regulated

substances pursuant to section 112(r)(5) of the Clean Air Act

as amended, listed in 68.130 and determined to be present at a

stationary source as specified in 68.115 of this Part.

<P>

<I>Vessel</I> means any reactor, tank, drum, barrel, cylinder,

vat, kettle, boiler, pipe, hose, or other container.

<P>

<B>Subpart B - Risk Management Plan Requirements [Reserved]</B>

<P>

Subpart C - Regulated Substances for Accidental Release Prevention

<P>

<B>68.100 Purpose.</B>

<P>

This subpart designates substances to be listed under section

112(r)(3), (4), and (5) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, identifies

their threshold quantities, and establishes the requirements for

petitioning to add or delete substances from the list.

<P>

<B>68.115 Threshold determination.</B>

<P>

(a) A threshold quantity of a regulated substance listed in 68.130

is present at a stationary source if the total quantity of the

regulated substance contained in a process exceeds the threshold.

<P>

(b) For the purposes of determining whether more than a threshold

quantity of a regulated substance is present at the stationary

source, the following exemptions apply:

<P>

(1) <I>Concentrations of a regulated toxic substance in a mixture</I>.

If a regulated substance is present in a mixture and the concentration

of the substance is below one percent by weight of the mixture,

the amount of the substance in the mixture need not be considered

when determining whether more than a threshold quantity is present

at the stationary source. Except for oleum, toluene 2,4-diisocyanate,

toluene 2,6-diisocyanate, and toluene diisocyanate (unspecified

isomer), if the concentration of the regulated substance in the

mixture is one percent or greater by weight, but the owner or

operator can demonstrate that the partial pressure of the regulated

substance in the mixture (solution) under handling or storage

conditions in any portion of the process is less than 10 millimeters

of mercury (mm Hg), the amount of the substance in the mixture

in that portion of the process need not be considered when determining

whether more than a threshold quantity is present at the stationary

source. The owner or operator shall document this partial pressure

measurement or estimate.

<P>

(2) <I>Concentrations of a regulated flammable substance in a

mixture</I>. If a regulated substance is present in a mixture

and the concentration of the substance is below one percent by

weight of the mixture, the mixture need not be considered when

determining whether more than a threshold quantity of the regulated

substance is present at the stationary source. If the concentration

of the regulated substance in the mixture is one percent or greater

by weight, then, for purposes of determining whether more than

a threshold quantity is present at the stationary source, the

entire weight of the mixture shall be treated as the regulated

substance unless the owner or operator can demonstrate that the

mixture itself does not meet the criteria for flammability of

flash point below 73oF (22.8oC) and boiling point below 100oF

(37.8oC). The owner or operator shall document these flash point

and boiling point measurements or estimates.

<P>

(3) <I>Concentrations of a regulated explosive substance in a

mixture</I>. Mixtures of Division 1.1 explosives listed in 49

CFR 172.101 (Hazardous Materials Table) and other explosives need

not be included when determining whether a threshold quantity

is present in a process, when the mixture is intended to be used

on-site in a non-accidental release in a manner consistent with

applicable BATF regulations. Other mixtures of Division 1.1 explosives

listed in 49 CFR 172.101 and other explosives shall be included

in determining whether more than a threshold quantity is present

in a process if such mixtures would be treated as Division 1.1

explosives under 49 CFR Parts 172 and 173.

<P>

(4) <I>Articles</I>. Regulated substances contained in articles

need not be considered when determining whether more than a threshold

quantity is present at the stationary source.

<P>

(5) <I>Uses</I>. Regulated substances, when in use for the following

purposes, need not be included in determining whether more than

a threshold quantity is present at the stationary source:

<P>

(i) Use as a structural component of the stationary source;

<P>

(ii) Use of products for routine janitorial maintenance;

<P>

(iii) Use by employees of foods, drugs, cosmetics, or other personal

items containing the regulated substance; and

<P>

(iv) Use of regulated substances present in process water or non-contact

cooling water as drawn from the environment or municipal sources,

or use of regulated substances present in air used either as compressed

air or as part of combustion.

<P>

(6) <I>Activities in Laboratories</I>. If a regulated substance

is manufactured, processed, or used in a laboratory at a stationary

source under the supervision of a technically qualified individual

as defined in 720.3(ee) of this chapter, the quantity of the substance

need not be considered in determining whether a threshold quantity

is present. This exemption does not apply to:

<P>

(i) Specialty chemical production;

<P>

(ii) Manufacture, processing, or use of substances in pilot plant

scale operations; and

<P>

(iii) Activities conducted outside the laboratory.

<P>

<B>68.120 Petition process</B>.

<P>

(a) Any person may petition the Administrator to modify, by addition

or deletion, the list of regulated substances identified in 68.130.

Based on the information presented by the petitioner, the Administrator

may grant or deny a petition.

<P>

(b) A substance may be added to the list if, in the case of an

accidental release, it is known to cause or may be reasonably

anticipated to cause death, injury, or serious adverse effects

to human health or the environment. 

<P>

(c) A substance may be deleted from the list if adequate data

on the health and environmental effects of the substance are available

to determine that the substance, in the case of an accidental

release, is not known to cause and may not be reasonably anticipated

to cause death, injury, or serious adverse effects to human health

or the environment.

<P>

(d) No substance for which a national primary ambient air quality

standard has been established shall be added to the list. No substance

regulated under Title VI of the Clean Air Act, as amended, shall

be added to the list.

<P>

(e) The burden of proof is on the petitioner to demonstrate that

the criteria for addition and deletion are met. A petition will

be denied if this demonstration is not made.

<P>

(f) The Administrator will not accept additional petitions on

the same substance following publication of a final notice of

the decision to grant or deny a petition, unless new data becomes

available that could significantly affect the basis for the decision.

<P>

(g) Petitions to modify the list of regulated substances must

contain the following:

<P>

(1) Name and address of the petitioner and a brief description

information to scientifically support the request to modify the

list. Such information shall include:

<P>

(i) A list of all support documents;

<P>

(ii) Documentation of literature searches conducted, including,

but not limited to, identification of the database(s) searched,

the search strategy, dates covered, and printed results;

<P>

(iii) Effects data (animal, human, and environmental test data)

indicating the potential for death, injury, or serious adverse

human and environmental impacts from acute exposure following

an accidental release; printed copies of the data sources, in

English, should be provided; and

<P>

(iv) Exposure data or previous accident history data, indicating

the potential for serious adverse human health or environmental

effects from an accidental release. These data may include, but

are not limited to, physical and chemical properties of the substance,

such as vapor pressure; modeling results, including data and assumptions

used and model documentation; and historical accident data, citing

data sources.

<P>

(h) Within 18 months of receipt of a petition, the Administrator

shall publish in the Federal Register a notice either denying

the petition or granting the petition and proposing a listing.

On December 21, 1995, EPA proposed the establishment of constituent-specific exit levels for low-risk solid wastes designated as hazardous because they are listed, or because they have been mixed with, derived from, or contain listed hazardous wastes. Under this proposal, if you generate a listed hazardous waste that meets the self-implementing exit levels, it will no longer be subject to the hazardous waste management system under Subtitle C of RCRA as listed hazardous waste. The proposal, referred to as the Hazardous Waste Identification Rule (HWIR), establishes a risk-based "floor" to hazardous waste listings. EPA says it will encourage pollution prevention, waste minimization, and the development of innovative waste treatment technologies. This proposal would apply to wastes generated from manufacturing processes as well as soil and groundwater that contain listed wastes.
<P>
Many of the exit levels were established using an innovative risk assessment which evaluates potential exposure pathways, both direct and indirect, from a variety of sources such as waste piles and surface impoundments. This assessment focused on both human and environmental receptors. The remaining exit levels are based on an alternative risk analysis.
<P>
To exit Subtitle C regulation as a listed hazardous waste, all the listed hazardous constituents (in a proposed new Appendix X of 40 CFR 261) would require concentrations less than or equal to the numeric exit levels, and when specified, the waste must meet the applicable land disposal restriction requirements at 40 CFR 268. EPA derived the constituent list from constituents listed in Appendix VII, Basis for Listing Hazardous Waste; Appendix VIII, Hazardous Constituents; and Appendix IX of part 264, the Ground-Water Monitoring List.
<P>
For an eligible waste to exit Subtitle C, every constituent in the waste must be below its exit level. The proposed exit levels are in Appendix X of 40 CFR 261, Tables A and B. Table A includes constituents and their risk exit values which can be measured analytically. Table B includes quantitation limits (exemption quantitation criteria, or EQCs) as exit levels for waste constituents which cannot be measured at the modeled or extrapolated risk value. EPA will require compliance with the land disposal restrictions as an additional condition of exit, for any waste exempted through a constituent exit level on Table B. With each waste stream for which you want an exemption, you'll be required to test the waste for all of the constituents on Appendix X expected to be present in the waste. At a minimum, you must test for the following if they are on Appendix X:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	Appendix VII constituents for which your waste was listed,
<LI>	LDR constituents in 268.40 for the waste,
<LI>	constituents identified in previous analyses of the waste,
<LI>	constituents added to the process that generated the waste, and
<LI>	constituents that you know may be in the waste.
</UL>
<P>
You must also develop and implement a sampling and analysis plan. There is overlap for some constituents between Tables A & B. For example, the wastewater exit level for a constituent may be on Table A, but the nonwastewater exit level may be on Table B. Also, if an exit level does not exist on Table A or B for a particular constituent, the waste need not be tested for that constituent. For example, some constituents that are hydrolyzers have exit levels for nonwastewaters, but not for wastewaters.
<P>
EPA proposed two exit level options. In Option 1, Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCLs) from the Drinking Water program are used as an acceptable toxicity exposure for human drinking water exposure and toxicity benchmarks are used for other exposures. In Option 2, toxicity benchmarks are used as acceptable exposure levels for all exposures. The effect of co-proposing these two options is that there are two independent sets of proposed exit levels. If your web browser supports tables, you may follow this link to <A NAME="TABLEA"></A><A HREF="TABLEA.HTM">see an excerpt of Table A</A>. You may also choose to <A HREF="APPENDIX.HTM">download the entire table here</A>.

<P>

Columns 3, 4, and 5 of proposed Tables A and B include the exit levels based on MCLs. Columns 6, 7, and 8 are the exit levels based on toxicity benchmarks. Columns 1 and 2 include the chemical names and CAS (Chemical Abstracts Service) numbers.
Other steps involved in obtaining this exemption will include notifying EPA, publishing a notice in a local newspaper that you are claiming this exemption, and re-testing or certifying your waste if there are any changes in the information that you submitted. To maintain your exemption, re-testing is required under a schedule that depends on the amount of waste generated each year.

<IMG  SRC="EPAMIX.GIF"  ALT="Oil Mixtures" ALIGN=LEFT>Until recently, the federal used oil rules allowed mixtures of characteristic hazardous waste and used oil which no longer displayed a characteristic to be managed as used oil. On October 30, 1995, EPA announced an administrative stay of the regulations (40 CFR 279.10(b)(2)) applicable to mixtures of used oil destined for recycling and characteristic hazardous waste or waste listed as hazardous because it solely exhibits a hazardous waste characteristic. The stay reinstates the regulatory requirements ordinarily applicable to mixtures containing hazardous waste, along with other applicable regulatory requirements including land-disposal restrictions (LDRs) until the agency completes a new rulemaking. The stay became effective December 29, 1995.
<P> 
The new rulemaking was based upon the Chemical Waste Management, Inc. v. EPA decision which challenged portions of the EPA's LDR regulations because the prior used oil rule allowed dilution of certain characteristic hazardous wastes with used oil instead of treatment. As a result, some such mixtures (or residuals) containing significant levels of hazardous constituents potentially could be disposed in land-disposal units without adequate prior treatment.
<P> 
The court held that dilution only removed the short-term threat posed by the characteristic and did not address the long-term threat posed by hazardous constituents that could be present in such wastes. Therefore, the Chemical Waste Management decision appears to indicate that such mixtures should be subject to LDRs, unless no hazardous constituents are present in concentrations sufficient to pose a threat to human health or the environment.
<P> 
EPA plans to propose a rule in the near future concerning how mixtures of used oil destined for recycling and characteristic hazardous wastes should be regulated under RCRA in light of the Chemical Waste Management decision and other comments. EPA believes that further analysis is needed to determine whether mixtures of used oil destined for recycling and characteristic hazardous wastes differ significantly from other mixtures containing characteristic wastes in terms of potential threat to human health and the environment.
<P> 
According to the ruling, you may not dilute your characteristic hazardous waste to render it non-hazardous. In addition, if the resulting mixture exhibits a characteristic, it must be managed as a hazardous waste. Used oil which is mixed with listed waste (that is not listed solely for a characteristic) will be also be classified as hazardous waste. The stay replaces the used oil mixture regulation (40 CFR 279.10 (b)(2)(iii)) with the hazardous waste mixture rule (40 CFR 261.3 (a)(2)(iii)) and makes the LDRs applicable to all mixtures of used oil and hazardous waste.
<P>
Persons who change their own oil ("do-it-yourselfers") and conditionally exempt small quantity generators (no more than 100 kilograms of hazardous waste per month) will not be impacted by the stay.

On December 6, 1994, (59 FR 62896), the Office of Air and Radiation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency published a new rule adding Subpart CC-Air Emission Standards for Tanks, Surface Impoundments, and Containers to 40 CFR 264-Standards for Owners and Operators of Hazardous Waste Treatment, Storage, and Disposal Facilities. The Office of Air and Radiation is not where we usually expect hazardous waste rules to come from, but in this case, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) required air emission rules for storage or accumulation in tanks, surface impoundments, and containers.
<P>
June 5, 1995 was the effective date originally set by EPA for large quantity generators and owners/operators of treatment, storage, and disposal facilities to comply with the monitoring, documentation, and management of emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from waste streams accumulated in tanks, containers, and surface impoundments. In EPA's estimates, implementation of the subpart CC regulations will reduce nationwide organic emissions from TSD facilities and generator wastes stored in tanks, surface impoundments, and containers by over 1,400,000 metric tons per year. EPA also predicts that the reduction in VOCs will address many air quality problems including ambient ozone formation, adverse human health effects from inhalation of air toxins, and the depletion of stratospheric ozone.
<P>
On May 19, 1995 (60 FR 26828), EPA published a notice delaying the effective date of the new rules until December 6, 1995. Then, on November 13, 1995 (60 FR 56952), EPA further delayed the effective date of the rules until June 6,1996.
<P>
Both notices announcing the postponement of the effective date for the final Subpart CC rules noted that since the initial promulgation, EPA became aware that certain provisions of the final standards may require clarification. EPA plans to publish a later Federal Register document to clarify those provisions. This process may result in compliance options that facilities do not realize are available. To ensure that all options are clear to affected facilities, and to ensure that all affected facilities have time to make any such alterations in their compliance plan prior to the effective date of the standards, EPA is postponing the effective date of the final rule to June 6, 1996.

TRI reporting requirements are expanding! Spring of this year is expected to bring changes in the TRI reporting requirements. EPA plans to announce several changes which will affect facilities required to file Toxic Release Inventory reports, commonly referred to as the TRI or Form R reports.
<P> 
The TRI program was formed under Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, (EPCRA) or SARA Title III, in order to establish a publicly available database of toxic chemical information. Under the Act, facilities are required to report their environmental releases of any of the more than 600 listed toxic chemicals which are made, produced, or used by the facility in quantities equal to or in excess of specified amounts. Reporting facilities must submit their TRI reports to EPA and state agencies annually by July 1 of each year.
<P>
For some time, according to EPA, there has been interest in expanding the TRI to include additional facilities and requiring a more comprehensive data set be reported. The last significant phase of TRI expansion was a 1994 chemical expansion rule that added 286 new chemicals and chemical categories to the TRI list of toxic chemicals. The upcoming second expansion phase adds to the types of industries covered by the TRI requirements. EPA states that the third expansion phase could fill in what the agency says are "remaining data collection gaps" by providing information on chemicals moving through communities and workplaces in products.
<P>
Currently, only facilities that fall within Standard Industrial Classification Codes (SIC) 20-39 and federal facilities have the potential to be subject to regulation under the Section 313 requirements. Industries that EPA is considering for addition to the reporting requirement include electric utilities, waste management facilities, mining, and oil and gas production facilities. Materials recovery and recycling activities as well as certain warehousing activities may also be included.
<P>
According to an EPA issues paper released in the fall of 1995, another change in the TRI reporting program is expected to be announced in March of this year. This modification is an expansion of the type of chemical end use and chemical exposure data that EPA obtains through the TRI reports. The issues paper was in response to an August 8, 1995 memorandum, issued in conjunction with Executive Order No. 12969, from President Clinton to EPA Administrator Carol Browner. In the memorandum, EPA was directed to develop and implement a plan to expand the TRI reporting requirements by adding information on mass balance, materials accounting, or other chemical use data to the reporting form.
<P>
According to the issues paper, EPA may include materials accounting data and worker exposure information in future versions of the TRI report format. Materials accounting (MA) involves determining the amount of a chemical at key points in its progression through the processes at a facility. MA differs from engineering mass balance in that mass balance is a more technical procedure and requires the measurement of process streams. In the past, the National Research Council has concluded that a materials accounting approach would satisfy the public right-to-know intent of TRI and would also create less of a reporting burden to industries subject to these requirements.
<P>
The issues paper stated that EPA is considering adding the following data elements to the TRI:
<P>
<UL>  
<LI>	Starting amount of raw material inventory;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals brought on-site;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals produced or manufactured on-site;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals processed on-site;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals otherwise used;
<LI>	Total input amount of toxic chemicals;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals shipped off-site;
<LI>	Ending raw material amount;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals stored on-site in product;
<LI>	Amount of toxic chemicals shipped off-site in product;
<LI>	Total number of workers on-site;
<LI>	Number of workers potentially exposed to the reported toxic chemicals; and
<LI>	Whether exposure monitoring has been performed at the site.
</UL>
<P>
Six data gaps in the current TRI, which EPA may choose to address in future actions, were identified in the issues paper. These data gaps include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>	Lack of information on the flow and use of toxic chemicals at a facility;
<LI>	Need to track toxic chemicals in products;
<LI>	Need for a scorecard to promote and track pollution prevention/source reduction efforts;
<LI>	Lack of a ledger check on TRI estimates;
<LI>	Need to enhance the TRI for regulatory integration efforts; and 
<LI>	Need to identify and research issues such as multiple chemical exposures.
</UL>

A clear understanding of an employee's work functions and an understanding of the training programs required by each regulatory agency is essential to maintaining compliance with the multiple laws governing training for employees who work with potentially dangerous chemicals. Each employee's duties and the chemicals they work with should be evaluated and documented to establish the applicability of environmental, safety, and health training requirements.
<P>
Take Jeff, for example, a degreaser technician, who operates a parts washing machine that uses methylene chloride. On a weekly schedule, Jeff drains the used degreasing solvent from the machine and places it in 55 gallon drums. The used solvents are transported to a solvent recovery facility to be recycled every 90 days.
Jeff's duties and the chemicals he works with require OSHA hazard communication training, RCRA hazardous waste training, and DOT hazmat training.
<P>
The topics that must be covered under these three programs overlap significantly. Each training program is regulated by a different agency and during an inspection you need to show clear documentation that all employees have met each particular agency's training requirements.
<P>
Due to the complexity of the information that must be presented, the differences in the frequency of training, and the independent certification requirements, employee training documentation must be managed very carefully. In industrial settings where there are many employees who must receive training, a computer database such as <A HREF="TRNTRK.HTM">Training Management Software (TMS)</A> is useful to manage and document training compliance. In <A HREF="TRNTRK.HTM">Training Management Software (TMS)</A>, each employee has an independent file which identifies their work function, the training topics required for that employee, the required frequency of training, and the latest training date for each topic.
<P>
At any time a training record can be generated that shows any or all of the training that Jeff has received. This information can be arranged to document compliance with each regulatory program. Also, the database will warn the user of any employee who has a training deficiency. This allows a manager to track, document, and schedule training modules to ensure compliance.
<P>
When evaluating training compliance, the three regulatory agencies will request to see different types of documentation. The databases allow you to generate pre-selected reports that are specific to the requirements of a regulatory inspection.
<A HREF="TRNTRK.HTM">Training Management Software (TMS)</A>;  is essential to keeping your facility in compliance. See for yourself by calling 1-800-537-2372 for a free demo disk or <A HREF="DEMOS.HTM">download a copy here</A>.

Waste minimization strategies that go <I>Beyond Compliance</I>   are a long term solution to rising waste management costs and disposal liabilities. Preventing or eliminating waste at its source not only makes sense for long term environmental health, it can result in substantial benefits.
<P>
It takes informed employees to achieve waste minimization. Since employees are ultimately the people that will implement waste prevention ideas, make them a part of waste minimization strategies. Teach them the company and employee benefits of waste minimization strategies.
<P>
<H3>Economic Benefits</H3>

Regulations governing the handling, storage, treatment, and disposal of waste have caused a significant increase in waste management costs. Reduction efforts offer a way to reduce disposal, permitting, and insurance costs. Also, production costs are reduced through better management and reuse of spent materials, thus reducing the risk of employee layoffs.
<P> 
You may decide to reward employees for their efforts toward waste minimization. These rewards may be either financial or in the form of personal recognition, or both. You could: 
<OL>
<LI>return some of the savings to the budget of the department that generated the savings; 
<LI>establish a special bonus for teams that achieve their waste minimization goals;
<LI>use some of the savings to buy successful team members "waste buster" jackets or coffee mugs; 
<LI>use the savings for high priority budget items that were not funded; or 
<LI>send your entire team to an Environmental Resource Center workshop in Orlando!
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Decreased Employee Exposure</H3>

Waste minimization strategies that reduce the volume or toxicity of waste also decrease employee exposure to toxic constituents making jobs easier and safer.
<P>
<H3>Environmental Benefits & Minimization of Liability</H3>

Myth No. 1: When waste leaves the plant, it is gone for good. Improper waste management may someday pollute your workers' neighborhoods and potentially harm their families. How we manage (or mismanage) hazardous waste is a crucial environmental issue with vast implications for public health and the ecological systems on which we depend.
<P>
<H3>Improvement of Corporate Image</H3>

Because of several incidents in the past involving industrial wastes, the general public is extremely sensitive to industrial releases and mismanagement of wastes. In addition, the public is becoming increasingly more informed. Consumers are looking at your company's policies, and a positive image associated with reducing waste could improve public perception about your company.
<P>
<H3>Government Mandate</H3>

Section 3002(b) of RCRA requires hazardous waste generators who ship hazardous waste off-site to certify on the manifest that an economically practicable waste minimization program is in place at their facilities, and the generator has selected the practicable method of treatment, storage, or disposal currently available. Section 3005(h) requires owners/operators of permitted on-site treatment, storage, and disposal facilities to make the same certification at least annually. Small quantity generators certify on the manifest that they have made a good faith effort to minimize the generation of hazardous waste and have selected the best, affordable waste management method available.
<P>
This column, "Waste Minimization Pays Off" explores what companies have done to minimize or prevent waste. Sharing successful waste minimization programs will serve to benefit everyone. If your company has had success in waste minimization and you would like to share your experience, please <A HREF="mailto:mrandall@ercweb.com">e-mail</A> or mail your story to

Confronted with escalating costs for waste disposal and concerns for increased liabilities, companies and government agencies and installations that generate waste have responded with waste minimization strategies. Many of these minimization strategies go <I>Beyond Compliance</I> .
Frequently, good materials are disposed of as waste before they are spent. Employees are usually the first to recognize waste, and with encouragement, can minimize waste. Here are just four ways employees can save money:<BR>
 
<OL>
<LI>Many preventative maintenance programs set specific times to change filter media; instead, encourage employees to change filters only when they are spent. An increase in pressure drop, indicated by a differential pressure gage, across the filter bag is a good indicator that it is time to change a dirty filter. Also available are filters on rolls that automatically advance when the pressure across the filter media builds up.
<LI>Many materials that are removed from filter housing, pipes or hoses, and containers may still be usable. Frequently, these materials can be used directly in the process or transferred to a new container.
<LI>Material losses from spills, leaks, and evaporation are difficult to measure and are often underestimated. Consequently, these losses are often a low priority. One leak, extrapolated over a year, and multiplied by the number of such leaks can be significant. Although it seems obvious, we often fail to recognize that material leaking is being paid for three times. First, as raw materials; second, for disposal; and third, to replace it. The best leak detection system available today may be employees.
<LI>Create an in-plant waste exchange. If one department or shop area has unused or partially used materials that they want to dispose of, check to see if another department needs it before they dispose of it. Anything from unused bench stock or partially filled aerosol containers is a candidate. If you can't use it on-site, maybe someone else can use it off-site. Make sure, however, that wastes use it for a beneficial purpose and be sure that they are not speculatively accumulated.

The International Standards Organization (ISO) has established standards for environmental compliance that go well beyond simply meeting legal requirements.  These standards make up the ISO 14001 program. The five elements of the program include:
<BR>

<OL>
<LI>Commitment and Policy
<LI>Planning
<LI>Implementation
<LI>Measurement and Evaluation
<LI>Review and Improvement
</OL>

<BR>
If your organization has been involved with the ISO 9000 standards related to quality certification, you will note a definite similarity.  The intent of the ISO 14001 standards is to define structured systems that recognize organizations with a systematic approach to continual improvement of environmental management. Although the final requirements of the ISO certification process have not yet been confirmed by all of the ISO committees, there is currently enough information available to allow you to begin preparations.
Start the process by establishing your organization's policy and commitment statements and conducting a survey of your existing systems to determine actions or changes which will be required to meet the standards.
During the survey of your existing systems, you should:

<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Identify the legislative and regulatory requirements which impact your facility
<LI>Identify the environmental aspects of all activities, products, and services produced or conducted at your facility to determine which may produce significant environmental impact or liabilities
<LI>Evaluate your performance compared to relevant internal criteria, external standards, regulations, codes of practice, and benchmarks
<LI>Determine your existing environmental management practices and procedures
<LI>Identify existing policies and procedures related to procurement and contracting
<LI>Examine feedback and reports from the investigations of previous incidents or non-compliance situations
<LI>Examine opportunities for competitive advantage in your industry due to your management of environmental issues
<LI>Determine the views of all parties that will be incorporated into the program from existing programs
<LI>Determine existing functions or activities that may enable or impede environmental performance
</UL><BR>


Concurrent with the review process, your organization should establish a formal policy which clearly defines your organization's commitment and goals related to the environment, continual review, and improvement.  It is not necessary for this statement to stand alone; it may be part of a larger organizational policy statement, but certain elements must be present in order to establish it as an ISO 14001 policy statement.
The following questions can serve as a guide to the construction of your policy statement:

<BR>
<OL>
<LI>Does your organization currently have an environmental policy that is relevant to all of your activities, as well as any products or services produced?
<LI>Does the policy reflect your organization's values and guiding principles?
<LI>Has the environmental policy been approved by top management and has someone been identified and given the authority to oversee and implement the policy?
<LI>Does the policy guide the setting of environmental objectives and targets?
<LI>Does the policy guide your organization towards monitoring appropriate technology and management practices?
<LI>What commitments are embodied in the environmental policy (e.g. support for continual improvement, support for pollution prevention, meeting and monitoring legal requirements, worker training, considering the expectations of other interested parties, etc.)?
</OL>
<BR>

The policy should be a comprehensive document designed to guide the progress of the company in environmental compliance throughout many years to come. While the policy may be used to set short term goals and objectives, specific items should not be included in the policy.  The inclusion of specific items in a guiding policy will make it necessary to revise the policy frequently and undermine its credibility as a long-term document.
Once your organization has completed the review process and developed a policy statement, you will be well on your way to compliance with ISO 14001 standards when they are finalized. This early preparation will pay off in dividends of lowered compliance costs, higher quality goods and services, and goodwill towards your neighbors for years to come.<BR>

<CENTER><H1>How to Determine SARA Reportable Chemicals</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER><h5>Esther Christian<br>
Environmental Consultant</h5></CENTER><BR>

As 1995 ends, you should be thinking of your Tier II reports required by SARA Title III (Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act). Although these reports are not due until March 1, you can compile your reportable information now and even beat the reporting deadline this year!
Two groups of chemicals must be reported on the Tier II form: 1) OSHA Hazardous Chemicals present in a quantity of 10,000 pounds or greater and 2) Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS) present in a quantity greater than or equal to 500 pounds or the Threshold Planning Quantity (TPQ) of the chemical (whichever of these quantities is the more stringent reporting requirement applies).<BR>

This article presents a 4-step process to determine which chemicals must be reported on your Tier II. Additionally, we've included some tips to help you organize your chemical inventory control program so that next year the determination process will be a snap!<br>

<h2>Hazardous Chemical Inventory</h2>

Survey all operations at your facility to identify all OSHA hazardous chemicals that your facility manufactures, processes, uses, and stores on-site. Walk through every work area, examine every process, and look into each storage area. Compile a list by gathering and studying all Material Safety Data Sheets, searching records for all chemicals that have been purchased since May 17,1987, and surveying all department managers.<BR>

Be careful not to limit your search to just those chemicals you believe are dangerous. For SARA Title III reporting, the term "hazardous chemical" is used as it is defined at 29 CFR 1910.1200, OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard. This means that any chemical with a physical or health hazard associated with it must be considered in your determination. However, if a material is exempt from consideration as an OSHA hazardous chemical under 29 CFR 1910.1200, it is also exempt from the SARA Title III reporting requirements.
Chemicals with physical hazards include combustible liquids, compressed gases, explosives, flammables, organic peroxides, oxidizers, pyrophorics, unstable reactives, or water reactives. Chemicals with health hazards are those that may cause immediate or delayed health effects. This includes chemicals that are carcinogens, toxic or highly toxic agents, reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, hepatotoxins, nephrotoxins, neurotoxins, materials that act on the hematopoietic system, and materials that damage the lungs, skin, eyes, or mucous membranes.<BR>

As you conduct your on-site search, you should compile a list of every hazardous chemical that you encounter. As you determine which materials are hazardous chemicals, list the names as they appear on the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS). Also, if known, indicate the appropriate storage code and storage location. Consider organizing your list as shown in Figure 1.<br>

<H2>Check MSDS Records for All Hazardous Chemicals</H2>
Obtain or develop an MSDS for every chemical that you have on your list. Write or call immediately for any missing MSDSs. Prepare a checklist so that you can cross out each chemical when the requested MSDS arrives and easily note those that do not arrive. Check each MSDS to be certain it is for the chemical that is used at your site, and that the MSDS is legible and complete.<br>

<H2>Identify Extremely Hazardous Substances</H2>
Next, determine if any of the materials identified for your hazardous chemical list are comprised entirely of or contain any Extremely Hazardous Substances (EHS). The EHS list, including threshold planning quantities (TPQ), is published as Appendices A and B of 40 CFR 355.<BR>
 
You can typically obtain most information for each material from the MSDS. The name of each EHS should next be added to your list in the column marked "EHS Name" on Figure 1. Also, enter the TPQ for the EHS in the column marked "TPQ." Enter the percent by weight of each EHS present in each material on your list. Compile the total number of pounds present at your facility for any EHS present. This total (aggregate) amount for each EHS is compared to the 500 lb./TPQ reporting trigger.<BR>

One important concept to remember when making the TPQ determination is that you may encounter an EHS with two TPQs on the EHS list, such as phenol (500/10,000 lbs.). A material with two TPQs is a solid under conditions of standard temperature and pressure. The regulations state that you must use the lower number if any of the following three criteria are met for an EHS:
<UL>
<LI> the solid exists in powdered form and has a particle size less than 100 microns, or
<LI> the solid is handled in solution or in molten form, or
<LI> the solid meets the criteria for a National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) rating of 2, 3, or 4 for reactivity (refer to NFPA 704 in their latest edition of "Fire Protection Guide on Hazardous Materials").
</UL><br>

<H2>Identify Chemical Inventory Amounts</H2>
Enter the maximum amount and average amount for each material on-site. The maximum amount on-site would be based on your facility's chemical inventories over the previous calendar year. All measures of quantity must be converted to pounds. While this presents little challenge if your facility purchases a material as a solid, a calculation is required if a material is present on-site as a liquid or gas. If the material is a liquid, the calculation requires a specific gravity or density as well as a volume amount. To convert gallons to pounds, perform one of the following two calculations:<BR>

<OL>
<LI>  (Gallons of Liquid) x (Specific Gravity) x (8.3 lbs/gal) = Pounds of Liquid
<LI>  (Gallons of Liquid) x (Density of Liquid) = Pounds of Liquid If the material is a gas, you are only required to determine the number of pounds of the gas on-site, i.e., you need not include the weight of the gas cylinder. The pounds of a gas are calculated in a similar fashion as the pounds of a liquid. You need to know whether the material in the cylinder is a gas or has been com-pressed to a liquid, and the corresponding vapor or liquid density (the density of a liquid is not equal to the density of a vapor). Pounds can then be determined by adapting equation (2) into one of the two following forms:
<LI>  (Volume of Gas*) x (Density of Vapor) = Pounds of Gas	
<LI>  (Volume of Liquid*) x (Density of Liquid) = Pounds of Liquid *  a conventional unit of measure is "cubic feet," in which case density would carry units of pounds per cubic foot.
</OL>

There are "de minimis" exemptions when regulated substances are present in mixtures at very low concentrations. EPA allows you to omit materials from your Tier determination that are present in very small amounts.
Under Section 312 of SARA Title III, components of mixtures only need to be factored into your determinations if the hazardous component is present in a concentration of greater than 1% (by weight) or 0.1% (by weight) for materials considered by OSHA to be carcinogens.<BR>
 
The data obtained in steps 1 - 4 will be all you need to complete your Tier II forms. If you find that you have to report on more than a few chemicals, it might be easier to use software to collect the data and print the forms. Use the order form and select product number 1099 for a demo disk of software that can create your Tier II reports as well as the Form R report that is required by Section 313 of SARA Title III.<BR>

A new and enhanced Material Inventory Report System (MIRS) version 3.4 was just announced and will be available in January. This easy-to-use, modular program offers automated solutions for SARA Title III reporting (including Tier I, Tier II, and Form R), MSDS management, CAA management, waste tracking, inventory tracking, NPDES, and state/local reporting.<P>
 
For the 1995 reporting year, there are a number of SARA Title III changes. EPA has added 286 chemicals to the TRI reportable chemicals list (there are now over 5,700 identified chemicals for the section 313 Form R alone). EPA also has made some important delisting decisions involving acetone and ammonium sulfate solution.<P>

MIRS software will keep you current every year <I>before</I>  the deadlines. You will also be one step ahead of EPA with thorough work sheets, audit trails, and multi-year reports.<P>

Whether you work on the latest Pentium workstation over a sophisticated network or on an older stand-alone DOS machine, there is a version of MIRS to meet your needs. The Windows version of MIRS is Windows `95 compatible and offers new features like automatic print driver compatibility, which is especially useful for network applications.<P>
 
Other MIRS features include read-only network access of company MSDS records, an expanded CAA module, a Chemical List Extension that has over 13,000 chemicals/categories, plus analysis and reporting capabilities of consolidated information with the Corporate MIRS module.<P>
 
MIRS continues to offer you the best set of tools for greatly simplifying your environmental compliance and safety data management responsibilities. To learn more or to request a demo, call 1-800-537-2372 or you may choose to <A HREF="DEMOS.HTM">download a demo here</A>.

There is a new reference for environmental, health and safety professionals that will change the way you think of Material Safety Data Sheets. Imagine how much file space it would take to hold over 162,000 MSDSs. Now imagine them all on two CD-ROMs. The MSDS Database on CD-ROM includes all products and chemicals purchased by the U. S. government that require material safety data sheets and is considered the largest and most comprehensive compilation of its kind in the world.<P>
Each MSDS record contains over 230 data fields, including:
<UL>
<LI>product identification data
<LI>general information
<LI>health hazard data
<LI>physical/chemical characteristics
<LI>fire and explosive hazard data
<LI>reactivity data
<LI>precautions for safe handling and use
<LI>control measures
<LI>disposal data
<LI>label data
<LI>ingredient data
<LI>record control data and more!
</UL>
<BR>

A complete search and retrieval engine is built-in, and information from the database may be sent to a printer or exported as either an ASCII or dBase file.<P>

The price for an annual subscription, which includes quarterly updates, is $325. Access over a local area network is available at no additional cost. In addition to using the database to locate MSDSs for the products you use today, you can also use it to find safer alternates, competitive products, or to find out the composition and hazards of products that you are considering for purchase. This thorough resource is an excellent value that you can order today by calling 1-800-537-2372 (ask for product #1255).<P>
