&QUOT;d.Comm is a new concept in publishing: it is a complete magazine, but 
is only available on the Internet.  It is not just a a Web site and it 
is not a mirror of a paper-based product. d.Comm covers all types of 
information technology issues, from the desktop PC through networking 
issues, to communications.  We aim to provide you with all the 
information that you need to keep up to date. The information within 
d.Comm is updated regularly.  News items are published as soon as we 
hear about them, not at the next fixed publishing date.  New features 
are posted once a month, replacing the previous month's features.  
However, old features never die and can be accessed via the search 
facility.  The aim is to eventually provide a comprehensive source of 
past and present issues within the IT industry. 
<BR>
We also aim to make life easy for you.  To this end, you can 
personalise the magazine to your own requirements.

A BRIEF CITATION GUIDE FOR INTERNET SOURCES IN HISTORY AND THE 
HUMANITIES (Version 2.1)</H2>

<p>
The following suggestions for citations of Internet sources in
history and the humanities are derived from the essential principles
of academic citation in Kate L. Turabian, <I>A Manual for Writers of
Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations</i>, 5th ed. (Chicago,
University of Chicago Press, 1987).  I have also drawn upon
suggestions from some of the works listed in the bibliography below.

<p>
Since version 1.0 appeared, many people have raised issues about
both internet and humanities citation standards.  The comments of
readers and users of earlier versions have been particularly helpful
in making revisions and refinements in the Guide.  It has also been
improved by the the students of my Historical Methods classes at East
Tennessee State University and my fellow H-AFRICA editors.  I thank
all of these individuals for their assistance.

<p>
Since the Internet is an evolving institution, this Guide is not 
intended to be definitive.  Corrections, additions, comments, 
suggestions, and criticisms are therefore welcome.  Please address 
them to the author at:

<p>

<p>
When the need for further revisions and updates become apparent, new 
versions of the Guide will be issued.  These can be found at the 
following URL:

<a name="null"><h1>General Citation Considerations</h1></a>

<p>
In some ways, the Internet poses problems for those who want to make
fixed references to documents which are frequently less than
permanent and generally subject to alteration.  Yet historians and
humanists have for generations faced similar problems in citing
sources.  Private correspondence held by families of its recipients
or in duplicate copies made the authors, for example, has long posed 
citation difficulties similar in nature to individual e-mail 
correspondence (and gopher and World Wide Web sites as well).

<p>
New electronic information technology, however, has brought with it
advocates of scholarly citations whose concerns are designed first
to meet the needs of the new technology and only then the interests
of humanistic scholarship.  In contrast, historians and their
brethern have scholarly inclinations that lead them in two
directions:  one toward the need for precision in identifying a
source and its provenance; the other focusing on a desire to provide
a guide to a source's location for subsequent researchers.

<p>
The date of a source, for example, is one area where the two
views are sometimes far apart, as has been made clear in numerous
comments and questions about previous versions of this Guide.  For
information technologists, the most recent posting date for a Web or
gopher site in which a document is found generally provides the best
date for a citation.  Yet historians are more interested in the date
when a particular document was written or created.  The preference 
here has been for the latter.

<p>
Another problem involves the citation of e-mail correspondence.  Such
sources are seen as undependable by information technologists unless
they exist in some electronic archive; the archive then becomes the
primary source citation.  Humanistic scholars also are concerned
about issues of impermanence, such as the question of paper documents 
which, once cited, are donated to an obscure library or archive,  
even destroyed.  Yet their citations are to the original source, and 
only secondarily indicate a new location or note the material is no 
longer extant.  Such practice seems appropriate for historian's 
citations of Internet materials as well.

<p>
At the same time, there are certain conventions in the use of the
Internet which require the attention of humanities scholars.  It is
appropriate, for example, to recognize the convention of using
pointed brackets, < >, to enclose electronic addresses.  Standard
Internet practice is also to put the address on one line so that, if
a hypertext link to that address is created, it can be easily and 
accurately read.  An address which continues onto a second line often 
cannot be read as a complete address.  But in print citations it is 
often preferable for the address continue from one line to another.  
When that is necessary, the compromise suggested here is that 
punctuation marks in Internet addresses (such as @ . or / but not ~) 
be at the end of one line with only letters, numbers, or ~ beginning 
on the next line.

<p>
Generally, the use of URL (Uniform Resource Locator) addresses is
also preferred for most Internet materials.  Nonetheless, humanists
who for the time being access material at gopher sites through a
gopher address, following a particular menu path, or by anonymous 
File Transfer Protocol (ftp) may prefer a citation format that 
actually replicates how they found the material.  (This may change as 
URL access through the World Wide Web becomes more universal).

<p>
There are also questions about how to deal with frequent changes in 
Internet addresses, especially as Web sites are updated and expanded.  
Even the best attempts at citing such material may lead subsequent 
researchers to a dead end.  This is a particular concern not just for 
humanists, but also for information technologists.  No method of 
citation can overcome this particular problem which, instead, cries 
out for great foresight in planning Web sites in addition to careful
explanations and Web links to materials which may be moved.

<p>
The use of an author's e-mail address was also mentioned as a
concern by some of those who commented on earlier versions of this
Guide.  Such citations can, indeed, be problematic.  Please be
considerate of those whose work you cite.  In this Guide the only
addresses included are those which are a part of the public record
(for example, listed at the WWW or gopher site in the citation) or
for which permission has been obtained.

<p>
Finally, it should be noted again that this Guide is based upon
citation principles contained in Turabian's <I>Manual</i>.  This has led
to certain conventions which would not appear in other formats.  One
of these is the representation of italics for book and journal
titles.  These are indicated here by opening and ending asterisks
(* *) in the belief that they are more distinctive on the 
computer screen than other possibilities, such as opening and ending 
underscoring (_ _).

<p>
Some historians advocate using other basic citation principles 
and formats--such as MLA or APA--especially for electronic sources.  
There are also a variety of questions raised for citations of CD-ROM, 
binary files, and other electronic materials.  While these issues are 
not addresses in this Guide, the bibliography below will lead to 
citation suggestions for some of these applications.

<hr>



<p>1.  E-mail discussion lists constitute one of the most popular methods of group communication

on the Internet.  Discussion lists support group communication by providing, at minimum, two

basic functions: (1) the ability to distribute a message to a group of people by sending it to a

single, central address, and (2) the ability to quietly join and leave the list at any time.



<p>1.1.  In order to provide these separate functions, an e-mail discussion list typically has two

addresses associated with it: (1) a "listname address," the address to which you send any

messages that you intend to be read by the list subscribers; and (2) an "administrative address,"

the address to which you send any commands or requests that affect your subscription to the list. 

It's easy to remember this distinction by thinking of your local newspaper: the first address is

somewhat analogous to sending a "letter to the editor,"  while the second is like sending a letter

to the newspaper's subscription office.



<p>1.2.  With most discussion lists, the "administrative address" is a computer program that allows

the subscriber to subscribe and unsubscribe automatically, without external intervention.  There

are at least five popular mail server programs used to manage Internet discussion lists: REVISED

LISTSERV (also called BITNET LISTSERV), Unix ListProcessor (or Listproc), Mailbase,

Mailserv, and Majordomo.  The commands for subscribing and unsubscribing under most of

these programs are the same; however, other useful commands differ greatly from one program

to another, and some programs support features that others do not.



<p>1.3.  This document does not describe all the features supported by any of these programs, only

those most commonly used.  For more information on any of these programs, send a message

containing only the word "help" to the appropriate mail server.  Additional programs and

commands will be added in future revisions of this document.



<p>1.4.  This document also does not deal with discussion lists to which one subscribes by sending a

message to "[listname]-request," sometimes referred to as "Internet lists."  There are a great many

discussion lists of this type; some are distribution lists maintained manually by the listowner,

while others use some form of mailer software ranging from a simple script to a fairly

sophisticated mailing list program.  Some require that subscription requests be placed in the

message text; others require them to be included in the Subject: line.  Because of the variety of

methods of maintaining these lists, it is impossible to generalize about their command features. 

However, as a rule, assume that any discussion list with an administrative address of "[listname]-request" is maintained manually by a human being.  Accordingly, you should subscribe by

sending a friendly message in plain English to "[listname]-request."  If a program responds with

instructions for subscribing, follow the instructions.



<p>1.5.  The latest version of this document is available by e-mail and by anonymous ftp, as well as on the World Wide Web:



<pre>

    E-mail:   Send a message containing only the line 

              <b>GET MAILSER CMD NETTRAIN F=MAIL</b>

              to LISTSERV@UBVM.cc.buffalo.edu.



    FTP:      Anonymous ftp to ubvm.cc.buffalo.edu

              cd /nettrain

              get mailser.cmd



                -- or --



              anonymous ftp to lawlib.slu.edu

              get mailser.cmd



    Web:      http://lawlib.slu.edu/training/mailser.htm

</pre>



<p>2.  When you subscribe to a list, you will typically receive a "welcome" message, describing the

purpose of the list and telling you how to unsubscribe.  <b>Save this message!</b>  It tells you which

program the discussion list is run under, and how to get further help.



<p>2.1.  Mail servers can be confusing.  Many people use the term "listserv" generically, to refer to

any list mail server program.  To make things worse, the Unix ListProcessor (listproc) program

was originally called "listserv," just like REVISED LISTSERV.  Many listproc hosts are still

configured with the name "listserv," and will accept commands addressed to "listserv@[host]" as

well as to the correct name, "listproc@[host]."



<p>2.2.  Usually--but not always--you can find out which program a discussion list is run under by

examining the message headers.  For instance, listproc lists should include a line saying "Unix

ListProcessor."  However, the best practice is to save any "welcome" message you receive when

you subscribe, and to note at that time which set of commands is applicable.



<p>3.  Remember to send all commands to the "administrative address"--[mailserver]@[host]--not to

the "listname address".  [Mailserver] is the program that maintains the list (either listproc,

LISTSERV, mailbase, mailserv, or majordomo); [host] is the address of the host computer (for

example, ucdavis.edu or cleo.murdoch.edu.au).



<p>3.1.  Be sure to leave the Subject: line blank, and to delete any signature file if your mailer allows

you to do so.



<p>3.2.  Always include the name of the list in the message to [mailserver]@[host].  Most mailserver

sites maintain many 

different discussion lists, and it is essential that you tell the mail server

which list you are talking about.



<p>3.3.  For instance, to join the discussion list <b>law-lib@ucdavis.edu</b>, send an e-mail message

containing only the command 



<pre>

    <b>SUBSCRIBE LAW-LIB John Doe</b>

</pre>



    to listproc@ucdavis.edu.



<p>The other examples used below are:



<p><b>INT-LAW@UMINN1.BITNET</b> (REVISED LISTSERV), <b>law-europe@mailbase.ac.uk</b>

(Mailbase), <b>envirolaw@oregon.uoregon.edu</b> (Mailserv),and <b>elaw-j@cleo.murdoch.edu.au</b>

(Majordomo).

                <b>REVIEW [listname] BY NAME F=MAIL</b> 

                -- or --

                <b>REVIEW [listname] BY COUNTRY F=MAIL</b>

    Listproc:   <b>SET [listname] CONCEAL YES</b>

                (To reverse this command, use:)

                <b>SET [listname] CONCEAL NO</b>

    LISTSERV:   <b>SET [listname] CONCEAL</b>

                (To reverse this command, use:)

                <b>SET [listname] NOCONCEAL</b>

    Mailbase:   Not supported.

    Mailserv:   Not supported.

</pre>



<p><b>Obtain a list of lists maintained by this mail server:</b>



<pre>

    Listproc:   <b>LISTS</b>

    LISTSERV:   <b>LISTS</b>

</pre>

To obtain a list of all known LISTSERV lists, send the command 



<pre>

                <b>LISTS GLOBAL</b> 

</pre>

To search for LISTSERV lists with a given keyword or character string in the description, send

the command



<pre>

                <b>LISTS GLOBAL /[keyword]</b> 

                e.g., <b>LISTS GLOBAL /LAW</b>

    Mailbase:   <b>LISTS</b>

    Mailserv:   <b>DIRECTORY/LIST</b>

    Majordomo:  <b>LISTS</b>

</pre>



<p><b>Obtain a listing of archive files for a particular list:</b>



<pre>

    Listproc:   <b>INDEX [listname]</b>

    LISTSERV:   <b>INDEX [listname]</b>

    Mailbase:   <b>INDEX [listname]</b>

    Mailserv:   <b>INDEX [listname]</b>

    Majordomo:  <b>INDEX [listname]</b>

</pre>



<p><b>Retrieve an archive file:</b>



<pre>

    Listproc:   <b>GET [listname] [filename]</b>

                (e.g., <b>GET LAW-LIB feb94</b>)

    LISTSERV:   <b>GET [filename] [filetype] [listname] F=MAIL</b>

                (e.g., <b>GET INT-LAW LOG9406 INT-LAW F=MAIL</b>)

    Mailbase:   <b>SEND [listname] [filename]</b>

                (e.g., <b>SEND LAW-EUROPE 05-1994</b>)

    Mailserv:   <b>SEND [listname] [filename]</b>

                (e.g., <b>SEND ENVIROLAW smith.txt</b>)

    Majordomo:  <b>GET [listname] [filename]</b>

                (e.g., <b>GET ELAW-J BOYLE.TXT</b>)

</pre>



<p><b>Search the archives for keywords (where available--some lists do not keep archives):</b>



<pre>

    Listproc:   <b>SEARCH [listname] "[keywords]"</b>

</pre>



<p>Boolean searches are possible using the symbols "&amp;" (and), "|" (or), and "~" (not).  For example,

to search for "mead" or "mdc" in law-lib, use the command 



<pre>

                <b>SEARCH LAW-LIB "mead | mdc"</b>



    LISTSERV:

</pre>

LISTSERV uses a sophisticated and powerful search engine that does lots of neat things like

finding "sounds like" matches; however, it uses a difficult, batch-coded search language to

construct queries.  I find it useful to keep a "template" file in my Internet account, and then edit

the file as appropriate when I need to do a search.  Here's the search file:



<pre>

                //  JOB  Echo=No

                Database Search DD=Rules

                //Rules DD   *

                Search nafta in int-law since 93/6/1

                Index

                /*



</pre>



To run a search, send this file in an e-mail message to LISTSERV@[host].  The <b>Search</b> line can

be modified as needed.  The date is optional; Boolean combinations, nesting with parentheses,

and a great number of other capabilities are supported.  For a full description of LISTSERV

search functions, send the command



<pre>

                <b>GET LISTDB MEMO F=MAIL</b> 

</pre>



to LISTSERV@UMINN1.BITNET.



<p>Once you've received a list of messages matching your query, send another message to

LISTSERV@[host] to retrieve the specific messages you want:



<pre>

                //  JOB  Echo=No

                Database Search DD=Rules

                //Rules DD   *

                Search nafta in int-law since 93/6/1

                Print all of 636 637 640

                /*



    Mailbase:

</pre>

Archives of Mailbase lists are searchable through the Mailbase Gopher (gopher mailbase.ac.uk). 

Mailbase does not support batch searching by e-mail request.



<pre>

    Mailserv:   Not supported.



    Majordomo:  Not supported.

<LI><STRONG>Internet Services - </STRONG>The Library provides
access to the Internet and the World-Wide Web from public computers
in the library. We also maintain selective lists of links to WWW
pages we have explored and judged useful to one or more of our
various user groups. We verify these links periodically to 
be sure they are still functional. You can access any of these lists 
and will probably find items of interest especially
in the professional areas of your studies, but we expect you will
usually find the <A HREF="slinks.htm">Student WWW Links</A> or 
<A HREF="mslinks.htm">Medical Students & Interns</A> lists
of most immediate interest.

<LI>
<STRONG>Literature Searches -</STRONG> 
The Staff can do research for you on topics related to your work. We have access to over
400 databases through seven online vendors to supplement our databases
on CD-ROM. Abstracts, if available, are always printed unless
you request they be deleted. If the topic is solely related to
your course work and you need to use our library rather than your
school's, we ask you use the indexes, CD-ROM sources or WinSpirs which
is currently available on four public computers in the library and can
access Medline (1990 to date), Cummulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health
and HealthStar through the Internet. This results in no additional direct 
costs to the library since these are all subscription services. We will, 
of course, be glad  to show you how to use these sources.
<BR>
<P>

<LI>
<IMG SRC="../graphics/cds1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><STRONG>
CD-ROM
Databases -</STRONG> The Library has CD-ROM databases available
for use by North Memorial affiliates. Subscriptions to indexes
in regularly updated CD-ROM format enable you to search for journal
articles in medical, nursing, allied health and health care management
sources. Results of your searches can be printed or downloaded
to diskette. The Library also has begun to purchase some reference
works on CD-ROM.
<BR>
<P>

<LI><STRONG>Photocopying -</STRONG> You can request photocopies
of journal articles or book sections from the Library collection.
Copying is charged to you at 10 cents a page for articles not
directly related to your work. The copying is done by the Library
Staff and the U.S. copyright law requires we have a request card
completed by you for each item. Most of our copying is done between
11 a.m. and 3 p.m., and we try to fill all requests daily. Copies
can be picked up at the wall rack on the pillar to the left of the
main desk as you face it. The Library generally will not copy anything 
except library materials.
<BR>
<P>

<LI><STRONG>Interlibrary Loans -</STRONG> The Library has arrangements
with other libraries locally, regionally and nationally, to obtain
items not in our collection. Because the time needed to receive
materials varies from 2 days to a week or more (depending on where
we can find it), please let us know if you have a deadline. If
items are needed for immediate patient care, we can also use fax
service to get articles usually within a couple of hours. All
costs for interlibrary loans for medical and work-related requests
are covered by the Library; we do ask you to remember the minimal
costs of an interlibrary loan, including staff processing time,
are about $8.00 per item (sometimes significantly more) and moderation 
is requested. Because of the costs involved and the uncertainties of time, 
interlibrary loans for courses should be directed through the library 
of your educational institution.
<BR>
<P>

<LI><IMG SRC="../graphics/assistmd.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><STRONG>Reference
Assistance -</STRONG> The Staff can assist you in the use of CD-ROMs,
catalogs, indexes, reference books and other materials in our
collection including the media of the Multimedia Center and in the use
of the Internet which is available on five public computers in the
library. You can also call or use e-mail to request any of our services
by mail, e-mail or fax as the situation requires. Please do not
hesitate to ask for assistance.<BR>

RESPONSIBILITIES:</STRONG></FONT></H4>
<P>

<OL>
<LI>Please remember our collection is relatively small and we
seldom have more than one copy of a book or journal. Return materials
promptly so they are available for others to use. The Library
does not have daily overdue fines, but you will be charged for
the replacement cost of material according to our overdue guidelines
if the material is not returned. Please note &quot;replacement
cost&quot; includes processing; it is much cheaper to buy a copy
off the retail shelf than to forget to return an item to ours.
<LI>Help us to help you by filling out our request forms, pulling
materials from the shelf when you are in the Library, and allowing
enough time for us to get your project done whenever possible.
We'll try to be flexible to your individual needs, but we also
have the needs of all our other users to meet.<BR>

This list is selective and limited to those sites the library
staff has actually reached. <EM>Inclusion of a source does not
imply the Library or North Memorial endorses the content of any
site, nor does exclusion imply we have examined the site and found
it misleading or useless.</EM> While the lack of an explanatory
note about a site means little (except perhaps the name is self-explanatory),
notes have been added when special features have been noticed.
These links are checked periodically to verify they are still
active. A failure to connect does not necessarily mean the site
is inactive. It could be:
<UL>
<LI>the site is busy and not accepting new users at that time,
<LI>the site is temporarily down when you tried to reach it,
<LI>the site is only available to external users outside of its
normal local business hours,
<LI>a computer in the routing sequence is overloaded and refuses
to accept and pass on your request.
</UL>

<P>
If you continue to have problems reaching a site, please let us
know.<BR>
<P>

Don't forget to check out local offerings of occupational and continuing education programs 
from <A HREF="http://www.nmmc.com/CE/"> North Continuing Education</A> which has regularly 
updated listings of a variety of courses.
<BR>
<P>

<IMG SRC="../graphics/tip.gif" ALT="[Tips Icon]" ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BLINK>REMEMBER</BLINK> if you're looking for a specific site you believe is listed on a page, most browsers will let you use the command EDIT/FIND or something very similar to search for a particular word or phrase on a hypertext page. For instance, if you're looking for the Virtual Hospital, rather than paging down through multiple screens, you can use Edit/Find to go directly to the first and each subsequent use of "virtual" on a page.

This list is selective and limited to those sites the library
staff has actually reached. <EM>Inclusion of a source does not
imply the Library or North Memorial endorses the content of any
site, nor does exclusion imply we have examined the site and found
it misleading or useless.</EM> While the lack of an explanatory
note about a site means little (except perhaps the name is self-explanatory),
notes have been added when special features have been noticed.
These links are checked periodically to verify they are still
active. A failure to connect does not necessarily mean the site
is inactive. It could be:
<UL>
<LI>the site is busy and not accepting new users at that time,
<LI>the site is temporarily down when you tried to reach it,
<LI>the site is only available to external users outside of its
normal local business hours,
<LI>a computer in the routing sequence is overloaded and refuses
to accept and pass on your request.

<STRONG>REMEMBER</STRONG></BLINK> if you're looking for a specific site you believe is listed 
on a page, most browsers will let you use the command EDIT/FIND or something very similar to 
search for a particular word or phrase on a hypertext page. For instance, if you're looking 
for the Virtual Hospital, rather than paging down through multiple screens, you can use 
Edit/Find to go directly to the first and each subsequent use of "virtual" on a page.

OVERVIEW
</STRONG></H3>
<BR>
<P> 

The vision of medical providers accessing computer consultation
networks and worldwide databases of text and images has been partially
realized in 1995. There has been a tremendous growth in the use of
Internet web browsers, medical multimedia files, and interactive
forums.  The breadth of global medical knowledge and the analytic
ability of high speed computing has begun to be applied to clinical
practice problems.
<BR>
<P>
      In 1995 medical practitioners can locate pathology, dermatology,
radiographic images and multimedia learning modules on Internet.  News,
product information, and conference announcements are available well
before they arrive by print media.  Many major publishers and medical
organizations including the <A  HREF="http://www.ama-assn.org/register.htm"> American Medical Association</A>, and <A  HREF="http://hpb1.hwc.ca:8400/"> Canadian Medical Association</A>, have posted web pages and
provide information about their organizations and publications. The
<A  HREF="http://www.bmj.com/bmj/"> British Medical Journal</A> is one of the first well known medical journals to post full text and archived articles. 
Many other publishers are establishing a presence on Internet
anticipating an era of fee based subscription services. 
<BR>
<P>
     Internet <A  HREF="HTTP://www-
sci.lib.uci.edu/~martindale/Medical.html"> medical multimedia modules</A> simululate the experience of real patient encounters.  Busy medical practioners can take advantage of on-line access to well maintained, current, quick reference guides and clinical guidelines.  Clinicians are installing desktop computers,
selecting valuable resources and entering these on &quot;hot lists&quot;. It is
increasingly clear Internet references are low cost, contain
unique search features and can offer an interlinking of state of the
art medical multimedia information.
<BR>
<P> 

<H3><STRONG>
POINT OF CARE REFERENCE HANDBOOKS
</STRONG></H3>
<BR>
<P> 

     There are a number of good examples of point of care reference
guides on Internet.  <A HREF="http://chorus.rad.mcw.edu/chorus.html"> CHORUS</A> -- Collaborative Hypertext Resource,  from the University of
Wisconsin, is a large project that indexes diseases and presents them
with hypertext links to pertinent xray, anatomy, and pathology images. The <A HREF="http://vh.radiology.uiowa.edu"> Family Practice Handbook</A>, a National Library of Medicine sponsored project from the University of Iowa's Virtual Hospital, is offerred on-line with the full text and tables that are in the published book.
<BR>
<P> 

<H3><STRONG>
CURRENT MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND SEARCHABLE DATABASES
</STRONG></H3>
<P> 

      Extensive databases can be rapidly keyword searched on Internet.
An important advantage of Internet distribution is the ability for an
information provider to maintain an up to date source at a central
location.
<BR>
<UL>
      <LI><A HREF="http://www.icsi.net/GenRx/"> Physician's GENRX</A>  is a commercial drug compendium program that provides a comprehensive listing of
pharmaceuticals. The database can be searched by generic or brand names
and by drug category.
<BR>
      <LI>The U.S. Government <A  HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/">Center for Disease Control WWW Server</A>  offers a clickable map that delivers country
specific information. It informs the public and health providers
regarding disease concerns, vaccinations, and preventive measures to be
taken during International travel.
<BR>
      <LI>A <A HREF="http://dgim-www.ucsf.edu:80/TestSearch.html"> Diagnostic Test Information</A> Server from the University of California at San Francisco, 
allows searches for information on lab testing and patient evaluation. The <A HREF="http://www.ohsu.edu/intindx.html"> Intern On-Call Handbook </A> from the Oregon Department of Medicine,  includes hypertext information on differential diagnosis, procedures and patient care topics.

<H3><STRONG>
DECISION MAKING TOOLS
</STRONG></H3>
<P> 

     DXPLAIN, from Harvard University authored by Octo Barnett,
obarnett@warren.med.harvard.edu,  is one of the first examples of
medical decision support systems that will be offerred on Internet.
DXPLAIN provides access to a structured knowledge base based on user
selections of clinical manifestations. Once the disease entity is
identified the user is presented a detailed discussion and
literature references.
<BR>
<P> 

<H3><STRONG>
POINT OF CARE COMPARISION IMAGES AND DATABASES
</STRONG></H3>
<BR>
<P> 

Pathology, radiology, or dermatology images with text  annotations increase the number of comparison references for practitioners and medical students as they treat patients. Extensive hyperlinked databases are offerred for general medicine by <A HREF="http://johns.largnet.uwo.ca:80/info/keywords.html"> Larg*net  </A>,  for dermatology by the <A HREF="http://www.rrze.uni-erlangen.de/docs/FAU/fakultaet/med/kli/derma/bilddb/db.htm"> University of Erlangen's Image Database</A>, and for pathology at the <A HREF="http://www-medlib.med.utah.edu/WebPath/webpath.html"> University of Utah</A>.

</UL><P> 

<H3><STRONG>
INTERACTIVE FORUMS
</STRONG></H3>
<P> 

One of the benefits of Internet connectivity is the ability to form networks and projects among colleagues and participate in a global collaborative decision making process. As medical practitioners join Internet they are exchanging new developments, case studies, treatment protocols, employment opportunities, and remote consultations. Specialties and interest groups are rapidly creating newsgroups and mailing lists. 
<BR>
<P> 

<H3><STRONG>
SUMMARY
</STRONG></H3>
<P> 

In 1995 Internet is taking hold in clinical medicine and has demonstrated an ability to present multimedia medical resources at the point of care to affect clincal decision making. Internet sound, images, and video simulate actual cases and can optimize learning and enhance decision making. Programs designed specificaly for hypertext multimedia access with modem transmission speeds ten and a hundred times what we have today will have even greater utility. Internet medicine links documents across geographic boundaries and medical  disciplines and promotes an integration of clinical knowledge that may revolutionize medical practice.

<TITLE> An Overview of the Pap Smear - NMHC </TITLE>

<STRONG><CENTER><H1>An Overview of the Pap Smear</H1></CENTER></STRONG>
<CENTER><STRONG><H3><i>by Sue Schlafmann, MD, Pathologist<BR>
North Memorial Health Care</i></H3></STRONG></CENTER>
<P>

The Pap smear is a complex test with the purpose of screening for precancerous and cancerous lesions of the cervix. It is a unique screening test because it is not automated and depends entirely on human judgment. Since the discovery of the Pap smear in the 1940s by Dr. George Papanicolaou and its widespread implementation thereafter, several studies have shown a decrease in mortality (overall 70 percent) from cervical cancer.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Obtaining a Sample</H4></STRONG>
Obtaining a sample for cervical cytology involves a number of factors, and experience often plays a key role in the adequacy of the specimen. Ideally, one should obtain a sample at midcycle, and obtain cells from both the squamocolumnar junction and the endocervix. In addition, there is essential clinical data, particularly ob/gyn history, that needs to be provided for accurate evaluation of the smear.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Reporting Results and the Bethesda System</H4></STRONG>
Results are reported differently in different labs, although most, including ours, use some form of the Bethesda system.  This system was developed in 1988, in an attempt to standardize reports and provide more clinically relevant information.  It includes a statement regarding the adequacy of the specimen for diagnostic evaluation and a descriptive diagnosis.  Categories for descriptive diagnoses include benign cellular changes (from infection, inflammation, atrophy, etc.) and epithelial cell abnormalities.
<P>
Epithelial abnormalities are further divided into squamous and glandular lesions.  Squamous abnormalities include atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LGSIL), encompassing HPV and mild dysplasia; high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSIL), encompassing moderate and severe dysplasia; and squamous cell carcinoma. Glandular abnormalities include benign endometrial cells in a postmenopausal woman, atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGCUS), endocervical and endometrial adenocarcinoma and extrauterine adenocarcinoma.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Inadequate Smears</H4></STRONG>
Smears called inadequate for evaluation include those that have a low number of cells and those that have an obscuring artifact such as air drying, lubricant, inflammation, blood or cytolysis. Smears without endocervical cells may also be inadequate depending on the particular patient and clinical situation; adequacy is determined by the clinician in these cases.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Potential Pitfalls: ASCUS and AGCUS</H4></STRONG>
The categories of ASCUS and AGCUS are for atypical cells that do not meet the criteria for dysplasia or malignancy, but cannot be explained by a reactive process either. Some labs try to further qualify this category as either favoring a reactive change or dysplasia.
<P>
Several investigators have retrospectively looked at Pap smears called ASCUS that had biopsy follow-up; they found that 18-30 percent have dysplasia on biopsy, and 3-10 percent have high grade dysplasia. Other studies have shown that it is very difficult to predict on Pap smears whether the atypical cells will be reactive or show dysplasia, except for those cases that turn out to be high grade dysplasia. Similar studies with similar results have been done with smears called AGCUS. One important point to take from these studies is that atypical glandular cells often are actually high-grade squamous lesions on biopsy, because the cytologic features may overlap.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Management of the Abnormal Smear</H4></STRONG>
Management of the abnormal Pap smear is controversial and depends somewhat on the natural history of cervical dysplasia. It is known that some dysplasias spontaneously regress over time, others remain unchanged, and others progress to higher grade lesions, including cancer.
<P>
Management of high-grade lesions generally involves colposcopy and biopsy.  Management of ASCUS/AGCUS and low-grade lesions is more variable and may either involve colposcopy and biopsy to rule out a higher grade lesion or regular Pap smears at closer intervals to follow the abnormality. Some have recommended HPV typing to triage patients to either biopsy or repeat smears, but this is currently not a widely accepted alternative due to limitations in our understanding of HPV and its association with cervical dysplasia.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Pap Smear Failure and False Negatives</H4></STRONG>
Due to the nature of the test, the Pap smear is prone to failure at all levels, including the 
clinical exam, obtaining the specimen, errors in screening and interpretation, the physician's failure to understand the report or take appropriate action, and patient's failure to follow recommendations. Several regulatory guidelines have been suggested to improve quality control in cervical cytology. These include rescreening 10 percent of all negatives, comparing cytologic findings with histologic findings in patients who have biopsy follow-up and reviewing previous material from patients with several consecutive smears.
<P>
Although the Pap smear has reduced cervical mortality since its implementation, it is still only a screening test and has a certain number of false negatives (reported in the literature as high as 50 percent). Studies have shown that most of these are due to sampling error, with a smaller percentage due to screening and interpretative errors. Sampling error is a difficult area to improve upon; since all lesions do not shed cells similarly, some lesions may not be obtainable by either a Pap smear or a biopsy, and some lesions may regress before definitive sampling.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Automated Screening Devices</H4></STRONG>
The small percentage of false negative cases due to screening errors may be improved in the future with the development of automated screening devices. Two systems have already received FDA approval for rescreening negative smears, PAPNET and AutoPap. While each system works a little differently, they are both designed to screen smears and look for the most abnormal cells. Smears must then be rescreened manually in the lab, either with images on a high resolution video monitor or with the actual slide. Although these devices are designed to lower the false negative rate of Pap smears, they will only have an effect on the small percentage of cases due to screening error, not sampling error, the most common cause for a false negative test.
<P>
Other disadvantages of automated rescreening systems are interpretation of the cells identified as abnormal and cost. Many of the cells identified as abnormal by the system are difficult to interpret and may be classified as atypical cells of undetermined significance. The additional expense that these devices will add to the cost of a Pap smear (conservatively estimated at $35-50) is currently the responsibility of the patient. Until it becomes standard of care in cervical cytology, third-party payers won't be interested in covering the additional expense. This could 
lead to a two-tiered system of screening for cervical cancer, which may pose an ethical dilemma.
<P>
<STRONG><H4>Conclusion</H4></STRONG>
In conclusion, it is important to remember that the Pap smear is only a screening test, and 
while it has proven to be useful in decreasing the mortality of cervical cancer, it also has its limitations.  It is not a diagnostic test and any abnormalities need to be further investigated with a more definitive procedure such as colposcopy and biopsy.  Patients and physicians should be aware of this to avoid burdening this complex test with unreasonable diagnostic standards.

<TITLE> Pap Smears for Patients with Prior Hysterectomy - NMHC </TITLE>

<STRONG><CENTER><H1>Pap Smears for Patients with Prior Hysterectomy</H1></CENTER></STRONG>
<CENTER><STRONG><H3><i>by Seymour Handler, MD<BR>
North Memorial Health Care</i></H3></STRONG></CENTER>
<P>

A recent  <STRONG>JAMA</STRONG> study (275[12]:940, March 27, 1996) and related coverage in the May 1996 <STRONG>OB/GYN Clinical Alert</STRONG> examined the value of performing Papanicolaou smears of the vaginal cuff of women with prior hysterectomy for benign disease. The stimulus for this literature review was concern for cost containment and efficacy.  Since over one-third of women in the U.S. will undergo hysterectomy by age 60, and since 85 percent of the surgery was performed for benign disease, the magnitude of Pap smears on this patient population is substantial, perhaps a half million smears annually, for a total charge of over one hundred million dollars. Three objectives of current screening practice were described: 1)  existing screening recommendations by national authorities; 2)  the risk of vaginal malignancy after total hysterectomy for benign disease; and 3) whether the test meets the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) criteria of an effective test.
<P>
National organizations remain ambiguous on the question, presumably because it has become almost a cardinal sin to suggest that Pap smears be limited. The American Cancer Society (ACS) continues to recommend Pap smears after hysterectomy, albeit at greater time intervals. This recommendation should be considered in the context that the ACS recommends fecal occult blood testing and serum prostate-specific antigen tests despite other opinions that these tests remain unproven in value as screening tests for cancer. The National Cancer Institute and the American Academy of Family Practice remain ambiguous. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) is also ambiguous, possibly to avoid offending members who continue to screen.
<P>
Most case-control studies have failed to show a relationship between vaginal cancer and prior hysterectomy for benign disease. Further, because of the very low incidence of this disease, vaginal Pap smears could not be recommended as a screening test. Further, there are no studies to suggest that the outcome of the rare vaginal malignancy was improved by detection with a Pap smear.  Finally, the USPSTF has unequivocally stated that the practice of Pap smears of the vagina after hysterectomy for benign disease does not meet screening criteria.
<P>
If there is no apparent yield in early detection of cancer from performing a vaginal Pap smear, why is it such a widespread practice? The answer to this question is not addressed in the positions of the organizations recommending or discouraging the practice. The reason lies in the value of periodic health evaluations by clinicians, hoping to detect breast tumors, hypertension and other disorders. The Pap smear may be the stimulus for women to return to their physician for a periodic health exam; without the Pap smear, they may consider a return visit unnecessary. Although women may be addicted to a regular Pap smear, thinking that all cancers are detected by the test, the question to be addressed by clinicians promoting the exam is twofold: <STRONG> 1)</STRONG>  Is a periodic health exam of value in disease detection or  other valid medical reasons?<STRONG> 2)</STRONG>  Is the vaginal Pap smear in patients with prior hysterectomy for benign disease necessary to induce patients to return for a periodic health evaluation?  Both questions would require an affirmative answer to justify the procedure.
<P>
If indeed the indication for a screening test for cancer is lacking in performing a vaginal Pap smear, and if the reason for performing the test is to entice patients to return for an annual periodic health evaluation, isn't this practice a bit deceitful? If the purpose of a return visit is preventive medicine in its broadest context, then that should be the reason for a visit, not a Pap smear without justified yield. This argument has already been accepted by one of our ob-gyn groups who will no longer perform vaginal Pap smears in women with prior hysterectomyfor benign disease. Keep in mind that patients with prior dysplasia or other pelvic malignancies are not included in this discussion.

Cervical cytology has been a part of medical practice for over 50 years, but only in recent 
years, since the 1988 and 1991 Bethesda Conferences on the nomenclature of cervical cytology abnormalities at NCI, has serious effort gone into standardizing cytology reporting. The so-called Bethesda System is now standard.
<P>
Unfortunately, although the cytologic changes associated with the degrees of squamous 
intraepithelial lesions (SIL) have been well described, changes of uncertain meaning are still subject to a wide range of interpretation. The designation ASCUS (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) was invented to cover these uncertainties. Proper use of this category requires a qualifying statement as to whether or not the examiner favors a dysplastic, inflammatory or reparative process. Recommendations for follow-up are often included.
<P>
The cytology literature is replete with articles on what constitutes ASCUS.  They are frequently in considerable disagreement. While the notion that ASCUS cells are those with a nucleus twice the diameter of a normal intermediate cell is the most consistent criterion, from this point each pathology practice goes its own way.  
<P>
Recently, Davey described a mean occurrence of ASCUS at 4 percent of all smears, with 
ranges from 0.2 to 9 percent. At the North Memorial Laboratory, the incidence of the use of 
ASCUS has remained stable over the years at about 1 percent. This would place our laboratory at the 25th percentile on the bell-shaped SD curve when compared to laboratories in the nation as a whole. Laboratories reporting 9 percent  ASCUS were at the 90th percentile level on the curve. Laboratories reporting these large numbers of ASCUS generate a lot of activity and anxiety over findings that are mostly not significant.
<P>
Determining where the proper ASCUS value should lie is difficult. Different populations are served by different laboratories, and we know that the rates of cervical neoplasia vary according to established epidemiological criteria. Different observers, however, treat this classification in vastly different ways. In 1995, our laboratory examined 33,059 cervicovaginal smears and reported 1192 as abnormal. Of the abnormal smears, 267 were reported as ASCUS (22 percent of total abnormal reports).  
<P>
The meaning of ASCUS to the patient and her physician is unclear. Ideally, long-term follow-up with later smears and biopsies might provide the answers. Reality has told us that, rather than high correlation with distinct lesions such as we see with the various SIL categories, ASCUS follow-up can range widely in possibilities. Fortunately for everyone, the most frequent association is with non-disease, inflammation and repair and individual variation. Some individuals with ASCUS smears have important lesions, including all degrees of SIL. Some individuals with normal cytology also have important lesions not uncovered by a particular smear. We assume that those with ASCUS are more likely to have some abnormality than those with normal smears.  
<P>
Of the 199 cases in our practice in 1994, where ASCUS was reported, follow-up statistics 
showed that only  27 or 14 percent showed squamous intraepithelial lesions on follow-up 
biopsy.  Of those followed by smear only, 10 out of 87 were abnormal on the repeat smear. It might be expected that the 22 percent who did not return for follow-up might include several cases of SIL.
<P>
The practice of cervical cytology has been fodder for the media for a number of years, at least since the <EM>Wall Street Journal</EM> expose of substandard cytology practices nine years ago.  The result of that article was the writing into the Federal Register of regulations related to cytology practice and the subsequent regulations of CLIA 88 (Clinical Laboratories Improvement Act). Cytology practice is highly regulated today, and the standards have become very high.
<P>
In spite of these regulations, certain laboratories have fallen through the regulatory cracks.  The recent experience of a hospital laboratory in Milwaukee, in which two young women subsequently died related to non-diagnosis of disease on cervical smears, illustrates this problem. While the laboratory was clearly shown to be seriously in error, the subsequent court trials led to examples of how junk science can dominate reason. In examining these proceedings for CAP Today, a publication of the College of American Pathologists, Dr. R. Marshall Austin quoted one expert who "claimed personally no false negative smears in 30 years of practice." The cytology literature accepts up to 30 percent false negatives as within reason.  Another pathologist claimed he could identify an abnormal smear  "in less than 5 seconds." Testimony such as this add little to the stature of cervical cytology as a science.  Slides from these cases examined by experts illustrated the possibility of disagreement. One slide received three different opinions from three different experts.  Among the areas of disagreement were in the ASCUS/AGCUS  category.
<P>
ASCUS and its cousin AGCUS (atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance) remain useful categories in cervical cytology. They should be considered a warning to the patient and her physician of a possible future problem. ASCUS/AGCUS, in our hands, will be reported in about one percent of cases. There is no need to panic.  Follow-up should occur within a reasonable period of time. Our recommended follow-up is repeat smear, not biopsy, and it should occur at about six months. After a repeat normal smear, a routine schedule of repeat smears should then be resumed. If the follow-up is still ASCUS or if SIL is noted, then colposcopy and biopsy are indicated.  
<P>
ASCUS smears remain a problem for patients and their physicians.  It is important to know the experience of the laboratory to which you send cytologic material in order to make informed decisions on future care of your patients.

<TITLE>YRE</TITLE>
<center><H1>What is Year Round 
Education?</H1></center>

Year-Round education is a concept that (1) 
breaks up the long three-month vacation of the farm calendar, and (2) 
provides better learning opportunities for students during the school 
year.  Students attend school the same number of days as under the farm 
calendar, which is generally 175 to 180 days.  But the calendar is 
arranged in smaller instructional blocks, with each block followed by 
vacation time.  The three month summer vacation is divided up into 
several shorter vacation breaks spread evenly throughout the school year.  


Most year-round calendars provide three one-month vacations or four 

three-week vacations.  For instance, on a 60/20 calendar, the 

instructional blocks are 60 school days (three months).  Three of these 
60-day instructional blocks equates to the 180 day school year.  Each of 
these instructional blocks is followed by a 20 day (one month) vacation, 
thereby breaking the three month summer vacation into three one-month 
vacations.  The 45/15 calendar provides 45 school days of instruction 
(nine weeks), followed by 15 days (three weeks) of vacation.  This 
pattern is repeated four times to equate to 180 days of instruction, and 
provides four three-week vacation periods.

<H3>Single-track and 
Multi-track Year-round Education</H3>

With a single-track program, a 
school operates with only one year-round calendar.  All of the students 
are in school at the same time and all of them are on vacation at the 
same time.  Only the calendar is different, dividing the summer's three 
month vacation into smaller breaks.  Socorro ISD's single-track program 
is a 60/20 calendar.

With a multi-track calendar, the capacity of a 
school building can be increased.  The school operates with three, four, 
or five calendars, assigning a proportion of students and teachers to 
each of the calendars.  The instructional blocks and vacation times are 
staggered so that part of the students are on vacation during each 
instructional period.  

The overcrowded schools in Socorro ISD operate 
on a 60/20, four track system.  Theoretically, this increases the 
capacity of a building by 33%  (One elementary school, however, has 
reached a capacity of 136%).  Students and teachers are assigned to one 
of the four tracks.  Each month of instruction, three of the tracks are 
in the building and one is on vacation.

<H3>How it Began</H3>

Socorro 
ISD established a task force, made up of 65 teachers and 
parents,  to 
study year-round education in the fall of 1990.  In the 
spring of 1991, 
the task force recommended that the district offer both the traditional 
farm calendar and a new year-round calendar in each elementary and middle 
school in the district.  As school began for the 1991-92 school year, 60% 
of the elementary and middle school students were attending school on a 
year-round calendar, by choice.  In 1992, the district's growth had 
caused such overcrowding that nine of the district's schools needed to 
implement multi-track year-round education to house all of the students.  
The district continued to offer the traditional farm calendar (a fifth 
calendar on the multi-track campuses), but less than 300 students 
registered for the old calendar.  The third year, 1993, the program was 
extended to the high schools and the traditional calendar was not longer 
offered in any school.  That year, the district became a year-round 
school district.  In 1994, five campuses remain on a single-track 
program; the remainder operate a multi-track program.

<H3>Benefits</H3>


<H4>Learning</H4>

In Socorro, more than half of the students have 
increased the number of days in school by attending the intersession 
program.  During the 
vacation time, acceleration, remediation, and 
enrichment activities are offered on all campuses.  A student who needs 
extra time on task has the opportunity to get help when it is needed, 
rather than wait for nine months of failure and frustration for a summer 
program.  Schools have become the center of the community activities, 
offering students alternatives to the streets.

Students have better 
attendance.  And with the shorter breaks, teachers report that they are 
spending less time with review and reteaching.  So, students are being 
exposed to more of the curriculum.

All of this results in improved 
academic performance and an increase in promotion rates.  Schools report 
a decline in discipline referrals.

<H4>Personnel</H4>

Because staff 
development now occurs during intersession in Socorro, 
teachers report 
an improvement in the program.  After gaining new 
knowledge, teachers 
have an opportunity to reflect and plan during the intersession. Their 
opportunity to practice their new skills is just around the corner.


Teachers and other staff like the flexibility in their vacation 

planning.  The old traditional farm calendar mandates that everyone take 
a family vacation during June, July or August.  The year-round calendar, 
which has some time in the hot months for those who desire it, also 
allows for vacations other months of the year.  Teachers are enjoying 
September through May vacations, traveling to amusement park areas when 
the rates are lower and the crowds are non-existent.  Having weddings and 
family reunions during cooler times of the year,  taking ocean cruises 
during various seasons, and various and sundry other opportunities never 
before available.  The appeal is that there is some choice.

Year-round 
education is offering more salary enhancement opportunities for teachers 
and other staff.  Under the old traditional farm calendar, only five 
percent of our student population attended a summer program.  This meant 
that there was a limited number of jobs for teachers in the summer.  With 
the increase of students taking advantage of the intersession program, 
more jobs are available for teachers and staff.  The multi-track schools 
have 'rainbow' teachers who can work an additional 40 days at their daily 
pay rate.  Teachers can even substitute in the multi-track schools when 
they are on vacation. 

Teachers report higher morale, possibly due to 
the renewal that comes with a month of vacation after each three months 
of teaching.  

<H4>Financial</H4>

In Socorro, the district has 
increased the capacity of existing buildings with multi-track education.  
This reduces the building program budget accordingly, saving the 
taxpayers money.  With the district's four-track program, one building 
can be eliminated from the building program for each three on multi-track 
year-round education.   The district currently has three phantom schools 
- schools that will never be built.

The multi-track schools are 
experiencing a reduction in cost-per-pupil expenditures.  This is due to 
the concept of 'economy of scale'.  As more students are served, the cost 
per pupil comes down.

<H3>State /National Perspective</H3>

The number 
of schools in Texas operating a year-round education calendar has 
steadily grown over the past few years.  In 1991, 22 districts served 
25,782 students on a year-round calendar.  In 1994, 67 districts have 
some form of year-round education, serving 152,761 students on 313 
campusus across the state.

Of the districts involved in year-round 
education, only five operate at least one campus on a multi-track 
calendar.  A dozen districts are totally year-round.

Based on 1993-94 
information, 388 school districts in 33 states have 
year-round 
education, serving  almost 1.5 million students.  California, Texas, 
Florida, Utah, and Nevada, in that order, have the largest populations of 
year-round students.  Socorro ISD is the tenth largest year-round 
district in the nation.

The trend, both at the state and national 
levels, is for year-round 
education to be implemented for the 
educational benefits, and not to 
handle overcrowding.  There are now 
more students attending school in a single-track program than in a 
multi-track program.  While the 45/15 calendar is the most common, the 
60/20 calendar is growing at the fastest rate.<BR>

<TITLE>Our Five Year Plan</TITLE>
Over the last year, Socorro has been 
implementing a district wide area network. This network connects all 
schools and departments via high speed dedicated circuits to a central 
hub at the Education Center. Voice, video, and data can be run over these 
circuits. The overall design is to have the complete system in place in 3 
years. All phones will also run through the central hub.<BR>

<BR>



Regardless of make, brand, or model, all computers will have access to 
the global Internet. Cabling and machines will be in place in every 
classroom by 1997. With the entire world computer systems available, 
students will have access to a limitless amount of resources. Some of the 
features are:<BR>
<BR>
 Local servers:<BR>
<ul><LI> Email throughout the 
district - (Sun Sparc20 email server running pine)
<LI> Library resources 
around the world as well as local (Local system on HP3000 using Inlex)

<LI> Administrative Resources (Pentamation running on VAX3000)
</UL>


Socorro is using extensively Sun workstations, Cabletron, and Cisco for 
their district standards. The desktop machines are of both PC and Mac 
platform. Consultants skilled in networking design and security have been 
retained for insurance that the district resources are protected. This is 
done through routing configurations and filtering at 2 levels.  The 
filtering system allows us to assign capabilities to the machine level, 
and track activity to and from each machine. We also have the ability to 
ban sights completely. All users (student and adult) sign an Acceptable 
Use Policy that states they understand the responsibilities of being a 
user. A teacher bulletin has been prepared that further describes 
appropriate use of the network. The idea is to allow access to all sites 
on the net, and encourage student and adult responsibility. <BR>

<BR>




Training is being provided at the district level to mentors, librarians, 
technology committee members, and administration to enable campuses to 
begin their own training. Technical assistance is available at the 
district level.<BR>

<BR>


All computer and software purchases are 
routed through the Director of Technology to ensure capability to the 
network and cabling. Ethernet cards have been standardized to Cabletron 
on the PC and Avante on the Mac. This allows for a backup supply to be 
kept on hand.  At the campus level, a Cisco 2500 router ensures that no 
traffic can pass from the administrative server to the instructional 
side. A similar hardware separation is in place at the district level, 
ensuring no access by students to district resources. Protection has been 
placed on the filtering system to allow no outsiders throughout the 
Internet connection to any resources outside of email. <BR>

<BR>



Partnerships have been formed with several vendors, in particular 
SaberData, Northern Telecomm, and Electus Technology to carry forth the 
effort. There is a desire on the part of Socorro to keep the network an 
open system, free of proprietary protocols. This allows for the greatest 
flexibility in purchasing and expansion. Ethernet 10 Base T is the 
current standard, Novell on the LAN side. The wiring system utilizes 
fiber and unshielded twisted pair at category five level in anticipation 
of 100 Mb speeds in the future. Each classroom, workroom, and office will 
be equipped with one of more data ports, which connect to a server or 
other device, and then to the network. Each site has a single wiring 
center, usually near the library at campuses. A locked cabinet houses the 
patch panels and network hubs required for networking. At each data port 
2 computers can be directly connected, adding a small ethernet hub can 
accommodate many more from one port. Hubs are intelligent with internal 
management to ease in system administration. We hope to complete our WAN 
and have a machine in every classroom by 1997.<BR>

Socorro High School</CENTER></I></H1><IMg src="hline.gif"><BODY>

Socorro High School annually serves the needs of over 2200 students.  A 
small town minority/majority high school with over 97% Hispanic students, 
SHS is unique because of its comprehensive nature.<P>

SHS achieves a remarkable degree of academic and vocational success for 
its students while overcoming the community's economic disadvantages 
(over 90% of the student body is eligible for the federally-funded lunch 
program) and the students' English language difficulties (over 300 
students participate in the bilingual education project).  Approximately 
70% of the graduates continue with post-secondary education upon 
graduation.<P>

Socorro High School operates on a year-round calendar.  A sixty/twenty

session for twelve weeks (60 days) followed by a four week (20 day) 
intersession.  During the intersession periods, many activities are

<title>Salvador H. Sanchez Middle School Year Round Education</title>

</head>

<body background=pnklethr.jpg>

<strong><h1>Year Round Education</h1></strong>

<h3>at Sanchez Middle School</h3>

<hr>

<p>Sanchez Middle School utilizes a 60/20 four-track calendar.  Students 
and most teachers are on one of the four colors of the SISD rainbow: the 
red track, the green track, the blue track and the yellow track.  
Selected special population and elective teachers join student services 
staff on what is affectionately known as the <em>rainbow</em> contract.  
Teachers on the rainbow contract are on duty from 210 to 226 days per 
school year compared with single track teachers who are on duty for 183 
days. </p>    

<br>

<p>Most teachers on the rainbow contract enjoy the extra money it 
provides but will be quick to point out that there is little vacation 
time to enjoy that extra money.</p><br>

<p>The faculty of Salvador H. Sanchez Middle school face a unique 
challenge that most middle school faculty do not face.  Not only are the 
faculty organized into departments, but they also find themselves 
organized into tracks, needed by the school's <a

We believe the value of the African proverb, <em>"It takes an entire

<p>Serving students in grades 6 through 
8, the school was named in honor 
of Salvador H. Sanchez.  Mr. Sanchez 
was a longtime advocate of quality 
education in Socorro ISD, and a

<strong><h1>Administrators of<br> Salvador H. Sanchez Middle 
School</h1></strong>

<h3><i>Home of the Warriors</i></h3>

<hr>

<p>Four members comprise the administrative team.  Recently, they all 
faced the pressure of  Spirit Week's <i>Kiss the Pig Contest</i> where 
students, staff and faculty all had the chance to vote  for the one who 
would kiss the pig.  Each vote cost a nickel and all proceeds went to the 
<b>W.G. Barber Scholarship Fund<b>.<br>

<center>

<img src="pigone.jpg"><br>

<h5><b>Our pig with its wet snout was just waiting to be 
kissed.</b></h5></center>

<br>

<a href="edgabald.html"><img src="pig2.jpg"></a> Mr. Gabaldon, our 
Principal,<br>shows his appreciation for not being selected. <br>

<br><center> 

<a href="bonnieg.html"><img src="pig1.jpg"></a><br>

Mrs. Gonzalez, an Assistant Principal, brought along a <i>pig-proof</i> 
mask just in case it was needed.  She was delighted when she didn't need 
it.</center><br>

<br>

<a href="seichorn.html"><img src="pig3.jpg"></a><br> Ms. Eichorn, our newest 
Assistant Principal, was highly favored among the students. Expecting 
to win, she pyschs herself up.<br>

<br>

<center>

<a href="masongr.html"><img src="pig4.jpg"></a><br>

Mr. Gray, an Assistant Principal whose many duties include 
administration of special education at Sanchez, finds out he is the 
winner and gets to kiss the pig. Rumor has it the special education 
teachers supported their administrator during this contest.

<h3>Special Education Teacher</h3>



<hr>



<p>I have been a teacher with Socorro ISD since 1990.  
Previously I 

taught in a resource classroom setting, but now run the 
Content Mastery 

Program.  This program has had exciting results for Sanchez 
Middle 

School.  Utilized by selected Special Education students,  
this program 

is a step towards inclusion and allows for more students to 
particapte 

and learn in the general education classroom.  Students who 
were 

previously served in a resource class have acheived stable 
academic 

scores, with a slight increase in grades for most 
students.</p>



<br>



<p>One of the most important tools I use as a teacher is the 
computer.  

I have developed special education forms and databases which 
facilitate 

the upkeep of records necessary for Special Education 
teachers.  Our 

database is password protected to allow for the 
confidentiality of 

records.  Placement forms and ARD evaluation sheets are 
computer 

generated.  Additionally, various reports needed by our 
campus 

diagnostician or administrators are generated by the 
database.</p>



<br>



<p>I am also the sponsor for the Yearbook Club, which 
produces the 

school's annual, <em> The Tomahawk</em>.  <a 
href="tkonline.html">The 1996 

Tomahawk</a>--the Internet Edition, is available for your 
viewing 

pleasure.  The Tomahawk is an 84 page yearbook.  Students 
compete in a 

school-wide contest to design the cover and write the poem 
that appears 

on the back cover.  <em>The Tomahawk</em> is produced 
without expense to 

tax-payers.  Students are responsible for the layout and 
design of the 

yearbook.  Because we have a laser printer, we also do our 
own layout and 

paste-up work.  Eventually, I hope to utilize elctronic 
desk-top 

publishing, sending only a floppy disk to the publisher 
instead of 

paste-up pages.  I became responsible for the yearbook when 
I broke one 

of the cardinal rules of teaching I was taught my a mentor 
teacher during 

my first year.  Even though I saw an administrator walking 
down the hall 

with a clipboard, I forgot to hide!



<hr>



<p>An interest I have developed since becoming the advisor 
to <i>The 

Tomahawk</i> is photography.  <center>

<strong><h1>Maria S. Baxley</h1></strong>

<h3>Bilingual Education Language Arts</h3>

<img src="mbax1.jpg">

<hr>

<br>

<p>Teaches English as a Second Language and a Dual Language Class at 
Salvador H. Sanchez Middle School.  She holds a Master of Arts  in 
Counseling and a Bachelor Of Science in Education.  She is a member of 
the National Teaching Association, American Counseling Association, 
Association for Multicultural Counseling and Development, and the 
International Association of Marriage and Family Counseling.  She was 
awarded <i>Outstanding Bilingual/ESL Educator 1993-1994 at The Socorro 
Independent School District</i> on May 19, 1994.  She was recognized for 
volunteer services at Life Management on May 23, 1995.  She was also 
recognized for five years service in the Bilingual Program at Socorro 
Independent School District on May 28, 1995.  Ms. Baxley sponsors Ballet 
Folklorico Club at Salvador Sanchez Middle School.</p><br>

<br>

<br>

<p>My main goal is to become an Educational Counselor before the year 
2000.  My experience at Salvador Sanchez  Middle School has been very 
pleasant and productive.  I have had the opportunity to actively serve 
the following:  The Language Proficiency Assessment Committee for the 
evaluation of Limited Proficiency students, Member of the Staff  
Development Committee, Liaison for the Special Education Department, 
Development and evaluation of ESL curriculum, Cooperating teacher for 
UTEP student teachers, Computer training to ESL teachers, Mentor for 
ESL/BED teachers, and Member of the School Improvement Team 
Committee.</p><br>

<br>

<p>I have participated in various regional and national conferences, 
workshops, and seminars.  I am presently enrolled at UTEP to stay current 
with new trends, technology, and teach methodology.  I have high 
expectations from my students because I want them to realize that in our 
competitive society, a child should learn that he must earn what he is 
given.  However, I always create a stress-free and enjoyable learning 
environment rather than to simply transmit information.  In addition, I 
evaluate each student holistically because I feel that each student is 
unique in his strengths, weaknesses, and in his learning style.</p><br>

<br>

<p>Two aspects of my personal attributes that  I value most highly are 
humor and creativity.  I also treasure relationships more than 
money.<p><br>

<br>

<p>My three precious children, with their words of love and 
encouragement, were the primary people who contributed to my professional 
and personal development.  There were many other people who also 
influenced me in a lot of ways.  In fact, my first year at Socorro 
Independent School District, provided me with solid foundation for my 
professional growth.  It was at the Generic Special Populations 
Department that I learned to challenge underlying assumptions of reality.  
I am sure my positive experiences with G.S.P.D. led me toward my own 
interest in Special Education and Bilingual Education.</p><br>

<br>

<p>I have learned a great deal from my personal experiences; I am 
persistent and somewhat stubborn.  I hate the expression <i>"I can't do 
it."</i>  My motto is <i>"I can and I will."</i></p><br>

<b>Memorable Teaching Experience</b></p>

<p>Coaching a district 7th grade football championship team at Hillcrest 
Middle School was one of my most memorable teaching experiences.  Another 
memorable teaching experience came during an archaeological history 
lesson during which students used created maps to locate Spanish 
treasures, shields, swords and cannon balls.  They used archaeological 
tools of picks and shovels to excavate the treasure.  Everything was 
photographed and recorded.  I had previously buried the artifacts in 
preparation for an observation.  It was a great lesson despite the fact 
that one of the students threw a cannon ball over our heads!</p>

<br>

<b>Hobbies and Interests</b>

<p>Martial Arts is my hobby and interest.  My style is Kempo Karate and 
I am a 3rd degree Black Belt.  It offers me the opportunity to see life 
and teaching in a different paradigm.  It permeates and parallels my 
teaching career.  We have a Karate Club at Sanchez Middle where students 
learn traditional values, self-defense, fitness and positive 
affirmations.</p>

<strong><h1>Student Writings</h1></strong>

<br>

<p>Salvador H. Sanchez Middle School  students are always reminded that 
they are on the warpath to excellence.  This space is devoted to allow 
our students to electronically share samples of their latest 
writings.</p><br>

<br>

<em><h3>Selected Eighth Grade Writings</h3></em>

<em><h3>Selected Seventh Grade Writings</h3></em>

<br>

<em><h3>Selected Sixth Grade Writings</h3></em>

Some of our sixth grade students learned to write poetry.  Autumn was 
the theme and their assignment was to use the five senses to bring the 
season alive. 

<br>

<br>

<br>

<center><i><b>Autumn</i></b>

<br>

<br>

Autumn is a hazy, gold color.<br>

It sounds like leaves rustling in the wind.<br>

It tastes like moist air before or after it rains.<br>

It smells like sweat from the basketball players at Sanchez' basketball 
courts.<br>

It looks like dust devils carrying around multi-colored leaves.<br>

It feels like a jacket against your skin to protect you from chill.<br>

It makes me feel like skipping and laughing around the neighborhood.<br>

told him one day that I needed for him to take responsibility for his 
behavior and <i>act mature</i>, he exclaimed, "But miss, I <b>am</b> 
acting manure!"  The class of course, roared.</p>

<h3>Reading Teacher</h3>

<hr>

<img src="shirlr1.jpg">

<p><b>My college education began, as a business major, at Texas College 
of Mines, here in El Paso, known nationally as U.T.E.P., 1947-1949.  I 
then married and worked in the retail jewelry business, while my husband 
served in the U.S. Air Force, during the Korean Conflict.  We returned to 
El Paso and his job at the Newspaper Printing Corporation, where he 
eventually retired as assistant head of production.  I also worked in 
classified advertising and at the Red Rooster Bowling Lanes.  After 
sixteen years of marriage, my daughter Kelli was born, three years later 
Kerri and in 1973 Rick came along.  When he went to Kindergarten, I began 
substitute teaching, In the Y.I.S.D. and continued for fourteen years.  
As soon as Rick could obtain a driver's license, I returned to college 
under the new Interdisciplinary Studies degree plan, graduated December, 
1991 and am in my fifth year, here at Sanchez Middle School.</p>

<br>

<p>Many times I have been greeted by past students, even a substitute, 
who recall  something I said or did.  So, I know to keep trying because 
somewhere, sometime, someone might be listening to, or watching my 
actions and it will motivate them to higher goals.  I feel a combination 
of the old and new strategies are needed for today's students to be 
successful.</p>

<br>

<p>Through the years I have been affiliated with the Delta Gamma Alumni, 
Southwest Area Square Dance, and the El Paso Women's Bowling 
Associations.  Currently, I am a member of the U.T.E.P. Alumni, and the 
International Reading Association.  My hobbies are limited to reading, 
painting, and my wonderful grandchildren Brandi, Jonathan, Sean, and Kari 
Lynn.</p>

<p><em><h2>"A Warrior is Brave Each Day..."</h2></p>



<br><h4><b><i>



For centuries and millenia, the tradition would continue.  A 
boy would 

not be accepted as a Warrior until bravery was proved.  Some 
tribes would 

require the long duration of pain as a sign of bravery.  
Others would 

require the ability to be self-supporting in an isolated 
wilderness 

environment.<br>



<br>



Today, children must show bravery in different ways.  Some 
learn to say 

"No!" to drugs.  Others avoid the violence of gangs.  Some 
struggle to 

keep up with life, but all are required to learn at 
school.<br>



<br>



The bravest of our Warriors are those who do their best to 
learn at 

school, no matter what fears or pitfalls await them after 
school.  Come 

join us in our tribe as these pages show the happiness and 
joy that 

accompany learning and extra-curricular activities at<br>



Salvador H. Sanchez Middle School.</h4></b></i>

<h3>Assistant Principal</h3><br>

<img src="bgonzale.jpg">

<hr>

I'm on my 23rd year in the field of education.  My experience has taken 
me into all three levels of public education--elementary school, middle 
school, and high school.  Seventeen years were spent with the Ysleta 
Independent School District and six years with the Socorro Independent 
School District.  I have taught special education and high school English 
as well as having served as a counselor for fifteen years.  This is my 
fifth year in school administration.

<h3>Assistant Principal</H3><br>

<img src="seichorn.jpg">

<hr>

On February 20, 1995 I was promoted to an assistant principalship here 
at Salvador H. Sanchez Middle School after teaching for 25 years.  
Although it was difficult to leave Montwood High School, I was eager to 
return to the valley where I had spent 19 years teachng.  I really enjoy 
being an assistant principal at a middle school; there's <b>never</b> a 
dull moment.<br>

<br>

Multi-track YRE is very challenging.  Traditional school calendars are 
quite placid when compared to Socorro's YRE.  I enjoy my job most days.  
I like trying to make a difference.

<title>Salvador H. Sanchez Middle School Web Page Creation 
Page</title></head>



<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">



<em><h1>Introduction to HTML Authoring</P></h1></em>

<h3>For Netscape Navigator</h3><br>

<h4><i>Information on Nestscape Navigator 2.0 will be 
forthcoming.</i></h4>





<hr>

This section is designed to help you create your own web page using 
html, or Hyper Text Markup Language.  All you need to do is be able to 
type and save your text in a text format and add some color, graphic and 
formatting commands.

<blockquote>

All html documents start with this command:<br>

&lthtml&gt  This tells the browser it will look at a new web page.  This 
is the first item typed for any document.<br>

<br>All html documents end with this command:<br>

&lt/html&gt  This tells the browser that the current web page is 
finished.  This is the last item typed for any document.<br>

<br>

<i>Note that commands come in series of two.  The first command looks 
like this:<br>

&ltcommand&gt  and the second command looks like &lt/command&gt.  Notice 
the / in the second command.</i><br>

<br>

The second command tells the browser that the immediate information is 
for the title bar or information only and will not appear on the monitor.  
This command looks like this:<br>

&lthead&gt  The title and title commands are inserted between these two 
commands.  &lt/head&gt.  

A title is needed for the browser.  This title <em>does not</em> appear 
in the text area of the screen, but normally appears on the title bar.  
This command normally fits on one line and looks like this:<br>

&lttitle&gtYour Document Title Goes Here&lt/title&gt<br>

<br>

The next command you must write tells the browser about what will appear 
on the monitor including which background color or image, text color and 
link color you wish to use.<br>

<br>

A selection of seamless background images is available in this section.   
The default color is gray  The command to use a background image is:<br>

&lt body background=filename.ext&gt  If your image comes from a 
different directory or sub-directory you will need to specify the 
directory and/or sub-directory before the file name such as &lt body 
background=scanner/myphoto/mypicture.ext  All further discussion will 
assume that the image is in the same directory as the html document.  
Please remember that all images must be in the .gif or .jpg format.  I 
prefer .jpg as it seems to load faster.<br>

<br>

A selection of colors and rgb codes is available in this section.  
<b>Netscape Navigator 2.0 allows for the use of color names instead of 
rgb codes, however, it does accept the rgb code.</b>  The default color 
is gray.  The command to use a different background color is:<br>

&lt body bgcolor="#rgbcode"&gt<br>

<br>

The default text color is normally black.  To specify a different color 
of text the following command would be used:<br>

&ltbody text="#rgb code"&gt<br>

<br>

The default link color is normally blue.  A link is a connection to 
another web page document you have not yet visited.  To specify a 
different color link the following command would be used:<br>

&lt body link="#rgb code"&gt<br>

<br>

The default visited link color is normally purple.  A visited link is 
another web page document you already visited.  To specify a different 
color visited link the following command would be used:<br>

&lt body vlink="#rgb code"&gt<br>

<br>

The default active link color is normally red.  An active link normally 
flashes and is another web page document you might want to visit.  To 
specify a different color active link the following command would be 
used:<br>

&lt body alink="#rgb code"&gt<br>

<br>

<i>In most documents you will want to combine several of these commands 
to specify a background image or color, text color, link color, visited 
link color and active link color</i>  The command line for documents with 
a background image and different text color, different link color, 
different visited link color and different active link color is:

&ltbody background image="image.ext" text="#rgb color code" vlink="#rgb 
color code" alink="#rgb color code"&gt<br>

<br>

The command line for documents with a background color and different 
text color, different link color, different visited link color and 
different active link color is:

&ltbody bgcolor="#rgb color code" text="#rgb color code" vlink="#rgb 
color code" alink="#rgb color code"&gt<br>

<br>

Note that the command <i>body</i> was used only once in the command 
line.  Remember to choose text and link colors to coordinate with the 
background color or image.<br>

<br>

The next part involves typing your document.  Several command can be 
used, always in pairs.

<h1>Use this command for this size type. 

<br> &lth1&gttext goes here&lt/h1&gt</h1>

<br>

<h2>Use this command for this size type.  

<br>&lth2&gttext goes here&lt/h2&gt</h2>

<br>

<h3>Use this command for this size type.  

<br>&lth3&gttext goes here&lt/h3&gt</h3>

<br>

<h4>Use this command for this size type.  This is normally the default

<br>

<h5>Use this command for this size type.  

<br>&lth5&gttext goes here&lt/h5&gt</h5>

<br>

<h6>Use this command for this size type.  

<br>&lth6&gttext goes here&lt/h6&gt</h6>

<br>

Other text style options exist.  <i>This is the command string for 
italics.</i>

<br>&lti&gttext goes here&lt/i&gt<br>

<br>

<b>This is the command string for bold type.</b>

<br>&ltb&gttext goes here&lt/b&gt<br>

<br>

<i><b>This is the command string for bold type italics.</b></i>

<br>&lti&gt&ltb&gttext goes here&lt/i&gt&lt/b&gt<br>

<br>

The beginning and end of paragraphs must have the following codes:

<br> &ltp&gtparagraph goes here&lt/p&gt

<br>

To place a horizontal line between text,<hr>such as this line type the 
following command where you want the horizontal line to appear:<br>

<br>

&lthr&gt  <i>Note that only one command is use to signify the horizontal 
line.</i>

<br> 

To place a graphic horizontal line between text,<br><br>

<img src="pat_ct1.jpg"><br>

such as this line type the following command where you want the graphic  
horizontal line to appear:<br><br>

&img src="filename.ext"&gt  <i>Note that only one command is use to 
signify the graphic horizontal line.</i>

<br> <br>

&lthr&gt  <i>Note that only one command is use to signify the horizontal 
line.</i>

<br> 

To determine a break in line text,<br>such as this break type the 
following command where you want break to appear:<br>

&ltbr&gt  <i>Note that only one command is use to signify the break in 
text.</i>

<br>

Text can be aligned left, <i> the default</i> or centered.<br>

<p align=center> To align center type this command<br>

&ltp align=center&gt centered text goes here&lt/center&gt</center><br>

<br>

Lists may be used in html documents.  All items in a list begin with the 
following command:<br>

 &ltli&gtlist item<br>

<br>

To create a numbered list<ol>

<li> The

<li> Following

<li> Command

<li> Is 

<li> Typed

</ol>

To create a numbered list this command is typed:<br>

&ltol&gt<br>

&ltli&gtThe<br>

&ltli&gtFollowing<br>

&ltli&gtCommand<br>

&ltli&gtIs<br> 

&ltli&gtTyped<br>

This command stops the numbered list:<br>

&lt/ol&gt<br>

<br>

<i>Note that the numbers were <b>not</b> typed as part of the 
command.</i>

<br>

<br>

&lt; body bg color="#CODE" text="#CODE" link="#CODE" vlink="#CODE" 
alink="#CODE"  &gt;

(CODE refers to the six digit codes in the following charts)



</BLOCKQUOTE>



Where text= color of your text,  link= not visited link,  vlink= visited 
links and alink=active links.<BR>



<hr> 

<p>You must carefully select your colors to coordinate with background 
colors or background images.  You should not choose for example a text 
color very similar to a background color or similar in color to a 
background image.  When selecting colors you <i>must</i> use uppercase 
letters when indicated and all codes must be preceded with the # symbol 
and enclosed with parenthesis.  <b>Netscape Navigator 2.0 allows for the 
use of a color name instead of the rgb code.  More information about 
Netscape Navigator 2.0 will be added at a later date.</b></p>

<h2><b><i>A Warrior is Brave Each Day</b></h2><br>

<br><h4>

Through all the worries of school,<br>

It's still hard trying to be cool.<br>

In Science we study different subjects like rain or fog,<br>

Although it's not as bad as dissecting a frog.<br>

In P.E., the coach builds you up like a champ,<br>

Although the work  feel like that of  Army boot camp.<br>

So even though the work piles up in buckets,<br>

Just remember, "Life is like a box of chocolates..."<br>

<br></h4>

<h5>By Adrian, an eighth grade student</i></center></h5>

<br>

<hr>

<br>

The drawing on our front cover, "A Warrior's Tale", was designed by 
Luis, an eighth grade student.  Both the drawing and the above  poem are 
featured in the print version of<br> <b>The 1996 Tomahawk</b>.<br>

<strong><h1>Sanchez Student Life</h1></strong><br>

<img src="pat_ct10.jpg"</center>

<br>

<img src="student1.jpg"><br>

<b>So a good part of our student's life <i>is</i> finding good food and 
a good place to eat.  If we followed the faculty home, we would probably 
find the same to be true.<br>

<center>

<img src="student2.jpg"><br>

But unlike faculty, Sanchez students have many opportunities to work off 
those calories...<br>

</center>

<br>

<img src="student3.jpg">

<br>

...whether it be karate...<br>

<center>

<img src="student4.jpg"><br>

...walking the halls with friends...<br>

</center>

<br>

<img src="student5.jpg">

<br>

...escaping school with no homework...

<br>

<center>

<img src="student6.jpg"><br>

...hiding out in the bathroom...<br>

</center>

<br>

<img src="student7.jpg"><br>

...or just dressing in costumes.   Sanchez students are not only busy 
learning, but learning how to keep busy.

<body background="whtmarb.jpg"><html><h2>Gifted & Talented</h2></a>

<hr>

The Gifted and Talented program offers special learning projects to

identified gifted students.  These programs are offered during the 
school

day and during intersession periods.  Teachers and community members

offer these projects.<br><br>



<img src="reebok.gif">



I like G.T. classes because it isn't like school.  There is no

homework, and their aren't tests.  You get to have lots of fun

activities and sometimes even go on field trips.  I also like it because 
there

aren't things like science or social studies.  And if there is,

we'll learn in a fun way, and not just reading out of a boring book.<br>


<i>Patricia Hernandez, 5th grade</i><br><br>



I like G.T. classes because we play many games that make us think

long and hard.  Many of the different things we do in G.T. make our

minds create thoughts of never before.  G.T. helps us become creative.

<i>Jennifer Salinas, 5th grade</i><br><br>



I think it's fun because we don't work out of a book and always do

fun stuff.  I also like the teacher, Mr. Badley.<br>

<body background="whtmarb.jpg">

<h2>Bilingual Education</h2>

<hr>

Myrtle Cooper school has award winning programs in bilingual 

education.  The English Language Accelerated Program <a 
href="elap.html">(ELAP)</a>

 is an integral part of our bilingual program.  Fourteen classes of 
bilingual

education are offered on our campus.  Students are served from age 3 to 
5th grade.

We offer bilingual classes on three of our four <a 
href="year.html">year-round tracks.</a>

Dual language classes are also offered.  In these classes, students 
proficient in

Spanish learn English and students proficient in English learn Spanish 
while learning

the curriculum together.  Teachers team-teach this program.

<img src="!dualcop.gif">

The Dual Language Program is composed of elementary students, half of 
whom are

are native speakers of English, the other half of whom are native 
speakers

of Spanish.  Students are given the opportunity to learn a second 
language

while working cooperatively.  <i>Cathy Martinez, 3rd grade bilingual

<h2>English Language Acceleration Program</h2>

<hr>

The ELAP program was initiated on the Cooper campus two years ago

to address the educational needs of students with very limited

English ability.  The program was founded and is taught by Mrs. Susie 

Acosta, the 1995 Socorro ISD Elementary Teacher of the Year.<br><br>

<img src="!elapcop.gif">

<h3>Why I liked to coming to ELAP</h3>

I like ELAP because it is fun.  I learn alot of english.  

And I learn how to read.  When I started this school I didn't know 

how to speak english, but now I know how to speak english with Mrs. 
Acosta's help.

Our librarian was very proud of me because I speak more english

than I used to.  When I don't understand something my best friend

Adriana helps me.  When she don't understand something I help her.

In Mrs Acosta's class we always did alot of art in our stories.  When I

go with my mom to the houses I help her with the ones who speak english.


I like ELAP because we read and play sight word bingo.  I like ELAP

because I learn my ABC's and all the letters in English.

What I liked most was being told to speak in English.  I like

ELAP because we shared and work together.  The english help us to

be able to defend our selves. <br>

<i>Luis Omar Carrasquillo, 5th grade</i>



<br>

<h3>Why I liked coming to ELAP</h3>

I like to come to ELAP because I like to be with my sister.  The 

day goes fast and we do fun things.  The days are better because my

family is proud of me.  My best friend, Luis Omar helps me in English 
and Writing

during ELAP time.  I also like when Mrs. Acoste let us work together

in groups.  It helped us to work together as a team.  I lern enaf 
English

that now I'm not in ELAP.  I like to read hard books.  We did all

the art Work in our stories.  I like the way Mrs. Acosta is.  So

that's why I like ELAP.  There are many reasons I like ELAP.

But, What I liked best was that I learn to speak read and write in 
English.<br>

<title>Special Ed</title>

<body background="whtmarb.jpg"><h2>Special Education</h2>

<hr>

The Cooper Resource Program serves students who meet Texas Education

Agency's (TEA) criteria for the handicapping code LD (learning 
disabled).

Students who require remedial help in the areas of written expression,

spelling, reading and math spend up to three hours per day in

the resource room.  Instruction parallels regular classroom instruction

with an emphasis on basic skills development. <i> Melissa Rueda, 
Resource Teacher</i>

<br><br>

The Early Childhood classes are started each morning when the children

are fed breakfast.  Some students need to be fed.  After they eat,

they are taught self-help skills.  These children are part of the

special ed inclusion program and they spend some time in regular

classrooms.  Speech and adaptive PE are also offered. <i> Sandra Torrez 
and Carmen

Cervantes</i>

<br><br>

In the Severe and Profound classroom, we like to be known as the

"therapy room." We serve 15 children from ages 3 to 15.  Five out of the 
15

children come from Early Childhood classrooms for additional services

including fine and gross motor skills.  Mealtimes are also included

in the educational time as each child learns needed feeding skills.  
Physical

and occupational therapy methods are taught to the classroom staff and 
implemented

on a daily basis based on each child's individual needs.  Each child has


an individual educational plan. <i>Mary Kay Emery, S & P teacher</i>

<title>Title 1 Program -- HOSTS</title>

<body background="whtmarb.jpg">

<h2>Title 1 Program -- HOSTS</h2>

<hr>

The Title 1 money allocated to Cooper School fund the Help One Student

To Succeed (HOSTS) program to improve the reading and math skills

of our "at-risk" students.  The HOSTS lab is staffed by Mrs. Clara

Contreras, teacher, and Mrs. Lucy O'Quinn, aide.  The program involves

community members tutoring individual students.<br>

<h3>What I Learned from the Hostlab</h3>

The most important thing I learned from HOSTS lab

was learning to read.  I Learned big words, vowel Sounds.

I learned to use the dictionary.  I enjoyed playing 

the different reading games.  Because of the HOSTS lab

I think I've improved.  I enjoy coming to the HOSTS Lab because I've

met new friends and teachers.  The first time I came to HOSTS lab I 
didn't 

know how to read, now I know how to read!<br>

<i>Stephanie Regalado, 5th grade</i>

<br>

<h3>What I Learned at Hosts</h3>

When I barely came to Hosts, Ms. Contreras and Ms. O'Quinn

tested me so I could learn about reading.  They made me a folder and I 
got 

in HOSTS lab. When I came in to the Hosts room I get my folder and a 
pencil.  My

tutor Jazmine Marquez helps me with my work.  The work I do is about 
writing new words,

learning letters and putting endings on words.  After I'm finished

with my work sheet I go to the shelf and get a book to read.  Last I

put my folder up and leave to class.<br>

<P>Uploads of Attendance Totals for Principal's and Contact Hours have been
completed for most of the campuses. Email was sent to administrators with
listing of campuses completed. If your campus is on the list, please call
Hilda at 860-3615 to setup an appointment for a mini-workshop on balancing 
the reports for the 1st six weeks.</P>

<P>Please remember when withdrawing a student from the Entry Screen in Registration,
you will need to withdraw him/her in the Spentry Screen. By not doing this,
the student will continue to receive funding for any Special Program coded.</P>

<P>After running the Regentry Error Scan at district level, it is apparent
that some campuses have not cleaned their campus errors. We are requesting
 all campuses run error scans to make sure there are not any errors.
Please do this ASAP, so there will not be any further delay in PEIMS 
processing.</P>

<P>The grade level KN for kindergarten students has been changed to KG for
PEIMS purposes.</P>

<P>When withdrawing a student, please check that he/she does not have any 
absences on that date or after the withdrawal date. By not doing this ADA 
for the student will be incorrect. These absences will need to be deleted 
in the students' calendar prior to withdrawing.</P>

<P>Hilda will be contacting campuses to set up an appointment regarding
an internal audit attendance record for the current 95-96 school year.</P>

<P>When entering or changing a Special Ed. student remember you will need
to enter the information on the PEIMS1 and Spentry screens.</P>

<P>TEA will be auditing our records in January for the 94-95 PEIMS submission.
A listing with the information required for your campus will be mailed to
the administrators this month.</P>

<P>For your information the Problem Report can produce different statistics
in a number of different combinations, depending on your responses to the
report prompts and selected criteria. In your manuals there is a section for
the Problem report and it explains in detail all of the prompts and criteria
for your selections. It also contains samples of different reports that
can be produced.</P>

<P>The Excessive Absence Report Screen project was completed according to
specifications given to Pentamation 2 years ago. Any additional reports
will have to be re-spec'd and submitted to Pentamation for an estimate.</P>

<P>When a student withdraws, some of you would like to be able to keep the
schedule on the system. However, a custom would be required for the seats
to be held on the master schedule and may not be beneficial to the campus
when trying to schedule other students. So you would need to do a print
screen and place it in the cum folder. This request has been closed.</P>

<P>In Class Attendance on the Daily Master Report, students with no absences
are appearing. The cause of this is that a user has entered Exception Entry,
and then does a &lt;CTRL/D&gt; to display Teacher Slip. A flag is set to 
indicate that the student has an Exception Entry record which appear on the 
Daily Master Report. A custom program would be required to change this,
and we have been informed that it would be very costly, therefore, this
request has been tabled until we can acquire funds next year. In the meantime,
we need to read the report carefully.</P>

<H3>Location</H3>

<P>Socorro 
Independent School District is located in the eastern and southeastern

portion of El Paso County, Texas. It serves Socorro, Horizon City, and 
the
eastern portion of El Paso. The district covers 136 square miles of 
<A 
HREF="http://cs.utep.edu/elpaso/main.html">El Paso</A> County. Its 
northern
boundary is the Texas/New Mexico line its southern boundary is 
the Rio Grande
River. We are in Texas Education Agency <A 
HREF="http://www.utep.edu/~region19">Region
19</A>.</P>


<H3>Facilities</H3>

<P>Socorro ISD is one of the fastest growing school 
districts in the state
of Texas. The district has 13 elementary schools, 
four middle schools, three
high schools and one alternative school. 
Seventeen of the schools have been
built since 1980. Facilities are 
attractive and well maintained. The district
has increased the efficiency 
of the facilities by implementing <A HREF=

"http://socorro.k12.tx.us/sue.html">multi-track year-round education</A>,

thus serving 2,000 more students than the schools were intended to 
accommadate.
Socorro is also in the middle of a <A

Acceptable Use Policy</H2>
<IMG Align=left SRC=eyes.gif><BR><BR><BR>

<H4><IMG Align=Left SRC="gold.gif">What is the 
SISD Network and Internet?</H4>

       The SISD Network is Wide Area 
Network which connects campuses and other sites in  the district by high 
speed data lines enabling computers to communicate with each other within 
the school district.  Email accounts allow users to send messages in a 
few seconds to each other and keeps these messages in a mailbox.  Our 
SISD Network also contains curriculum, and administrative information 
allowing authorized users immediate access to district 
information.<BR><BR>



        The Internet is a collection of more than 
10,000 interconnected computer networks around the world that make it 
possible to share information almost instantly.  Every two minutes 
another domain name is added to the internet.  E-networks are owned by 
commercial, research, governmental, educational organizations and 
individuals.  The Internet allows almost 2 million computers and 23 
million users of those computers to collaborate easily and quickly 
through electronic mail, discussions, groups, and conferencing.  The Net 
has become a major global infrastructure for education, research, 
professional learning, public service, and business.<BR>
<BR>


        
Our Socorro Network is connected to the Internet through a T1 dedicated 
leased high speed data line to UTEP.  We pay monthly fees for this access 
to UT Austin who 
maintains the hardware routers for this connection.<BR>

<BR>


<H4><IMG Align=Left SRC="gold.gif">What are the benefits for 
Socorro ISD students and teachers having this network?</H4>

        
Classroom resources will be expanded enormously by making information and 
people from all over the world available to students, teachers and media 
specialists.  It brings instant access to original source material, 
general information, data, images, and computer software.  It makes 
contact with people possible, bringing into the classroom experts from 
all over the world, new and old friends, and colleagues.  Such access 
spawns individual and group projects, collaboration, curriculum 
materials, and idea sharing.  As a hands-on classroom tool, networks can 
motivate students.  They  encourage the kind of independence and autonomy 
that many educators agree is important for students to achieve.  Because 
class, race, ability, and disability are removed as communication factors 
or barriers, the Internet is a natural tool for addressing the needs of 
all students.<BR>
<BR>


	<H4><IMG Align=Left SRC="gold.gif">How can a 
student/teacher use the Internet to search for materials?</H4>

        
There are basically two ways we recommend schools search for internet 
materials on a particular topic:  (1)  Through the use of gopher, and (2)  
Through the use of WWW. 
          
     <UL><LI> (1)  For gopher, you 
can go to veronica.scs.unr.edu and select Search ALL of   Gopher space 
(4800 servers) using Veronica.  Select one of the servers allowing a 
search by Title word and type in the topic when the prompt appears.
<LI>      
(2)  For WWW, to URL:  http://lycos2.cs.cmu.edu/lycos-form.html, enter 
the  appropriate word for the search and hit button Begin Search. 
</UL>




<H4>What are some of the risks associated with accessing the 
Internet?</H4>

        Like other parts of real life, there are good 
things and bad things on the Internet.  
Most people are who they 
represent, but it is possible to misrepresent oneself.  Also, 
remember 
that not everything you read on-line may be true.  Students need to learn 
to 
discriminate between reliable sources of information and those that 
may be questionable.  Most universities have reliable information unless 
the information is found on a student machine, which will usually have a 
people from all over the world avaidisclaimer attached to it.  No one 
should respond to messages that are suggestive, obscene, belligerent, 
threatening, or make you feel uncomfortable.  We encourage you to let us 
know who and from where such messages may come from, so we may ban them 
from our link to the Internet.  NEVER give out your address or phone 
number to an unknown internet user.  Students, teachers, and staff are 
expected to use the Internet for the purpose of educational resources, 
not game playing or searching for objectionable materials.  Anyone found 
trying to go to an objectionable site will have their privileges lifted.




<H4><IMG Align=Left SRC="gold.gif">What can Socorro ISD System 
Administrator see and monitor?</H4>

        Socorro ISD has taken every 
step to ensure the best security and appropriate use of  the network.  
Filters have been placed both inside and outside to monitor all use of 
our link to the Internet.  That means that a log is kept showing who is 
using the link and what site they are trying to access.  We can even see 
attempts to connect to a site which we have banned.  Through the use of 
these filters, we hope to be able to maintain a safe and yet exciting 
interactive setting for students to use in their studies.  Should 
violations of the Acceptable Use Policy be found in the logs of these 
filters, appropriate action will be taken to deny access to the offending 
individual.<BR>
<BR>


	<H4><IMG Align=Left SRC="gold.gif">What are the 
Federal and State Laws in place regarding Computers and 			Internet 
Use?</H4>

       <H5> Federal Law:</H5>

        It is a violation of 
Federal Law intentionally:<BR>
     <OL><LI> To access a computer without 
authorization and thereby to obtain classified information. 
<LI>      To 
access a computer without authorization and thereby to obtain financial 
records of a financial institution.
<LI>      To access any U.S. 
Government computer without authorization if such conduct affects the use 
of the Government's operation of the computer.
<LI>       To access a 
Federal computer without authorization with the intent to defraud.
<LI>       
To access a financial institution or U.S. Government computer without 
authorization and thereby alter, damage, or destroy information which 
causes losses to others of a value exceeding $1000 or more during any one 
year or which modifies or impairs medical diagnosis, treatment, or care.

<LI>       With intent to defraud to traffic passwords or similar 
information through which a computer may be accessed if the trafficking 
affects interstate commerce or the computer is used by the U.S. 
Government.<BR>
</OL>
  The penalty can be a fine or as much as 20 years 
in the Federal penitentiary for certain of these violations.  (18 USCA 
sec. 1030)<BR>
<BR>


        Copyright is a constitutionally conceived 
property right which is designed to promote progress of science and the 
useful arts by securing for an author the benefits of his/her original 
work for a limited time (U.S. Constitution Art. 1, Sec. 8).  Congress has 
passed the copyright statute (17 USCA sec. 101 et seq) to implement this 
policy by balancing the author's interest against the public interest in 
the dissemination of information affecting areas of universal 
interest.<BR>
<BR>


       <H5> Texas State Law:</H5>

        It is a 
violation of Texas Law intentionally:<BR>
    <OL><LI>  To use a computer 
without the consent of its owner or to access data stored in a computer 
system without the consent of its owner or licensee if you know there is 
a security system intended to prevent your doing either of these things. 

<LI>      To give passwords, or similar confidential information about a 
computer security system to another person without the consent of the 
person employing the security system to restrict access to a computer or 
its data. 
<LI>      To cause a computer to malfunction or to interrupt 
operation of a computer system without the consent of its owner. 
<LI>      
To alter, damage, or destroy data or a computer program in a computer 
program. 
</OL><BR>
 Convictions under the Computer Crimes section of the 
Texas Penal Code can result in a sentence of a fine up to ten years (7 
Texas Penal Code, sec. 33).<BR>
<BR>





	<IMG Align=Left 
SRC="gold.gif"><H4>What are the responsibilities and uses of a 
password?</H4>

        Your password enables you to access to the 
Network.  It is your way to obtain access to information on line.  Should 
you give your password to someone else, and they abuse the use of your 
account, you will be held responsible for the wrong doing and may lose 
access.  Do NOT give your password to anyone else to use.  Should you 
believe that someone else may have seen or have your password, you have 
the ability to change your password at any time in order to keep it 
secret.  No passwords are meant for multiple users.  Anyone wanting a 
password needs to fill out the appropriate information found in the 
Acceptable Use Policy.<BR>
<BR>
 

<IMG Align=Left SRC="gold.gif"><H4>	
What is Netiquette?</H4>

        Netiquette is a term for correct and 
best use of electronic communications.  They 
include the following 
suggestions:

    <UL><LI>  Keep paragraphs and messages short and to the 
point.
<LI>      Focus on one subject per Email message and always 
include a pertinent subject title 		for the message, that way the user 
can locate the message quickly.
<LI>      Don't use academic networks for 
commercial or proprietary work.
<LI>      Include your name, position, 
affiliation, and internet address at the bottom of any 			Email message.

<LI>      Capitalize words only to highlight an important point or to 
distinguish a title or
<LI> heading.  *Asterisks* around a word can also 
be used to make a stronger 			point.Capitalizing entire words that are 
not titles is generally termed as 				SHOUTING!
<LI>      Limit line 
length and avoid control characters.
<LI>      Follow chain of command 
procedures for corresponding with superiors.  For  example, 		don't send 
a complaint via Email directly to the "top" just because 	you can.

	<IMG Align=Left 
SRC="gold.gif"><H4>What is the responsibility of the Teacher for Internet 
Access?</H4>

	Every student needs to be briefed by a teacher on the 
rules of the district regarding internet and network use.  Teachers 
should encourage students to use these vast resources, but must also 
caution them against misuse and the fact that they may lose the privilege 
if not used correctly.<BR>
<BR>


	Teachers are expected to keep an eye 
on the use of the Internet in their own classroom and report misuse to 
the district system administrator who will take appropriate action (A 
warning or termination of account).<BR>
<BR>


	Socorro wants their 
students to have the vast amount of educational resources available, but 
must also monitor itself to see that the machines are used for 
appropriate educational research.<BR>
<BR>


	Teachers are also expected 
to serve as models of correct use in their own accounts.<BR>
<BR>


	

	
<IMG Align=Left SRC="gold.gif"><H4>What is appropriate use of the SISD 
Network?</H4>

	SISD network is meant to be used for access to district 
information by administrators, access to the district library system, 
email access, and access to thousands of sites worldwide with 
instructional educational materials.  Students and teachers are 
encouraged to share especially good sources of educational materials, or 
even provide access to their own materials through a homepage. Please 
contact Pat Sullivan at 860-3435 if you need help in accessing or finding 
information on a particular topic.<BR>
<BR>

	
	<IMG Align=Left 
SRC="gold.gif"><H4>What are inappropriate uses of the SISD Network?</H4>

	
Internet access is considered a privilege and not a right.  This 
privilege can be denied to anyone who does the following:

    <OL><LI>  
Uses the net to access materials that are considered pornographic or  
inappropriate for educational purposes.
<LI>      Uses the net for 
advertising, soliciting, or harassment of any kind.
<LI>      Uses the 
net to try to access data that is protected and not intended for use.

<LI>      Uses someone else's account or password at any time.
<LI>      
Violates any federal or state laws regarding network access.
<LI>      
Tries in any way to interfere with the computer systems here at  Socorro, 
or anywhere, in an effort to obtain private information, have the 
computer malfunction, or destroy data.
<LI>      Violate any copyright 
laws by passing licensed software across the network. 
</OL>      

	<IMG 
Align=Left SRC="gold.gif"><H4>What steps will be taken for inappropriate 
use?</H4>

	It is the intention of the Department of Strategic Planning 
to provide a free and open system to the Socorro Network Users.  However, 
if serious misuse is reported, users will be banned from using the 
Network.<BR>
<BR>


	A database of registered users and banned users will 
be maintained by the district and monthly lists will be supplied to the 
campuses.  Every attempt will be made to warn students and teachers of 
violations before removing access.<BR>
<BR>


	<IMG Align=Left 
SRC="gold.gif"><H4>Whose responsibility is it to see that the SISD 
Network is used correctly?</H4>

	Primary responsibility for correct 
students use lies with the teacher who is supervising the classroom.  It 
is the teacher who should set the rules and see that they are enforced.  
Should it be necessary to deny access a request can be sent over email to 
<a href=mailto:psulli@socorro.k12.tx.us>Pat Sullivan</a>.  The system 
administrator will also review logs of staff and student use on a regular 
basis and take action on any attempts at violating the above rules and 
regulations.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=5><A NAME="Socorro">Socorro</FONT></A>, a small town on the
outskirts of El Paso, Texas, is rich in culture as well as history.  We
have spent some time researching some of that history and would like to
share it with everyone. There are four main areas we focused in on during
our research. They are: The Missions, The First Thanksgiving, the City of
Socorro, and The District of Socorro and when it started.<BR> <BR> <H3>The
Missions of El Paso</H3> <I><B>by Julio C. Cardiel</B></I><BR> <BR> On
hundred and fifty years after the deVaca, Coronado, and deSoto expeditions
of the 1500s there followed a time of retrenchment and consolidation for
Spanish Mexico. It was also a time of intense ferment and revolution on
the Great Plains.  During the

Pueblo Indian Revolt, many settlers ( Spanairds) and some Tigua and Piro
Indians were driven south.  With this migration of refugees, a new era
began in the Paso del Norte.  Places of worship began to evolve.  Missions
took root and thus began there history.<BR>
 <P> The most successful of all Missions built by the Spanish in Texas
were those built along the Rio Grande from Brownsville to El Paso.  Over
hundreds of years, these missions became centers of towns and farming and
ranching communities.The three missions that make up an important part of
El Paso's history,the Ysleta Mission, the Socorro Mission, and the San
Elizario Mission, are strung along the former banks of the famed Rio
Grande River. <IMG Align=left SRC="escon.gifs/ymission.GIF"><BR> <BR> <BR>
<P> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The Ysleta Mission was built in 1680 on a
site several hundred miles downriver from Paso del Notre on the south bank
of the Rio Grande.  It was part of Mexico until the river shifted in 1848. 
It then became part of the United States.  The mission was rebuilt four
times because of natural diasters with the last happening in 1907 when a
fire destroyed the roof and bell tower.  Today the Ysleta Mission is part
of the Tigua Indian Reservation and has been rebuilt to its original
beauty.<P> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <HR> <IMG
Align=right SRC="escon.gifs/smission.GIF"><BR> <BR> <BR> The Socorro
Mission was built in 1691 and was also a victim of natural disasters as
was the Ysleta Mission. In the 1740's, it was washed away by the Rio
Grande and rebuilt four years later.  In 1828 it washed away again but
wasn't rebuilt until 1843.  In 1873, a larger transept and sanctuary was
completed.  Today, the roof and vigas have been repaired using grant
money, but more extensive repairs are still needed.  <P> Recent
excavations southeast of the present mission have uncovered what is
believed to be the original building foundation of 1691.  Today the
mission remains the best of Indian tradition and Spanish design.<BR> <BR>
<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <HR> <IMG Align=left
SRC="escon.gifs/sanmission.GIF"><BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> The San Elizario
Mission was established as a military garrison to protect the Camino Real
(a major road running up from Mexico through San Elizario) and the
missions and settlements along its trails.  This mission was moved several
times from its original location just like the Socorro and Ysleta
Missions.  In 1877 the mission was rebuilt to accomidate the more than one
thousand people living in San Elizario.  That building still stands today
with only changes made to the interior after a fire in 1944 destroyed its
contents.  The San Elizario Mission is an outstanding example of late
adobe church architecture of the West Texas New Mexico tradition.<BR><BR>

<BR> <HR> <BR><P> <H3><A NAME="The First">The First
Thanksgiving</A></H3><BR> <B><B>by Robert Hernnandez and Ernie Aguilar
Jr.</B></B><BR> <BR>
  Almost 400 years ago, a group of Spanish conquistadores stopped to thank
God after venturing to the Rio Grande just east of present-day El Paso. 
In 1598, Don Juan de O&ntilde;ate's Thanksgiving Mass and meal signified
the first Thanksgiving in America. 





  It is believed that O&ntilde;ate's 1598 expedition held their ceremony
near San Elizario some 23 years before the Pilgrims had their Thanksgiving
feast in Plymouth, Massachussetts.  This is how it was remembered.<BR>
<IMG Align=Left SRC="escon.gifs/thanksgiving.GIF"><BR> <BR> <BR>
  Don Juan de O&ntilde;ate and his men were passing through what is now El
Paso when they discovered a beautiful flowing river, The Rio Grande, and
decided to stop.  The desert was hot and the troop was almost out of food
and water.  On April 20, 1598 they stopped by the river.  What a sight it
was, full of fish below, and ducks and geese above.  For ten days they
swam in the deep cool waters of the Rio Grande, rested under the giant
cottonwoods, hunted, fished, and ate plenty.  One day everyone decided to
gather and feast as part of giving thanks to this wonderful world.  That
was the first Thanksgiving in America.  Today people from all over come
and gather at San Elizario to celebrate the First Thanksgiving.  A
festival is held for the occasion with music, arts and crafts, food, and
native dancing.  Now you know where and when the true First Thanksgiving
was.<BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

<IMG Align=Right SRC="escon.gifs/council.GIF"><P> Socorro is recognized as
one of the two oldest towns in Texas.  The land Socorro sits on was a
grant based claim made by Spain nine years before the beginning of the New
England Colonies.  It therefore holds a place of honor in the history of
the entire United States.  The land was settled in 1598 by the
conquistadors, the true first familes of North America, (not including the
Native Americans).  The land would be known as the Pueblo de Socorro.<P>
<P> In 1835 Socorro became part of the Republic of Texas.  On April 26,
1871, Socorro was incorporated by an Act of the Twelfth Legislature of
Texas.  Socorro has not changed significantly in its 122 years of
existence.  Over sixty seven percent of its land is still in use for 
agriculture.<P> <P>
  For 65 years, Socorro was without a local government. An election held
was held on December 18, 1920 to decide once again if the town would
remain incorporated.  It remained incorporated until April 5, 1986 when
the citizens of Socorro elected a new mayor and reactivated the city
government.  Under the present council, lead by Mayor Rogelio Lozoya,
Community Development Block Grants for water and sewer, have been
received.  Federal and State money for improvements to streets, as well as
funding for affordable housing has also been received, creating a growing
community.<P><BR> <HR> <H3><A NAME="The Beginning">The Beginning Of The
Socorro Independent School District</A></H3><B>by Priscilla Guerrero and
Beatriz Dominguez</B><BR> ............(The First School Building in
Socorro) <BR> <IMG Align=left SRC="escon.gifs/prek.GIF"><BR> One of the
first schools built in the town of Socorro was Escontrias.  It was built
in 1924 on land donated by a Texas Ranger.  His name was Silverio
Escontrias, thus the name Escontrias School.  The original building served
as a school and housing for the single female teachers employed.  At the
time, Escontrias was the largest school in the county.  The county school
employed eight teachers and taught about 300 students in grades 1-7. 
Socorro was a fast growing district even then.  By 1926 the Districts
enrollment had reached 452 students.  In the 1930's, Escontrias school
became known as Socorro School.  In 1961, the people of the community
voted to create Socorro Independent School District. More classrooms were
added and in 1964 a cafeteria was built.  In 1966, Socorro School was
called Socorro Elementary School and was remodeled.<BR> The school went
through a series of name changes and grade levels beginning in 1973.  In
1981, it finally returned to its original name, Escontrias Elementary. 
The school went through another name change a few years later when it was
renovated for Pre-k grades and was called Escontrias Pre-K Center.  In
1986 a new Escontrias Elementary School was built next to the original
building.  Today Escontrias consists of both the new and old buildings and
serves pre-k through 5th.<BR> <BR> <HR> <BR> <H3><A

<CENTER><H2>THE TIME I PULLED GILBERT OUT OF A TREE</H2></CENTER>
     
One day my friend Gilbert and I fell out of a tree.  We were in my 
backyard.  I was five years old, and I was in kindergarten. At first, we 
were just climbing the tree.  Then, we got up higher and we were talking.  
It was fun.  We got a little scared because we went too high.  When we 
were going up, I said,  "Let's swing."  Then, Gilbert said, " Okay."  So, 
when we got high enough, we started to swing.  I went first.  Then 
Gilbert went.  When I was going, I slipped and fell.  I pulled Gilbert 
down with me.  When I pulled him with me, he fell on top of me.  Then, my 
mom came outside and took me inside.  We were not hurt, but we were 
hungry.  So, my mom made us sandwiches.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>PLAYING FAIRLY</H2></CENTER>
   Good sportsmanship means 
playing fairly when playing a game.  A good sport doesn't cheat.  A good 
sport follows the rules.  Helping your teammates is part of good 
sportsmanship.  You can be a good sport.
     Boys and girls can be good 
sportsmen by helping your parents, by playing fairly and by helping your 
teammates.  Be a good sport by being fair.   Do your best to be one.  
Don't get mad that you are losing.  You can be a good sportsman when you 
are at school, a park, or at a person's house.
     Some players help 
other players get up.  A good sportsman does everything he is told to do.  
A sportsman can be fun for everyone.  Some children act so badly.  Do 
your best and be proud that you are a good sportsman.
     Do you like 
sports?  I do.  Everyone should like sports.  Some people like all 
sports.  Try your best .  Never give up being a good sportsman.  You're a 
good sportsman every time.  Good sportsman means a lot to me.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>FRIENDS</H2></CENTER>
I am going to write an essay about my 
best friend T.C.  T.C. has been my best friend for life.  T.C. has been 
my classmate for almost three years.  So, we have been very good friends 
together.  Now, I will explain why he is so special. Tyson and I are 
students.  Tyson and I like to write.  We live with our moms and dads.  
We have the same classroom and we share the same teacher.  T.C. and I 
have little hairs. I like pizza and Tyson likes everything.  I like to 
play football and T.C. likes to play spy.  I have a motorcycle bike and 
he has a kid bike.  Tyson and I do not have the same eyes because his are 
blue and mine are black.  Tyson and I are not the same height because he 
is shorter and I am taller.  Tyson has a goldfish and I a chicken.  
Tyson's hair is blonde and mine is black.  Tyson is younger and I am 
older.  It's o.k. to be the same.  It is o.k. to be different.  But we 
are still friends.<BR>

ganaran la paz y la justicia.  Martin Luther King fue educado porque sus
padres le ensenaron comprandole libros.  El era pastor como su papa.  El
era lider porque queria cambiar leyes.  Marcho porque el queria cambiar
las leyes para tener amor en el mundo.  A la gente blanca y a la gente

<H2><CENTER>Annie and the Old One<BR>
Together, 
Forever<BR></CENTER></H2><BR>

<PRE>There's one old one, and one young one,
     That seem to be so much alike.
For one who weaves and one who listens,
     Can do so much together.
For this young girl and this old 
lady, go through so much.
This young girl does not understand,
     the saying, "Go to Mother Earth".
Then a day came when the grandmother called,
And the look she gave to Annie was very strange.
Annie knew, and she picked up the only thing
     she had left to remember,
Her grandmother's polished walking stick.
For Annie did not want her 
grandmother to go,
     she was furious and wanted to stop time.
Then her grandmother explained, as Annie listened,
     and understood.
     Annie began to weave,
     because she knew this on her own,
     Together they'd be forever.</PRE><BR>

She climbs into the huge aircraft on the long stretch 
of black runway at the New Guinea Airport.  What she doesn't know is that 
her life is about to change.  Who is this  woman?  Amelia Mary Earhart, a 
superstar.	Amelia Mary was born in Atchison, Kansas on July 24, 1898, in 
her grandparents home.  Her parent's names were Edwin and Amy Earhart who 
were soon to become parents over a baby daughter.  She was a beauty at 
age ten.  She had a thin face, long hair, and a very wide smile.  But as 
she grew older, she became more and more tom-boyish and cut her hair up 
past her chin. Growing boyish wasn't the only thing she grew in.  She 
also grew an interest for flying and planes.  She learned to fly in 
California and made it her career.  By 1922, she had received a pilot's 
license and had begun entering flying meets.  She served as the organization's president from 1930 to 1933. On July 1, 1937, Amelia 
attempted to make a solo trip around the world.  Somewhere in the 
Southern Pacific, she, her navigator, and her plane vanished.
	Amelia 
Earhart's life was over but memories were still there.  She is honored 
all over the world because she was the first woman to try and attempt to 
make a flying trip around the world.  That is why she is famous.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>The Wild West</H2></CENTER>
Here I am covered in tape, a 
broken lead, no eraser, and broken in half.   I wonder now what had just 
happened to me?  Lost in the wild frontier of the wild west under a bed.  
Not just any bed.  The bed of messiness where toys get lost and homework 
is gone and monsters of lint hide.  I'm lost under it!
	I, Bic #2, lost 
under the bed of messiness.  This is how it all began.
	Once I was a new 
pencil wrapped in plastic in a store called K-Mart.  I had been there for 
three weeks waiting to be bought and either taken to a school or a home.  
Here came my chance.
	A nine year old boy called Ricky with short black 
hair, bright green eyes, and a voice of an angel said, "Hey Dad.  I want 
that pencil," and he pointed to me.  He picked me up, paid for me, and 
took me home. 
	 When I got home, I was disappointed.  It was a mess!!!  
Socks on the door knob, posters on the wall, video games on the floor, 
and toys  roaming the room.  I made the best of it.  Then it happened.  
He dropped me and kicked me under the bed.  Everything went black. 
	 
When I woke up, I was surrounded by X-Men toys.  They took me to a Barney 
doll.  I screamed in terror.  The Barney doll started singing.  Then my 
lead snapped, and my eraser popped, but that was wonderful compared to 
when the doll hugged me.  I slipped out and rolled away.  When I stopped, 
I was ready to snap in half but an Elvis doll made me stop by singing 
"Heart Break Hotel."  Elvis said he knew the way out  from under the bed 
, but  he was to old, fat, and to chicken to go.  He told me the way out.  
I followed the way and encounterd tribes of homework, rotten pizza, and 
caves of lint.  As I walked, his words of wisdom pondered my mind, 
"Follow the smell of pie and bring me some."
	 I made it out and rolled 
to Ricky.  He picked me up and said, "Boy, I cant use this pencil," and 
he threw me into the trash.  I now think I should have stayed under the 
bed of messiness! <BR>

<CENTER><H2>HOW 
TO DECORATE AN INDIAN TURKEY</H2></CENTER>
 I am going to tell you how my 
family and I made my Indian Turkey.  My assignment was to decorate a 
paper turkey with my family.  First, I made a drawing of how my turkey 
would look after it was done.  We looked at the drawing and my mom said 
to add some more things to it, so I did.  My mom got all the supplies 
together and placed them in the kitchen table.  Second, my mom gave me 
the macaroni and the food coloring and I got a a bowl and I put the 
macaroni and food coloring in it.  I left it to dry for twenty minutes.
     
Next, I went to my sisters' room and got red ribbon for the turkey head 
band.  Then I went to the den to get feathers from my pet bird and I got 
bird seeds to complete my head piece and the seeds for the neck.  I glued 
them on the turkey.  My sister came and made an Indian dress made out of 
brown and gray felt.  I got the macaroni and put it on the vest and on 
the head band.
     Then I drew a waddle on the face of my turkey.  I 
rolled and glued some crepe paper and placed it on the legs and wings of 
the turkey.  Finally, I got coffee filters from my mom's coffee machine 
and decorated the back feather.  My mom and sister put drops of food 
coloring on the coffee filters to give it different colors.
     I am 
finished telling you how to decorate an Indian Turkey.  I am glad I 
decorated this turkey with my family.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>MY LOST SHOES</H2></CENTER>
I am going to 
tell about the day that somebody threw away my shoes.  I was 5 years old 
when this happened.  The teacher, my friends and I were in the first 
grade class in Mexico.
     One day I went to play and I came back to 
class tired.  I took off my shoes and put them on the floor under my 
desk.  My mom came to pick me up and she asked me, "Where are your 
shoes?"
     I said, "I have them at my desk."
     Then she said, "No, 
theyre not at your desk."
     We looked all around the classroom for my 
shoes but we didn't find them.  The teacher was throwing some paper away, 
and she said, "Here are your shoes!"  They were in the trash can.  My 
teacher gave me my shoes and my mom took me home.
     I will always 
remember this time because I was little and it was a funny thing to 
happen to me.  I was crying because I liked the shoes so much and I had 
never taken my shoes off in class before.  But everything turned out all 
right, and my mom and I laugh about it now.

was 93 years old. When Harriet Tubman was little she carried water to the 
slaves.  Harriet Tubman was sold to a lady to make cloth.  When Harriet 
Tubman took care of the baby, she couldn't let the baby cry.  When she 
let the baby cry, she would get whipped.  When she got sick, she went to 
the pig pen for a few days and hid.  When she was found, she was sold 
back to work in the fields.  When there was a runaway slave, she got hit 
in the head and started bleeding.  Harriet Tubman's brain was hurt.  She 
didn't know when she was going to fall asleep. She escaped by the 
Underground Railroad.  Harriet Tubman followed the North Star and the 
moss on the trees in order to go north.  When dogs came, she had to walk

<CENTER><H2>The 
Dangerous Journey</H2></CENTER>


It was a spring, rainy, ugly day, in El 
Paso, in a backyard.  It's exactly David's and J.J.'s backyard.  J. J. 
had curly hair, M & N pants, and a shirt that says "J.J.".  David was the 
strong one on his elephant Roulf.  David and J.J. got the elephant at the 
zoo for being  good guests. The elephant was real strong and fast. He had 
a very long and strong trunk. J.J. and I decided to go on a faraway 
journey to Canada. The next day we asked Roulf if he could come. Roulf 
said, "No!" So we told him, "We'll give you ten bags of butter peanuts." 
So he said, "Let's go tomorrow." The next day we were packed and ready to 
go.  We got on Roulf and Roulf passed every single car.  Finally when 
J.J. and I were asleep on the elephant, Roulf stopped and it woke me up.  
One side of the forest was dark,  ugly, and muddy and the other side was 
nice, gentle, and pretty.  I said "Let's go left, Roulf," but Roulf went 
right. He wanted an adventure.
<PRE>	"AAAAAAAAAHhhhh!" screamed J.J. in a 
great fury. 
	 "J.J., don't worry," I said.  
	J.J. said, "I am scared."
	 
I said, "Stop Roulf."
	There was a big fence and a big sign that said 
CLOSED!  
	I asked J.J., "Do you know the way back?"
	J.J. said, "No!"
	I 
said, "I don't know the way back either. "
	J. J. said,  "I wonder if 
Roulf could jump the fence."
	I said, "No!"	So we spent the night.
</PRE>	
The next day when we could see a little better, we saw our house.  I had 
put a CLOSED sign on it so nobody could visit.  The very next day J.J. 
and I ate and watched T. V.  J.J. and I learned an important lesson, 
"Never go on a dangerous journey."<BR>

<CENTER><H2>A BANANA SPLIT</H2></CENTER>

I am going to make a banana 
split.  I am making it for my dad because he likes sweets. I am making it 
because I enjoy making them. Now, I need the ingredients. They are a 
cherry, banana, chocolate syrup, pecans, and ice cream. First put four 
scoops of ice cream. Be sure to put two scoops on each side. Then slice 
the banana and put it in the bowl exactly on the middle of the ice cream. 
Cover the banana and the ice cream with chocolate syrup.  You may 
sprinkle pecans then put a cherry on top. Now I am finished and my dad 
can enjoy his banana split.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>THE TIME I GOT LOST AT FURR'S</H2></CENTER>
 One Sunday, my 
mom and I went to Furr's to buy bread.  I was looking at the toys that 
were beautiful!  When I turned over, my mom was not there.  I was scared.  
I was all over the store.  I was shaking because all the people were 
looking at me.  I was embarrassed.  I was crying, but I didn't find my 
mom.  My heart sounded like this, "pum..pum...pum" and then faster, "pum 
pum pum, pum pum pum."  I was sad, my eyes were wet.  There were 115 
people looking at me.  I looked in the bathroom, in the vegetables , and 
in the bread, but my mom was not there.  I ran and ran all over the 
store, until I almost ran over her.  I was so happy to see my mom that I 
wiped my tears from  my eyes and kissed my mom a million times.<BR>

<CENTER><H2>WHY IS IT SOMETIMES HARD TO SAY NO TO 
DRUGS?</H2></CENTER>


     This paper is about why sometimes it is hard 
to say no to drugs. What if your cousin is at your grandparents house 
when you are there?  He says,"Let's go into the backyard and smoke some 
pot.  If you don't, I'll tell Grandma you ruined her flower bed."  Right 
when he says that, you think, "Should I do it or not?"  It is a really 
confusing answer to come up with.  You might take a lot of time trying to 
figure out the answer.  That is why sometimes it is hard to say no to 
drugs.
     <P>
What if your friend comes up to you and says, "I'll play 
with you, if you come with me to your room to sniff some cocaine."  That 
question is very hard to answer.  He might be your best and only friend 
in the world.  You have to think it over and over again.  You ask 
yourself, "Should I do it or not?"  You might think of the risks you have 
In taking it and the risks you have on not taking it.  So you might need 
to talk it over.  For that reason, it is hard to say no to him.
    <P>
 
What if your big brother comes up to you and says, "Come up to my room 
and chew some chewing tobacco.  If you don't, I'll tell mom you broke her 
Elvis record."  You know that record is your mom's favorite.  You might 
say that chewing tobacco can cause cancer to the mouth, but he might just 
laugh at you.  He is your big brother and you love him very much.  What 
should you do?  In that situation saying no to drugs is very hard.
     
Now you know why sometimes it is hard to say not to drugs.  Sometimes 
people use peer pressure.<BR><BR>
<CENTER><H2>The Pencil 
Adventure</H2></CENTER>

How would you like to be lost under a dark dark 
bed for some time? I know I wouldn't like to be lost under there.  Hi, 
I'm Ben.  I'm a brand new pencil that was lost under a bed for a little 
while.  My master was irresponsible so that is how I got lost.  Well,  
maybe all seven year old pencil keepers are not good pencil owners.
	 It 
was a beautiful, breezy Monday.  All of a sudden I was picked up and 
sharpened.  The kid's mom called him to breakfast, and he went 
downstairs.  I was very happy that my owner liked me.  I was waiting for 
him when a gust of wind came in and blew me into a dark spooky place.  I 
found wood beams and smelly socks.  I had heard tales that this was the 
place where pencils had no return. I was fighting my way through huge 
dust balls of lint.  I saw some light and I followed it.  It led me into 
a kingdom filled with brand new pencils that were lost under the bed.  I 
asked one pencil, "Do you know where I am?" 
	He replied, "This is where 
pencils stay until they find a way out." 
	 I thought , "BOY that kid 
loses a lot of things!"
	I soon left.  I bumped into a great, humongous 
rock.  It moved a little and said, "Ha, Ha, Ha, another pencil I could 
eat.  I love pencils.  That is why under here pencils never come out 
because I always eat them."  
	I got scared and said in a shaky voice, 
"Dont eat me.  Im barely brand new."  
	"Be quiet!" he roared.  He 
started to put some salt and pepper on me.  Some pepper got into my nose 
and I sneezed so hard, that it blew me into a breezy opening.  I looked 
and saw some sunlight on my orange paint.  Quickly I ran out following 
the light.  It came to me that I was in  my master's room.  Another gust 
of wind came and blew me onto a shelf.  I noticed that my master was 
looking for me.  After a while, he found me.  I was very happy.  He 
called me his special pencil.  I was very thankful that I got out from 
under the bed.
	I was very famous to my master.  He loved me.  I heard 
him say that I was a very good pencil.  He carried me around everywhere.

<H1>ISP Primer - March 29'th Version</H1>

<MENU>
<LI>Author: Bill Gassman
</MENU>

<P>

<H2>Introduction: This primer is for use by Digital sales and
sales support channels, to educate the reader about the ISP market.
 This is not a finished document, and will be revised when time
permits.  However, you may find it useful now.    Please send
your comments to Bill Gassman - gassman@zko.dec.com</H2>

<H1>Introduction:</H1>

<P>
The Internet Service Provider market is expanding or consolidating
depending on which analyst you talk to.  There does not seem to
be a near term shortage of business inquiries from ISPs however.
 This document is written to educate Digital's sales and sales
support channels.  It is a tutorial on what an ISP is, what is
important to them, and what Digital has to offer.  This document
may also be of some use to those getting into the ISP market.
 
<P>
The term Internet Service Providers represents a broad range of
enterprises, that offer access to the Internet in one way or another.
 There are three primary types of Internet access provided.  
They are dial-up access, dedicated access, and hosted services.
 
<P>
Dial-up access is a popular way for home users and business users
on the road access the Internet.   Charges may be a flat fee or
based on connect time.   There is a wide variety of  rate plans.
  When a user dials up to an Internet provider's facility, there
is a authorization sequence that identifies the user, make sure
that the account is valid, and keeps track of the time connected.
 
<P>
Dedicated access customers can range from small businesses or
organizations to large corporations.  The ISP provides Internet
access through addressing and full time bandwidth to the customer's
private network.  The dedicated access customer can be a consumer
or provider of information to the Internet.  They often have their
own intranet,  email system, and external web site.  An ISP may
be called in to consult on web server design, commerce using the
Internet, email, intranet network issues, security concerns, and
the installation of a firewall.  The corporate customer may be
sophisticated enough to not require any services from the ISP
except bandwidth and data circuit maintenance.
<P>
Web hosting is a popular business for ISPs to engage in.  The
hosted customer wants to establish a presence on the Internet,
but does not have the skills or investment to do it at their site,
or wants to conduct a trial before commiting to it.  The ISP will
help the business obtain a registered domain name in the Internet
name space (i.e., business.com), and set up the ISP server to
respond to requests directed to the business's address.  Electronic
mail and web hosting are the top applications that will be supported
for the business.  Access from the business to the ISP will be
either dial up client or a dedicated network connection.  The
ISP's customer may want to maintain the web pages, the ISP may
offer it as a service, or a third party may be involved.  
<P>
Beyond the basic connection and technical assistance, there are
many services that an ISP can provide to their customers.   The
range and quality of these services are often the distinction
between ISPs.   Primary services are email, Internet news, and
web page hosting.  Email is important, because the customer can
receive and store mail while not being connected to the Internet.
 A news service allows a customer to read and submit articles
in the many newsgroups.  Web page hosting allows the customer
to place a web home page on the ISP's server, allowing it to be
available all the time.  Other services an ISP may provide are
chat servers, allowing groups of people to connect to a single
point and type a conversation with each other, file storage, 
local search engines,  mailing list distribution servers, shell
account service, search engines, and encrypted tunneling servers
for accessing private networks.  
<P>
Since most dial-up users are concerned about long distance telephone
charges, an ISP may be limited to the size of the local calling
area.  To get around this limitation, an ISP can build a &quot;point
of presence&quot; or POP in remote calling areas.  The remote
POP is usually connected back to the ISP's central site via high
speed circuits,  or in some cases may be directly connected to
the Internet at the remote site.  Large ISPs may have a network
with hundreds of remote POPs.  These ISPs attract large customers,
because corporate connections can be made all within the ISPs
network, giving greater control over throughput and response time.
<H1>Operations:</H1>

<P>
An ISP operation is similar to the service bureaus of the 1970's.
 There is a business and technical side to staying in business.
 Marketing and sales brings in new business, customer support
maintains the existing business, and operations takes care of
the service.  The network and the servers need to be maintained
to be efficient and available, and secure.  
<H2>Accounting and Billing:</H2>

<P>
Billing is the lifeblood of an ISP.    Data circuits put a monthly
drain on the budget, and it's important to have the monthly flow
of customer activity charges coming in.  No matter what the billing
policy of an ISP, some kind of system is needed to keep track
of the customers, their account details, and their payment history.
 
<P>
Billing packages tailored for ISPs are just emerging on the market,
but they have specific features that are important.  The first
requirement is flexibility.  Some ISPs charge a flat fee, some
provide a number of hours free, some vary the charge by modem
speed, some have additional charges for extra services.  Building
a custom billing package is expensive, so the off the shelf ones
need to adapt to the policy of the ISP.  Linkages to the authentication
packages is another important feature.  No matter whether it's
CHAP/PAP, or RADIUS, or TACACS, or RAS, the billing package must
be able to read the records.    A very nice feature is the ability
for the access software to integrate it's user database with the
billing package user database.  Other nice features of a billing
package are the ability to verify credit card charges, and to
prepare customer statements and deliver them by email.
<P>

<H2>Authorization:</H2>

<P>
The lifeblood of an ISP that supports dial-in users is the authentication
of the users, and keeping track of their usage.  More than one
ISP has gone out of business because the accounting and billing
system failed, and several months of revenue were lost.  
<P>
A user's call is answered by a modem, which is connected to a
&quot;network access device&quot;, or a &quot;terminal server&quot;.
 This is the first link in the accounting chain.  Depending on
the vendor of the access device, a specific sequence of  identification
is performed.  Once this sequence is successful, the TCP/IP initialization
and data flow can begin.
<P>
There are many defacto standards on the market today for performing
the authentication.  Most get a username and password from the
dial in client, then use a client server network approach to talk
to an authentication server, where the user database is stored.
 The server sends back a &quot;OK to connect&quot; message to
the network access device, and records a log of the time that
the user connected.  When the user disconnects, another record
is sent from the network access device to the authentication server
to log the disconnect time.  The daily file of connects and disconnects
is the raw material of the billing systems.
<P>
There are many authentication protocols in use today.  The CHAP/PAP
is one of the more popular one.  A variant of PAP/CHAP is being
recommended by Microsoft, and will no doubt be the choice of a
Windows NT server.
<P>
Kerberos has been used as an authentication scheme.  This technology
comes from the MIT Athena project.  It however is fairly complex
to use, and has not seen a lot of popularity.
<P>
The Livingston company has written and is making popular the RADIUS
authentication protocol.  It's in use by several other companies.
 There is no firm standard yet for Radius, so each implementation
may have it's uniqueness, however, it is expected to become an
Internet RFC soon.  CISCO also is pushing an authentication process
called TACACS.

<P>
NOTE: Add RFC for Radius
<P>
TACACS+ Software information - http://cio.cisco.com/warp/public/558/42.html
<P>
Important issues for an authentication system are server software
availability, flexibility of the authentication software, wide
support of clients, linkages between the access software and the
billing system, and consistency to  customers.  
<P>
Leading vendors of network access devices are Livingston, Ascend,
US Robotics, and Cisco.  Digital also has a line of network access
devices.  Alternatives to using a dedicated network access server
are to use the PPP support on a UNIX server, or use the RAS support
that comes with Windows NT.  
<P>
The use of a dedicated network access device is a better approach
than using a multifunctional host.  If a host based access is
used for dial in, there are several things to watch out for. 
 There is often limited bus space inside the server to attach
dial in boards.  Expansion is not easy past a certain point. 
 There can be a heavy interrupt load on the server if the dial
in hardware does not off load a lot of the communication function.
 It is also hard to switch the lines to a new system when a server
needs to be taken down for upgrades or reconfiguration.  In general,
while it can be done, it should only be done at low volumes or
as a backup strategy.  
<P>
There is a very competitive market today for network access devices.
 Integration of high capacity data circuits (T1 and/or ISDN) with
modem cards and routers make for a clean package that is easy
to install and support with minimum footprint.  
<P>
When choosing a network access device, make sure it can handle
the full load of lines at full speed.  There are devices on the
market that support more lines than they can really handle.  In
an ISP environment, where the ratio of customers to lines is always
an issue, it's critical that the access hardware can handle a
full load.
<H2>Customer Support:</H2>

<P>
Customer support is the interface between the ISP and it's customers.
 Many customers have little understanding of the technology behind
the Internet services they are using, and the ISP represents the
lifeline to those services.  No matter if the problem is ISP related
or not, the ISP is often the first place the customers will come
to resolve their problems.   After dial-in availability and Internet
throughput, customer service factors into customer's perception
of an ISP's quality.  
<P>
In the customer support business, the most important feature is
to be able to take the call and acknowledge it.  The answer can
come later, but customers need to know that the problem has been
reported successfully.  A busy line, or a call unanswered is a
fast way to lose customers.  
<P>
The next most important aspect of customer support is to handle
the calls well.  Calls that are lost, or forgotten get customers
looking elsewhere for service.  A call tracking system of some
sort is the answer.  Each call needs to have a resolution, even
if the problem is not one that can be fixed.  
<P>
If an ISP does not provide off hour support, customers need to
be aware of this.  Often, an answering service can be used to
log the calls and explain that the reply will be made during business
hours.  Some ISPs will use a professional call handling service
that can provide some degree of call triage, and alert the ISP
to emergencies.   There is an emerging market of call centers
that ISPs can sign up with.  The &quot;National Support Center&quot;
is one to look at (01-800-672-3683).
<P>
Since the business provided is the Internet, it makes a lot of
sense to use the Internet to provide some degree of automated
service.   A web page with frequently asked questions, a news
section, and a real time status page go a long way to making customer
support automated.   An EMAIL responder can also be useful.  For
those customers that are having connection problems, an automated
voice response system may help reduce the load on the support
staff.  
<P>
The use of a good trouble tracking system makes response time
to problems quicker.  These systems create categories for problems,
and record resolutions.  For problems that have been solved before,
a trouble tracking system is great for identifying and resolving
the problem again.  Good systems will report on average time a
call is open, where the calls are coming from, what kinds of problems
are occurring, and who is fixing the problems.  An ideal trouble
tracking system will allow users to submit trouble tickets electronically,
via EMAIL or a web page.  It's important to not fall behind in
the support area, and trouble tickets systems if used correctly,
help an ISP stay ahead.
<P>
The customer support staff needs to be aware of the different
kinds of calls that will come in, and deal with them appropriately.
<P>
When a business or dial in customer comes on line for the first
time, there are bound to be start up questions.  The questions
are often the same, and can be handled with a &quot;frequently
asked question&quot; report.  It is very important to satisfy
the customer during this start up phase.  
<P>
Support calls that involve down time need to get rapid action.
 An ISP should be monitoring their own equipment, so problems
relating to the ISP network should be detected before the calls
come in.  Problem isolation is the first step, then resolution,
testing the fix, and service restoration.  The problem will often
be the customer's fault.  ISP policy and contracts with the customer
determine how far the diagnostic process goes, and what charges,
if any, apply.  
<P>
Performance problems and unavailable remote services complaints
will often be out of the control of the ISP.  Testing, understanding
the complaint, and education of the customer is the best approach.
 The ISP should be aware of the average performance to remote
locations on the Internet, and know how the real time statistics
relate to the average.
<P>
Support issues can overwhelm the business of an ISP if care is
not taken.  The best approach is to attack and resolve the top
10 problems.  Bubble the next ten to the top of the list, and
solve those.  By keeping a top ten list, most customers are kept
happy.  Some ISPs get into trouble by choosing the cheapest computing
and networking hardware in order to get into business quickly
at the least cost.  The phrase &quot;you can pay now or later&quot;
applies to ISPs.  Spend the money on good modems or you will be
spending too much time fixing them.  Buy computers with enough
&quot;head room&quot; that you can expand without scrapping. 
Evaluate the software carefully before building a business on
it.  Pilot new services before going mainstream with them.  If
support issues overwhelm an ISP, people costs can sky rocket and
limit the cash available to grow the business.  
<P>
Dial-up users can put a heavy load on the customer service department
of an ISP.  Each customer requires a sign up process, where the
account is established, and the technical details of connecting
are figured out.  All accounts have the accounting and billing
issues that keep the ISP in business.  
<H2>Network and System Management</H2>

<P>
The tasks of network and system management should be automated
as much as possible.  An ISP must have the  configuration and
performance issues under control.  The security and availability
of the network and servers are critical.  Faults must be detected
and corrected as soon as possible.  
<P>
Since the primary business of an ISP is bandwidth, an ISP must
know the up time, throughput, and error statistics of all data
circuits.  The duty cycle profile of the dial in lines helps determine
if more are needed.  Routing information on the routers must be
kept efficient and up to date.  Traffic flow analysis is useful
when adjusting the topology of the network.
<P>
The server performance statistics are important.  Is there enough
memory, processing power, and disk space?  Is the system swapping
too much?  Is there a good load balance among multiple systems?
 How many web pages are being served?  
<P>
Each piece of equipment needs to be accounted for.  The make and
model, the serial number, purchase price, current value service
contract and contact information should all be in a database.
 The database should also contain the software installed, along
with the version and patches installed.  This database not only
helps with the financial reporting of the business, but is invaluable
during trouble shooting exercises.
<P>
System backup and recovery procedures are important.  There should
be a schedule for backing up both customer data, applications,
and operating systems.  Incremental backups should occur more
frequently than full backups, and second generation backup media
should be stored off site as disaster protection.  A documented
procedure for recovery should be done for the most common types
of failure.  These are operator error, disk failure, and computer
failure.  The ISP should understand how they would recover if
they had a fire and had to relocate the business to another site.
 
<P>
Outsourcing network and system management to service groups is
popular among some ISPs where broad technical skills are required
but are hard to aquire.  
<H2>Training:</H2>

<P>
As the Internet expands and becomes more mainstream, the ISP represents
the &quot;person behind the curtain&quot; that makes the magic
happen.  There is a big opportunity for an ISP to generate revenue
by consulting with customers.  There needs to be a balance between
helping a customer solve a problem as presales activity, and making
a profit helping the customer better exploit the Internet for
their own use.  
<P>
Some ISPs offer courses on Internet basics.  These courses can
be focused towards dial in customers or business customers, and
can be for a fee or free.  As an ISP is trying to establish a
business in a new market, free seminars at business gatherings,
educational institutions, and even the local computer store can
generate business.  It is not uncommon to see an ISP sponsoring
a seminar partnered with a computer store or office supply store.
<P>
As business grows, ISPs often branch out into consulting for profit.
 Web page design, security consulting, intranet design, and application
development are all in high demand.  ISPs can often get into the
business of maintaining a customer's internal network, if they
choose to get into that phase of the business.  
<P>
There is also money to be made in the reselling of network equipment
to customers.  An ISP can be a distributor of routers, hubs, firewalls,
web servers, commerce servers, PCs and software.  More profit
can be seen when the equipment is set up and serviced by the ISP.
 
<H1>Telecommunications</H1>

<P>
The major business of most ISPs is to relay packets of data from
one place to another over some form of communications equipment.
 The interface between the routers, modems, and servers with the
outside world is the telecommunications equipment.  The wires
usually come into a secured area and are &quot;punched down&quot;
onto connection blocks.  Data circuits may come in as a pair of
copper wires, a bundle of 50 copper pair, a fiber optic link,
or coax cable from a microwave or satellite dish. There is a point
of demarcation, called a DMARK, where the responsibility for the
data circuit transfers from the telecommunication company to the
ISP.  This point is often a piece of electronic equipment called
a data set unit/computer set equipment or &quot;DSU/CSU&quot;.
 A DSU/CSU isolates the external wiring from the internal wiring,
and can be remotely set to loopback a signal by the telecommunication
company's central office.  It is important to plan the space for
the wires and cables to come in.  The layout should be neat, and
clearly labeled.  There should be space for maintenance people
to work, with light and power.  Network connections should also
be available near the telecommunications rack to help with troubleshooting.
<P>
The location of a ISP's central office must be selected with consideration
of telecommunication circuit availability.  Not all locations
can get access to ISDN circuits, or even bundles of 50 pair voice
cables.  Some areas have very long lead times for new circuits,
while other areas are quicker, even with the same carrier.  Discussion
of short and long term plans with the local carriers is important.
<P>
An ISP's network is analogues to a plumbing system, or a chemical
process plant.  There are connections to worry about, and data
flows to keep moving.  The quality of an ISP directly relates
to the ability to manage the connections, bandwidth, and throughput
in their network.  
<P>
The size of the pipes and how information flows through them are
a reflection of the kind of service offered, and the size of the
customer base.  
<P>
There are two major parts of the equation.
<H2>Downstream Considerations:</H2>

<P>
The terms upstream and downstream are used when discussing connections
from an ISP to other sites.  Downstream circuits refer to those
that route information further away from the Internet core while
upstream connections route data closer to the core.  Another way
of looking at it is that an ISP charges for downstream links and
pays for upstream links.
<P>
Dialup users represent one style of downstream customers.  Their
data flow will be typically more inbound than outbound, with their
WEB traffic most often going to the Internet core and their EMAIL
being read from ISP owned servers.  As a rule, general public
customers use the dialup service during nonworking hours and weekends.
 Business customers such as sales people and those without a corporate
network use dialup lines during business hours.  
<P>
Another source of downlink customers are the directly connected
business customers.  These customers are usually permanently on
line, and have a different data characteristic.  Business customers
provide their customers with a service via web pages, so outbound
traffic may exceed inbound traffic.  If the business has a lot
of web and email users, inbound traffic may also be heavy.  Depending
on the type of business, traffic flow may be heaviest during business
hours.  Traffic will be flowing in , and the ISP will see heavy
data flowing from the customer's network into the Internet.  There
may also be a heavy flow of data from the ISP servers, where web
hosting occurs.
<P>
An ISP can choose to resell upstream bandwidth to other ISPs,
generating yet another revenue source with downstream links. 

<P>
To extend the geographic area supported, an ISP may have built
distributed access points called &quot;point of presence's&quot;
(POPs).  Where POPs are used, dial in connections and possibly
full time lines are brought into remote network access server
and routers.  Traffic from the remote POP is routed to the ISP's
central office and from there onto the Internet.  Some ISPs connect
remote POPs directly to the Internet, providing a more direct
route for remote users and providing a backup link for the ISP
network incase a primary link fails.
<H2>Upstream Considerations</H2>

<P>
Upstream circuits connect the ISP and it's customers to the Internet.
 They represent the agrigation of all sent and received traffic.
 The capability, performance and reliability of these circuits
are important.  However, they represent a major expense, so must
be chosen carefully.
<P>
The connection can be as simple as a single circuit to another
ISP, can involve connections to multiple other ISP's, or can include
high bandwidth connections to a network access point (NAP).
<P>
The Internet is made up of a mesh of ISP's connected together.
 A developing trend is for regional ISPs to connect together at
a group funded site, then tie regional sites together with higher
speed circuits.  In a hierarchieal fashion, sites agrigate, connect
with peers, and connect with higher bandwidth circuits until they
reach the core of the Internet.  The largest network access points
are connected by very high speed data circuits, often in the 45
to 144 megabits per second range.  The performance and throughput
for customers of an ISP will be related to how close the ISP is
to the major NAP circuits.  
<P>
It is generally considered good practice to split the upstream
bandwidth across multiple data circuits, and upstream ISPs.  This
provides redundancy in case one data circuits needs repair, and
provides a choice of paths into the Internet, introducing a level
of load balancing based on destination.  Some ISPs will dedicate
data circuits for web hosted and business customers, so inbound
requests don't get clogged up sharing bandwidth with dial up customers
doing web browsing.  
<P>
A business decision needs to be made around the policy for connecting
to other ISPs. If an ISP is willing to be an upstream provider
for other ISPs, then pass through traffic will be a major consideration
in choosing upstream bandwidth and providers.  If multiple connections
to ISPs is made for redundancy reasons, then a policy must be
made on traffic route through.  There is a often a sense of cooperation
among ISPs, especially where they are geographically or business
segment isolated from each other.  Unless the upstream connection
is to a NAP, legal agreements and understandings should be made
with the upstream and downstream providers.
<H2>Telecommunications Options:</H2>

<P>
The ISP has a wide variety of data circuit technology choices
today.  Dialup, ISDN, leased analog line, digital data service,
frame relay, ATM, satellite, and sonet are among the many options.
<P>
Dial up customers present a challenge to the ISPs.  The more dial
in lines required, the bigger the problem.  There are several
ways to bring in a lot of data circuits.  Large cables with 50
pairs of wires will support 48 phone lines.  These large cables
are connected to a 'punch down' block, and fanned out to individual
modems.  A popular approach is to use a T1 data circuit for every
24 analog voice lines.  A single data circuit carries all 24 voice
circuits, and is split up electronically at the ISP site.  There
are network access devices on the market today that combined with
a router, allow a T1 connection in, and provide an Ethernet connection
out.  
<P>
ISDN is another popular way to bring in a lot of dialup users.
 An ISDN PRI circuit will supply 24 inbound ISDN or analog calls
on a single circuit. 
<P>
For full time connections, frame relay has a wide following. 
With a single physical connection into a frame relay cloud, multiple
'virtual circuits' can be formed.  Remote POPs can link into a
frame cloud to create private links back to an ISP central office.
 Costs for the frame connection are a bit more expensive than
a dedicated circuit, but if the characteristics of the frame are
used, costs become a lot cheaper.  Additional virtual connections
are inexpensive, and adding new sites means only one installation
charge, not one for both ends.  
<P>
Standard 56/64Kbs data circuits and T1/E1 are also popular.  T1
is a US term, while E1 refers to European and Asian standards.
 They come in use where access to a common frame relay is not
available, or the dedicated nature of the line makes it worth
the lower cost.  For example, if a data circuit is going to be
fully used, tied only to a single remote end, then a dedicated
circuit will be less expensive.  
<P>
Above T1/E1 the next standard telecom standard is T3/E3.  This
is 45 megabits per second, and is the fastest connection widely
available from the telcos.  If an ISP is supporting a lot of downstream
T1/E1s, or has a customer base of over 2000, T3/E3 starts to become
necessary.  A T3 connection should be only hooked to an upstream
ISP with T3/E3 connections to a NAP, or to a NAP directly.   
<P>
A growing option is the use of microwave to provide direct connections
from an ISP to a upstream Internet provider.  This is only available
in some cities.  Typical bandwidth ranges from 10 megabits/second
and up.
<P>
ATM is a technology that is maturing slowly, and still has a lot
of interoperability problems, but promises to provide very fast
bandwidth.  ATM is starting to appear at the NAP level, and as
interconnections between NAPs.  It is an expensive option, but
something to consider when T3 is not enough.
<P>
Downstream connections and dedicated circuits to business users
should be provided by the same kind of bandwidth as just discussed.
 Frame relay makes a lot of sense, with private leased lines where
required.
<P>
An ISP needs to consider the expected growth of their dial in
customer base when choosing a business site.  A discussion with
the local telephone company will determine what is available,
what can be made available.  Cost and timeframes are also important.
 With the deregulation of the telecommunication industry, it is
possible for an ISP to make bandwidth business deals with a local
cable TV or electrical power company.  It's also possible that
the cable TV or electrical company will decide to be an ISP. 
As the laws and regulations change, it's important to understand
the emerging options.  
<H1>Hardware</H1>

<P>
While data circuits as the supply and distribution medium, it
is the hardware and software that adds value to the passing packets
of information.  This next section discusses the various pieces
of hardware that are used in an ISP business.
<H2>Modems</H2>

<P>
Dialin customers will be using an analog modem or an ISDN interface
to connect into the ISP.  The ISP needs to determine how many
lines will be supported, and what type of modems will be used.
 The number of lines depends on the type of customers and their
habits.  Modem selection needs to take into account that there
are a lot of different modem vendors, and a long history of modem
standards.  
<P>
The ISP must be concerned about the quality of the modems.  Some
vendor's modems are more reliable than others in providing a quality
call than others.  The ISP's community favorite modem vendor tends
to change as new models come out, and it is a hot topic of debate.
 
<P>
A major issue that may determine the type of modem is the level
of integration the modems have with the other equipment.  An ISP
may have banks of standalone modems cabled to the network access
equipment, or the modems may be integrated into the same chassis
by the network access vendors.  A system that integrates the CSU/DSU,
modems, network access device, and uplink routers on a backplane
will reduce wiring clutter, and improve reliability and performance.
 Integrated systems also tend to have integrated management systems
linked in.   Management systems that link to a SNMP manager help
integrate the entire management picture.  However, integrated
solutions are more expensive.
<P>
For analog voice lines, it's best to use 28.8 Kbs or higher modems.
 There are some 33.6 Kbs modems now on the market but reliability
has not yet been determined.  Customers rate an ISP on the ability
to connect at full bandwidth with what ever modem they have. 
Lower speed modems should be linked to a less expensive service,
and tied to a separate phone number.
<P>
Modem problems are annoying for both the ISP and the customer.
 The typical problems seen are unanswered calls, not working with
a broad set of client modems, downgrading to a low speed, disconnecting
in the middle of a call, and not resetting after a call is over.
 As the number of modems grows, it is important to make sure they
are all working.  The best approach is to maintain duty cycle
statistics, and test the ones that fall outside the normal usage.
<P>
An ISP needs to support ISDN lines where that service is available
and there is a demand for it.  It's possible to bring in only
ISDN PRI circuits, then split up the circuits into analog voice
and ISDN channels.
<H2>Network Access Servers:</H2>

<P>
Once a dial up customer has come in through a telephone line and
a modem, the network access server (NAS) is the next component
in the Internet connection.  These devices are also called terminal
servers because historically their role was to connect character
cell terminals to interactive hosts.  Today's access devices still
retain some of the character cell characteristics in their autobaud
detection, and often support ASCII based user login.  
<P>
The network access devices first role is to capture the authentication
information from the client and then get approval for linkage
from an authentication server.  Once the authorization is approved,
the protocol switches to PPP (Point to Point protocol). The NAS
then issues the client an IP address.  The address is assigned
based on username, the port that the call came in on or a pool
of addresses.  Finally, the NAS acts as a router to forward IP
packets from the client onto the Internet.
<P>
There are a number of features to look for in a NAS.  The port
density and cost per port should match the ISP requirements. 
Some NAS products are more integrated than others.  The most integrated
contain modem cards and a T1/E1 interface, allowing a channelized
T1/E1 to be connected directly to the NAS, with a LAN connection
coming out the other side.  Channelized T1/E1 is a data circuit
running at 1.544 or 2.0 megabits/second that is split into separate
voice channels.  One circuit from a telecommunication company
replaces a fifty pair cable.  The channels are electronically
separated, and directed to modems via a backplane.  
<P>
There are three primary choices in network access servers.  The
most popular is the dedicated server.  UNIX servers can also act
as network access servers, by supporting the PPP protocol on serial
lines.  The Windows NT server operating system supports dial up
users with a protocol called &quot;remote access services&quot;
or RAS.   The number of ports can be increased by plugging in
multport access boards such as those from Digiboard.

<H2>Routers:</H2>

<P>
Routers are traffic pumps to an ISP.  They tie together data circuits
from downstream businesses and institution customers, from network
access servers, and from locally generated traffic, and pump the
traffic upstream towards the routing core of the Internet.  In
return, they receive the traffic from the Internet and forward
it on it's way to the downstream recipient.  
<P>
Depending on the type of bandwidth coming into the ISP, the router
may support many individual dedicated data circuits.  Each circuit
requires an interface card.  In this environment, the port density
and cost per port are important.  
<P>
Just as channelized T1/E1 circuits can multiplex dial-in calls,
frame relay or ATM are used to multiplex upstream and downsteam
data circuits.  An ISP can put a single data circuit into a frame
relay cloud, and connect to many customers who also have a single
circuit into the frame relay cloud.  To the router, the single
physical circuit appears as many virtual circuits.  
<P>
Routers have performance characteristics measured in packets per
second.  Higher PPS numbers are needed as the number of connections
and the aggregate bandwidth goes up.  Ongoing management of a
router will indicate if packets are being dropped because the
router cannot go fast enough.  
<P>
There are characteristics to look for in a router other than packets
per second.  Management is a big issue.  The tools to manage the
router should give a good indication what is going on inside,
and allow easy adjustment and restoration of the parameters. 
Dual power supplies is a popular option.  Compatibility with the
other end of the data circuits is an important factor.  There
are several routing protocols common on the Internet.  RIP and
OSPF are common among smaller networks, and BGP-4 is required
to connect to large Internet providers.  
<P>
If an ISP has customers with dedicated access circuits, the ISP
must determine what routers will be supported at the customer
end.  The customer may wish to provide their own routers, or may
ask the ISP to supply one.  The ISP may wish to become a distributor
of a particular brand of router.  It adds profit to the business,
and makes support easier.  
<P>
The higher upstream an ISP goes into the Internet infrastructure,
the more likely Cisco routers will be required.  However, much
lower cost solutions exist for downstream and customer premises
routers.
<P>
The Internet today is challenging routing technology.  The scattering
of addresses has created the need for very large routing tables.
 The implementation of the CIDR blocks of addresses is designed
to reduce the table size.  Large blocks of class C networks are
grouped into one CIDR block, and given to large ISPs.  As the
addresses are passed out to downstream ISPs, the CIDR block is
broken up into smaller chunks.  However, each router below the
Internet backbone only needs to keep tables for the networks below
it.  
<H2>Switched High Speed LAN</H2>

<P>
Within an ISP's central office or at a POP, switched Ethernet
or FDDI if often used.  A switched LAN provides each LAN connection
the full bandwidth, and privacy.  The switch itself switches traffic
from one LAN segment to another where required.  The upstream
and down stream routers, as well as the ISP servers are put into
the switch.  When using switches with packet filtering features,
some degree of firewall style security can be implemented.  
<P>
Switched LANs are an ideal way to connect a shopping mall or an
multiple tenant office building to the Internet.  The ISP puts
in a remote POP environment, with a high speed data circuit and
a router.  The switch then provides each client with a LAN speed
connection to the POP.  The switch isolates each LAN from the
other, so customers cannot packet sniff each others data.  
<H2>Servers:</H2>

<P>
An ISP will have computer servers at their business site, to support
a variety of functions.  They will run the operation of the business,
including authorization, billing, technical and customer support.
 Depending on the type of business the ISP is running, small to
very large servers may be required to provide services to customers.
<P>
Web hosting, email, and news are the most common services.  Each
service requires compute cycles and disk space.  The number of
customers supported, the usage, and the volume of data goes into
determining the size of systems.
<P>
Performance of the systems is important, because in web hosting,
the customer's image is at stake.  With email and news, slow performance
makes it hard to attract new customers.  Reliability is another
big issue.  A company's web service or email should never be off
line.  Yet, systems need to be taken down for various reasons.

<P>
There are several solutions to the problem.  All involve a secondary
server.  The two servers can be linked to a common set of disks
to provide the most automatic fail over.  Other methods of fail
over involve disk shadowing.  The use of a multiple servers also
allows load balancing. 
<P>
The most popular operating system for providing ISP services is
UNIX.  The UNIX might be running on RISC machines, provided by
one of the major hardware vendors, or might be one of the PC based
UNIXs like LINUX or BSD.  There is a growing interest among ISPs
to use the Windows NT operating system.  This market is expected
to grow as Version 4 is rolled out.  A growing number of billing,
network management, and trouble tracking software available on
Windows NT makes it attractive today for many of the operational
tasks of an ISP.  
<P>
Digital's product line of Alpha and Intel hardware, along with
Digital UNIX and Windows NT make ideal servers for an ISP.  The
systems have leading price performance, meaning that fewer computers
are required for large customer bases.  The systems also have
high availability features that provide the up time an ISP requires.
 Finally, Digital's world wide service organizations are skilled
in ISP network design, installation, customization, maintenance
and operations.  An ISP starting out may not need the power that
an Alpha solution requires, but the headroom that allows for rapid
growth without migration makes a lot of business sense for the
ISP that has big plans or is designing for uncertain, but obvious
growth.  
<P>
Digital UNIX version 4.0 fits well into an ISP environment.  It
supports both BSD and System V programming interfaces, meaning
that most applications can be ported with little trouble.  Digital
UNIX also supports multihoming.  This feature lets the server
identify itself with many unique IP addresses.  While some WEB
servers, such as Netscape, can support multiple domain names on
a single address, many other applications cannot.  When each customer
wants it to appear that there is a single computer sitting behind
their corporate Internet name, i.e. COMPANY.COM, the ISP needs
to use multihoming.  Digital UNIX supports well over 1000 unique
IP addresses.  Other UNIX operating systems are limited to 64
or 128 addresses.  The ISP needing multihoming needs fewer servers
to serve a large customer base by using Digital UNIX.
<H1>Customer Internet Application Services:</H1>

<P>
There are many Internet related applications.  Some are peer to
peer, and do not require a server, while others require a server.
 In addition, most of the popular Internet applications have public
domain versions available and news group support.  Some ISPs prefer
using public domain applications, because they have a wide choice
of sources and support.  There is a growing market for vendor
supported applications for the ISPs that need to focus more on
their business and where the cost of applications is offset by
the reduced support efforts.
<P>
The following list discusses some of the more popular Internet
applications that an ISP may want to run on their network, or
be asked to supply their customers.
<H2>WWW</H2>

<P>
World Wide Web is a major application of the Internet, and a major
service opportunity for Internet service providers.  First, most
ISPs will want a web server to sell and service their wares. 
The big business comes from &quot;web hosting&quot;, or running
a web server for businesses and individuals.  The size and type
of server will depend on the nature of the business the ISP is
getting into.   Performance and system up time are important for
web hosting services.  Companies will often have bursts of traffic
during product announcements or other news making events.  The
corporate image is to some degree riding on the performance and
availability of the web pages, hosted by the ISP.  Backup systems,
hot swappable components, expandable storage, and fast networking
are important characteristics.  
<P>
Some ISP's make a business out of designing and programming of
web pages.  This can bring in a good revenue stream depending
on the value added.  Artistic design, page sequence and layout,
forms, credit card verification, and other services can be part
of this service.  Many businesses use web hosting services as
a way to get on the web quickly.
<P>
Issues like allowing the customer to update pages, or establish
links to private databases must be addressed by the ISP.  FTP
and SHELL services are one technique, however, some web servers
feature the ability to maintain the web pages directly from a
browser. 
<H2>Mail</H2>

<P>
The EMAIL service of an ISP is usually in high demand among dial-up
customers.  It can generate revenue based on disk storage and
number of messages sent.  Customers who use the ISP domain name
for their EMAIL address tend to stay loyal since changing one's
EMAIL address is harder than changing home addresses.  
<P>
The most common EMAIL service to provide is POP3 although this
is quickly being replaced with IMAP4.  These are server based
mail systems running at the ISP's facility, allowing EMAIL to
be received and stored until the customer wants to read it.. 
With POP3, the mail is not marked read and filed on the server
after it's downline loaded to a client.  This is a problem for
people who use several computers to access their mail.  Read messages
tend to become scattered across different computers, and are hard
to find at a later date.  With IMAP, the server can store the
mail and file it in folders even after the client has retrieved
it.   The client only picks up the mail that is of interest, and
periodically synchronizes read and stored mail with the server.
<P>
A &quot;simple mail transport protocol&quot; SMTP forwarder is
also required by an ISP.  This service talks directly with SMTP
clients in classic store and forward fashion, without the login
phase that POP3/IMAP4 has.  
<P>
An ISP may also find a market to support EMAIL gateways to proprietary
systems like Microsoft Exchange or Lotus ccMail, or the ISO international
standard X.400 mail system.
<P>
An EMAIL service similar to news is mail lists.  A user interested
in joining others in discussing a topic,  subscribes or unsubscribes
to the mailing list by sending an email message to the list server
automatic subscription service.  Any message sent to the list
is then forward to everyone on the list.  Features like responding
with canned messages based on keywords in sent mail and archiving
of previous messages exist.  There are several products that support
this.  Majordomo and Listproc are popular public domain products.
 An ISP can provide a list server for it's customers, and offer
support for list maintenance.

<H2>Chat</H2>

<P>
Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is an application that lets people communicate
with each other in real time, while all connected to a common
server.  An IRC server has channels that clients can tune into.
 Once on a channel, anyone typing a message can be seen by the
others tuned into the channel.  Private conversations are also
possible.  Features are appearing in IRC clients to allow the
exchange of web pages so participants can view a common page while
chatting.  Integration with file transfer protocols, voice protocols
like RealAudio, and even video protocols like CUSEEME are appearing
in clients.  There are networks of IRC servers that link together
to let world wide groups of users connect to a local server yet
chat with the world.  However, IRC servers can be also run locally.
 An ISP may wish to put up a server for it's customers to use,
and provide resources for groups that want to establish a separate
chat room.  Active IRC servers are a good way to keep customers
on the line when fees are based on usage.  
<H2>Internet News</H2>

<P>
Internet Network News (INN)  has updated the 15 year old USENET
news application that ran over dial-up lines by using the Internet
for exchange.   There are thousand of world wide news groups,
and each network can have local news groups.  A full news feed,
which would include all the newsgroups and all new postings to
those groups, delivers about 1.2 gigabytes a day.  The typical
approach to news from an ISP point of view is to subscribe to
the news groups that it's customers have subscribed to, and store
several days worth of news for the customer base.  Individual
dial in customers will read the news directly, and corporate users
will downline load the news groups that are subscribed to by the
private network users.  There are several news readers available,
including ones built into web browsers.  
<P>
News is a heavy load on an ISP's network and server.  Bandwidth
is taken up bringing in the news, CPU cycles are taken up sorting
it, and a lot of disk space is taken up storing it.  The sad reality
is that only about 2-3% of the daily news is read by a customer
base.  A recommended approach to news is to maintain about 6 gigabytes
for news, allow it to expire in a week, and process it on systems
that are reserved for backup or operations.  From a bandwidth
point of view, it makes a lot of sense to subscribe to a satellite
service to receive the news.  This will cost about $1000 per year,
but will offload 1.2 gigabytes of data per day off of the upstream
data circuits.
<P>

<H2>Search Engines</H2>

<P>
Search engines may or may not be appropriate for the ISP to support.
 There are a lot of search engines on the network today.  However,
when an ISP is supporting a specific group of customers, such
as doctors, or lawyers, search engines tuned to the customer base
can be a service that adds value.  There are several search engines
for sale on the market, including the ones from AltaVista, WAIS,
Yahoo, and Excite.  
<P>
When an ISP provides dial-up customers with web space, a search
engine that only searches the local servers provides a nice service
to the customer base.  
<H2>Access Software</H2>

<P>
To make the connection, a customer needs some sort of networking
software to hook up with.  Since there is a lot of different types
of networking software available, many ISPs choose to provide
the new client with networking software that the ISP is comfortable
supporting.  This is normally given as part of the service, but
there may be a charge for it.  The networking software includes
a TCP/IP stack, a telephone dialer, optionally a script utility
for automatic login, and a set of Internet related utilities.
 These utilities include a web browser, file transfer utility,
terminal emulation software, chat, and others.  Windows 95 users
often do not require special software from an ISP because most
of the required software comes with the operating system. 
<P>
A broad base of clients need to be supported.  UNIX and Windows
NT/95 are pretty self sufficient, but previous versions of Microsoft
Windows, Apple and Novell usually require some sort of add on
software.
<P>
There is a lot of software that can be shipped to customers for
little or no charge.  Many times it requires an agreement with
the vendor.  An ISP should provide a list of sites that provide
downline loadable software.  
<P>
Vendors that provide access software are: Microsoft, Netscape,
NetManage, and FTP Software.  
<H1>Performance:</H1>

<P>
In a sense, there is never enough performance.  An ISP represents
the Internet to the customer, and so will be called upon to explain
performance issues and recommend ways to improve it.
<P>
In general, a dial in customer will be happy if they are getting
close to full bandwidth out of their connection.  Most links are
at least 14.4 Kbs, and 28.8 is becoming more popular.  There is
also a growth of ISDN service in some parts of the world, providing
64 or 128kbs of service.   Within the next few years, the industry
will see the growth of cable TV and electrical power companies
coming on line with higher bandwidth options. 
<P>
If all the information to all the customers is coming from systems
local to the ISP, then performance issues are usually tied to
the server performance and the network access device.  However,
a lot of traffic is going to come from the far reaches of the
Internet.  The variables are the ISP's access speed to the next
Internet tier, the number of hops and throughput to the ISP of
the remote server, packet loss due to congestion, the speed of
the last links to the server, the remote server load, and the
complexity of the remote application.  
<P>
The ISP can maximize it's customers perceived performance in several
ways.  Provide enough bandwidth upstream to the Internet.  It's
quite common to lease more than one data circuit, and to connect
each one to a different carrier.  This provides a backup link
in case one goes down, and gives a routing choice to packets headed
for remote Internet servers.  ISPs should monitor the bandwidth
usage of outgoing links to establish patterns and trends.  
<P>
The use of a web cache proxy can make the Internet appear faster
than it really is, especially for popular web sites with fairly
static information. If the ISP puts up a web cache proxy, and
educates users how to set up their browsers to use it, all pages
pulled off the web will be cached on the ISP's local network.
 Depending on the valid life time of the page, all but the first
requester of popular web pages will see fast performance.  
<P>
If  an ISP has customers that communicate with each other, then
building a fast internal network, inside the ISP is important.
 Integrated routers, switched Ethernet or FDDI technology should
be used to connect ISP resources and links to dial up and dedicated
line customers.  
<P>
It's hard to estimate exactly what an ISP's customers will use
for bandwidth.  One informal study by Alex Rubenstein at alex@nac.net
showed that 28.8 dial in users average 30 minutes of on line time,
and during that time average 6 kb/s of throughput.
<P>
An ISP must not forget the business users though.  While dial
in customers tend to have little data going out and a lot of data
coming in, popular business customers can create a heavy pull
of data outbound.  In addition, corporate network customers can
clog the inbound lines during business hours, because a lot of
users are aggregated behind a single leased line.  
<P>
Other considerations are peak usage times.  If a remote web site
or a business customer makes the evening news, or if a corporate
customer releases a new product, there is bound to be a flurry
of activity that is above normal.  There are bandwidth options
like fractional T1/E1 that can handle this, and they should be
considered as the ISP business grows.  
<P>
Performance does matter.  The size of the pipes, the speed of
the routers, the number and speed of the hops to the nearest network
access point (NAP) all help define the quality of an ISP to it's
customers. 
<P>
A &quot;network access point&quot; (NAP) or &quot;metropoleon
area ethernet&quot; (MAE) is a place where many ISP circuits meet
to exchange packets flowing from one ISP network to another. 
The reality of the Internet is that small ISPs connect to larger
ISPs, which connect to national or international ISPs.  The real
test of the potential quality of an ISP is a mapping of the linkages,
speed, utilization, and average throughput to the high speed routing
core of the Intenret.
<H1>Security:</H1>

<P>
The number one security issue that an ISP has is the protection
of their operations systems.  The billing and authentication systems
are targets for attacks.  If an ISP is hosting web pages for a
customer, the security of the content is important. Packet filtering,
firewalls, sneakernet (disconnected systems using floppy/tapes
for file transfer) and system security techniques should be used.
 
<P>
Business and corporate customers who have a full time connection
to the Internet through the ISP may require security consulting
from the ISP.  Security concerns is a large inhibitor to businesses
getting onto the Internet, so an ISP can increase business by
addressing the problem.  ISP's often sell and install firewalls
for their customers.  Customers doing commerce transactions often
need additional security advice.  An ISP may choose to become
an expert, and make it part of their service offerings, or recommend
a security consultant to the customer.  
<P>
ISPs that are community based may see some demand to restrict
the access to some news groups and web pages.  There are filtering
tools available, but it is very hard to keep young innovative
minds from discovering alternative locations of forbidden information.
 These tools will most likely become most sophisticated as the
Internet matures, and as freedom of speech issues are argued in
the court systems.  
<P>
As it stands today, it's unclear what responsibility an ISP has
in monitoring content stored on it's servers.  Where customers
have editing rights to news groups and web page content, it's
hard to restrict anything but that which is clearly illegal. 
However, if an ISP stores externally generated content from a
news group, and is charging for the news service, there is some
concern that there is some liability for the content.  
<P>
The ISP's customer account information and billing records are
prime targets for attack.  Some will choose to keep the information
off line, and use tape or floppy to transfer information from
the accounting records to the billing systems.  Others will use
firewall or packet filtering techniques.  
<H1>Miscellaneous:</H1>

<H2>Addressing and Naming Issues</H2>

<H3>Introduction:</H3>

<P>
Finding resources on the Internet often depends on the host name
associated with the resource.  Most business customers want a
name that represents their business.  For the names ending in
.COM, the InterNIC is a organization that assigns domain names
to those requesting one.  While it used to be free, the massive
increase in demand has required a change in policy.  There is
an application process to get a name, and there is both an initial
charge, and an ongoing yearly fee to maintain the name.  It is
still fairly inexpensive.  Many ISPs offer a name application
service to their customers, however it is not a hard process for
business to do themselves.
<P>
The domain name is mulitpart name, with the parts separated by
a period.  The significance of the name is read from right to
left, making the last part the most significant.  The last part
will fall into a domain based on geography or organization type.
 Geography names will end with the country code, such as .US or
.UK, or .FR.  Organization types will end with .COM or .EDU, or
.MIL, or .NET or .ORG.  Most ISP's will register in the .NET type,
and most businesses register with the .COM type.  
<P>
When an organization registers a domain, they then own the responsibility
to register sub domains under the primary domain.  In the geography
case, a country will assign subdomains to regions or states. 
For example, in the United States, there is a subdomain for all
50 states, e.g. NH.US and CA.US.  From there, each state can issue
a subdomain to it's towns, so there can be an AMHERST.NH.US and
a FRESNO.CA.US.  
<P>
In the same way, a business can create subdomains in any way they
choose.  A BUSINESS.COM can have a MARKETING.BUSINESS.COM or a
FRANCE.BUSINESS.COM. 
<P>
An ISP usually registers their own business name in the .NET domain
as well as the .COM domain.  For business customers who don't
need a unique name, or to identify the dial in customers, the
ISP uses subdomains in their own domain.  For example, an ISP
with the domain GOODNET.NET will also register GOODNET.COM.  A
business customer may be use the name BUSINESS.GOODNET.COM, subnet
itself into MARKETING.BUSINESS.GOODNET.COM, and refer to it's
web page as WWW.BUSINESS.GOODNET.COM.   <BR>

<P>
The first part of a name, on the left side, is the host name or
the service name.  Examples of this are MYHOST.AMHERST.NH.US or
UNIX1.MARKETING.BUSINESS.COM.
<P>
Every computer on the network has a name, but many have more than
one.  Services, which are tied to one or more computers can also
have names.  The most service name is WWW, such as WWW.BUSINESS.COM.
 Usually the system that provides the web service does not have
WWW as it's primary host name, but the naming service is set up
to point requests to WWW to the host that is servicing it at that
time.
<P>
There are naming issues that effect an ISP.  They need to be approached
with a vision towards the future.  If an ISP provides web hosting
services for a set of businesses, each business is going to want
a unique home page for their customers.  They are also going to
want unique names.  The ISP does not normally dedicate a unique
computer for each business, but sets up a large server to serve
multiple businesses.  This means that the ISP server has many
names, and responds to many addresses.  In reality, the server
has a primary host name and address, and refers to the alternate
addresses and names as aliases.  The number of aliases a vendor's
operating system supports determines how many businesses can be
supported on a single server.
<H3>DOMAIN NETWORK SERVICE</H3>

<P>
While each computer on the Internet has an address, most are referred
to by their host name.  The host name is the name of a computer
or service, followed by the complete domain name.  
<P>
When an application such as a web browser wants to connect to
a remote service, the first step in the connection is to resolve
the name into an address.  This is done with a request packet
put out onto the network addressed to the local name server.
<P>
The network service that keeps track of the host name to address
translation is called DNS (Domain Name Service).  It is often
called by a former name BIND (Berkeley IP Name Daemon).  
<P>
The Internet has millions of names, and it is impossible to keep
one database of all the names.  The problem is solved by using
the domain naming scheme to distribute the naming responsibility.
 There are primary and secondary name servers for each domain,
and each upstream domain forwards name resolution requests down
to it's subdomain name servers.
<P>
When a name resolution request is forwarded from an application
to it's local name server, the local name server looks in it's
local database.  If the name is not there, the request is forwarded
to an upstream name server.  Each upstream name server has a broader
view of host domains.  The primary name server for the .COM domain
will forward requests for WWW.BUSINESS.COM to the primary name
server for BUSINESS.COM.  This might be at the ISP that has BUSINESS.COM
as a customer, or may be a system managed directly by BUSINESS.COM.
<P>
A primary name server is where new systems are added or deleted.
 A secondary name server updates it's database from the primary,
and will answer requests if the primary nameserver is not available.
 
<P>
An ISP needs to understand it's customer's needs for name service.
 It is not easy to keep a name server up to date, if a network
is changing a lot.  A business that adds and removes computers
frequently, will probably want to manage their own primary name
server.  The rules of the Internet dictate that each domain must
have a primary and secondary name server.  The ISP can act as
a secondary name server for the business. This service is valuable,
because if a business is off the network, customers will at least
get an error message saying the host is unreachable, instead of
getting an error message saying the host is unknown.  
<P>
Some businesses will request the ISP to act as the primary name
server.  The advantage to this is that the dedicated bandwidth
from the ISP to the business does not need to carry name resolution
requests, and the business does not need to be on the network
all the time.  This is useful especially when an ISP is providing
a web hosting service for the business. 
<P>
For Internet services that are very busy, there is a trick that
can be played using DNS called &quot;round robin DNS&quot;.  With
round robin DNS, the name server gives different IP addresses
each time a service is asked for.  For example, if WWW.BUSINESS.COM
is asked for, the first request might be answered with 192.168.10.15,
and the next request will be answered with 192.168.10.16.  This
has the effect of load balancing requests across multiple systems.
 If this technique is used, there is one problem that an ISP needs
to be aware of.  If a system listed in the round robin table becomes
unavailable, a certain number of clients will be sent to an unavailable
host and will not connect to a service that is reachable to others.
 The solution is to remove the unavailable hosts from the round
robin table until the system is back on line.   Server clustering
can offer a better solution than round robin DNS, but not all
operating systems support that. 
<H2>Addressing</H2>

<P>
Each computer needs to have an address.  While names are a nice
way to refer to a system or service, the routing decisions made
by the routers on the Internet rely on addressing alone.  
<P>
An ISP is allocated a set of addresses, and must assign them wisely
across it's dedicated business customers, dial in users, remote
POPs, ISP related servers, and networking equipment.  
<P>
The technique used to allocate addresses is called subnetting.
 Each business is allocated a range of addresses within the ISP's
allocation.  
<P>
An IP address is a 32 bit number made up of two parts.  The first
part is the subnetwork address.  The second part identifies the
actual computer within the subnetwork.  Routers on the Internet
deal with the subnetwork part of the addresses.  Tables are updated
in the routers to determine which data circuit to forward a packet
to.  The challenge to the Internet is to keep the routing tables
as small as possible on the very high speed backbones and NAPs,
and allow the routers in the ISPs to handle the routing to individual
business and dial in users.
<P>
Each IP address comes with a network mask.  The network mask determines
how many of the 32 bits refer to the network address.  A network
address works like a postal code (ZIP code in the US).  All addresses
within a network address are routed in the same direction.  Networks
are broken up into classes, depending on the number of bits in
the IP address that represent the network subnet.  Classes A,
B, and C are sizes that be assigned to an ISP.  There are no Class
A addresses available anymore, few Class B, so most networks are
assigned multiple Class C address blocks.  
<P>
A Class C network block uses the network mask of 255.255.255.0,
meaning that there are 255 addresses per Class C.  An ISP may
assign an entire Class C block of address to a business, or may
further subnet the block of addresses to service multiple businesses.
 For example, if the network mask is changed to 255.255.255.248,
then 8 addresses are available to that particular customer.  
<P>
From the Internet's point of view, any Class C address that is
within the ISP's range gets routed to the ISP.  The ISP's routers
must then understand the deeper subnetting assigned, and route
the packets appropriately.  
<P>
Address allocation is important for an ISP, and keeping track
of what is used, and what is available is important.  Changing
addressing schemes is very disruptive to businesses, so the ISP
should carefully map out the addressing strategy early in the
game. 
<P>

In many ways, you are the bridge between your customers and the Internet and, as part of that relationship,you have a responsibility to ensure a secure environment for your customers. <p>As an ISP, you probably offer one or more of the following services:<p><ul><li>Dial-up service, which allows paying customers to connect their systems to the Internet by means of your access server(s).<li>Dedicated-line service, which allows business customers to connecta Local Area Net (LAN) to the Internet or to connect a corporate Wide Area Net (WAN) to the Internet. <li>ISP-operated application servers such as e-mail, web hosting, and news.</ul><br>In addition to customer services, your Internet System Provider business has systems,applications, and data that you use in day-to-day operations. These operations typically involve customer account and billing information, trouble ticket systems, access logs and other private information. <p>Each customer and operational service on the Internet has a different security need. This application note discusses those services in terms of security and offers information on ways to secure your environment. </p>The interactions among components of an Internet Service Provider system can become complex, depending on the level of service, number and variety of customers, andthe hardware and software configurations of the system. This application note discusses many of these interactions from the perspective of protectingthe security of the system. Consider the following graphic of a complexISP environment:<p><img src="topo.gif"></dd></dl><hr><h3><a name="A2"> Security Architecture</a></h3><a href=#A1><img src="nav01lt.gif"></a><a href=#A0><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><a href=#A3><img src="nav01rt.gif"></a><dl><dd><p>There are many approaches you can take to ensure the security of your ISP environment. The technology and proceduresyou use will depend on the needs and expectations of your customers, the technical skill of your staff, the levelof risk you wish to avoid, and the budget you have for implementing security. <p>No matter what technology and procedures you apply, you should approachsecurity as an architectural exercise. That is, you should break down eachpiece of your system into contained elements and provide a level ofprotection for each element. You then connect the pieces into a systemin a way that minimizes risks to security. However, it is not easy to build a bullet-proofsystem and you often must make tradeoffs between holes in security and the system's ease of use. Your goal should be tounderstand the risk and be able to monitor and diagnose security problems as they occur. <p>After you map out your approach to security, subject the architectureto failure analysis to see what can go wrong. Failure analysis can highlight which pieces are more important than others, show areas that require a security focus, and may suggest changes to the approach. See the section on <a href="#A4">Security Auditing</a>.</p> </dd></dl><hr><h3><a name="A2.1">Security Threats</a></h3><a href=#A2><img src="nav01lt.gif"></a><a href=#A0><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><a href=#A3><img src="nav01rt.gif"></a><dl><dd><p>When you apply security measures to your ISP system, it is a somewhat like buying insurance. You wish it was not needed, youwant to purchase only as much as required, and you hope it works when it is tested. The openness of today's worldwide Internet isbased on a foundation of trust. However, it is prone to some of the following security threats:<p><ul><li>Most of the protocol specifications and equipment manuals for components of the Internet are, themselves, publicly available on the Internet. Armed with this information, people will attemptunauthorized access and abuse unprotected equipment. <li>There are people who enjoybreaking into networks as a hobby. Unfortunately, there are professionals who break into networks as a business. There are even robots thatbreak into networks under program control. <li>Security problems can arise from current or former ISP employees,your ISP customer base, visitors to your customer's pages, and others who stumble across the ISP network. </ul><br>The tasks of understanding security threats, knowing how to protect against the threats, and keeping currentcan be overwhelming. In the cash-flow intensive operation of an ISP business, you can not do everything. However, damage from a security breach in vital operational areas can put an ISP out of business. You must treat security seriously, but you must also balance the costs and benefits ofincreased security against the theoretical risks and the security threatsyour experience tells you are most likely.</p></dd></dl><hr><h3><a name="A3">We Have Met the Enemy and He is Us</a></h3><a href=#A2><img src="nav01lt.gif"></a><a href=#A0><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><a href=#A4><img src="nav01rt.gif"></a><dl><dd><p>The most common method to break into a system is to simply ask for information from those chartered with protecting the system.That is, most systems use an account and password combination as the primary security measure. Also, systems often have obscureholes in security that are only known to the people working withthat system. A person seeking to break into your system is very interested in those account and password combinations and in the details of those security holes. <p>Unfortunately, a person can obtain information on your system's security by watching a technician on a trouble call. An employee, who has not beentrained to use caution, can divulge information over the telephone. In small ISP shops where everyone is known, this may not be a problem.However, in large environments, a helpful, but untrained, employeeresponding to a desperate call for access on a Sunday night may actually be assisting an unauthorized user masquerading as an employee.<p>You should also be concerned with previous employees, especially those who leave without good standing, who feel the urge to play pranks, or who are loose with confidential information. <p>To protect the security of your ISP system and the integrity of yourcustomers' data:<p><ul><li>Train your employees in security procedures and in the techniques used to obtain security information.<li>Increase the awareness of your employees to security threats.<li>Change internal passwords and processes on a regular basisand purge old accounts.</ul> </p></dd></dl><hr><h3><a name="A4"> Security Auditing</a></h3><a href=#A3><img src="nav01lt.gif"></a><a href=#A0><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><a href=#A5><img src="nav01rt.gif"></a><dl><dd><p>In order to have confidence in your security system, you must test it.It is probably not a good idea to challenge theInternet community to break into your network, but you should have yoursystem tested by the ISP staff as well as a neutral security consultantwho knows the tricks of the break-in trade. In addition to boosting yourcustomer's confidence in your system, security checking can be a valuable service to that customer. <p>There are many ways to break into a system and you can not know or testfor them all. However, there are several softwareroutines you can run that attempt to break into a system and report on the results. SATAN andCRACK are two highly-regarded routines. These routines are also thetools commonly used by those who break into systems. In the hands ofa competent administrator, SATAN can be a valuable tool for identifyingpotential security holes. However, in the hands of an incompetent or malicious person, SATAN can be used to compromise system securityor, because SATAN is reminiscent of the Morris Worm, generate unacceptable traffic loads.<p>To obtain a copyof CRACK, contact the Brookhaven National Laboratory, operated by Associated Universities, Inc.

Access server systems are typically connected directly to the Internet without firewalls. Firewalls,which act as a layer of security between the local Internet system andthe wider Internet, have an impact on performance and often restrictapplication access. This is a tradeoff that dial-up customers usuallydo not want to make.<p>Access servers and dial-up access are a major element of customeravailability and, without this offering, an Internet Service Provider can lose business. To replace the security offered by a firewall,most major suppliers of access servers offer a range ofsecurity mechanisms, including management accounts, SNMP, and accessaccounts and passwords. The following sections describe these mechanisms.You should use them to ensure the security of systems accessed by dial-up customers.  </p></dd></dl><hr><h4><a name="A6"> Management Accounts</a></h4><a href=#A5><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><a href=#A7><img src="nav01rt.gif"></a><dl><dd><p>To maintain security, a system administrator must configure and monitorevery access server. Most access servers use telnet terminal sessionsor a client/server protocol, such as SNMP, to provide system access, which can be through the LAN connection or one of the dial-in ports. <p>Note that clear text passwords are sent over the LAN connection. A security breach of the LAN that occurs between the access server and source of the telnet session could extend to the access servers. To prevent a security breach, the management account shouldbe protected by one of the following:<p><ul><li>Purchase access servers that use a one-time password for management account access. <li>If the access server permits it, use a dial-up port for the managementaccount. Some access servers provide a special auxiliary port that can be used for this. The best approach is to plug a terminal directly into the management port, however, the switched telephone network usually offers adequate security. <li>Use modems that have a separate access passwordbefore connecting to the equipment. <li>If an access server provides system access by means of a client server or telnet over the LAN, pay particular attention to the security of the LAN. <li>Restrict management account access to those systems that will be issuing management commands. </ul></p></dd></dl><hr><h4><a name="A7"> SNMP</a></h3><a href=#A6><img src="nav01lt.gif"></a><a href=#A5><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><a href=#A8><img src="nav01rt.gif"></a><dl><dd><p>Most access servers use the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to provide access to configuration and counter information. SNMP requires two passwords for access. One for <tt>read</tt> commands and one for <tt>set</tt> commands.It is industry custom to use <tt>public</tt> for the <tt>read</tt> password, and to use a private password for <tt>set</tt> commands. <p>It is not a good security practice to use an industry-standard password on your system, especially if you are using SNMP Version 1, whichdoes not encrypt the passwords. For this reason, many network managers do not use SNMP to perform any <tt>set</tt> commands. If the LAN on which the management account traffic occurs is vulnerable to unauthorized access,you should consider not using SNMP to perform <tt>set</tt> commands. Even ifthat is not the case, change the default password for <tt>read</tt>commands from <tt>public</tt> to a less obvious password. These steps will helpprevent potential hackers from gaining any information about the access servers.  </p></dd></dl><hr><h4><a name="A8"> Access Accounts and Passwords</a></h4><a href=#A7><img src="nav01lt.gif"></a><a href=#A5><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><dl><dd><p>Before network packets are received over dial-up access servers,users must identify themselves to the server. Some access servers support two levels of user password checking: one allows access tothe server and the other authenticates the user. There are also twomethods of password verification: one verifies the username andpassword against a table that is internal to the access server and the other verifies the username and password remotely from a separateauthentication server. The separate authentication servers are morepopular with system administrators because many access servers can useone database and because user's records can be tied to other accounts. <p>RADIUS (Remote Application Dial-In User Service), TACACS (Terminal Access Control Access Control System), Kerberos, or some other encryption-based client/serverprotocol is usually used to provide security between the access servers and the authentication server. Information on RADIUS, TACACS, Kerberosand other Internet protocols and topics can be found in the Internic directory and database. This service is maintained by AT&T and Network Solutions in collaboration with the National Science Foundationand can by choosing Directory and Database services at the Internicsite -  <A HREF="http://ds2.internic.net/">http://ds2.internic.net/</A>. For example, a search forRFC1510 and RFC927 from the Internet Documentation (RFCs) page yieldedinformation on Kerberos and TACACS, respectively.<p>However, a security problem can still exist with customers who are careless with their passwords. Also, stolen passwords often translateto unbillable connect hours and additional support costs in resolving the issue. To prevent unauthorized use, an ISP operation must establish a usage policy with its customers and educate them in ways to protect their passwords. For example:<p><ul><li>Customers should be able to change their own password but the change should be based on their knowing the existing one. A call froma customer to change a forgotten password should become the subject ofan ISP-wide policy that balances customer convenience with protectionfrom an unauthorized person attempting to obtain passwords.For example, a policy could be instituted whereby users receive a written authentication password when they get their account. If theyneed to obtain a password over the telephone, they would use theirauthentication password.<li>An ISP should make sure that user accounts are disabled or deleted when a customer drops the service. </ul><p>Authentication servers must have network connectivity to the access servers, which makes them susceptible to unauthorized access.Many ISPs put the authentication server on the same server that provides e-mail and web services to customers. This policy is risky, but it can be done safely by allowing only access servers to use the authentication application. In addition, such a system requires tight control of access to database and management applications. <p>To create a more secure approach to authentication, use a separate system protected by a firewall. Configure the firewall to allow only incomingauthentication traffic from the access servers. With this approach, you can keep usage records and billing information on the samesystem. This method has a higher cost, but it may be worth it tokeep valuable records and billing information separate from customer services. </br></p></dd></dl><hr><h3><a name="A9"> Downstream Routers</a></h3><a href=#A5><img src="nav01lt.gif"></a><a href=#A0><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><a href=#A12><img src="nav01rt.gif"></a><ul><ul><ul><li><a href=#A10>Configuration Management</a><li><a href=#A11>Switched versus Shared LAN</a></ul></ul></ul><dl><dd><p>As an ISP, if you support dedicated access customers, consider using separate routers for upstream traffic (up to the Internet) and downstream traffic (services you provide to the other ISPs, businessesand customers connected to you). Use of separate routers protectsthe "uplink" to the Internet in case there are router or other serviceproblems with the "downlink". This will help to ensure that you maintainaccess to the Internet for your users. <p>Consider the following illustration of upstream and downstream routersas described in the <A HREF=#A1>ISP Environment</A> topology map.<P><IMG SRC="topo1.gif"><P>You should also consider separating the routers based on function, which allows you to reconfigure functions more easily than if multiple functionswere available on a single router.</p></dd></dl><hr><h4><a name="A10"> Configuration Management</a></h4><a href=#A9><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><a href=#A11><img src="nav01rt.gif"></a><dl><dd><p>Just as with <a href=#A5>access servers</a>, routers can be configured and managed by telnet or SNMP. Also like access servers, routers can be on a shared LAN that is prone to sniffing attacks. (A sniffing tool is one whichcan capture data packets and decode them to show the underlying protocols.) <p>To protect from security violations, perform management functions by means of a direct management port or well-protected LAN. Also,select access passwords that are not obvious and change the SNMPdefaults. <p>An ISP commonly provides and supports the routing equipment on a customer's premises. In addition, the customer often shares the equipment access password with the ISP. Take care that knowledge ofa local router password does not allow one customer to gain access to another customer's equipment or to the ISP equipment. </br></p></dd></dl><hr><h4><a name="A11"> Switched versus Shared LAN</a></h4><a href=#A10><img src="nav01lt.gif"></a><a href=#A9><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><dl><dd><p>An ISP can enhance the security level by use of a switched LAN instead of a shared one. Use of a switched LAN is also valuable when putting in a high speed Internet drop to a location that will support multiple customers. A switched LAN provides dedicated segments and provides a bridge function between LAN segments. Traffic on one LAN segment is never seen on the other segments unless the traffic is destined for systems on that segment. If you put access servers, downstream servers,upstream servers, customer servers, and management servers on different segments, a successful sniffing attack is contained to the LAN segment whose security was breached. Switched LANs also offer performance and reliability benefits. <p>A switched LAN is also useful in situations where several differentbusinesses are connecting (for instance, when hooking up a mall or shared office building). A switched LAN offers protection againstpacket sniffing by one company against another. That is, each customer is given their own switched LAN circuit and the routers are put on a different LAN segment. Traffic between the Internet andeach customer only appears on the router LAN segment and that customer's private LAN segment.  </br></p></dd></dl><hr><h3><a name="A12"> Upstream Routers</a></h3><a href=#A9><img src="nav01lt.gif"></a><a href=#A0><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><a href=#A14><img src="nav01rt.gif"></a><ul><ul><ul><li><a href=#A13>Filtering and Spoofing</a></ul></ul></ul><dl><dd><p>Because upstream routers are an ISP's connection to the Internet, they are a major component of an ISP's business. An attack on an upstream router can cause major disruption in an ISP's customer base and lost business.<p> To ensure availability, most ISPs have backup upstream routers and keep them on warm or hot standby for immediate use in case of a hardware failure. To enhance performance and reliability whenmultiple upstream circuits are used, each circuit can be put into a separate router.<p>The security considerations mentioned for the <a href=#A5>access servers</a>and <a href=#A9>downstream routers</a> also apply to upstream routers. In addition, you should enforce a strict policy to log changes. <p>If possible, you should implement authentication between a routerand its upstream connection. If dial-up backup bandwidth is used, all security features provided should be used. <p><a href=#A36>Physical security</a> should be strictly enforced for the upstream router and both physical and logical access to routers should be restricted. </br></p></dd></dl><hr><h4><a name="A13"> Filtering and Spoofing </a></h4><a href=#A12><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><dl><dd><p>A unique address for every host is the basis of Internet routing. Unlike telephone numbers, where each user is handed an address (phone number), users can create their own addresses on the Internet. However, users can select addresses that identify them as someonethey are not (a practice called spoofing). This practice can cause a security hole when an access list based on IP addresses is used tocontrol access to routers and servers. <p>To address the problem of spoofing, ISPs use the filtering features in routers to restrict the flow of packets tothose that are authentic. For a specific ISP, this means that outbound packets must have a source address that is within the valid range for the ISP and all downstream customers. Inbound packets must have a source address of anything but the addresses owned by the ISP. This authenticationprocess applies to both the upstream and downstream routers. The process allows vital systems to restrict management access to IP addresses withthe knowledge that those packets are coming from within the management domain. This authentication process also providesthe Internet with some degree of protection in that any misuse can be traced back to the source. <p>An ISP should also include unusual IP addresses in the list of filteredaddresses. For example, 0.0.0.0 is an address that is not commonly assigned,which means that it may be overlooked by the ISP as an address that needsto be filtered, but not overlooked by an unauthorized user.</br></p></dd></dl><hr><h3><a name="A14"> LAN</a></h2><a href=#A12><img src="nav01lt.gif"></a><a href=#A0><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><a href=#A15><img src="nav01rt.gif"></a><dl><dd><p>The LAN (Local Area Network) of an ISP sets the tone for other security needs. If the LAN is secure, then traffic and hosts on that LAN can bemade more secure. Security issues can arise from unauthorized devices put on the LAN to sniff packets and, similarly, compromised systems running undetected packet sniffers. The ability to capture and decode data packetswith a sniffer tool can provide a hacker with username and password information and a view of device configuration. <p>To prevent this type of security breach, separate access servers,routers, application servers, and management systems by means of acombination of LAN switches, bridges, routers, firewalls, and packet filters. Also, perform frequent audits of the LAN to make sure that all physical taps are accounted for and authorized. For example, a managementsystem on UNIX can create a <tt>cron</tt> task that pings all addresses on a LAN segment. On Windows NT, a system agent canbe used to similar effect.With knowledge of which addresses should be live and valid, the management system can direct its attention to any invalid or unexpectedaddress.</p></dd></dl><hr><h3><a name="A14.1">Operating Systems</a></h3><a href=#A14><img src="nav01lt.gif"></a><a href=#A0><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><a href=#A15><img src="nav01rt.gif"></a><ul><ul><ul><li><a href=#A14.11>UNIX</a><li><a href=#A14.12>Windows NT</a></ul></ul></ul><dl><dd><p>Each operating system has unique security features, quirks, and holes.

This application note has discussed the securityissues for the system, but each application also has unique security issues. <p>In terms of implementing security, you should approach the systemas though it were composed of many compartments. A security breach in one compartment should not allow a hacker to access others. This approach is not always possible. For example, shell commandsissued from within an application are the most common security breach on a UNIX system because the shell commands are run in the account used by the application. If this account is <tt>root</tt>, itexposes the system to a security breach.<p> Where possible, run applications in their own account without <tt>root</tt> access. If possible, use a <tt>chroot</tt> environment, which gives access to only the required applications. For example, a web server can be run as user &quot;nobody&quot; rather than <tt>root</tt> to prevent unauthorizedaccess to files.<p>On Windows NT, use the NT File System protection features and start applications in application-specific accounts. <p>As an ISP, you can also require that your customers use a proxy server.A proxy server can improve performance and provide customers with a level of security. And, from the ISP's point of view, it provides adegree of separation between the ISP and the customer.<p>You should also limit access to the server to only the services required. You can use a firewall or packet filter between the server and the Internet to limit access. Unlike routers and access servers, the application server does not need to be directly connected to the Internet.

Some POP3 servers support an option that keeps the mail on the server by keeping it marked"unread". <li>IMAP4 - is a newer protocol than POP3 and its features are a supersetof POP3. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) uses the server to store e-mail even after it has been read. Server storage ispopular with users who access their e-mail from many different computersbecause the e-mail stays in one place rather than be scattered across many systems. <li>SMTP mail - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)is a store and forward e-mail system that can be used to deliver mail to a corporate user or ISP customers who accesses their mail by means of a shell account on the ISP's UNIX system. </ul> </br></p></dd></dl><hr><h5><a name="A17"> Storage of Customer's Mail</a></h5><a href=#A16><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><a href=#A18><img src="nav01rt.gif"></a><dl><dd><p>Customer e-mail can be a thorny privacy issue.

To complicate the matter,there is always the potential that a law enforcement agency may obtain a court order to obtain copies of a customer's mail. <p>The ISP policy regarding e-mail should be a clearly understood partof the agreement between customer and ISP. The agreement should cover the degree of protection provided for e-mail, length of storagefor messages both before and after reading, backup for e-mail and howlong backups are retained, and under what conditions e-mail might beread by others.<p>An ISP should develop a policy for e-mail forwarding that addresses the potential for abuse in forwarding e-mail for people whono longer pay for the ISP's services.

Finally, an ISP may support local news groups, in which case news articles circulate among local users and do not go outside the ISP's network. <p>There are several security considerations in running a news operation. Some newsfeeds coming into the ISP are by subscription only and can only be distributed to authorized clients. There may be news groups that are considered unsuitable for some customers. Also, some news groups provide their own password authentication. Finally, thesame policies regarding mail netiquette violations (such as spamming)also apply to news and newsgroup. <p>Downstream newsfeeds are controlled by a configuration file. Changes tothe configuration file limits client access to newsservers that have only the appropriate news groups available. <p>The legal risk to an ISP censoring newsfeeds is unclear, but technically there are some things that can be done to control access to news groups:<p><ul><li>Filter all connections to news servers outside the ISP by blocking the news port on the upstream router. <li>Assign addresses to customers by their profile and assign each profile group a separate news server. Filtering on the news serversis then used to provide the approved news groups to the correct user groups. </ul><p>The logs of client access to news groups are considered private records and should be protected from disclosure.

Firewalls become particularlyimportant when there are multiple systems of multiple types where itis difficult to maintain security for all of them. Firewallsalso help protect security when there is a tendency within an organization to set a loose security standard for the private network(Intranet) as opposed to the security standards for the publicnetwork. 	<p>Usually a firewall is configured in a system where a Local Area Network (LAN) or series of LANs is connected into a Wide Area Net (WAN) by means of a single connection to the Internet. The firewall resides on the LAN connected directly to the Internet.<P>Consider the following illustration of a firewall that is configuredto control access to billing and customer service systems. This illustration is part of the larger picture of Internet topology shown in the section on <A HREF=#A1>ISP Environment</A>.<P><IMG SRC="topo2.gif"><P>You can find firewalls in several architectures including packet filtering, circuit relay, and application relay. Some firewalls hide the IP addresses of the private network, which meansthat all packets appear to come from a single system. The ISP can be a valuable resource in choosing a firewall and setting it up correctly. Many ISPs require subscribers to use an ISP-provided proxy firewall,and those who do not insist that a customer use a firewall should make clear that, without one, exposure to attack is very high.</P></dd></dl><hr><h3><a name="A43"> Encryption Tunneling</a></h3><a href=#A42><img src="nav01lt.gif"></a><a href=#A0><img src="nav01up.gif"></a><dl><dd><p>You use encryption tunneling to connect systems together across the Internet in a secure fashion. The tunnel authenticates the connections between the systems and encrypts all packets.<P>Tunnels work through firewalls and so can provide a virtual private data circuit between two LANs. A virtual private data circuit isoften much less expensive than leased lines. <p>Tunnels can also allow a roaming PC user to connect to their enterprise's private network over the Internet. An ISP can participate in this security arrangement by setting up tunnel access to private networks and associating them with dial-ingroups. Tunnel technology can also be used by the ISP to encrypt management traffic using SNMP or telnet. </P>

No trafficlights, fender benders, car problems, detours, people pullingout in front of you, people in the left hand lane going less thanthe speed limit, four lane highways narrowing down to two lanes....This is rather unrealistic, just like with a computer system itis unrealistic to expect at some point in time there will notbe a limit to the amount of memory, CPU, or I/O being consumedby internal or external processes. <P>You might also say that it might be nice to know how long it wasgoing to take you to get to work in the morning (<I>with someexpected normal variation</I>). Users of a computer system havethe same expectation. They expect their jobs to finish in an acceptableamount of time without bottlenecks in the system slowing themdown.<P>If there were bottlenecks on your way to work each day, I supposeyou could <I><B>optimize or tune </B></I>the trip (reduce bottlenecks)by possibly finding an alternate route, car pooling, taking advantageof a car pool lane, taking a bus, or even changing your workinghours (possibly to the evening when there is no traffic and theonly thing keeping you from getting to work any faster is thespeed limit and possibly the size of your engine). Computer systemshave the same optimizations (run jobs during off peak hours, etc.).As with transportation systems, there is also the same lack ofenvironmental control with a computer system. For example, itis not realistic to think that there will always be the same amountof traffic (on the road or in your computer system), it's alsonot realistic to think that you have control over the traffic(on the road or in your computer system). Problems always occur(a rain storm causing increased slowdowns on the road or one userconsuming a great deal of the bandwidth of the server's memory,CPU, or I/O). Managing, as well as expecting, the problems, andknowing what to do when they occur is the key.<P>Once you feel you have the trip optimized, you might also thinkabout taking some statistics, daily, weekly, or monthly, suchas the amount of time it takes you to arrive at the office, numberof <I>red</I> lights you got rather than green, and so on. Thistype of information will allow you to make future decisions onsuch things as &quot;If I stop to get gas in the morning, howmuch earlier will I have to leave the house?&quot; Of course youwould also have to know how much time it would take you at thegas station (another set of statistics). The same thing goes foryour computer system. It's called Capacity Planning. <P>The following information provides you with tips on areas of theMicrosoft&#174; Windows NT&#153; operating system in which youshould pay attention (What to Watch). It also gives you a fewrules/guidelines to use to optimize the system (What You Can Do).Once you take each of these areas into consideration, your systemshould be optimized. Once you feel your system is optimized itis then time to gather data on current capacity. The data willallow you to do the following:<P><UL><LI> Project how much the workload at the memory, CPU, I/O,and bandwidth levels will increase in response to business growthand new Microsoft BackOffice applications.<P><LI> Diagnose problems by comparing subsequent measurements.</UL><P>This information is rather technical in nature and assumes thatyou already know a great deal about Microsoft Windows NT&#153;Workstation and Microsoft Windows NT Server operating systems.However, it only touches the surface of optimization. Many bookscould be written on the subject. Consequently, this paper neglectsto explain many details and assumes you know where to get informationabout the hardware and software concepts mentioned. If you stumbleupon a concept that is not explained in detail, you may want torefer to the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit, Server MessageBlock specification (which can be obtained from Microsoft), MicrosoftTechNet, or any book that details network architecture (such asthe book <I>Local Area Networks</I> by James Martin or <I>LANTimes Encyclopedia of Networking</I> by Tom Sheldon).<H2>Definitions</H2><P>Before diving into any Performance Tuning, it is necessary togo over some definitions and terms.<H3>Task</H3><P>For the purpose of this paper, I refer to the word <B>task</B>as a series of computer instructions, the execution of which involveswork to be performed by one or more computer components or resources(for example, CPU, memory, hard disk, and network adapters).<P>The amount of time it takes to complete a task can be dividedup among the several resources that are involved in the task'sexecution-some resources will be responsible for small amountsof the total time, others will be responsible for larger amounts.<H3>Bottleneck</H3><P>The single resource that consumes the most time during a task'sexecution is that task's <B>bottleneck</B>. Bottlenecks can occurbecause resources are not being used efficiently, resources arenot being used fairly, or a resource is too slow or too small.Let me try to elaborate on this point with the following example.<P><I><B>Example.</B></I> <I>If a task takes 2.2 seconds tocomplete, with .2 seconds spent executing instructions in theCPU and 2 seconds retrieving data from the disk (assuming bothare not overlapping in time), the disk is the bottleneck in thetask. If the CPU were replaced with one twice as fast, task executiontime would drop from 2.2 to 2.1 seconds. This would be approximatelya 4.5% increase in productivity. However, if the disk controllerwere replaced with one twice as fast, it would drop the disk accesstime from 2 seconds to 1 second, dropping the total executiontime from 2.2 to 1.2 seconds. This would be approximately a 45%increase in productivity.</I><P>It would be easy if the previous example were on a workstationrunning the Microsoft MSDOS&#174; operating system, but we aredealing with a multitasking OS. One thing to always keep in mind,especially in a multitasking OS, is that <I><B>resolving one bottleneckwill always lead to the next one.</B></I><H3>Windows NT System Tuning</H3><P>The goal in tuning Windows NT is to determine what hardware resourceis experiencing the greatest demand (bottleneck), and then adjustingthe operation to relieve that demand and maximize total throughput.A system should be structured so that its resources are used efficientlyand distributed fairly among the users. This is not as difficultas it sounds, assuming you use a few good rules/guidelines andhave a thorough understanding of the computing environment. Forexample, in a file and print server environment, most of the activityat the server is in support of file and print services. This tendsto cause high disk utilization because of the large number offiles being opened and closed. It also causes the network interfacecard(s) to endure a heavy load because of the large amount ofdata that is being transferred. Memory typically does not geta heavy load in this environment (memory usage however can beheavy due to the large amount of system memory that may be allocatedto file system cache). Processor utilization is also typicallylow in this environment. In contrast, a server application environment(for example, other Microsoft BackOffice products such as MicrosoftSQL Server&#153; database server for PC networks, Microsoft Mailelectronic mail system [Mail 3.5 or Exchange], Microsoft SystemsManagement Server centralized management for distributed systems,and Microsoft SNA Server) is much more processor and memory boundthan a typical file and print server environment because muchmore actual processing is taking place at the server. The diskand network tend to be less utilized, due to a smaller amountof data being sent over the wire and to the disk. Understandingthese generalizations is not enough; the only way to get an ideaof the utilization of the resources is to monitor them, and oneof the most powerful tools that you can use is the Windows NTPerformance Monitor.<P>Performance Monitor is a graphical tool for measuring the performanceof your own Windows NT-based computer or other Windows NT-basedcomputers on a network. It is located in the Administrative Toolsgroup of both the Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Serverproducts. On each computer, you can view the behavior of objectssuch as processors, memory, cache, threads, and processes. Eachof these objects has an associated set of <B>counters</B> thatprovide information on such things as device usage, queue lengths,and delays, as well as information used for throughput and internalcongestion measurements. It provides <B>charting, alerting,</B>and <B>reporting</B> capabilities that reflect current activityalong with ongoing <B>logging.</B> You can also open log filesat a later time for browsing and charting as if they were reflectingcurrent activity.<P>Before spending money to add more hardware or replace existinghardware with faster, it's best to use Performance Monitor tofirst tune the system to make the most efficient use of existingresources. Here are a couple of examples of where the tool maybe useful:<P><I><B>Example.</B></I> <I>If we find that the CPU is 100%utilized, before replacing it with a faster CPU or adding anotherone, we should identify and analyze the process that is utilizingthe bulk of the CPU time. We may find that the processor cyclesare being consumed by a disk controller requiring PIO. In thiscase a DMA disk controller will then reduce processor utilization.</I><P><I><B>Example.</B></I> <I>If we determine the hard diskis full, before adding additional disk drives, identify how muchof the page file is being utilized. You may find that the systempage file size is initialized at 100 MB, but there is never morethan 40 MB of it being used. Instead of purchasing another disk,we could adjust the size of the page file.</I><H2>Typical Questions</H2><P>If you talk to our product support engineers or our consultantsin the field and ask them about the tuning questions they mostfrequently hear, you may find the following:<P>1. How do I determine how well an application is performing?<P>2. How can I support my environment in a proactive manner?<P>3. How do I know what component of my system is the most limiting(the bottleneck)?<P>4. How can I ensure my system is performing the best it possiblycan perform?<P>5. How do I determine what size system I need based on the followingcriteria?<P>6. How do I know when to upgrade?<P>All of these questions play some part in performance tuning. Weare going to focus mostly on answering questions 2, 3, and 4,primarily by focusing our attention on exploring each of the primarycomponents of a computer system-the memory, processor, and theI/O subsystem (e.g., disks and networks). From this standpoint,performance tuning means ensuring that every user gets a fairshare of available resources of the entire system. Once you feelyou have 2, 3, and 4 under control, you can start focusing on5 and 6, which are more capacity planning issues. Once you have5 and 6 under control, you will be able to answer number 1, andmore important, do &quot;What If&quot; analysis.<P><A HREF="#BMarkHome">Document Contents</A><BR><HR><H1><A NAME="Tuning_for_Memory">Tuning for &quot;Memory&quot;Performance</A></H1><P>Lack of memory is by far the most common cause of serious performanceproblems in computer systems. If you read no further in this documentyou could just answer by saying &quot;Memory!&quot;, if anyoneever asks you how to improve the performance of a system.<P>Memory contention arises when the memory requirements of the activeprocesses exceed the physical memory available on the system;at this point, the system is out of memory. To handle this lackof memory the system starts <I>paging </I>(moving portions ofactive processes to disk in order to reclaim physical memory).At this point, performance decreases dramatically. Consider thefollowing example. If the average instruction in a computer takesapproximately 100 nanoseconds to execute and disk access takessomewhere on the order of 10s of milliseconds, how many timesslower would the machine run, if there were 1 paging operationper instruction? If you answered 100,000 you would be correct!Let's hope things don't get that bad....<P>To optimize overall performance, steps must be taken to ensurethat main memory is used as efficiently as possible and thus pagingis held to a minimum. As you will see in the next section, youcan tell how loaded system memory is by watching how the systempages.<H2>What to Watch</H2><P><UL><LI> The Performance Monitor counter &quot;Memory <B>Pages/sec&quot;</B>is the number of pages read from the disk or written to the diskto resolve memory references to pages that were not in memoryat the time of the reference. As a rule, you can assume that ifthe <U>average</U> of this counter is consistently greater than10, then memory is probably becoming a bottleneck in the system.Once this counter starts to average consistently at 20 or above,performance is significantly degraded and disk thrashing is probablyoccurring.  <P>If &quot;Memory <B>Pages/sec</B>&quot; is increasing, yet &quot;Memory<B>Available bytes&quot;</B> is not decreasing then you may actuallynot have a memory bottleneck.  In this case you would want tocheck for an application that is doing a great deal of disk IO(reads or writes)  and the data is not in cache.<P><LI> If the actual size of the page file is greater than itsinitial size (typically physical RAM + 12), time is being spentgrowing the page file and dealing with page file fragmentation.It is best that the page file not be required to grow during theoperation of the system because it adds time to the paging processes(additional disk access to allocate the needed sectors, updateany allocation, and free sector tables used by the various filesystems). Another result of this behavior is fragmentation, causingthe file to exist on many areas of the disk (the initial pagefile is created using contiguous disk space).<P><LI> A quick way to tell if your system is struggling formemory is to call up WINMSD.EXE (located in %System Root%\system32)and look at the Memory dialog.</UL><P>It details the total memory in your system, the current availablememory ready for allocation to applications you may start, availablespace within your page file, and the Memory Load Index. The MemoryLoad Index specifies a number between 0 and 100 that gives a generalidea of current memory utilization, in which 0 indicates no memoryuse and 100 indicates full memory use. This index is based onthe amount of available memory pages are free in the system. If AvailablePages &lt; 100 (~500K assuming a 4K page) then theindex would be at 100.  If the AvailablePages &gt; 1100 (4MB assuminga 4K page) the index would be at 0.  Any value in between wouldbe calculated with the following formula:<P> (100-((Available Pages-100)/10)<P><I>This dialog is built with a call to the Microsoft Win32&#174;application programming interface GlobalMemoryStatus() in theSDK.</I><P><UL><LI> The counter &quot;Memory <B>Available Bytes&quot;</B>displays the amount of free physical memory. If this counter staysconsistently below 4 MB, paging is occurring and performance isless than optimal. <P><LI> &quot;Memory <B>Committed Bytes&quot; </B>displays thesize of virtual memory (in bytes) that has been committed (asopposed to simply reserved). If this counter is greater than theamount of main memory, it indicates that main memory MAY not belarge enough to accommodate all functions of all currently activeprocesses-some paging MAY be inevitable. However, before makingsuch an assumption, you should check &quot;Memory <B>Pages/sec</B>&quot;and &quot;Memory <B>Page Faults/sec.&quot;</B> If the &quot;Memory<B>Pages/sec</B>&quot; is greater than 10 (10 is a reasonableguideline, but varies with disk hardware) and &quot;Memory <B>PageFaults/sec&quot;</B> is greater than &quot;Memory <B>Cache Faults/sec</B>&quot;then you are paging too much.<P><LI> If you are trying to determine if adding more memoryto your system will benefit your Microsoft SQL Server system,then you may want to monitor the &quot;SQLServer <B>Cache HitRatio</B>&quot; while the system is under a typical load. If thehit ratio is relatively high (over 90%), adding more memory willusually not be beneficial. This is because additional memory canmainly be used for additional Microsoft SQL Server data cache,thereby increasing the hit ratio. In this case, the hit ratiois already high, and the maximum available improvement quite small.If the hit ratio is consistently lower than this, adding morememory may improve the hit ratio and thereby performance, if thelocality of reference is such that it can be &quot;bracketed&quot;by economically or technically feasible amounts of memory.<P><LI> When &quot;Memory <B>Committed bytes&quot; </B>approachesthe &quot;Memory <B>Commit Limit&quot;-</B>and the page file hasalready reached maximum page file size, there are simply no morepages available, in main memory or in the page file. The &quot;Memory<B>Commit Limit&quot; </B>is the amount of virtual memory thatcan be committed without extending the page file. If this occurson a server running Windows NT Server, you may experience 3 errorsin the Event Log. (EVENTVWR.EXE is located in the AdministrativeTools group). They are from the source: SRV. <P><LI>  2020: The server was unable to allocate from the system pagedpool because the pool was empty.<P><LI>  2001: The server was unable to perform an operation due to ashortage of available resources.<P><LI>  2016: The server was unable to allocate virtual memory.</UL><P>If this occurs, it is generally related to a memory leak in anotherprocess. To determine the process at fault you can monitor eachprocess's Page File bytes or Working Set.<UL><LI>Another condition you may want to be aware of is the followingnonpaged pool error in the server's Event Log:</UL><P>  2019: The server was unable to allocate from the system nonpagedpool because the pool was empty.<P>Nonpaged pool pages cannot be paged out to the paging file, butinstead remain in main memory as long as they are allocated. NonPagedPoolSizeis calculated using complex algorithms based on physical memorysize. However, you can use the following formulas to 'approximate'these values for an X86-based computer.<P>MinimumNonPagedPoolSize = 256K<BR>MinAdditionNonPagedPoolPerMb = 32K<BR>DefaultMaximumNonPagedPool = 1 MB<BR>MaxAdditionNonPagedPoolPerMb = 400K<BR>PAGE_SIZE=4096<P>NonPagedPoolSize = MinimumNonPagedPoolSize +<BR>                   ((Physical  MB - 4) * MinAdditionNonPagedPoolPerMB)<P>Example.  On a 32 MB x86-based computer:<P>   MinimumNonPagedPoolSize = 256K<BR>   NonPagedPoolSize = 256K + ((32 - 4) * 32K) = 1.2 MB<P>MaximumNonPagedPoolSize = DefaultMaximumNonPagedPool +<BR>                    ((Physical MB - 4) * MaxAdditionNonPagedPoolPerMB)<P>If MaximumNonPagedPoolSize &lt; (NonPagedPoolSize + PAGE_SIZE* 16),<BR>  then  MaximumNonPagedPoolSize = (NonPagedPoolSize + PAGE_SIZE*16)<P>Example On a 32 MB x86-based computer:<P>   MaximumNonPagedPoolSize = 1 MB + ((32 - 4) * 400K) = 12.5 MB<P>You can monitor the system's nonpaged pool allocation with the&quot;Memory Pool Non Paged Bytes&quot; counter. If there is ashortage of nonpaged pool, you may also see the following erroron a remote system or even the local system:<P>  Not enough storage available to process this command.<P>If this occurs, start looking at each process's nonpaged poolallocation. This is generally caused by an application incorrectlymaking system calls and using up all allocated nonpaged pool.<P><UL><LI> If you are concerned that one application is consuminga great deal of memory (paged or nonpaged) then you may want touse a utility such as the Win32 Software Development Kit utilityPMON.EXE (this is also included in the Windows NT Resource Kitvolume 3 utilities) to monitor its load on the system. At thetop of the PMON display you see some system global statistics:memory size and available bytes, the virtual memory commitment,and pool sizes. Then, for each process, PMON shows processor usageduring the last update interval. The next column is total processortime. The third column 'Mem Usage' is how many pages each processis using (this is the same as the Performance Monitor counter&quot;Process <B>Working Set</B>&quot;), and then the change sincethe last update. PMON also shows how many Page Faults have occurredin the process and the change since the last update. Next is thevirtual memory commitment charge--Commit Charge (this is the sameas the Performance Monitor counter &quot;Process <B>Private Bytes</B>&quot;),and then the pool usage estimates for the process. Finally yousee process priority and the number of threads. There's nothinghere that is not in Performance Monitor (you could get the sameinformation by looking at such counters as &quot;Process <B>PageFaults/sec&quot;</B>), but it is a very handy overview and isquicker to start up, as well as being &quot;preconfigured&quot;to show you the system at a glance. Here is how it looks:<P><H2>What You Can Do</H2><P><LI> Schedule memory-intensive applications during off-peakhours. You can use the AT scheduler that ships with Windows NT.<P><LI> Distribute memory-intensive applications/processes acrossmultiple machines.<P><LI> Add more memory. To determine ABOUT how much memory toadd, use the following formula: </UL><P>&quot;Paging File <B>% Usage MAX&quot; </B>* Page file size =number of bytes used<P>Add together the bytes used for all page files. This is the amountof memory that would need to be added to allow all of the applicationsto perform their operations with minimum paging. For example,if your page file is 100 MB and the % Usage MAX is 20%, then youwould need 20 MB additional RAM to have a system that does minimalpaging. The reason this formula only gives you an idea ABOUT howmuch memory to add is that a) not all page file &quot;in use&quot;code is accessed all of the time; and b) the formula ignores therequirements for code and mapped files not backed by the pagingfile. Therefore this estimate is neither an upper bound, nor alower bound-it is only an &quot;indication.&quot; The truth isthat there is no good way to know how much memory to add at thistime. A more accurate way to measure the amount of memory an applicationwould require is to run the application on a very large machineand measure the needs under some slight memory pressure. (Thereis a tool in the Windows NT Resource Kit volume 3 utilities calledResponse Probe that can aid in this area.)<P><B>Gotcha<I>. </I></B>Adding memory without upgrading the secondarycache size sometimes degrades processor performance. This is becausethe secondary cache now has to map the larger memory space, usuallyresulting in lowered hit rates in the cache. This slows down processor-boundprograms because they are scattered more widely in memory aftermemory has been added. (Secondary cache refers to the physicalcache memory chip(s) usually located on the motherboard, as opposedto within the processor itself. In the future, processors willbe built with secondary cache on the same substrate as the processorchip, or even within the processor chip itself.)<P><B>w</B> If you determine that a great deal of memory is beingconsumed by an application for which you have the source code,you may want to investigate tuning the application to be lessmemory intensive. Good tools to use to profile your applications'memory allocation are the Working Set Tuner and the VADUMP toolsin the Win32 SDK.<P><B>w</B> Spreading paging files across multiple disk drives andcontrollers generally improves performance as multiple disks canprocess I/O requests concurrently. After all, you can have upto 16 separate page files. Also, since Windows NT has severalsystem files that are frequently accessed, you may want to experimentwith locating the paging file on one disk and the Windows NT systemfiles on another. You should also locate the page file(s) on separatedisk(s) from application files to allow for page file I/O andapplication file I/O to occur concurrently. This will only workif the disk driver(s) and controller(s) used can accommodate asynchronousI/O requests. Keep in mind that most IBM-compatible &quot;non-superservers&quot; have an ATDISK as the default and the ATDISK drivercan have only one I/O request pending at a time. If your systemmixes high-speed disks and low-speed disks, use the fastest disksfor all your paging.<P><B>w</B> Use the Control Panel | System | Virtual Memory and setthe page file size such that extension of it will rarely occur.<P><B>w</B> Use the Control Panel | Services to turn off unnecessaryWindows NT services, and Control Panel | Network to uninstallany unnecessary Windows NT device drivers. This can free up bothCPU and memory.  One example might be the <B>Spooler</B> service. If you don't have a printer connected to the workstation or serverthere may not be any reason to have it running.  It can save you 560K of committed memory and about  691K of non paged pool--Checkit out with the PMON.exe tool in the Windows NT Resource Kit. Look at the 'Commit Charge' column (this is the same as the &quot;Process:<B>Private Bytes&quot;</B> counter in Performance Monitor).<P><B>w</B> User accounts are stored in a registry hive, which meanseach account consumes paged pool on a Primary Domain Controlleror Backup Domain Controller. Therefore the limit on the numberof user accounts depends on the amount of memory and swap filespace in your PDC and BDCs. User accounts take about 1K each,so 10,000 is about 10 MB. You may want to consider a second domain(possibly a different domain model) if you have more than 15,000user accounts. However, the only answer may be to add more memory.<P><B>w</B> Some machines provide the ROM BIOS shadowing option.While this feature provides an advantage with MSDOS, it is NOTan advantage with Microsoft Windows NT. ROM BIOS shadowing isthe process of copying the BIOS from ROM into RAM and using eitherhardware or 386 enhanced mode to remap the RAM into the normaladdress space of the BIOS. Because reading RAM is much fasterthan reading ROM, BIOS-intensive operations are substantiallyfaster. For example, MSDOS uses the BIOS to write to the screen;therefore, with ROM BIOS shadowing, directory listings run morequickly. Windows NT does not use the BIOS (except during startup);therefore, no performance is gained by shadowing. If ROM BIOSshadowing is not used, more RAM is available. With Windows NT,there is an advantage to disabling the ROM BIOS shadowing option.This applies to other BIOS shadowing schemes as well. Typicallythe CMOS settings allow the system to shadow any BIOS. This includesthe following: System BIOS, Video BIOS, Other adapters ROM BIOS(in a given select range).<P><A HREF="#BMarkHome">Document Contents</A><BR><HR><H1><A NAME="Tuning_for_Processor">Tuning for &quot;Processor&quot;Performance</A></H1><P>A processor (running at a given clock speed) can execute a setnumber of instructions per second. Therefore, if a processor isswitched among multiple threads that all have work to do, a giventhread will take <I>x</I> (<I>x</I> being the number of simultaneouslyexecuting threads) times longer to complete a given task.<P>There are times when a thread has no work to do, such as whenwaiting for user input, or when waiting for another thread tofinish a related operation. As long as the thread is in this waitingstate, it will not be scheduled for execution and, thus, doesnot take up any CPU time. Since most Microsoft Windows&#174;-typeapplications spend a considerable amount of time with their threadsin this waiting state, there may be little performance degradationwhen running multiple Windows-based applications.<P>Some applications are considered CPU intensive. A CPU-intensiveapplication almost always has work to do and spends very little,if any, time in the waiting state. For example, the followingC program consumes 100% of the CPU. When additional applicationsare started, their performance, and that of the CPU-intensiveapplication, will be less than optimal since all must share theprocessor's time. This is an example of how NOT to write an application;a better approach would be to create an event or wait on a semaphore.<P>main(){<P> while(1){}<P>}<P>The figure below shows the application's utilization of the CPU.<P><H2>What to Watch</H2><P>If the &quot;Processor <B>% Processor Time</B>&quot; counter consistentlyregisters at or near 100%, the processor may be the bottleneck.('System <B>%</B> <B>Total processor time</B>&quot; can be viewedfor multiprocessor systems.) If this occurs you need to determineWHO or WHAT is consuming the CPU. To determine which process isusing up most of the CPU's time, monitor the &quot;Process objects<B>% Processor Time&quot; </B>for all of the process instances (asin the previous figure).<P><B>w</B> You can tell if the CPU activity is due to applicationsor to servicing hardware interrupts by monitoring &quot;Processor<B>Interrupts/sec.&quot;</B> This is the number of device interruptsthe processor is experiencing. A value over 1000 should causeyou to look at the efficiency of hardware I/O devices such asthe disk controllers and network cards.<P><B>w</B> You can also monitor &quot;System <B>System Calls/sec.&quot;</B>Systems Calls/sec is the frequency of calls to Windows NT systemservice routines. These routines perform all of the basic schedulingand synchronization of activities on the computer and provideaccess to nongraphical devices, memory management, and name spacemanagement. If there are many more interrupts per second thansystem calls, it could indicate that a hardware device is generatingan excessive number of interrupts.<P><B>w</B> Monitor the &quot;System <B>Context Switches/sec</B>&quot;as well. Too frequent context switching can be caused if semaphoresor critical sections (see the Windows NT SDK for more information)are placed at too low a level in order to attain high concurrency.The only way to solve this problem is to re-evaluate the priorityplace on the source code.<H2>What You Can Do</H2><P><B>w</B> Schedule CPU-intensive applications during off-peak hours.You can use the AT scheduler that ships with Windows NT.<P><B>w</B> If you have control over the application source, youmay want to investigate tuning the application to be less CPUintensive. There are a number of tools available with the WindowsNT SDK that allow you to do this, such as WAP (Windows API Profiler),CAP (Call Attributed Profiler), FIOSAP (File I/O and SynchronizationWin32 API Profiler), and Win32 API Logger.<P><B>w</B> Distribute applications and processes across multiplemachines.<P><B>w</B> Upgrade the processor if possible. Keep in mind thatWindows NT runs on MIPS and Digital Alpha AXP machines as wellas the Intel (386, 486, and Pentium). Most servers are eitherfile servers or application servers. Even though they use thesame operating system each uses the machine's resources in a differentway. A file server generally maximizes system bus utilizationand under-utilizes the processor. A 486 clock doubler chip inthis machine would not provide a big performance enhancement overa typical 486 chip. An application server (such as a databaseserver running Microsoft SQL Server and Systems Management Server),however, utilizes the processor subsystem significantly more thanthe file servers. You will find that this is the environment wherea more powerful CPU chip will pay off. <P>If you are in a situation where you are trying to determine ifmoving to a RISC processor will increase performance, you shouldlook at the counter &quot;System <B>Context Switches/sec.&quot;</B>This is the rate of switches from one thread to another. Movingto a RISC machine will only be a good idea if the <B>Context Switch</B>rate is NOT dominating processor activity.<P><B>w</B> Add more processors assuming there is more than 1 threadcapable of asynchronous execution. If you have a multiple processorcomputer, Windows NT will assign separate threads to differentprocessors (interrupts are also distributed). The thread executionload is then distributed across the multiple processors. For example,if a CPU-intensive thread is executing on processor A, processorB will be free to process other threads.<P><B>w</B> Upgrade the secondary cache. In this same regard, youmay consider upgrading the CPU to a chip with a 16K First Levelcache such as a 486 DX4/100 (Unified Instruction and data cache)or a Pentium (8K data cache and 8K instruction cache).<P><B>w</B> Assuming you have at least a 486, if you are in a serverenvironment, part of your problem may be the network or disk adaptercards you have chosen. 8-bit cards use more processor time than16-bit or 32-bit cards. The number of bits here refers to theamount of data moved to memory from the adapter on each transfer.The most efficient cards use 32-bit transfers to adapter memoryor direct memory access (DMA) to move their data. Adapters thatdon't use memory-mapped buffers or DMA must use processor instructionsto move data, and that makes the processor busy. DMA uses thememory bus, and that can slow the processor down but it is stillmore efficient than individual instructions. There is more informationon this topic in the &quot;Tuning for Disk Performance&quot; sectionof this document. Keep in mind while reading this section andthe &quot;Disk Performance&quot; section that replacing PIO deviceswill almost always reduce processor bottlenecks.<P><B>w</B> In a resource-sharing environment, a greater improvementcan be found by upgrading to a faster processor rather than increasingthe number of CPUs. In a client-server environment, the additionof another CPU will typically give a better performance increasethan upgrading to a faster or more advanced processor becauseof the multithreaded design of all Microsoft BackOffice products.<P><B>w</B> Each application (as well as each thread) in the systemhas a set priority. You can control the priority system-wide bychanging the following in Control Panel | System | Tasking.<P>Use this dialog box to change the relative responsiveness of applicationsthat are running at the same time. When more than one applicationis running in Windows NT, by default the foreground applicationreceives more processor time, and so responds better, than applicationsrunning in the background. (You can also use the Windows NT SDKutility PVIEW to set individual application priorities.) <P>You may also use the START command to alter the priority of aprogram as it is started. This command can take /low, /normal,/high, and /realtime switches to start programs with varying levelsof priority.<P><B>Gotcha<I>. </I></B>Never start processor-bound applicationsat real-time priority.<H3>Considerations for 16-Bit Applications</H3><P><B>w</B> You can monitor the performance of 16-bit MSDOS-basedapplications, however they are difficult to identify as instancesbecause the program name does not appear. This is because eachMSDOS-based application shows up in its own Virtual DOS Machine(NTVDM). You would have to look at the individual threads (thatis, &quot;Thread <B>Processor Time</B>&quot;) for the NTVDM.EXEapplication. An easy way to identify the thread associated withthe application you want to monitor is to stop all other 16-bitMSDOS-based applications and choose the remaining thread. Anotherway to identify the application is to copy the NTVDM.EXE processto another name and editing the following path in the Registry:<P><B>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\</B><P><B>Control\WOW\</B><P><B>cmdline</B><P>16-bit Windows-based applications execute in one NTVDM by default,but can be started in separate NTVDMs.<P><B>w</B> If you are not satisfied with the performance of yourMSDOS-based applications running on Windows NT Workstation, tryfull-screen mode. In full-screen mode, most applications can runwith native performance directly on the installed video adapter.Windows maps VGA memory to the appropriate place in the VDM andmaps the relevant registers from the application to the videoadapter. To get in and out of full-screen mode, press ALT+ENTER.<P><B>w</B> When running MSDOS or Windows version 3.1, serial communicationsapplications that directly access serial port hardware, you mayenhance performance of these applications by using software handshaking(xon/xoff) instead of hardware handshaking (cts/rts). Becausehardware must be virtualized under Windows NT, checking the cts/rtssignals directly will incur an unavoidable performance degradation.Using xon/xoff handshaking avoids this problem since xon/xoffhandshaking does not require accessing the serial port hardwaredirectly.<UL><LI>Windows NT 3.51 supports disk compression (via the COMPACT.EXEutility).  You should not compress your \temp directory \%systemroot%\system32 directory or any other directory that gets useda great deal.  You should also not compress any files that arealready compressed, such as Microsoft Email MMF files.</UL><P><A HREF="#BMarkHome">Document Contents</A><BR><HR><H1><A NAME="Tuning_for_Disk">Tuning for &quot;Disk&quot; Performance</A></H1><P>As you might have guessed, disk performance is the single mostimportant aspect of I/O performance. It affects many other aspectsof system performance. Good disk performance enhances virtualmemory performance and reduces the elapsed time required to loadprograms that perform a great deal of I/O, and so on.<P>If you discover a disk bottleneck, the first thing you need todetermine is whether it's really more memory that you need. Ifyou are short on memory, you will see the lost performance reflectedas a disk bottleneck.<P><B>Gotcha<I>. </I></B>Because disk counters can increase diskaccess time by approximately 1.5% on a 386/20, Windows NT doesnot automatically activate these counters at system startup.

This counter is the percentage of elapsed timethat the selected disk drive is busy servicing read or write requests,including time waiting in the disk driver queue.<P><B>w</B> If &quot;Physical Disk <B>Disk Queue Length</B>&quot;(pending disk I/O requests) is greater than 2, it generally indicatessignificant disk congestion. <I>(Note: This same rule appliesto most all I/O devices.)</I><P><B>w</B> Determine the portion of the disk I/O used for pagingwith the following function &quot;% disk time used for paging= 100 * ('Memory <B>Pages/sec</B>' * 'PhysicalDisk <B>Avg,DiskSec/Transfer</B>')&quot;.If this is more than 10% of the total disk activity then pagingis excessive. <B>Avg. Disk sec/Transfer</B> is the time in secondsof the average disk transfer. This formula does not include thecase where you may be paging over the network.<H2>What You Can Do</H2><P><B>w</B> Install a faster disk and/or controller. Determine ifthe controller card does 8-bit, 16-bit, or 32-bit transfers. Themore bits in the transfer operation, the faster the controllermoves data. You may also want to choose a different drive technology.IDE (integrated drive electronic) has a 2.5 MB/s throughput, ESDIhas a 3 MB/sec, SCSI-2 has a 5 MB/s throughput, and a Fast SCSI-2has a 10 MB/sec throughput.<P><B>w</B> Create mirrored data sets. The I/O system can issue concurrentreads to 2 partitions. The first portion of the read will be topartition A, while the next portion of the read will be to partitionB. (Assuming the disk driver and controller can handle asynchronousI/O).<P><B>w</B> Create striped data sets. Multiple disks (between 3 and32)can process I/O requests concurrently (assuming the disk driverand controller can handle asynchronous I/O).<P><B>w</B> Add memory (RAM) to increase file cache size.<P><B>w</B> Change to a different I/O bus architecture. EISA, MCA,and local bus (VESA or PCI) buses transfer data at a much higherrate than ISA buses. PCI is fast because it transfers data at33 MHz, a double word at a time (33 MHz * 4 = 132 Mb/sec) whereasISA maxes out at about 5 Mb/sec and EISA about 32 Mb/sec (EISAtransfers at 8 MHz * 4 bytes). There has been talk about raisingthe PCI clock rate to 66 MHz (to get a 264 Mb/sec transfer rate)but most manufacturers are resisting the idea (at about 50 MHzor so, getting past FCC class B certification is a nightmare).<P><B>w</B> When choosing a I/O device such as a disk adapter, considerthe architecture of the card. For example here are some of thepoints to consider about each architecture:<P>  <B>PIO: </B>PIO (programmed I/O) requires intervention by theCPU. For example, the Adaptec 1522 is a PIO device and can doeither 16-bit PIO or 32-bit PIO. However, CPU-usage is quite intensive(30-40%) and it will slow down your system during a large transferor a CD-ROM access. As such, most high-performance systems don'tuse a PIO device because they adversely impact system throughput.<I>BYTE</I> magazine did a comparison of Adaptec 2940 (PCI) againsta Future Domain adapter (PIO). While the Future Domain and Adaptec2940 provide almost identical benchmark results, the Future Domainconsumes a hefty 40% of CPU time whereas the 2940 does not. However,all PIO devices are much cheaper to manufacture- the FD is abouthalf the price of the 2940. Another thing to keep in mind is thatthe standard ATDISK disk (most IDE drives) does PIO.<P>  <B>DMA: </B>ISA DMA has only 24-address lines so it can physicallyaddress 16 MB. However, if you happen to have 32 MB of RAM, theOS can see all of the memory. Therefore, if the OS wants to transfera block of memory (which happens to be located at memory locationabove 16 MB, which the ISA DMA card, such as the Adaptec 1542C,cannot physically see), it will have to copy that block down toan area in the 0-15 MB range (where the Adaptec 1542c can see)so the 1542C can initiate the DMA transfer (double buffering).This copying down to 0-15 MB range and also copying up (16 MBand up) <I><B>takes quite a bit of time</B></I> (using Intel repsb,repsw, repsd) so that explains the slow down. However, you don'thave that problem with either VL, PCI, or EISA as they all have32-bit DMA address lines and can physically see up to 4 GB. PIOdevices can see all of the memory, including those above 16 MB.The only problem is that it takes the processor to do any kindof data transfer. The last thing to keep in mind is that somedevices do both PIO and DMA. If your system is not an ISA computerWITH more than 16 MB of RAM, you should always run with the controllerin DMA mode.  <P><B>Gotcha</B>. The Adaptec 154x ISA busmaster, has a hard codedlimit of a DMA speed of 5 MB/sec transfer rate.  This is hardcoded in the Windows NT driver.  <P>  <B>Bus Master: </B>Bus master devices have their own intelligenceand offload this work from the CPU. The CPU can resume doing itsown thing while the bus-master device is doing all the I/O. Whenit's done, it hands the result to the CPU. These cards are byfar the best solution.<P><B>Gotcha<I>. </I></B>Make sure that you check the Windows NTHardware Compatibility List before you purchase a controller.This will tell you if the controller is supported by Microsoftand has a certified driver.<P><B>w</B> On a 2 SCSI disk daisy-chained system, the SCSI controllerhas more of an impact on your total performance than your diskdrive. You would be better off buying a slower, cheaper disk andinvesting in a better SCSI controller. <P><B>w</B> Adding more physical drives in a RAID 5 configurationcan result in significant performance improvements when the disksubsystem is the bottleneck. However, adding more controllersusually does not significantly improve performance. When usinghigh-performance disk controllers, the physical drive access timesare usually the performance limiting factor for the disk subsystem.<P><B>w</B> Choose a disk with a low seek time (the time requiredto move the disk drive's heads from one track of data to another).The ratio of time spent seeking to time spent transferring datais usually 10 to 1, and often much higher. <P><B>w</B> Distribute the workload as evenly as possible among differentdisk drives. This will allow you to take full advantage of thesystem's I/O bandwidth. For example, if you have one user populationthat does a great deal of reads and writes to directory \\server\ExcelDataand another user population that does a great deal of reads andwrites to a directory \\server\WordData then you may want to considerputting the ExcelData directory on a different disk and/or controllerthan the WordData directory. You can take advantage of the auditingfacility of Windows NT and the NTFS file system to track how certainnetwork files are being used. User Manager lets you enable fileaccess auditing, and File Manager lets you specify the users andfiles whose access you want to record.<P><B>w</B> If you choose a FAT file system, with time it tends tobecome fragmented. As the file system becomes full, pieces offiles tend to be scattered over the disk; the system cannot findenough contiguous blocks to store a new file in one place, soit must fit the file in empty spaces between other files. As filesare added, deleted, truncated, and expanded, the file system becomesincreasingly disorderly. Performance suffers because the diskdrive cannot read a file with a sequential group of operations.Instead, it must constantly seek for different pieces of the file.To avoid fragmentation, use a Defrag utility, such as ExecutiveSoftware's DiskKeeper, to adjust files in a sequence (for moreinformation refer to their web site at http: \\www.earthlink.net\execsofton the internet).<P><B>w</B> NTFS is best for use on volumes of about 400 MB or more.This is because performance does not degrade with larger volumesizes under NTFS as it does under FAT. As the size of the volumeincreases, performance with FAT will quickly decrease. When usingthe FAT file system, the disk space taken by files is more thanthe space taken when using NTFS. FAT file system uses clustersto allocate disk space for files. Clusters are the smallest allocationunits that the file system uses to allocate space for the files.For example, for a 1-byte file, 1 cluster will be allocated, thuswasting all of the unused space. When a large number of smallfiles are stored on a FAT partition, the cluster size may tendto waste a large amount of disk space. The cluster size is dependenton the size of the logical drive. FAT can only track a maximumof 64K clusters since there are 64K entries in the File AllocationTable. That would indicate that the cluster size will increasefor large drives, in order to access the whole drive. The maximumcluster size is 64K, thus making the largest logical drive sizeto be 4 gigabytes. With NTFS there is a limit, however it's 264.<P><B>w</B> Disabling short name generation on an NTFS partitionwill greatly increase directory enumeration performance especiallyin the case where individual directories contain a large numberof files/directories with non-8.3 filenames. To disable shortname generation, use REGEDT32.EXE to set a registry DWORD valueof 1 in the following Registry location:<P><B>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\</B><P><B>Control\Filesystem\</B><P><B>NtfsDisable8dot3NameCreation</B><P><B>Gotcha. </B>This may cause compatibility problems with 16-bitMSDOS- and Windows-based applications.<P><A HREF="#BMarkHome">Document Contents</A><BR><HR><H1><A NAME="Tuning_for_Network">Tuning for &quot;Network&quot;Performance</A></H1><P>Network performance problems can have basically three forms, eachof which cause the network protocol to have to transmit each blockof data many times (or error out) causing performance problems.<P><B>w</B> A server can be overloaded<P>The server is being asked to do more than it can based on an inadequateresource, possibly from a lack of another resource such as memory.<P><B>w</B> A network can be overloaded <P>The amount of data that needs transferred is greater than thecapacity of the physical medium.<P><B>w</B> A network can lose data integrity<P>The network is faulty and intermittently transfers data incorrectly.<P>We can examine each of these problems from the perspective ofthe OSI (Open Systems Interconnect) networking model.

The redirector then packages up the requestand forwards it down to the transport (TCP/IP, NBF, or NWLINK)and out onto the wire to be picked up by a server. So, as youcan see, a great deal of the redirector's network performanceis tied directly to how well the server responds to its requests.However, there are a few issues to be aware of on the redirectorside.<P><B>w</B> &quot;Redirector <B>Current Commands&quot;</B> countsthe number of requests to the Redirector that are currently queuedfor service. If this number is much larger than the number ofnetwork adapter cards installed in the computer, then the network(s)and/or the server(s) being accessed are seriously bottlenecked.To try to compensate for the problem locally, you could increasethe maximum allowed pending network commands if the redirectorapplication I/O request queue is backed up by increasing:<P><B>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\</B><P><B>LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\</B><P><B>MaxCmds</B> (default = 5)<P><B>w</B> If you see &quot;Redirector <B>Network Errors/sec&quot;</B>then SMB requests are timing out, forcing the redirector to disconnect,reconnect, and recover.

For example, the WriteFileEx()WIN32 function may fail, returning the messages ERROR_INVALID_USER_BUFFERor ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_MEMORY if there are too many outstanding asynchronousI/O requests.<P><B>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\</B><P><B>LanmanWorkstation\Parameters\</B><P><B>MaxThreads</B> (default=17)<P><B>w</B> If you have more than 1 redirector loaded on your WindowsNT Workstation (for example, Client Services for NetWare, andso on), consider the order of providers. When a WNet API is called,it routes the call to the first provider DLL (dynamic-link library)in the &quot;ProviderOrder&quot; and then waits for this providerto return before submitting it to the next provider. You can seethe provider order by looking in the Network Control Panel andpressing the Network button <P>or, if you are interested in the value on a remote machine, youcan use the registry editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and view the followingregistry entry:<P><B>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\</B><P><B>NetworkProvider\</B><P><B>Order:ProviderOrder</B><P><B>w</B> There is a new SMB that is now supported under WindowsNT called <B>NtTransact_NotifyDirectoryChange.</B> This allowsan application to know when a directory structure has been updatedon the server. If an application causes one of these SMBs to besubmitted, RAW SMB I/O cannot be accomplished. (Note: RAW I/Ois much faster than CORE I/O. However, it must have the session'sfull attention. Since there is an outstanding request on the session,RAW cannot be accomplished.) Windows NT File Manager causes oneof these SMBs to be submitted if you are focused on a redirecteddrive. This can cause a slowdown on large reads and writes fromother applications. You can shut this feature off for File Managerin the registry by adding the following value:<P><B>SOFTWARE\Microsoft\File Manager\</B><P><B>Settings\</B><P><B>ChangeNotifyTime</B> (default=0 REG_SZ)<H2>Netlogon</H2><P>One of the primary jobs of Netlogon is to keep the user accountdatabase in sync on all of the backup domain controllers withthe primary domain controller.<P><B>w</B> Increase Netlogon service update notice periods on yourPrimary Domain Controllers, as well as the server announcementperiod if you are concerned with the amount of maintenance trafficthe Windows NT Server is creating and the load on the primarydomain controller.<P>Use the registry editor and modify the following path:<P><B>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM</B><P><B> \CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters</B><PRE WIDTH=132>Value Name      Default       Minimum       Maximum Value                      Value         Value                            Pulse           20              1             500                Concurrency                                                              Pulse           300 (5 minutes) 60 (1 minute) 3600 (1 hour)                                                      Randomize       1 (1 second)    0 (0 seconds) 120 (2 minutes)                                                           </PRE><P>  <B>Pulse</B> defines the typical pulse frequency (in seconds).All User/Security account database changes made within this timeare collected together. After this time, a pulse is sent to eachBDC needing the changes. No pulse is sent to a BDC that is up-to-date.<P>  <B>Randomize</B> specifies the BDC back off period (in seconds).When the BDC receives a pulse, it will back off between zero andRandomize seconds before calling the PDC.<P>  <B>PulseConcurrency</B> defines the maximum number of simultaneouspulses the PDC will send to BDCs.<P><B>w</B> Netlogon sends pulses to individual BDCs. The BDCs respondby asking for any database changes. To control the maximum loadthese responses place on the PDC, the PDC will only have PulseConcurrencypulses &quot;pending&quot; at once. The PDC should be sufficientlypowerful to support this many concurrent replication RPC calls(related directly to server service tuning as well as the amountof memory in the machine). Increasing PulseConcurrency increasesthe load on the PDC. Decreasing PulseConcurrency increases thetime it takes for a domain with a large number of BDCs to geta user account database change to all of the BDCs. Consider thatthe time to replicate a database change to all the BDCs in a domainwill be greater than:<P>((Randomize/2) * NumberOfBdcsInDomain) / PulseConcurrency<P>You have to keep in mind the amount of traffic that 1 change tothe user account database causes between Primary Domain Controllersand Backup Domain Controller.   Each password change or additionof a user takes approximately 1K of data (it can be greater dependingon the amount of comments etc.).  Each  group takes approximately4K of data.  When doing the math once you know how many changesyour users will be making (you can control this with User ManagerAccount Policies) you also have to consider how many servers youhave in the domain because each server changes its internal passwordrandomly each 7 days).  <P>Netlogon also has controls in place to ensure that the bandwithis not compensated.  Netlogon has a REPLICATIONGOVERNER that letsit use only 25% of the available bandwidth.<P>In Windows NT 3.51, there are two new counters in PerformanceMonitor to assist you  in Domain Performance analysis.  They are&quot;Server <B>Logon Total&quot; </B>and &quot;Server <B>Logon/Sec.</B>&quot;.<H2>Print Browser</H2><P>When you share a printer in Windows NT, the spooler creates athread that broadcasts a message on all of the print server'sinstalled protocols to all other Windows NT print servers, informingthe other print servers of the new print share. Each of theseprint servers adds the new print share name to its local printerbrowse list. Also, each print server rebroadcasts the list ofits local printers to all other print servers every 10 minutes.This ensures that all Windows NT print servers have current browselists, but it also causes network traffic. To disable the printerbrowse thread (Disabling the thread will reduce network traffic,but it also keeps other print servers from knowing about new printshares) update the following registry path to a 1 rather thana 0.<P><B>  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\</B><P><B>   CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers</B><P>   <B>ServerThreadRunning </B>(default = 0 REG_SZ)<P><H2>Transport (NBF, TCP/IP, NWLink, and so on)</H2><P>The transport drivers function is to transport network data submittedby applications (such as the redirector, e-mail, Microsoft SQLServer, and so on) to other network stations. Windows NT shipswith a variety of transport drivers such as TCP/IP, NBF (NetBEUI),and NWLink. All of these transports export a TDI interface ontop and an NDIS (Network Driver Interface Specification) on thebottom. (Windows NT also ships with AppleTalk and DLC, however,these do not have a TDI interface.)<P><B>w</B> If the protocol used on most stations that you will connectto is first in the bindings list, average connection time decreases.This is because when you request a connection to shared resourceson a remote station, the local workstation redirector submitsa TDI connect request to all transports simultaneously, and whenany one of the transport drivers completes the request successfully,the redirector waits until all higher priority transports return.In the following figure you will see that the NetBEUI / IntelEther Express binding has the highest priority.<P><B>w</B> Each transport has its own way of doing windowing (typicallythe amount of packets sent before an acknowledgment is required).By increasing the window size, you can send more packets to theother side before you have to wait for an acknowledgment. Thiscan have a slight increase in performance (less packets = lessI/O), however, it can also increase the risk of retransmission.This is NOT a recommended practice. <P>  For NBF you can modify:<P><B>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\</B><P><B>NBF\Parameters\ </B><P><B>LLCMaxWindowSize</B> (default = 10)<P>This is how many LLC I-frames NBF can send before it must stopand wait for an acknowledgment.<P>  For TCP/IP you can modify:<P><B>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\</B><P><B>Tcpip\Parameters\</B><P><B>TcpWindowSize </B>(default = 8192 for NT 3.1.  In NT 3.5x itdepends on the Maximum Transmission Unit and it rounds to thenearest multiple, so for Tokenring it ends up at 16K and for ethernetit ends up about 8700.)<P>This is the amount of data that can be accepted in a single transaction.<P>  For NWLINK you can modify 3 entries:<P><B>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\</B><P><B>NWNBLink\Parameters\</B><P><B>AckWindow </B>(default = 2)<P>This specifies the number of frames to receive before sendingan acknowledgment.<P><B>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\</B><P><B>NWNBLink\Parameters\</B><P><B>RcvWindowMax </B>(default = 4)<P>This specifies the maximum number of frames the receiver can receiveat one time.<P><B>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\</B><P><B>NWLink\Parameters\</B><P><B>WindowSize</B> (default = 4)<P>This specifies the window to use in the SPX packets.<P><B>w</B> If you are on an NBF network and have a server on a veryslow link, you may want to consider increasing the following:<P><B>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\</B><P><B>NBF\Parameters\</B><P><B>DefaultT1Timeout</B> (default = 600 ms; grows dynamically to10 sec) <P>The T1 value controls the time that NBF waits for a response aftersending a logical link control (LLC) poll packet before resendingit. The default value you specify here is only used upon linkestablishment. It is then dynamically changed every 30 seconds.<P><B>w</B> If you are on an NBF network and have a server on a verybusy link you may want to consider increasing the following:<P><B>SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\</B><P><B>NBF\Parameters\</B><P><B>LLCRetries</B> (default = 8)<P>This value specifies the number of times that NBF will retry pollinga remote workstation after receiving a T1 timeout. After thismany retries, NBF closes the link.<H2>Physical (Network Adapter)</H2><P><B>w</B> If the sum of the &quot;Server <B>Bytes Total/sec&quot;</B>(the number of bytes the server has sent to and received fromthe network) is roughly equivalent to the maximum transfer rateof your network, you may need to segment your network. On an Ethernetsegment this value is ~1.2 megabyts per sec <I>[(10,000,000 bits/sec) / 8 =  1,250,000 bytes / sec]</I>, once you include theoverhead of the network.<P><B>w</B> An Ethernet segment is shared by every user of everysystem on the network. Therefore, it is a relatively limited resourcewith many users. This situation can be alleviated somewhat byadding sub-networks, but no matter how complex the network's topology,a network basically consists of many systems communicating througha single piece of wire. If one user is accessing a very largefile across the network, that user may be slowing down the networkfor <I><B>all</B></I> users.<P><B>w</B> Match adapter to the system bus. If you have a 16-bitbus, use a 16-bit network adapter; if you have a 32-bit bus, usea 32-bit network adapter.<P><B>w</B> Avoid sending from fast adapters to slow adapters.<P><B>w</B> If you need to transfer huge amounts of data betweendifferent computer systems, Ethernet may not be the appropriatemedium to use; the basic Ethernet cable is limited to 10 megabitsper second (considerably less when you include network overhead).Other media are now available that offer significantly highersustained transfer rates (FDDI, and so on).<UL><LI>It's not difficult to figure out how much data can be senddown a segment once you know the line speed.  For example, ifyou are dealing with a 9600 BPS line, that means that you shouldbe able to get a true throughput of 4.32MB per hour.  </UL><P>  9600 BPS/8 bits/byte * 60 sec/min * 60 min/hour ==&gt; 4.32MB/hour<P>The same goes for a higher speed line such as a 38.4K line.  Themath says you should be able to get approximately (4*4.32) 17.28MBdown the pipe.  This does not account for retransmissions andline noise, it's a theoretical number.  When doing calculationssuch as this you should probably use some type of factor suchas (.80 * theoretical value).<P><B>w</B> The Network Monitor (provided with Systems ManagementServer) is a very good tool to use to monitor the general networkperformance. It offers additional Performance Monitor countersas well as a few unique statistics from within the applicationsuch as:<P>  <B>% Network Utilization</B> represents what percentage of thenetwork bandwidth is being used.<P>  <B>Frames per Second</B> is the number of frames being transmittedon the network per second.<P>  <B>Bytes Per Second</B> is the number of bytes being transmittedon the network per second.<P>  <B>Broadcasts per Second</B> represents the number of broadcastframes on the network per second.<P>  <B>Multicasts per Second</B> represents the number of multicastframes on the network per second.<P>  <B>Network Card (MAC) Statistics </B>represents the cumulativetotal number of frames, bytes, broadcasts, and multicasts seenon the network by the network card since the capture has begun.<P>  <B>Network Card (MAC) Error Statistics</B> indicates the cumulativeerrors seen from the network card. These include CRC Errors andframes dropped because of no buffer space as well as frames droppedbecause of hardware constraints.<P><B>w</B> By sorting the Network Monitor Broadcasts Multicastscolumn in the Station Statistics pane (bottom pane), you can findthe source(s) of a broadcast storm to see which machine(s) is/aresending the most Broadcast frames.<P><B>w</B> An increase in the amount of Broadcasts/Multicasts persecond can relate directly to machine performance. Each broadcast/multicastcauses every card on the net to generate an interrupt to allowthe packet to be passed up to the transport. This can cause seriousCPU utilization problems. As a general rule, a broadcast/multicastrate of over 100/sec should cause you to investigate a cause aswell as a cure. The cure may be as easy as identifying a jabberingnetwork card or configuring a router to not enable TCP ports 137and 138. Note: NBF is not a routable transport.<P><B>w</B> &quot;Network Segment <B>% Network Utilization</B>&quot;should be considered when things start slowing down to the pointthey are no longer acceptable.  Some say that this point is around40-50%.  Then the network is the bottleneck.<P><B>w</B> Ethernet <I><B>collisions</B></I> occur when your systemstarts sending data at the same time as another system on thenetwork. When your system detects a collision, it waits a randomamount of time and retransmits the packet. Collisions are normalevents and don't indicate hardware problems. However, the probabilityof two hosts transmitting at the same time, increases as the networkis more heavily utilized, so collisions are an extremely goodindicator of network load. The number of collisions should be,at most, 15% of the total number of output packets. The only solutionfor this problem is to rearrange the network in a way that reducestraffic. Ethernet networks start to have significant collisionsat about 66.67% utilization, or 833375 bytes per second. You canmeasure collisions with a tool such as a Network General Sniffer.Note that Version 1.0 of Network Monitor does not report collisions.<P><A HREF="#BMarkHome">Document Contents</A><BR><HR><H1><A NAME="Capacity_Planning">Capacity Planning</A></H1><P>Now that you have your system optimized to where you are verycomfortable with its performance (today), it's time to start collectingdata that will help you in the future.

<BODY bgcolor=#ffffff>

<p>	
<blockquote>
This server is made available to distribute the Digital Internet Tunnel 
International Evaluation software kits.  This README file contains some
important information that will help you smoothly obtain, install, and use
the Digital Internet Tunnel.
<p>
Because the Digital Internet Tunnel contains encryption technology, it is 
regulated by the US Government, and may not be distributed without some 
controls.  The kit available on this server has been approved for international
distribution by the US Govenment, but with some restrictions.  To comply with 
these restrictions, you must EMAIL to Digital an <a href="request.html">
account request form. </a>  Turn-around on the form will be typically under 24
hours.  With the account and password, and a WEB browser that supports the 
account feature, you will be able to access the Tunnel kits on this server.
The passwords will change frequently, so you should grab the kits soon after 
receiving the account information.  This International Evaluation kit uses an RSA
based 40 bit RC-4 encryption key, and will expire on May 1, 1996.
<p>
With the account information, the <a href="/kits/tunnel/etunnel.exe"> 
PERSONAL </a> and the <a href="/kits/tunnel/DTU.tar"> GROUP </a> kits may
be down line loaded.  The Personal Tunnel kit is a self extracting ZIP file
and is about 1MB in size.  When extracted, the kit is under 1.4Mb, so will
fit on a DOS floppy.  The Group Tunnel kit is an uncompressed UNIX TAR file, and
is about 4.2 Megabytes.  You are accessing a server on a 56Kb Internet circuit 
closest to the Sprint backbone.  Please allow enough time for the copies to 
succeed.
<p>
It is very important to copy the <a href="tundocs.zip"> product documentation </a>
 and the <a href="trelnote.txt"> release notes. </a>  
These documents are not controlled by export regulations, so are available with
or without an account via this web server.  The product documentation is a 
Postscript file, and has been compressed with ZIP to 460Kb.  Expanded, it is
about a 12Mb file.  
<p>
The Digital Internet Tunnel kit is also available for $20 US on CD-ROM format.
The entire CD-ROM is available for browsing and copying files from on this 
server.  As with the kits, an account/password is required.  On the CD-ROM, you
will find additional software such as examples of distributing Tunnel Keys from
a web server, and instructions on how to build a secure tunnel proxy for your
firewall.  
<p>
The Personal Tunnel Client installs in minutes on a Windows 95 PC.  The UNIX
Group Tunnel Server takes about 15 minutes to install.  You need at least one
server to make use of the client.  Over the next few weeks (from December 18, 
1995) a demonstration server will be made available on this network to allow
you to get a look at the Tunnel Client in action without having to install a
server.  An automatic key generation application will be put up to allow you 
to get a key, and connect to a secured section of this web server.

<H1><EM>The Union</EM> History<HR NOSHADE></H1>



<I>The Union</I> has come a long way in its 133 years.<p> When the
newspaper was founded, October 28, 1864, the United States was in the
throes of its greatest crisis. The nation was fragmented and the Civil
War was raging.<p>

Publishers Townsend and Blumenthal threw their support behind the Union
and the president, Abraham Lincoln, struggling for re-election, by
naming the newspaper the <EM>Grass Valley Daily Morning Union</EM>. That
courageous act is memorialized in the newspaper's motto, "Founded in
1864 to preserve the Union--one and inseparable."<P>

That act took no small measure of courage because, while California
remained part of the Union, Confederate sympathesizers abounded in the
gold-mining town of Grass Valley. Street fights and gang wars between
the two factions were common. <P>

Townsend and Blumenthal's action proved prophetic. The Union prevailed
and so did <I>The Union</I> newspaper.<P>

Prior to 1910, some 25 other newspapers sprang up in Nevada County.
<EM>The Union</EM> has outlived them all.<P>

The first two years of the paper can only be described as hectic.
Ownership changed hands several times as did the paper's political
orientation.<P>

Charles H. Mitchell gained control of the paper in 1866 and stayed in
charge until his retirement 25 years later. In 1893 <EM>The Union</EM>
was sold to William F. Prisk, who edited it for the next 53 years. Also
in 1893, <EM>The Union</EM> was the first newspaper in the west to
contract with the Associated Press wire service--an association which
remains to this day.<P>

Prisk was to be the last single owner of the newspaper. In 1906 the
paper was incorporated but the staff remained the same. Incorporating
with Prisk were Henry Argall, Jo Snyder, Thomas Ingram and John
O'Neill. The families of these men were part of the newspaper until
1975.<P>

In April 1945 <I>The Union</I> made one its most momentous changes. A
morning daily paper for 81 years, the paper swung over to the afternoon
or evening field where it remains today.<P>

Prisk's long tenure ended in 1946 when Robert T. Ingram and Earl Caddy,
longtime staffers, bought out his interest. The retained control uneil
1968 when Nevada County Publishing Company bought <EM>The Union</EM>.
Ingram's son, R. Peter, remained as editor and publisher for seven
years. Jack S. Moorhead assumed that title in 1975, and after nineteen
years, retired in 1994. Margaret Wade</A> succeeded Jack at his
retirement in 1994.<P>

<EM>The Union</EM> had made some physical changes over the years as well.
Originally located at the corner of Mill and Main streets in Grass
Valley, the facility was moved in 1906 to 151 Mill Street. That
building accommodated a then-modern, but noisy, duplex press.<P>

The newspaper's last move was in 1978 to its current facilities in the
Glenbrook Basin on Sutton Way. The press was also updated to a nine
unit offset installation which features high-speed printing and
precision color and black and white printing. The paper's photo, news
and advertising staff compose the entire printed edition electronically.

<P>In June of 1995, <EM>The Union</EM> began experimenting with
publishing on the World Wide Web by putting stories on weekly. And, March
of '96, began publishing on the Web daily.
<P>
<EM>The Union</EM> has about 110 employees, 20 independent route drivers
and 80 news carriers. Its average net daily press run is 17,000.

<H2>Clerk-recorder suggests changes</H2>
<STRONG>By Tim Willis - Mon, Jan 6, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Nevada County's elections chief is recommending that supervisors change his job from an elected to appointed post to take the politics out of it.
<P>Clerk-Recorder Bruce Bolinger recommended the changes take place after he finishes his current term in January 1999, when he plans to retire.
<P>The Board of Supervisors will review Bolinger's proposal during its meeting Tuesday, which will begin at 9 a.m. in Board Chambers at the Rood Administrative Center, 950 Maidu Ave., Nevada City.
<P>Under the current system, the clerk-recorder must run for office every four years and is responsible for overseeing the very elections in which he or she is a candidate. That can create a conflict of interest, particularly if someone challenges the incumbent.
<P>As an elected official, Bolinger said he has been required to seek political support in his campaigns when the job really demands someone who is impartial. 
<P>Bolinger argued there are other good reasons for making the post an appointed one. Many of his duties have been transferred to other county departments over the years. The job of overseeing county elections also has become increasingly technical, he said.
<P>"The highly technical nature of elections and the need for the appearance of impartiality requires a professional to administer them, rather than someone selected through the political process," Bolinger said.
<P>He is recommending his election duties be given to a newly created post of registrar of voters and that his remaining clerk-recorder duties be transferred to the county assessor's office.
<P>Because the state legislature would have to approve the change, the county should get started on it now, Bolinger suggested.
<P>Meanwhile Bolinger, 60, said he is eager to move on. He has already been on the job 16 1/2 years. He was first appointed by supervisors to fill an unexpired term and was subsequently elected to the post four times.
<P>"I don't want them to carry me out of office," he quipped.
<P>During the meeting, supervisors will consider the following other matters:
<P>-- A resolution adopting revised rules of conduct for the Nevada County Planning Commission.
<P>-- An annual report on development fees from the Department of Transportation and Sanitation.
<P>-- A request from Terry McAteer, Nevada County superintendent of schools, to adjust voting boundaries for the superintendents of Placer and Nevada counties.
<P>Items for the afternoon session, beginning at 1:30 p.m., include:
<P>-- A study and environmental review involving closure of the county garbage dump on McCourtney Road.
<P>-- A resolution approving the Family & Youth Health & Human Services Council funding recommendations for the community services block grant for 1997.

(Photo by: John Hart)</FONT></CAPTION>
</TR></TABLE>

<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Much of Susan Lyon's living is buried under tons of sand, rock and river debris.
<P>The summertime camping season paid the bills the entire year, but the raging South Yuba River wiped out her source of income in a few hours Wednesday.
<P>Lyon owns the River Rest Resort in the town of Washington where the New Year's Day flood caused the heaviest damage in western Nevada County. On Saturday, Lyons and other flood victims were digging out and wondering what to do next.
<P>"We could use some cats down here to dig everything out ... some tractors," Lyon said.
<P>The upper half of Lyon's trailer park survived, but floodwaters destroyed the campgrounds on which she and her father, Ed Laplace, relied to draw summertime vacationers. She and her father bought the River Rest last March.
<P>"My father, he's 86, and he put every penny he ever had into the place. Now we're looking at walking away from it," Lyon said.
<P>She still has a home in the relatively unscathed upper part. Several other Washington residents don't even have that much. On Saturday, Grass Valley resident Sandy "Yokum" Scarbrough worked to retrieve what was left of her mother's property.
<P>As did a few other people in Washington, Scarbrough noted how the flood washed away more than homes and property.
<P>"We don't even know what day it is. The world could burn down right now and we wouldn't even know," Scarbrough said. "We're not watching the news anymore because we don't want to see any more water."
<P>The big problem in Washington this weekend was apparent to anyone who walked up to the bridge crossing the Yuba. Floodwaters blasted a gap in the bridge, stranding 80 to 90 people on the other side. Nevada County road workers were assessing the damage and hoping to erect a footbridge across the gap. 
<P>Supervisor Rene Antonson and Supervisor-elect Peter Van Zant arrived mid-afternoon to help coordinate delivery of food and water to cut-off residents, perhaps by stringing it across the river with a pulley.
<P>The flood blew out the town's reservoir, and residents on both sides of the river were left to either boil their drinking water or get it from a tanker truck parked at the post office.
<P>About 11 people who lost their homes along Maybert Road were evacuated Friday by Nevada County Sheriff's deputies, who took the long route through Malakoff Diggins State Park and Relief Hill Road - an estimated three-hour journey from Nevada City.
<P>Richard Parker lives 2 miles up Maybert Road and was contacted by telephone. He was worried about elderly people  being stranded, but the food supply was holding out. One concern for Parker and others along Maybert was fire protection - there is none. If a home catches fire, it could burn to the ground because there is no way to get fire trucks over the river from town.
<P>Parker had been expecting a propane delivery Friday. Instead, he was left keeping a close eye on his dwindling gas supply Saturday.
<P>"There's nothing you can do about it," Parker said about being stranded.
<P>Parker said he had been spending his time helping muck out his neighbor's home.
<P>"I was here in '86, and that was just an afternoon rain shower," Parker said. "The complexion of the river is a brand new person, so to speak."
<P>Boulders the size of school buses rolled down the river, he said.
<P>Back on the town side of the South Yuba, Lyon contemplated calling her lenders Monday to start recovering from the damage, which amounted to about half the $477,000 she and her father invested in the River Rest. Lyon said she hopes to get federal emergency relief money.
<P>The campground was littered with tangled piping and wiring and the scattered remains of a children's merry-go-round. The manager's trailer was smashed against a tree.
<P>Where there's hope, there's usually a sense of humor.
<P>"Well, we ought to have one hell of a swimming hole this summer," Lyon said.

<H2>County to get FEMA money</H2>
<STRONG>By Paul Harrar - Mon, Jan 6, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Federal emergency funds and other assistance were ordered Saturday by President Bill Clinton for Nevada County, one of 37 California counties declared a federal disaster area in the wake of last week's flooding.
<P>The president's declaration means residents and business owners hurt by the flooding may begin to apply for a variety of loans and grants to repair damage.
<P>Applicants should immediately call the Federal Emergency Management Agency at 1(800) 462-9029 to register for assistance. Applicants may need to leave a phone number where FEMA officials can contact them.
<P>In conjunction with state and local efforts, disaster assistance will be offered in several forms:
<P>-- Low interest loans to cover expenses not covered by state or local programs, or insurance. Loans are available to individuals, families and businesses, including farms.
<P>-- Cash grants for up to $12,900.
<P>-- Housing assistance in the form of financial aid.
<P>-- Emergency funds for veterans from the federal Department of Veterans' Affairs.
<P>-- Unemployment benefits through the state unemployment office and federal Department of Labor.
<P>-- Tax refunds in the form of federal tax deductions for casualty losses.
<P>-- Legal and crisis counseling.
<P>FEMA representatives are expected to be in Nevada County early this week, according to Tom Coburn of the Nevada County office of emergency services. FEMA representatives will personally visit properties to assess damage and financial needs.
<P>FEMA will likely set up a temporary office at the Rood Center in Nevada City to interview flood victims, but arrangements for that have not yet been made, Coburn said.
<P>Anyone in the federally designated disaster area with property damage and flood-related financial needs may apply for disaster relief. The county will apply for federal emergency funds to repair the Washington bridge and other infrastructure damaged by the flooding, Coburn said. 
<P>Some immediate financial aid may be available for temporary housing for those whose homes are inhabitable, Coburn said. The county housing office also may be able to provide emergency assistance to homeless flood victims, he said. Applicants should call 265-7288 for more information.
<P>County officials this morning were trying to assess the county's private and public losses. Coburn said county officials have made a "rough estimate" of $10 million in losses.
<P>County supervisors Tuesday morning are scheduled to receive a report on the flooding, which local officials estimate damaged between 40 and 50 homes, businesses and other structures.
<P>Coburn could not estimate how quickly disaster relief might be received by victims. He said FEMA will likely mobilize quickly because there are no other major federal disaster areas other than the western states are affected by the flooding.

<P>My name is Pat Devereux, and I have been at The Union for 10 years.
I began doing page paste-up here but transferred to a copy editor
position about four years ago. Since then we have abandoned our hand
paste-up process and, in my new position, I do all the layout and color
work on the computer. 

<P>I moved to Nevada County from Berkeley 16 years
ago. I have worked locally on The Western Slopes Connection, The Nevada
County Mountain Messenger, The Colfax Record, The Auburn Journal and
The Roseville Press Tribune before The Union. I own a small house off
Greenhorn Road on 10 acres on a bad dirt road. I share it with five
cats and many, many deer and raccoons. I'm 41. 

<P>I have a BA degree in
English literature from UC Berkeley and have continued my education at
Sierra College with natural-history and liberal arts classes; last
semester I took a humanities class. I use the Spanish I learned at
Sierra when I travel to Latin America every few years. I've been to
several areas of Mexico and to Peru, Guatemala, Costa Rica and
Honduras, hiking, snorkeling and, most importantly, visiting
Mesoamerican ruins - one of my passions. I've also spent a fair amount
of time in our Southwest backpacking, camping and viewing Anasazi ruins
and petroglyphs. <P>
<IMG ALIGN=LEFT SRC="patbig.gif" hspace=5 HEIGHT=179 width=155>

I write a monthly hiking column for The Union's
outdoor page and an occasional outdoors feature. I belong to the Nevada
County Hiking Club, Nordic Skiers of Nevada County, the Sierra Nevada
Group of the Sierra Club, Bicyclists of Nevada County and Desert
Survivors. I am also a member of Nevada County Citizens for Choice and
my United Way recipient is the Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault
Coalition. 

<P>You might say I'm an outdoor freak: camping, hiking,
backpacking, canoeing, kayaking, free climbing and "peak-bagging,"
swimming in the Yuba, cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and mountain
biking.
<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<P><HR NOSHADE WIDTH=40%><P>
My business card says "copy editor." When I
tell people I'm an editor at The Union they invariably say, "Really, what kind of
stories do you write?" I've learned that most people don't know the
difference between a writer and an editor - that an editor corrects and
amends and, in some cases, rewrites the copy submitted by writers
before you see it in print. 

<P>As a  copy editor, I must know correct
usage of English spelling, punctuation, parts of speech, etc. As such,
I refer to my dictionary probably six to 10 times before deadline every
morning. In addition to the dictionary, I must constantly refer to the
Associated Press "Stylebook and Libel Manual" because newspaper English
differs from standard usage, even some of its punctuation rules. 

<P>In a typical morning I may ask myself these type of questions: is the
adjective "life threatening" one word or two - or hyphenated? is
"longtime" - or "longterm" or "lifelong" - one word, two words or
hyphenated? is "travelled" the British or American spelling, and which
spelling is correct for a newspaper? what is the correct spelling of
"eenie, meenie, miney, mo?", which adrenalin has an "e" on its end, the
product or the glandular secretion? are dumpster, laundromat and weed
whacker brand names and thus capitalized? what's the difference between
"small business owners" and "small-business owners"? is it OK to use
the acronym FBI on a first reference in a story but not to use IRS? is
driver's license singular possessive or plural possessive - what about
workmen's comp or Veterans Building? what is the full name of Cal Poly
university? when do you use "its" or "it's"? does the semicolon go
outside a quotation mark? (You're reaching for your dictionary now,
aren't you?) 

<P>In addition to the Ps and Qs of language and basic
elements of AP stories, I must know local facts: which county
supervisor represents each district? what is Terry McAteer's official
title? what do PRIDE, IDGAS and FREED stand for? who is the county's
chief election official or its tax collector? what is the correct name
of Grass Valley Group since it was absorbed into Tektronix? What is the
official name of the new Sierra College campus in Grass Valley - who is
its dean? what is the correct spelling of a small town in Iowa in a
local obituary? who is the presiding judge of the Superior Court? does
Christine Wilcox Foster hyphenate her last name? 

<P>As a copy editor I
also "lay out" several sections and pages: the Saturday business
section; Senior Life; page A3; the garden, clubs and wedding pages; and
most of the front section on Saturdays. I must decide what stories run
on which pages and where - select the content and photos for and decide
the design of the pages. In this capacity I consult with city editor
Paul Shigley, graphic designer Tom Harbert, the reporters, the
photographers and several free-lance columnists. I also write headlines
and photo captions for pages, including many I do not lay out. <P>

So, the
public's question "What kind of stories do you write?" should be "What
kind of stories do you rewrite?" or "What kind of errors do you catch
in stories others write?" A copy editor's glory is more of a personal
triumph than the glamour of a reporter's page 1 byline or a
photographer's photo credit. I work behind the scenes to ensure
accuracy and consistency, but you'll rarely see my name in print.


<P>CUTLINES- #1- I was an assistant leader on a national Sierra Club
backpack trip in Idaho's Sawtooth Mountains in September 1995.

<P>#2- In September 1994, I "bagged" 14, 200-foot Mt. Russell, reached
by the mountaineers' route up Mt. Whitney.

<P>Hey sports readers!</P>

<P>Thanks for your interest in me, my professional background and life
away from the newsroom and the games.</P>

<P>Because of technological progress and the inevitable invasion of
privacy, I figured you would eventually find out everything you wanted
to know about me anyway. This will hopefully save you the research.</P>

<P>The question I'm most asked, especially by high school kids, is "How
did you get to become a sportswriter?"</P>

<P>Well, frankly, it all started with bad grades. Yes, C's and D's in
most of my engineering and science classes during my first two years of
college at Diablo Valley Community College in the Bay Area. My father
and two oldest brothers all graduated with engineering degrees, so I
tried it. But the grades told me this wasn't my calling. I had always
liked writing - letters, shorts stories, poetry - and people from all
walks of life.</P>

<P>So it wasn't long before I joined the sports staff of the DVC
newspaper and took my first semester of journalism classes.</P>

<P>I then transferred to <A
HREF="http://sorrel.humboldt.edu/~humboldt/index.html">Humboldt
State</A><IMG SRC="../graphics/qbullets/Qremote.gif" HEIGHT=11 WIDTH=11>
with journalism classes I worked for the school's "Lumberjack"
newspaper as a sports writer, sports editor and general photographer. Working for the college paper wasn't required, but it proved at least as valuable as my classes once I took my
journalism degree into the real world and looked for a job.</P>

<P>I got my first journalism job at the Contra Costa Times in Walnut
Creek, working as a "correspondent". There were about five of us hired
just for that spring of 1989, part-time, covering high school sports 
or "preps," as the business lingo goes.</P>

<P>When I was let go just before summer of 1989, I got a full-time job
writing sports for a weekly paper across town called the Concord
Transcript. In the spring of 1990, I worked at both the Times, as a
correspondent, and the Transcript.</P>

<P>That summer, I sent 17 resumes all over California, and the first
response came from Kyle Orr, then the sports editor at The Union. I had
never been to, nor heard of, Grass Valley before I came up for the
interview. Ill never forget my first drive up 49, feeling like I was
entering a national park. Well, eventually, Kyle called back and said,
You got the job if you want it. And so it all began.</P>

<P>Sports is not my primary interest in life. Eventually, I hope to
move on to science writing, either for a newspaper or a magazine. I am
still intrigued by science despite my bad grades way back when. I think
thats the wave of the future in journalism. Somebodys going to have to
explain all of these technological advances to laypeople.</P>

<P>My hobbies include music, jogging, working out at a fitness club,
golf, poetry, photography and drawing. I enjoy playing guitar and piano
(synthesizer), and I still have a drum set that I occasionally pull
out. Even more relaxing is jogging, breathing in the clean foothill air
and taking in the scenery while listening to my favorite type of rock
music. Most call it alternative, but the alternative I like is best
classified as "power pop.</P>

<P>My favorite groups include the Beatles and the rest of the British
Invasion groups of the 60s, REM (the Beatles of my generation) and
anything else you can whistle to or tap your foot to. Actually, my
favorite rock groups are Teenage Fanclub, Smithereens, the Greenberry
Woods, Velvet Crush, Cavedogs, Insomniacs, Spongetones and
Sugarplastic, but most people have never heard of those.</P>

<P>I also like Johnny Cash and Metallica, bluegrass and new age.</P>

<P>Some other things you might want to know:</P>

<P>I turned 30 on Nov. 29</P>

<P>I was born in Philadelphia, moved to northeast Ohio when I was 3,
lived there until I was 17, moved to Walnut Creek, Calif. for my senior
year of high school, and graduated from Northgate High there in
1984.</P>

<P>I played baseball (pitcher, center fielder) and golf at my Ohio high
school. I tried out for the Northgate baseball team as a pitcher, but
got cut when the wrestlers and basketball studs came out late.</P>

<P>My brother was the star tailback in high school, and I look back on
his and my prep careers all the time when I write about Nevada Union
and Bear River teams.</P>

<P>Some of my favorite moments since Ive been here include the 1992 NU
baseball teams and 1993-94 NU boys basketball teams league-championship
campaigns. Ive never had so many stories write themselves. The 1993 NU
football team's run to their school's first section title was one
blowout after another. But after watching the Miners lose the 1990
section title game to Merced, and hearing about the 1989 loss to the
same team, it was almost as emotional for me as for the players.</P>

<P>The community support for the girls basketball teams here have
probably been the most eye-opening experience for me here as far as
high school sports go. No area in which I've lived - from Ohio to
Northwest California to the Bay Area - has had near the following of
the Lady Miners, Lady Bruins or Lady Falcons of Forest Lake and
Colfax.</P>

<P>I enjoy all the working relationships I have with kids, their
parents, coaches and the people outside high school sports in this
community. It's a great place to be a sports writer.</P>

<P>I hope you're as excited about our local teams and athletes as I am.
Thanks for reading.</P>

<H2>Mother finds Good Sams who saved her daughter</H2>
<STRONG>By Tim Willis - Wed, Jan 1, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->A Yuba City woman searching for the Good Samaritans who helped her daughter after a car accident near Penn Valley has located three of them.
<P>Stephanie Ruscigno contacted The Union newspaper after her daughter's Dec. 20 accident in an effort to thank them for helping her daughter. Friends of the Samaritans saw the story and supplied Ruscigno with the helpful strangers' names and telephone numbers.
<P>"People who stop and do something never know if they make a difference," Ruscigno said. "I would like them to know that maybe the next time they help, someone will thank them."
<P>Ruscigno's daughter, Jennifer, 19, who lives with her mother in Yuba City, is recuperating at home. She received more than 40 stitches for facial cuts and could require plastic surgery. However, she recently had the stitches removed and some of the swelling has subsided., Ruscigno said.
<P>It was raining the night of the accident. As Jennifer drove home about 10 p.m. along Highway 20 from Nevada City, she lost control of her vehicle near Pleasant Valley Road. The car slid over the center line and down an embankment, about 75 to 100 feet from the roadway. Ruscigno believes her daughter, who was wearing a seat belt, was saved because her car had an air bag.
<P>Jennifer was bleeding profusely and in danger of going into shock or developing hypothermia from the cold rainy weather, Ruscigno said. Though injured, Jennifer managed to hike up the steep embankment.
<P>Tom Williams of Rough and Ready was driving northbound on the highway when he spotted something in the corner of his eye and stopped the vehicle.

<P>Ruscigno had thought Williams, and possibly other bystanders, had helped her daughter up the embankment. Actually, Williams said the girl had hiked up by herself but couldn't get vehicles to stop and help her. He said that was probably because people typically drive swiftly past that point to gain speed for an uphill stretch of highway.
<P>"I'm just glad I stopped," Williams said.
<P>He flagged down a second vehicle, which had a cellular phone. Then a third vehicle pulled over to assist. In the third vehicle was Tena Wilkerson, a Grass Valley nurse, who was able to assist Jennifer until an ambulance arrived. Wilkerson could not be reached for comment.
<P>These days, only one big problem remains, Ruscigno said.
<P>"How do you say thank you for saving your only daughter's life?" she explained.
<P>

<H2>Idaho-Maryland Mine expands local holdings</H2>
<STRONG>By David Sneed - Tue, Dec 31, 1996</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Emperor Gold Corp. has added 13 acres to its Idaho-Maryland Mine properties.
<P>The new parcel is within the city of Grass Valley and contains the Round Hole Shaft, also known as Idaho Shaft No. 2. The shaft is over a portion of the mine that produced about 700,000 ounces of gold before the mine closed in 1959, said Ross Guenther, project manager.
<P>"Historical maps and core drilling indicate resources of at least 500,000 ounces of gold with a potential that is much greater," he said Monday.
<P>The parcel is bordered on three sides by Brunswick and Idaho-Maryland roads and Whispering Pines Lane. Emperor purchased the land from SF Properties, Inc. of Anaheim for $250,000, Guenther said.
<P>Early next year, Emperor plans to rehabilitate the New Brunswick Shaft, which is on the company's 117-acres at Brunswick and East Bennett roads. In April, the company plans to drain the mine in preparation for exploration to determine if mining for an estimated 3 million ounces of gold is feasible.
<P>The Round Hole Shaft connects to the underground workings on several levels and could be used for ventilation or as an additional access point for ore sampling or water level monitoring. The company would need to get permits for those activities, Guenther said.
<P>The Round Hole Shaft was sunk in 1935 to a depth of 1,125 feet using an innovative boring technique that produced solid, cylindrical 5-foot-diameter chunks of rock. Chunks of that core are on display at Empire Mine State Historic Park, Calanan Park in Nevada City, the Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park in Coloma and San Andreas, Guenther said.

<H2>NC Council names Planning Commision choices</H2>
<STRONG>By Susan Lauer - Wed, Jan 1, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->The names of four of five new members for the Nevada City Planning Commission have been released.
<P>Under a measure agreed upon by the City Council in November, each councilmember will select his commissioner without having to obtain approval by the entire panel.
<P>Mayor Harry Stewart chose Jim Rose, who has been active in the Nevada County Historical Landmarks Commission. Paul Matson selected former City Councilwoman Laurie Oberholtzer. Sharon Tobiassen chose David Fluke, the owner of a bed-and-breakfast inn. Tom Balch named Denis Kutch, an architect who has served on the interim planning commission.
<P>There are no set terms of office. The planning commissioners will serve at the discretion of the councilmembers who made the appointments.
<P>Councilman Steve Cottrell has yet to name his selection, according to City Clerk Cathy Wilcox-Barnes.
<P>Each appointee must be cleared for any conflict-of-interest problems before taking office, Wilcox-Barnes said.
<P>The new Planning Commission will be sworn in mid-month  during the next City Council meeting.
<P>The panel meets twice a month, although it will miss the first monthly meeting this month while awaiting the swearing-in ceremony.
<P>"There is nothing pressing (regarding planning issues) at the moment," Stewart said.
<P>The new commission will meet Jan. 30.
<P>In September, an interim five-member planning commission was appointed to replace four commissioners who resigned in August and one commissioner whose term the council had allowed to expire. Members of the City Council first elected in March - Stewart, Balch and Tobiassen - expressed displeasure with the Planning Commission for nitpicking apart applications and slowing the development approval process.
<P>The commission handles applications for commercial and residential development and proposed building changes in the downtown historical district.

<H2>Sierra Homes: The sink/counter connection - Lots of choices for the combination you want </H2>
<STRONG>By Karen Austin - Fri, Jan 3, 1997</STRONG><P>

<!-- story -->Do you find the term "Huddee rim" (pronounced hoo-di) as funny as most of my clients do when they first hear it?
<P>That's the flat, metal ring that surrounds and covers the junction of the sink and counter in past installations. I can tell you that no one uses Huddee rims in their kitchen anymore, but I often see them in kitchens that are slated for remodeling.
<P>Nowadays, sinks are joined with counters in lots of creative ways. And they clean up far better than with the old-fashioned rims - where the two edges of the rim let in and catch water, food and grime. 
<P>The ways sinks can be joined with counters are varied. Self-rimming, undermount, tile-in, and integral are different techniques used to connect the sink to the countertop. In addition, the sink choice you make can often dictate (and sometimes limit) your countertop choice.
<P>Self-rimming: This is the type of sink that has a raised rim that lips over the sink opening. The sink can be made from enameled cast-iron stainless steel, or a solid-surface material (like Corian or a relatively new composite "granite-look" product). This type of sink can be used with all kinds of counters. It works great with ceramic tile, plastic laminate, solid surface, natural stone, or wood. This is the most common application used in American kitchens.
<P>Undermount: This is a new way of installing sinks that eliminates that catch-all rim found on self-rimming sinks. This sink is installed from underneath the counter and held in place with a series of mounting screws. Since the edges of the counter's sink opening is exposed, you can't use a plastic laminate counter. It works best with solid-surface or natural-stone counters. Sometimes, a little-used bar sink can be undermounted to a wood counter if the exposed end-grain edges are well sealed. Moisture can be absorbed by the wood and cause it to swell and buckle. The most common undermount sink is stainless steel, but often other metal sinks are used for show, such as brass or copper. Solid-surface sinks also can be undermounted.
<P>Tile-in: (also called "flush")This is an enameled cast-iron sink designed to be installed with ceramic tile. Instead of a lipped edge, the sink has flat, squared-off edges that will receive tile right up next to it. They form a wonderfully smooth surface that makes cleaning up a breeze. The sink and counter essentially work together as one unit. This technique, however, is limited to pairing up ceramic tile counters with enameled cast-iron sinks.
<P>Integral: This has been found in bathroom cultured-marbled applications for a long time, but now are gaining popularity in the kitchen, using solid-surface products. Corian, Gibraltar, Avonite and Swanstone are some of the manufacturers that make sinks form their countertop material and offer a one-piece, formed unit that is the ultimate in cleanability. They are seamless, stain-resistant, repairable, and have color all the way through. Not all countertop colors are available in sinks, though, so you may have to choose a white sink to be integrated with a contrasting countertop color. As the demand grows, however, manufacturers are offering more and more sinks in companion colors to match up with their countertops.
<P>When you are ready to start thinking about sinks and countertops for your new kitchen (and ditch that Huddee rim) remember that you may have to choose which features are the more important of the two. You may decide that an undermounted, triple-stainless steel sink is the only one you'll consider, so you won't spend time checking out the plastic laminate color samples. Or maybe you've been dreaming of a bright-blue sink to go with your dishware collection. Most likely though you'll end up with a self-rimming, enameled cast-iron sink. Think your priorities carefully through, and you'll be able to make the right choices.

<H2>The Master Gardener: January - Prune, spray and divide</H2>
<STRONG>By Beverly Butler - Fri, Jan 3, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->-- Continue to care for holiday gift plants. Water regularly and fertilize lightly every three to four weeks.
<P>-- Move your live Christmas tree outdoors. Rinse off the foliage and thoroughly soak the soil. If the tree is root-bound, now is a good time to transplant it to a larger pot.
<P>-- Prune deciduous fruit trees, grapes, roses and shade trees. Wait to prune spring-flowering plants until after they bloom. Cut back hydrangeas.
<P>-- Prepare planting beds for bare-root planting. This is a great month to guy dormant fruit and shade trees, roses, shrubs, vines, berries, grapes, artichokes and asparagus.
<P>-- Divide overcrowded perennials.
<P>-- Divide daylilies and hostas later in the month.
<P>-- Protect plants from frost by covering them, or by moving container plants to warmer, protected areas.
<P>-- Dormant spraying of fruit trees and ornamentals should be completed before their buds open. Apply only when weather will be dry at least 24 hours.
<P>-- Dormant-spray apricots, almonds, cherries, plums and prunes with fixed copper for shothole fungus, brown rot and twig blight. For peach leaf curl on peaches and nectarines, spray with lime sprays or fixed copper as leaf buds begin to swell. Do not apply lime sulphur to apricots. Use dormant oil on fruit trees, shrubs, and citrus to control mites, scales and aphids.
<P>-- Rake dead leaves and debris from beneath trees and shrubs.
<P>-- Now is the time to review your garden plans for the new year. Collect seed catalogs and make plans for purchasing those  "interesting varieties." Order as soon as you can so that you have ample time to sow vegetable and flower seeds in flats indoors.
<P>-- This is also a good time to check out your garden tools. Sharpen pruning shears, saws, edges of shovels and spades. After sharpening, clean them and rub them with a light coating of machine oil.
<P>Happy New Gardening Year!

<H2>Footloose in the Foothills: Wilderness ethics - Beyond "Pack it in, pack it out" </H2>
<STRONG>By <A HREF="../people/biodevereux.html"> Pat Devereux</A> - Thu, Jan 2, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->"Thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home: that wildness is a necessity ..." - John Muir
<P>"Wilderness may be used and enjoyed by such means and in such manner as will leave it unimpaired for future generations." - Richard M. Leonard

<P>It's 5 p.m., and you've hiked 10 miles today. Your 35-pound pack has mysteriously metamorphosed into 70 pounds. Mercifully, your companion says, "Well, I reckon it's about time to look for a campsite." You spot a clearing through the trees and make a beeline for it, unbuckling your waistband in anticipation of dropping the pack. Then stop in your tracks ...
<P> A fire ring is still smoking with the remains of last night's   bonfire. Abandoned plastic rope hangs from large nails randomly hammered into trees, and a live branch shows fresh axe marks. Cans, plastic bags and broken glass are strewn about. And every rock within 100 feet has a frill of toilet paper coyly peeking out from under it.
<P>This is becoming an all-too familiar scenario for backcountry visitors. The ability of wild places to recover from damage decreases dramatically with increased use. Because wilderness use continues to grow, practices that were once acceptable can no longer be sustained. As such, these practices must be continually refined to minimize impact. 
<P>Good wilderness ethics, or manners, are universal concepts for all outdoors users. Minimizing impact depends on attitude and awareness, judgment and experience, as well as a site's soil, vegetation, moisture levels and prior use. 
<P>The following principles are some of the guidelines of the National Outdoor Leadership School educational program, "Leave No Trace" (1-800-332-4100):
<P>-- Know the area and what to expect, including weather, crowding and type of terrain. Plan for enough daylight and energy to select a site carefully - fatigue, bad weather and lateness are no excuse for choosing a poor or ecologically fragile site. Camp in existing campsites rather than impact a new area. If you must establish a new site, make it at least 200 feet from water and trails (a ranger will now cite you if you don't) on a durable surface, such as rock or sand, with no vegetation. Erase as many signs of your impact as possible when you leave. 
<P>-- Minimize the use of fires. In the past, building a huge "white man's" blaze was de rigueur.  Aside from the fact that it's illegal in most backcountry areas now to make a fire, it's simply uncool to risk starting a wildfire or to deny soils and animals the decomposing timber they need for regeneration and shelter. If you must build a fire, use pre-existing fire rings but don't create a new ring. Build a small fire on as nonporous a surface as possible, extinguish it completely (until you can put your hand on it) then broadcast the ashes.
<P>-- Hike only on existing trails to minimize impact on soils and wildlife. Never cut across trail switchbacks. Nothing burns my bacon like the sight of someone careening down a hill causing erosion and destroying plants just to save a few minutes and distance on the trail.
<P>-- Avoid damaging live trees and plants. Do not remove deadwood from a living tree and don't, for heaven's sake, chop on a live one for firewood. Don't pick wildflowers - few people know that this is a misdemeanor in California.
<P>-- Leave natural and cultural artifacts in place. This is one of the toughest to follow - I confess to having an extensive collection of illegally harvested bones and animal parts. The federal Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979  makes it illegal to remove cultural (i.e., manmade, often prehistoric) artifacts and fossils from a site. Regardless of legality, leave objects of beauty or interest where you find them so others may enjoy them and study them.
<P>In Utah this fall I saw the two extremes of this ethos. In the backcountry of Grand Gulch National Monument, Chris and I found 800-to-1,000-year-old Anasazi corncobs, pottery shards and stone walls unmolested and lying in the open after many conscientious hikers had examined them. But later, we camped in an Anasazi shelter cave in Canyonlands, the floor of which was pockmarked with pits dug by "pot hunters" hoping to get rich quick with a pottery find. And - gee, what a surprise! - they had left a big pile of garbage.
<P>-- Keep cooking and waste water away from water sources. How many times have I gone down to a pristine lake and seen the remains someone's macaroni-and-cheese dinner floating in the shallows? Or seen chips of their Ivory soap ground into the shoreline? The correct way to wash dishes in the woods is to dip out the necessary water into a pot or collapsible bucket. Carry it away from the water's edge for at least 100 feet. Use a minimum amount of biodegradable soap then broadcast the water, so the soap breaks down biologically before it percolates back into the water. The same goes for personal washing; many times I've taken a bath out of my Sierra Club cup with my bandana corner rather than dump soap into the lake during a full-body scrub.
<P>-- Carry out all garbage. This seems like common sense but is rarely strictly adhered to. Plan menus so there are few leftovers. The old practices of burning or burying leftovers don't cut it anymore. Few backcountry areas allow fires now, and animals simply dig up buried food, which interferes with their natural nutrition and causes them to become too habituated to people as a food source. Don't burn aluminum; I'll find it in the ashes 10 years from now..
<P>-- And now we come to that most delicate of subjects, disposal of human waste ... When I began backpacking the Sierra in 1970, I thought nothing of dipping my cup into a stream for a cold drink.  I've only done that one time in the last 20 or so years, at 13,000-plus feet and in desperation. Increased wildlands use by both humans and livestock has caused an epidemic of giardia and fecal parasites, therefore it is imperative that we properly dispose of our bodily wastes. Pack out all toilet paper. If you're squeamish about putting your used TP in a Baggie then back in your pocket, try adding a few drops of chlorine bleach to the bag before leaving home to reduce its odor. Urine is made up of basically sterile salts and has little impact on vegetation and soils. But feces should be buried in 6-to-8-inch-deep "catholes," even if it slows down its decomposition. Forest fires have been started by the old practice of burning toilet paper, and buried paper doesn't decompose properly. Pathogens can survive for over a year, so locate your cathole at least 200 feet from water or campsites. Disguise catholes when done - and don't just plop a rock on top of your waste in lieu of burying it. 
<P>-- Finally, a personal pet peeve: Remember that most people visit the wilderness to escape noise. Why would you think that everyone in the campground shares your taste in the music blasting from your car stereo, be it Bach or Bachman Turner Overdrive?
<P>By following these rules and common sense, you can set a good example for others every time you set foot in the backcountry.

<H2>Musings: Life ticks away unnoticed</H2>
<STRONG>By Susan Lauer - Wed, Jan 1, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->The best part of New Year's Day is its essence: try again.
<P>Last night, as I gathered with friends, counting down to 1997, I remembered that life isn't measured by a series of paychecks, a rush of months and seasons. Every tick of the clock represented a breath, a thought, a chance to try again.
<P>That's the purpose of New Year's. 
<P>That's why we toss out the old calendar and unwrap a new one. That's why we shout at the top of our lungs, "Ten, nine, eight...."
<P>The trick is to remember the message of New Year's some 12 hours later, before the aspirin and Alka-Seltzer has had a chance to erase the blur of the night before, and we begin our rush into the future again.
<P>A friend of mine gauges her life by trips to the mirror. She is fond of saying, "At the end of the day when you look at the face in the mirror, all there is is you."
<P>If you like what you see, it's been a good day. If that face staring back is haggard, stressed, or downright ugly, the next day is a chance to improve.
<P>An old clockmaker in my hometown used to wind every clock in his shop and sit back to listen to each one tick-tick-ticking the day away. Whenever I'd walk from school past his shop, I'd peek in the window, and there he would be, sitting and listening to the ticks. It was nerve-wracking to me, but obviously satisfying to him.
<P>Perhaps the idea should be to boil life down to clock-ticks, a step-by-step process in which there are as many opportunities as the seconds in each hour - or 86,400 ticks each day.
<P>Some ticks are better than others, and at times thousands - millions - of ticks count off feelings of sadness, anger and misery. But, there's always another tick, and it may be better than the rest.
<P>With the new year, I'm taking to heart the gist of the day and will try again. Forget last year's mistakes, humiliations, failures and follies. All that made life difficult and weary throughout 1996 is gone. 
<P>Now I've replaced the batteries on my wristwatch and wound all the clocks in my house. I am jumping into 1997 undaunted and enthusiastically, with the promise to myself to listen to the clock-ticks along the way.

<H2>Vector settle dispute with county</H2>
<STRONG>By Tim Willis - Wed, Jan 1, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Vector Engineering settled with Nevada County and other companies over a solid-waste contract, heading off a lawsuit threatened by Vector.
<P>Under terms of the agreement, released Monday, Vector Engineering will receive $25,000 for its legal and other costs from the county and three companies involved in the contract.
<P>The dispute concerns Nevada County supervisors' decision in March to award a $205,000 contract to Holdrege & Kull Consulting Engineers & Geologists for technical assistance on solid-waste operations.
<P>Vector complained that the decision was improper because Holdrege & Kull represented a consortium of engineers that included Sylvester Engineering, whose president, Ed Sylvester, was a member of the county's solid-waste planning and review committee. Three other members served on a subcommittee that ranked Holdrege & Kull's proposal ahead of one submitted by Vector.
<P>Vector President Mark Smith, who cited other conflicts in the contracts, threatened a lawsuit if the contract was not rescinded and re-awarded. He could not be reached for comment regarding the settlement.
<P>Sylvester argued he tried to deal with the issue fairly at the time by not participating in the action to recommend the contract to the supervisors and by quitting the committee to avoid a conflict of interest. The agreement itself also notes the complaint was referred to the state attorney general's office, which determined prosecution of the case was unnecessary.
<P>Sylvester said he is happy to have the matter resolved.
<P>"It is unfortunate to have ever happened in the first place," Sylvester said. "Certainly we are glad it is over. We would rather put our energies and money into something more productive than that."
<P>Under the agreement, Holdrege & Kull, Sylvester Engineering and another subcontractor, Minshew Engineering, each will pay Vector $6,250.
<P>Part of the original contract includes work on the closure of the county landfill on McCourtney Road. County Counsel James Flageollet noted the agreement allows the county to move forward with the closure, as mandated by the state. The county hopes to finish the job by the end of 1997. Failure to do so could lead to state sanctions, he explained.
<P>"The penalties could far exceed the $6,250 contribution by the county," Flageollet said.
<P>The agreement itself also cites a desire by the paying parties to avoid the expense and time of a lawsuit from Vector.
<P>The agreement calls for the original contract to be terminated by Jan. 15 and for the county to review its procedures for awarding professional services contracts. Flageollet stressed, however, that most of the work on the contract was complete and that what was left could be completed by county staff or, per the agreement, rebid. He added that the county had already intended to review its contracting procedures before inking the settlement agreement.
<P>Representatives from Holdrege & Kull could not be reached for comment.

<H2>Board circulate housing plan </H2>
<STRONG>By The Union Staff - Tue, Dec 31, 1996</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->The Board of Supervisors, after reviewing an alternative housing proposal earlier this month, has directed the plan be distributed to all interested parties for review and written comment by Feb. 28.
<P>The proposal will be returned to the board in March.
<P>The plan would allow a wider range of housing options and relax some county rules if certain minimal standards are met, particularly those for health and safety. For example, the proposal would allow recreational vehicles to be used as owner-occupied residences in some areas.
<P>Members of the public may review the proposal at the supervisor's office at the Rood Administrative Center, 950 Maidu Ave., Nevada City, or at any county library branch. Copies of the proposal also are available for purchase at the board office, or at the House of Print and Copy, 11501 Nevada City Highway, Grass Valley.

<H2>The Artists: Brenda McCoy - Painter</H2>
<STRONG>By Paul Harrar - Fri, Jan 3, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Brenda McCoy says she never had much trouble becoming an accomplished painter. It came naturally.
<P>"I've been drawing since I was 5. It's a natural ability," she said. "I moved faster than my art teachers wanted me to.  By the time I was in high school, I had moved past that level."
<P>The 30-year-old Grass Valley computer software writer is lucky to have fine art flow so easily from her paintbrush. Although blessed with natural artistic talent, McCoy is legally blind in one eye and has partial vision in the other. Her partial blindness has made depth perception impossible. That is a serious problem for an artist who paints three-dimensionally.
<P>"I have what's called an artist's eye, which gives me an ability to add depth to my paintings," she explained.
<P>McCoy thinks she became absorbed in art as a child because she couldn't play sports or other activities. Favoring pastels and large canvas paintings, McCoy paints in her spare time. She enjoys painting portraits and science-fiction scenes.
<P>"It comes in spurts. I finish maybe one or two (paintings) a year and probably start a dozen," she said with a laugh.

<H2>When women ruled the Earth: Group examines matriarchal societies</H2>
<STRONG>By David Sneed - Thu, Jan 2, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->For centuries, people have been grappling with serious ethical questions.
<P>Why do we persecute each other?
<P>Why is our world so full of man's infamous inhumanity to man and woman?
<P>How can a human being be so brutal to its own kind?
<P>What is it that chronically tilts us to cruelty rather than kindness, toward war rather than peace?
<P>A group of about 10 Nevada and Yuba county women are examining the earliest periods of human history and the role gender may play to find answers to those questions. The group does not have an official name, but it has been meeting monthly for more than a year, said member Carolyn Mumm of Camptonville.
<P>Most of the women are Unitarian Universalists, and they started by using the church's program, "Rise Up and Call Her Name." They have used other source books, videos and music.
<P>"I feel like it's been a really heart-opening kind of experience for me," Mumm said. "It has also been something that has widened my world and my outlook on things."
<P>The book, "The Chalice and the Blade," by Riane Eisler, forms much of the basis of the group's studies. History indicates that humanity was not always as aggressive and warlike as it is today.
<P>There is a strong probability that women were the leaders in antiquity as well as in neolithic and paleolithic times. Cave paintings indicate that women were goddesses and leaders who helped hold civilization together, Mumm said.
<P>According to Eisler's book, when women were the heads of societies, there were no armies. Religions were Earth-based, natural and spiritual, much like the approach of Native American populations.
<P>These civilizations were based on partnerships rather than domination. Life, Eisler says, after all, springs from a woman's womb, and women, by nature, tend to be nurturing and nonconfrontational.
<P>"That's something that we need very badly in our world today," Mumm said.
<P>Crete was the last and longest-lasting of these so-called goddess civilizations. Its cities were built in circular patterns and not designed to be defensive, Mumm said. 
<P>At some point, humans shifted away from worshiping the life-generating and nurturing powers. Societies that promote sexual equality, no matter what culture, are more peaceful, according to the book.
<P>Eisler argues in her book that today's movements, such as New Age and environmentalism, are attempts to move from domination to partnership. She further argues that today's violence, war and general breakdown of society are caused by the dominator model.
<P>The women in the group study these ideas and try to enlarge upon and personalize them in their own lives and experiences, said Mary Thelander, another member. They have looked at how women can work for partnerships in their relationships as well as in the world as a whole.
<P>Thelander said she was drawn to the group because she does not have a strong Christian orientation, and the group seemed to best fit her interests.
<P>Although the group studies gender domination, its goal is to create more harmony between the sexes.
<P>"We are very determined that there is no male-bashing in our meetings," Thelander said.

<!-- story -->With a third straight day of sunshine, hundreds of evacuees from Yuba and Sutter counties are returning home.
<P>As many as 1,000 people from those areas were directed to American Red Cross facilities in Nevada County during last week's storm. Up to 90,000 evacuees fled communities along the Feather River Thursday under a mandatory evacuation. A levee along the river broke, flooding 10 square miles with up to 20 feet of water.
<P>Emergency officials notified residents of Marysville they could return home Sunday morning. Later in the day, people from surrounding areas got permission to return.
<P>That was fantastic news for evacuees. 
<P>A Linda resident staying at the Grass Valley Veterans Memorial Building since Wednesday said she could not wait to get home, "although everyone here (at the emergency shelter) has been so nice."
<P>"My house is still there, although just up the block it was flooded," she said.
<P>For those evacuees whose homes did not fare so well, the Red Cross will keep the veterans building open, consolidating other emergency shelters that were established at Nevada Union High School and the Nevada County Fairgrounds.
<P>The Western Nevada County Chapter of the American Red Cross has maintained the shelters with the help of many volunteers. Food and supplies have been donated by area restaurants and businesses to supplement Red Cross resources.

<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->What do you do with a sandbag after the storm?
<P>That's a question Northern Californians will have to answer in the coming days. It appears as though western Nevada County residents will have to answer the question soon, as the series of storms has ended in our region for now.
<P>When asked what should be done with the bags, several sand-bag distributors paused to ponder the query. Hmm. 
<P>Those more cautious suggested keeping them in storage for future deluges.
<P>The more adventurous might open up a short-term Zen gardening enterprise.
<P>For those harboring the insufferable holiday-leftover house guest, stuff two of the bags into a pillowcase and plunk it on the moocher's bed.
<P>But if you want the sandbags gone, you can take them to the Allison Ranch stockpile, said Rudi Golnik , Grass Valley Public Works director and city engineer.
<P>Sandbags may be dropped off during the day at the area near the second gate on Allison Ranch Road beyond the McCourtney Road intersection.
<P>Tracy Gidel, supervisor of the county Environmental Health Department's Hazardous Materials Division, said, "I have no reason to believe ... that sand that is utilized to protect a home in a sandbag is contaminated. It's sand, and they can use it, if they want it, for fill or something. It's not a hazardous waste."
<P>He added than anyone concerned about sandbags that came into contact with sewage could call his department at 265-1452 for information.

<H2>Better weather on the way; roads reopening in hard-hit foothills</H2>
<STRONG>By Will Holbert - Fri, Jan 3, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->For Nevada County, the worst is apparently over.
<P>While skies clear, it's time to tally the damage that in western Nevada County includes at least 40 to 50 flood-damaged homes, businesses and other structures, according to the Nevada County Building Department.
<P>However, that's just the latest figure and county workers are still assessing the total damage, said Chief Building Inspector Dennis Coliten.
<P>With flood waters threatening the Yuba County Jail, the Nevada County Sheriff's Department agreed to accept more than 100 Yuba County inmates. The old jail at the Nevada County Courthouse will be reopened to accommodate them, said Assistant Nevada County Sheriff Bob Hammill. Yuba County sent over its own correctional officers to help, he said.
<P>Coliten said it was important that people who suffered flood damage make a report and contact county officials. Gov. Pete Wilson Thursday afternoon added Nevada County to a list of disaster areas. The declaration will aid the arrival of low-interest loans and other help to repair storm damage.
<P>Coliten said flood victims can report damage by telephoning either his department at 265-1444 or emergency authorities at 265-7002.
<P>National Weather Service forecasters predicted scattered showers tonight with the snow level dropping to between 3,000 and 5,000 feet. A chance of showers remains in the forecast for Saturday, with the cooling trend continuing. Forecasters called for a chance of showers Sunday and Monday.
<P>Coliten said the damage ranged from homes with a few inches of water on the floor to houses that were wiped out altogether, as was the case in Washington.
<P>According to emergency logs, Thursday's flood victims included a neighborhood along the Bear River near Highway 49 where residents evacuated and one house was left an island in the swollen river.
<P>Two mudslides on Scotts Flat Road left one home in danger of being washed away and shut down the roadway to the Nevada Irrigation District campground, according to dispatch reports.
<P>In Grass Valley, floodwaters started receding on Wolf Creek, promising relief to residents along Mill Street. Damage in the town could have been worse were it not for improvements to the city's drainage.
<P>The Centerville Flume Project - which is only half complete - prevented flood waters from collecting on Richardson and North Auburn streets, said Rudi Golnik, city engineer and public works director.
<P>In Nevada City, damaged buildings included Kirby's Creekside Restaurant and Bar, two offices in the same Boulder Street area and two homes, said Nevada City Police Sgt. Lorin Gage.
<P>A raging Little Deer Creek overtook Pioneer Park, which Gage described as "a flowing lake."
<P>Little Deer Creek had fallen about 5 feet today, but the flood waters wiped out much of the picnic area.
<P>"Until it dries out ... we're not real sure of the damage over there," Gage said.

<P><HR>
<P>SOME ROADS STILL CLOSED, OTHERS BEGIN TO REOPEN 
<P>Several western Nevada County roadways remained closed or restricted this morning, but clearing weather, work crews and receding floodwaters are offering hope.
<P>The road situation is improving, with Graniteville Road and Red Dog Road reopened to travel as of this morning, according to the county Office of Emergency Services.
<P>However, new damage includes a giant sinkhole that opened up on Allison Ranch Road south of Grass Valley Thursday. County road crews tried plugging the hole with rock and gravel, but the material disappeared, according to reports. The road remains partially open.
<P>Lake Vera-Purdon Road at the Lake Vera Dam remains closed. It was reported underwater Thursday. The bridge today had been knocked off its footings, according to Nevada County emergency authorities.
<P>Other road updates include:
<P>-- Grizzly Hill Road, closed a half-mile south of Tyler Foote Crossing Road due to mudslides.
<P>-- Pasquale Road, closed by numerous slides.
<P>-- Dog Bar Road, open to travel.
<P>-- Relief Hill Road, open to four-wheel-drive vehicles only.
<P>-- Pleasant Valley Road, closed from the South Yuba River to French Corral due to mudslides and boulders on the road.
<P>-- Purdon Road, partially closed with large vehicles prohibited because of a boulder in the roadway. Crews will be at the scene today.
<P>The California Highway Patrol reported that Highway 20 is open between Nevada City and the Interstate 80 junction. Highway 174 was open, as well as Highway 49 between Grass Valley and Auburn. Highways 20 and 174 were both closed for periods Wednesday and Thursday.
<P>However, Highway 49 two miles north of Camptonville remained closed this morning because the storm had washed out part of the roadway, according to the CHP.

<H2>Human and animal evacuees settle in at vets building, fairgrounds</H2>
<STRONG>By Susan Lauer - Fri, Jan 3, 1997</STRONG><P>

<!-- story -->About 1,000 evacuees fled to American Red Cross shelters in Nevada County Thursday when their Yuba County communities were ordered to evacuate Thursday.
<P>Families, single young people and seniors filed into Nevada Union High School throughout the night from Marysville, Yuba City and Olivehurst because of actual and potential flooding. At least one levy break was reported near Olivehurst Thursday.
<P>Grass Valley's primary Red Cross shelter at the Veterans Memorial Building filled to capacity by noon Thursday with about 90 people.
<P>As the evening wore on, evacuees found their way past flooded roads to Nevada County. Lines of cars, some following the lead of California Highway Patrol escorts, filed into Nevada Union High School throughout the night.
<P>Six hundred people spent the night at Nevada Union, and more than 100 were staying at the Nevada County Fairgrounds, according to Susan Kelly, western Nevada County American Red Cross executive director. She was unsure how long the evacuees would need shelter.
<P>Red Cross officials had estimated as many as 15,000 people could have been directed to Nevada County. But by breakfast-time this morning, serving 1,000 evacuees, volunteers and emergency workers was a manageable task.
<P>"We are are expecting some additional resources that haven't been able to get to us, because the state is so impacted," Kelly said.
<P>Despite the limited resources, no evacuees were turned away last night.
<P> "These are our neighbors, and we are saying we will help you," she said.
<P>Most of the evacuees arrived last night with bedding and pillows, but the facilities soon ran out of cots. At the high school, sports mats were laid out on gymnasium floors.
<P>"We were soaking wet when we got here. They've fed us and kept us warm. The people here have been wonderful," said Connie Seymour of Yuba City.
<P>She and five other family members, who live about a mile from the Feather River, were spending their second evening in the Grass Valley Veterans Building.
<P>"We stood at the levy and watched the water level rise 3 inches in 15 minutes," she said. "We didn't want to take any chances."
<P>Area restaurants and charitable organizations are pitching in to help with food. A Grass Valley carpet business donated a large rug for children to play on at the veterans building.
<P>"The community has responded, especially businesses," said Sue Ramey, who was in charge of Southern Baptist volunteers. They operated a child-care facility and were helping with food at the veterans building.
<P>Evacuees were taking their misfortune in stride.
<P>"This was the first time we visited my daughter in eight years. I was here for the holidays," said Sylvia Funderburg of Lake Havasu, Ariz.
<P>She and friend Jackie Smith, also of Arizona, who was staying with her brother in Yuba City, ended up at the Grass Valley Veterans Building.
<P>"It's an adventure," Smith said. "I started putting my furniture up high and had difficulty deciding what was what. Then I realized they were just material things, and what will happen will happen."
<P>"At least I'm hoping we will be able to do some shopping while we are here," Funderburg said.
<P>Red Cross officials say they have been impressed with the optimism of the evacuees.
<P>"They don't know what they will be going home to, but for all that, they have a wonderful spirit," Ramey said. .

<P><HR>
<P>FOUR-LEGGED FIND HELP, TOO
<P>While two-legged evacuees sought warmth and food in shelters around Grass Valley, four-legged members of the family received relief in a temporary animal shelter at the Nevada County Fairgrounds.
<P>Dogs, cats, horses and even a pig hunkered down for a brief stay as part of Animal Disaster Response efforts, coordinated by Penn Valley veterinarian Melissa Nixon and operated by trained volunteers.
<P>"Most kennels and space at (veterinarians') offices already are filled. We can provide care for pets until the disaster is over," Nixon said.
<P>Volunteers oversee the animals' check-in and care for them during their stay. Nixon coordinates efforts with the American Red Cross during disasters, so evacuees know their pets will be cared for. The Red Cross does not allow animals at its shelters.
<P>Animal Disaster Response is not part of the Red Cross, and does not receive funding, except in the form of community donations.
<P>As volunteers dashed to purchase more dog collars and pet food Thursday, Nixon said one of the greatest needs during this disaster is carriers and cages for animals.
<P>"If people want to help and have (small pet) airline carriers or cages, we ask they put their names on them and drop them off at the fairgrounds (gate 8). We can use them, then return them," she said.

<P><HR>
<P>RED CROSS NEEDS FUNDING HELP
<P>The Red Cross' greatest need now is monetary donations.
<P>Contributions will help the western Nevada County chapter purchase items that evacuees need immediately, such as diapers, medication and food, officials said.
<P>Donations may be made to the Red Cross office at 144 Hughes Road, Grass Valley, or mailed to the Western Nevada County American Red Cross, P.O. Box 250, Grass Valley, CA 95945.

<H2>Wolf Creek surges into life, damages Mill St. homes, businesses</H2>
<STRONG>By Shawn Neidorf - Fri, Jan 3, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Having moved to 507 Mill St. only a month ago, Eric Lyon did not know most of his neighbors - until late Wednesday night and early Thursday morning.
<P>They got acquainted while watching an aggressive Wolf Creek overrun its banks, flooding their garages, submerging their lawns and lapping at their front porches, which sit about a dozen steps below street level and next to the creek.
<P>The rain-swollen creek - doing a fine imitation of a river - was still rushing and frothing Thursday afternoon.
<P>Too anxious to sleep, Lyon was awake when Grass Valley Police made a predawn visit Thursday, warning him and his neighbors of Wolf Creek's danger. Lyon, his wife and son had spent Wednesday night eating popcorn, listening to Christmas music and playing games - and keeping an eye on Wolf Creek and television weather reports. Lyon was still monitoring them Thursday afternoon.
<P>Sherman Sims, who lives a few doors down at 455 Mill St., considered evacuating his elderly father when police knocked. But Sims decided against it as the waters began to recede. In the 6 1/2 years Sims' has lived in his creekside home, he's never seen flooding this bad.
<P>One nearby business, the Carpet Barn, was spared, but the Swiss House restaurant suffered damage, according to neighbors. The eatery was closed Thursday, and a note taped to the door said it would reopen Friday. Owners could not be reached for comment.
<P>Mill Street residents who live on the west side of the street were spared the most dramatic Wolf Creek effects, but water cascading down the slope behind their homes landed in at least one basement. The water pressed noisily down a creek dividing homes at 452 and 462 Mill St., a tire partially wedged under a footbridge connecting the properties.
<P>Lyon said several tires washed up near his home, as well as beer cans and even a handful of pennies - including a couple of wheat-backs.
<P>Mill Street neighbors to the north fared better, for the most part. A few businesses did suffer rain-related damage, and a sign posted in the Mill Street Grill's window said the restaurant would be closed until Friday because of flooding and electrical problems.
<P>Water seeped through the walls of the Antique Emporium, causing some strips of wallpaper to separate from the wall. The pieces were held in place by the nails that would ordinarily be supporting merchandise.
<P>An older, higher lathe-and-plaster ceiling sopped up water as well, causing chunks of the heavy material to fall, thereby damaging lower ceiling tiles. Several of these fell, breaking a lamp and a few plates, said owner Lori Rollins. Three prints also sustained water damage..
<P>"We haven't suffered that much loss," she said.
<P>A few ceiling tiles also fell at Gold Cities Insurance and The Little Silver Palace.
<P>Late Thursday morning, a bucket perched on a chair beneath  a dripping ceiling blister at the Hot Gossip cafe held about 6 inches of yellow-brown water. Customers joked about it as a meditating pond, or perhaps a waterfall.
<P>Business was brisk at the Del Oro Theatre, but several clusters of rain-damaged seats were cordoned off, according to assistant manager Ryan Palmieri.
<P>"This building takes on water like a battleship hit by a torpedo," he said.
<P>Minor rain problems were reported at the home-furnishings and decorations store Duck Soup, Future Generations children's store, Hedman Furniture and Bloomers apparel shop.
<P>Melissa Leathley, a Future Generations retail clerk, noted that last year's rains allowed business owners to identify problem areas in their buildings and correct them before this year's downpours.

<H2>County sewage treatment plants cope with deluge</H2>
<STRONG>By Shawn Neidorf - Fri, Jan 3, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Nevada County sewer plants have been severely taxed by the last few days' deluge, but the facilities are hanging on, according to officials who oversee plants in Grass Valley, Nevada City, Lake of the Pines, Lake Wildwood and Cascade Shores.
<P>Grass Valley's plant is at its "absolute maximum," according to Rudi Golnik, city engineer and director of public works. The city's sewer collection system also is stressed.
<P>"We've got manhole covers floating," Golnik said Thursday. "In the Glenbrook Basin, the entire line is submerged in water."
<P>In Nevada City, City Manager Beryl Robinson said the sewer plant was functioning "remarkably well" considering the extraordinary inflows.
<P>Tom Miller, county director of transportation and sanitation, said conditions at the Lake Wildwood plant were "touch-and-go." The situation at the Lake of the Pines plant was similar.
<P>"Cascade Shores handled it surprisingly well. That was one of our major concerns," he said.
<P>An access road to the plant was flooded by a stream that blew out a culvert, he said. A county pickup truck was nearly overturned by the water when an employee went to check on the plant Wednesday night, said Miller.
<P>The Penn Valley plant, which takes waste from individual septic tanks, saw a lot of infiltration of rainwater, and there may be some minor spillage on individual properties, Miller said.
<P>"For the most part, we've been able to handle whatever was pumped into the system," he added.
<P>No problems were reported from the North San Juan or Mountain Lake Estates sewer plants, Miller said.
<P>Miller was grateful for Thursday afternoon's break in the rain and for Friday's predicted letup.
<P>"If we did not have this break, we would probably run into serious problems," he said.

<P><HR>
<P>HOW TO TREAT CONTAMINATED WATER
<P>The Nevada County Department of Environmental Health is warning that all surface water, including lakes, ponds, creeks and streams, should be treated as if it were contaminated with sewage because recent storms could leave surface water exposed to sewage-disposal systems.
<P>Well owners should determine if a well head has been under water. If so, the well water should be treated as if it is contaminated and should not be used for drinking or cooking (including brushing teeth) until it has been tested. Suspect water can be boiled for 10 to 15 minutes and considered safe for consumption.
<P>Specific instructions for decontaminating wells are available from the Department of Environmental Health by mail, fax, e-mail, or pick up from the office. Copies are available by calling 265-1452.
<P>Those who operate small, public water systems also should check their systems and notify water users and environmental health officials immediately if problems are found, the department advises.
<P>Personal items that come in contact with contaminated creeks or streams should be disinfected with bleach or a Lysol-type product.

<H2>A river runs through it: Stunned Washington residents assess damage</H2>
<STRONG>By David Sneed - Fri, Jan 3, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Chris Burdick couldn't believe his eyes.
<P>The raging South Yuba River had torn in half his 3,500-square-foot home on Maybert Road outside of the town of Washington.
<P>"The whole back end is gone, and the river is running through what used to be the master bedroom," Burdick said. "I don't know what's keeping the roof up."
<P>Burdick was one of at least a dozen Washington residents whose homes were destroyed Wednesday morning when heavy rains and melting snowpacks sent the South Yuba River surging over its banks with alarming speed.
<P>"It was incredible how fast the water came up," Burdick said. "It's scary."
<P>Flooding caused a host of other problems for the small community on the river. The town's treated water system was knocked out, and residents were told to boil their drinking water.
<P>The South Yuba washed out an approach to the Washington Road bridge, and mudslides closed Relief Hill Road, leaving about 50 residents stranded, said Assistant Nevada County Sheriff John Trauner.
<P>Sheriffs deputies are traveling to the Maybert Road area by way of Relief Hill Road today to rescue stranded residents, Trauner said.
<P>Flooding also destroyed the Washington Road bridge over Washington Creek, impeding access from Highway 20.
<P>Richard Johnson, Nevada County road superintendent, said the bridge over the South Yuba will probably be out for several weeks. The river had undercut the bridge's south footing, causing a square chunk of the roadbed to fall into the river.
<P>"Until the river goes down, there's not much we can do," Johnson said.
<P>Although a portion of the bridge was gone, the sidewalk was still intact, and several people, including Burdick, were able to reach the town by running across.
<P>"That was real stupid," Burdick said. "I won't do that again."
<P>John Godfrey, another Washington resident, lost nearly everything Wednesday morning when the river jumped its banks. On Thursday, Godfrey's mobile home on Pine Aire Road was sitting in the river, in danger of being washed away at any moment.
<P>"I lost everything," he said. "I basically got away with the clothes on my back."
<P>Henry Decorte, owner of the Washington Hotel, said he has rooms available for those people who need a place to stay. He expected about a dozen people displaced by flooding would be staying at the hotel Thursday night.
<P>The River Rest Resort, a mobile-home park and campground along the river, was also hard-hit by flood waters. The campground was under water Thursday. Three mobile homes had been displaced by the river but were still visible. The river also collected at least two cars, said Susan Lyon, owner of the resort.
<P>"Many lost everything," Lyon said. "We just got them out in time."

<H2>Few area homeowners insured for flooding</H2>
<STRONG>By Tim Willis - Fri, Jan 3, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->

<!-- story -->While flooded homes and businesses have become a common sight during the recent downpours, insurance to protect against such calamities is rare in Nevada County, local insurance agents said.
<P>The typical homeowner policy in Nevada County covers fire, theft, vandalism and wind and rain damage, said Ed Mertens of Ed Mertens Farmer's Insurance. If there is rain damage from a hole in the roof or water damage from a leaky faucet, homeowners are protected, Mertens explained. Rising floodwaters are another story, however.
<P>Typically, homeowners and business owners would not bother with flood insurance unless their property is within a 100-year floodplain. In such cases, a bank or lending institution would require the flood insurance for a loan to refinance or buy the property, insurance agents explained.
<P>"Flood insurance in this area is uncommon for homes and businesses," said Ron Wedlake, owner and broker of Siskiyou Insurance Service in Grass Valley.
<P>However, he said those who live in areas prone to flooding, such as tracts along Wolf Creek, Idaho-Maryland Road and parts of Penn Valley, may want to at least consider it.
<P>Flood insurance coverage for a home in a designated flood zone might cost anywhere from $200 to $800 a year, based on the home's value, Mertens said.
<P>Cost-conscious business owners may consider it one more expense they don't need.
<P>"That is not something (business owners) expect to happen, even if they are in a floodplain," said Betty Riley, executive director of the Sierra Economic Development District.
<P>She noted, however, that those in a floodplain who apply for a Small Business Administration loan would be required to have such coverage.
<P>"I don't think we have had written a flood policy in some time, because most lenders don't require it," said Dave Incrocci, an agent with Interstate Benefit and Casualty. "Unless the lenders demand it on a loan, most people won't even consider it."
<P>Flood insurance, which is a federally operated program, is almost as uncommon as earthquake coverage, which has become a state-operated program, said Richard Harris, owner of Harris Insurance Services.
<P>"It is hard to be an expert in flood insurance," Harris said. "We have done two homes in the last six years."

<!-- story -->
<P>The new year dawned in Nevada County Wednesday with intense rain and localized flooding that caused millions of dollars in damage, forced people to flee their homes, and closed many roads.
<P>A state of local emergency was declared about 11 a.m. Wednesday by Dennis Cassella, director of the Nevada County Office of Emergency Services.
<P>County Administrator David Brennan requested today that the state declare a state of emergency in Nevada County.
<P>As of this morning, forecasters were expecting another night of rain, heavy at times. Forecasters predicted showers would decrease by Friday night. National Weather Service forecaster Steve Anderson predicted a drop in the snow level to 6,000 feet. Low-degree temperatures are expected to drop slightly, from the middle to low 40s.
<P>And there's a chance of clearing Sunday and Monday, according to the extended forecasts, Anderson said.
<P>"It's still calling for showers and partly cloudy skies, but nothing like we have right now," Anderson said this morning.
<P>The current storm is possibly even worse than the 1995 rainstorms that also left Nevada County one of numerous California communities declared disaster areas.
<P>During the 48 hours ending at 7 a.m. today, 11.62 inches of rain fell in Nevada City.
<P>As of 5 p.m. Wednesday, there had been an estimated $6 million in damage to public roads and utilities, said Sheriff Troy Arbaugh. No new figures were available this morning.
<P>"The water flow from this storm is going to be very similar to that in (February) 1986. If it flooded in '86, it's going to flood here," Arbaugh said.
<P>A house off Highway 49 near the Bear River was in danger of being engulfed by a mudslide and washing out this morning. Nevada County Sheriff's Capt. Gary Jacobson said deputies were expected at the scene by 10 a.m. to make sure the residents had evacuated.
<P>Jacobson said the Office of Emergency Services did not expect major flooding today.
<P>"We are currently getting reports of an increase in flooding in the Truckee area, but not in western Nevada County," he said.
<P>Sandbags are available at Nevada County Consolidated's Station 88, off Highway 49 south of Grass Valley; at the Higgins Area Fire District station on Combie Road at the Highway 49, and at the Penn Valley Fire Protection District's main station in Penn Valley.
<P>Fewer than a dozen Nevada County residents were known to be without electricity this morning. During the day Wednesday, the number of residents without power varied from 100 to 2,000. Portions of Lake of the Pines and southern Alta Sierra were blacked out most of the day.
<P>"It hasn't been very extensive; it's just been steady. Every hour or so, another tree falls down. The ground becomes so soaked that the roots can't hold, and they fall over," said Dennis Trinidad, PG&E district manager.
<P>Flooding and mudslides restricted travel, in some cases cutting off entire communities, such as Washington and Downieville.
<P>Workers this morning were still clearing a Wednesday mudslide that has closed Highway 20 between Nevada City and Interstate 80, according to Lt. Kevin Green, the California Highway Patrol commander in Grass Valley. The slide was near the Highway 20 and I-80 junction. Highway 20 is open to residents only, Green said.
<P>Highway 20 remained open between Grass Valley and Marysville. Highway 49 remained open this morning between Grass Valley and Auburn.
<P>The rains flooded and washed out parts of Highway 49 in the Camptonville area. The highway was closed this morning at the Marysville Road junction.
<P>Several local roads were shut down, including Idaho-Maryland Road leading to Grass Valley from Brunswick Road and East Main Street. Flooding was reported on other roads from Rough and Ready to the Lake Vera area.
<P>Firefighters discovered an empty truck that had apparently become stuck in a rising creek near French Corral. The truck had probably been in the creek since Tuesday and may have washed into the South Fork of the Yuba by this morning, said Engineer Dennis Bishop, with the Penn Valley Fire Protection District.
<P>"Whoever was in the truck managed to break the windshield and get out," Bishop said.

<P><HR>
<P>RENO, TAHOE AND TRUCKEE AREAS EVACUATED
<P>RENO, Nev. - Heavy rain caused the worst flooding Wednesday in downtown Reno in more than 40 years, forcing the evacuation of hundreds of residents.
<P>There were widespread reports of flooding along the 90-mile course of the Truckee River between Lake Tahoe and its end east of Reno. No injuries were reported.
<P>Up to 7 inches of rain Wednesday in the Tahoe area sent the Truckee over its banks.
<P>At least several houses were flooded along the Truckee between the towns of Truckee and Tahoe City, and several other houses were flooded in Truckee, said Nevada County sheriff's deputy Steve Stanovich.
<P>Heavy rains also triggered mudslides that closed Interstate 80 near the California line and Highway 89 between Truckee and Tahoe City. Another mudslide closed the Union Pacific railroad tracks east of Truckee.
<P>A woman was rescued after the raging Yuba River surrounded her Hampshire Rocks house west of Truckee and flooded it. Authorities said they found a piano floating in the house.
<P>The latest rain melted much of a heavy snowpack left after last week's ferocious storm dumped more than 8 feet of snow in the Tahoe area.
<P>''There were some areas near Truckee that had up to 74 inches of snow on the ground after that storm and now they have no snow,'' Barbato said.

<H2>Creekside dining: Kirby's Restaurant inundated by Deer Creek</H2>
<STRONG>By James Nash - Thu, Jan 2, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->At about 2 a.m. Wednesday, Kirby and Carol Sechovec went to bed assuming their restaurant, Kirby's Creekside in Nevada City, was safe from receding flood waters.
<P>Later in the morning, the Sechovecs were wading in knee-deep water as they attempted to salvage chairs, tables and glassware from the 4 feet of water that filled the dining room.
<P>"What hurts so much is that so many people were here having a wonderful time last night," said Carol Sechovec. "They were having such a nice time."
<P>After receding temporarily, the muddied waters of Deer Creek broke into Kirby's with a vengeance early Wednesday, filling the dining room waist-high by noon.
<P>Scores of fire department personnel were at the scene through the afternoon, pumping water from the restaurant. But there was little they could do to stem the rising tide.
<P>The Nevada Irrigation District was forced to release water from the Scotts Flat Reservoir in the early afternoon, further gorging Deer Creek after days of uninterrupted rain.
<P>By late afternoon, Kirby's was cordoned off as water climbed the stairs from the dining room to the street level. Fire departments quit pumping water from the lower floor at about 3 p.m.
<P>"We're doing everything we can," said Sam Goodspeed, assistant chief of the Nevada City Fire Department. "We've got Deer Creek coming up through the building. All the pressure comes up through the floorboards.
<P>"Right now we're - pardon the expression - barely keeping our heads above water," Goodspeed said.
<P>The county declared the building not occupiable Wednesday afternoon.
<P>The Sechovecs and their employees scrambled to retrieve items from the dining room before rising water made the area impassible. Tables were nearly submerged; menus, napkins and a safe full of checks were drenched; wet labels peeled from wine bottles.
<P>Kirby Sechovec, standing in the upstairs bar amid poinsettias and other items rescued from the dining room below, said the previous night's New Year's Eve dinner crowd had been the best he has seen since buying the restaurant 1 1/2 years ago. That, added to the false sense of security he had felt upon leaving that night, made the spectacle of 4 feet of water in his dining room all the more painful.
<P>"Yesterday the water went down all day," he said. "When I left at 2 a.m., it was 4 feet under the deck."
<P>Sechovic found some consolation in the support - from employees and the community - that poured in after the water did.
<P>"The thing that literally brought tears to my eyes is the support I've gotten from the community," he said. "I've had people come in here who I don't even know to offer their support. Somebody came in and donated a 1,200-gallon-a-minute pump we've been using all afternoon."
<P>The restaurant, then operating as Big Al's Night Club, flooded in February 1986 after an intense storm. Sechovic left no doubt that Kirby's would recover again after the floods disappear.
<P>"If I work here 20 hours a day, it will probably take less than a week (to reopen) after the water goes," he said.

<H2>Residents evacuated as rivers spill over</H2>
<STRONG>By James Nash, The Union staff - Thu, Jan 2, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Eighty-nine people spent Wednesday night at an American Red Cross shelter in the Grass Valley Veterans Memorial Building on South Auburn Street.
<P>The Red Cross opened the shelter Wednesday afternoon as rising flood waters forced residents to evacuate their homes, said Susan Kelly, executive director of the Red Cross Western Nevada County chapter.
<P>Other displaced residents holed up in motel rooms overnight. No estimate of the number of displaced Nevada County residents was available this morning.
<P>Expecting an influx of flood refugees from Marysville and areas along Highway 20 east of Nevada City, the Red Cross planned this morning to open a shelter at Nevada Union High School.
<P>As many as 10,000 people, most from Yuba County, may need temporary shelter in Nevada County tonight, Kelly said.
<P>Kelly asked county residents to open their homes to people displaced by flooding. She said shelters may not be able to handle the flow of people.
<P>Kelly said the Grass Valley McDonald's and Wonderful III donated food to the South Auburn Street shelter last night. 
<P>Pets will be placed in temporary quarters at the Nevada County Fairgrounds.
<P>The Western Nevada County American Red Cross can be reached at 272-3265.
<P>Meanwhile, many residents who remained at home assessed the damage caused by the worst flooding in at least 11 years.
<P>Burt Spangler, a Grass Valley resident whose property abuts Wolf Creek, said Wednesday's flooding was the most severe in the 16 years he has lived on Mill Street. His property floods nearly every winter, but usually only 3 to 4 inches in his garage.
<P>"This time, it came up a good 30 inches," he said.
<P>Spangler said he fears that his beekeeping supplies and tools on pallets in his garage are submerged. His furnace, in a walk space under his house, may be completely flooded.
<P>Spangler's next-door neighbors, Jim Craun and Kim Epperson, were packing some of their belongings Wednesday as a precautionary measure.
<P>Watching the flood waters recede in their backyard, Craun and Epperson said they were not overly concerned about flooding.
<P>"I think it's pretty neat," Epperson said.

<P><HR>
<P>RED CROSS RECOMMENDATIONS IF YOU EVACUATE
<P>If you are told to evacuate to flee flood waters, authorities recommend that you do so immediately and go to the nearest shelter. Be sure to maintain a battery-powered radio to follow announcements of emergency shelter openings and evacuation orders.
<P>The Red Cross has opened an evacuation center at  Grass Valley Veterans Memorial Building, 255 S. Auburn St. Later today, the Red Cross planned to open another shelter at Nevada Union High School.
<P>If time permits, bring with you:
<P>-- Essential medicines
<P>-- Infant formulas and supplies
<P>-- Pillows, blankets and sleeping bags
<P>-- Change of clothing
<P>-- Flashlight and batteries
<P>-- Radio and batteries
<P>-- Important documents
<P>-- Insurance polices
<P>-- Personal toiletry items

<H2>Washington inhabitants stranded by rising Yuba; historical bridges imperiled</H2>
<STRONG>By David Sneed - Thu, Jan 2, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Days of drenching rains turned the South Yuba River into a raging, chocolate-colored torrent that flooded the town of Washington and threatens at least two historic bridges.
<P>The town of Washington has been hardest hit by the local flooding. Maybert Road is inundated, and several houses have been washed away, said Gene Godfrey, Washington fire chief.
<P>"This is the highest water I've ever seen, and I've been living here for 25 years," Godfrey said. "This makes the 1986 flood look like a Sunday school picnic."
<P>Henry Decorte, owner of the Washington Hotel, said he saw two houses wash down the river Wednesday afternoon. Six people are homeless as a result of the flooding and are staying at the hotel.
<P>"It's a total mess down here," he said.
<P>The town has lost its drinking water supply, and authorities have closed roads into the town. Rescue teams will try to get up the river today to assess the damage and reach families stranded by road washouts, Godfrey said.
<P>The Nevada County Sheriff's Department will concentrate its effort on getting the road to Washington open to allow evacuations, said Capt. Gary Jacobson.
<P>Downstream at Bridgeport, rangers with the state Department of Parks and Recreation, said the river was nearly touching the bottom of the historic covered bridge. This morning, they were evacuating the visitors center and ranger station as a precaution.
<P>"The river has been climbing 4 or 5 inches an hour," said Ranger Chuck Scimeca. "If it rises any further, the bridge is in danger. We are at a critical time right now."
<P>Rangers said the covered bridge is in danger even if flood waters do not reach it. Flooding has washed away entire trees and other heavy debris that could strike and damage the wooden structure, said Supervising Ranger Lt. Larry Clark.
<P>Clark was busy Wednesday afternoon shooing sightseers off the old South Yuba River bridge at Highway 49, which now serves as a footbridge. Flooding could undercut the bridge, and Clark decided to close it as a precaution. Hundreds of curious people flocked to the bridge to watch the swollen river thunder by.
<P>People who have lived near the river for much of their lives say the flows are the highest they have ever seen.
<P>"The ground just shakes back and forth with all the rocks banging together underwater," fire chief Godfrey said.
<P>The river was in danger of flooding the Washington bridge, which has 31 feet of clearance underneath. Nevada Irrigation District General Manager Jim Chatigny said a flow of 68,000 cubic-feet-per-second of water would be needed to endanger the bridge.
<P>Upstream at Spaulding Reservoir, 32,000 cfs of water is flowing over the top of the dam. Warm rains have melted much of the snowpack, increasing the flows, Chatigny said.
<P>"That snow is just melting like crazy," he said. "It's really coming down."

<H2>Rains bring outages, high-water crises</H2>
<STRONG>By JAMES Nash, David Sneed, AP - Wed, Jan 1, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Wolf Creek flooded its banks this morning and the south fork of the Yuba River threatened to overflow as driving rain continued to batter Nevada County and Northern California for the fourth straight day.
<P>Rain and strong winds downed several power lines overnight Tuesday, cutting off power to hundered of residents in the south county and parts of Grass Valley.
<P>Homes along Highway 49 between Lime Kiln Road and Higgins Corner, including the northern section of Lake of the Pines and southern Alta Sierra, were without power this morning. The outage was blamed on fallen power lines. Power was expected to return by early this afternoon.
<P>Southwestern Grass Valley along McCourtney Road also was blacked out this  morning, with crews expected to investigate the cause by late morning.
<P>A flood watch warning was issued for the south fork of the Yuba River this morning as the river began to spill over at Lake Spaulding. Some residents along the river evacuated their homes this morning.
<P>"We're definitely way out of the banks right now," said Kurtis Congdon, a resident of Maybert Road near the town of Washington. "We've called 911 and we were told they couldn't get to us because the road was out. I've thrown in the towel."
<P>Congdon was packing up his belongings this morning and had expected to leave his home by 9:30.
<P>A car was reported to be over the embankment of the South Fork of the Yuba River off Pleasant Valley Road near North San Juan at about 9:30 this morning. The swift-water response team was summoned as the river continued to rise. Further details were unavailable at press time.
<P>The latest in a string of powerful storms to assault Northern California brought howling winds and driving rain today, sending major rivers pouring over their banks and walls of mud oozing down sodden hillsides.
<P>People along parts of the Truckee and Susan rivers in Nevada and California began the new year under a flood warning.
<P>The warning was in effect from Sparks to Vista, east of Reno, including the flood-prone Lockwood area. A warning also was posted along the river from Tahoe City to Truckee and for the Susan River near Susanville.
<P>The Lake Tahoe Basin and the Reno-Carson City-Minden area were under an urban and small stream flood advisory today along with Lassen and eastern Plumas and eastern Sierra counties.
<P>The Truckee was running nearly 1 feet above flood stage between Sparks and Vista today, causing minor flooding in low-lying areas. No homes were affected, the National Weather Service said.
<P>In the Sierra, the rising river was endangering private bridges across the Truckee betwen Tahoe City and Truckee.
<P>The Susan River had flooded a few rural roads and some agricultural land near Susanville, and local flooding was occurring along small streams in the Janesville, Milford, Loyalton and Sierraville areas.
<P>All of the waterways were expected to continue rising as a result of today's rain.
<P>Small creeks around the perimeter of Lake Tahoe were likely to cause problems on roadways in the area. The weather service said tributaries of the Truckee and Carson rivers from Verdi, west of Reno, south to Genoa and Gardnerville may experience rapid rises during periods of heavy rain.
<P>No snow was expected below 9,000 feet from the very warm storm with rain continuing through today, then tapering off tonight as the storm moves east. 
<P>The snow level was forecast to lower to around 7,500 feet on Thursday as the highs slipped into the 50s.
<P>''It's a happy New Year, if you're a duck,'' said National Weather Service meteorologist Dan Keirns.
<P>Meteorologist Dan Weygand said flood warnings for the Russian and Napa rivers will remain in effect through Friday. He said the powerful storm dumped 4-6 inches of rain on the area overnight, and he predicted more heavy rain today and rain continuing off and on into Saturday.
<P>The Russian River at Guerneville was at 39 feet this morning, seven feet above flood stage, enroute to an expected crest of 49 feet later today, a foot over the record mark set last year.
<P>The Napa River was heading to near 19 feet by Thursday in St. Helena, breaking the mark of 18.6 feet set last year. Major flooding of homes and businesses was predicted in low-lying areas along the rivers, the service warned in a bulletin.
<P>The Sacramento River in Tehama County topped out, too. Intersections across the region were flooded and thousands of people lost power after gale force winds of up to 80 mph lashed trees, hitting transformers and power lines.
<P>Some 19,600 of Pacific Gas & Electric's 4.6 million customers were without service, including 9,000 in the Fort Bragg and Eureka area and 4,600 around Chico and Auburn.
<P>''The ground is really saturated and gusts are 60 mph in some areas,'' said Greg Pruett, a PG&E spokesman. ''Whole trees are uprooted.''
<P>''Overall, our system is holding up extremely well,'' he said.
<P>Sonoma County officials urged residents living along the Russian River to evacuate. And the California Highway Patrol warned motorists to avoid many Sonoma County roads near the river because of flooding.
<P>Elsewhere, the Sacramento River in Tehama County, 200 miles north of San Francisco, overflowed its bank, prompting about 300 people to leave their homes. Officials closed fourteen roads and several mobile home parks.
<P>Mudslides closed highways throughout the region. A massive slide near Dunsmuir Tuesday closed a 45-mile section of Interstate 5, the state's main north-south freeway. The highway was reopened later in the day. The slide hit two cars but no injuries were reported.
<P>In San Francisco, organizers of SFNYE, a huge New Year's Eve celebration near the city's waterfront, put up huge tents with steel beam frames and covered walkways to protect party-goers, who paid $85 each to enjoy a long list of acts including Chris Isaac and Lyle Lovett. About 10,000 people braved the storm to party in the new year.
<P>Throughout Northern California, residents filled sandbags to keep the creeping, muddy water out of their businesses and homes.
<P>In Butte County, officials declared a local state of emergency because of flooding in the Butte Creek area. Evacuations were voluntary. The National Guard activated 16 members of a Chico engineering unit to operate heavy trucks if needed, according to Lt. Col. Doug Hart.
<P>California's main dams - the Folsom, Oroville and Shasta - should be able to handle any flood runoffs in their area, said Pete Weiser, spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources.
<P>Rivers without dams, including the Trinity, Eel and Klamath, could be another matter, he said. The Eel and Klamath were at flood stage Tuesday and officials urged ranchers to move livestock to higher ground.

<P><HR>
<P>NID: AREA RESERVOIRS OVERFLOWING; SNOWPACK RESULTS UNAVAILABLE
<P>This year's succession of warm winter storms has left the Nevada Irrigation District with plenty of water.
<P>All of the district's lower-elevation reservoirs, including Rollins, Scotts Flat and Combie, are full and overflowing, said Jim Chatigny, NID general manager.
<P>The first of the year is the time NID usually takes its first snowpack measurements, but stormy weather prompted the district to postpone the first measurements until February. Helicopters cannot safely fly in the inclement weather that is expected the rest of the week, Chatigny said.
<P>"We probably won't take measurement this month unless there is a compelling reason to do so," he said.
<P>Rain was expected up to 9,000 feet Tuesday, and this was expected to soak the snowpack that has accumulated in the higher elevations.
<P>"What would be ideal would be a good, hard freeze over the next couple of weeks and then snow on top of it to lock in all that water," Chatigny said.
<P>NID measures the snowpack in the upper-elevation areas of the district during the winter and early spring in order to predict how much water will be available for the upcoming irrigation district. The April measurements are considered the most accurate.

<H2>Mud blocks Highway 49 as deluge continues</H2>
<STRONG>By Susan Lauer, AP - Tue, Dec 31, 1996</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->A mudslide on Highway 49 near the South Yuba River blocked the northbound lane this morning.
<P>The slide was described as "taller than a propane truck" by Ayse Turkseven, who drove past the site on her way to work in Grass Valley.
<P>"We are used to rock slides, but this was higher up," she said. "We were lucky there were not many cars driving then. I was concerned with all of the blind curves along that stretch of highway."
<P>The slide occurred six miles north of Nevada City, just north of the South Yuba River bridge, according to a Caltrans spokeswoman. Work crews began clearing the area around 8 a.m.
<P>The mudslide was one of the most visible effects of the region's continued wet weather.
<P>The end-of-the-year downpour has brought Nevada City precipitation to record levels for this early in the season. By this morning, Nevada City had racked up 44.90 inches of precipitation since July 1.
<P>Nevada City is on pace to surpass records set during the 1994-95 rainy season, when more than 100 inches of precipitation fell. By Dec. 31, 1994, 27.57 inches of rain had fallen during the season.
<P>During December 1996, Nevada City has collected 33.02 inches of rain, second only to 1955, when 34.66 inches fell.
<P>The rainy season runs from July 1 to June 30, with most of the  precipitation coming after January. Nevada City's seasonal average is 54 inches.
<P>Heavy rains will continue throughout the week, according to the National Weather Service. This evening and tomorrow, another front will roll through Nevada County powered by wind gusts of up to 50 mph, according to Steve Anderson, a weather service meteorologist.
<P>"The heaviest rain of the last three systems will begin tonight," he said.
<P>To prepare for the onslaught, the county has issued sandbags to fire departments to make available to the public. Sandbags are available from the Higgins, Penn Valley and Nevada City fire departments. The Consolidated Fire District station on Highway 49 south of Grass Valley also has sandbags, according to Dennis Cassella, emergency services director for the county.
<P>Cassella said Monday afternoon he had received no reports of flooding.
<P>The state Office of Emergency Services has been working with the county and wards from the California Youth Authority to sandbag around a sewage treatment pond at Scotts Flat Reservoir. The pond was previously dry but has begun to fill with the heavy rains.
<P>In the Sacramento Valley, engineers were considering cracking open Folsom Dam's spillway gates if the latest storm proves to be too much for the region's levees and dams. Shasta Lake and Lake Oroville were expected to handle the anticipated runoff.
<P>Residents of such flood-prone areas as Rio Linda, Napa, the Russian River region and San Jose prepared for the worst.
<P>''We haven't had a storm that portends to be as big as this one in 10 years,'' said Jeff McCracken, spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. ''We are anticipating the worst, and we've got operational plans to deal with it.''
<P>A flood warning was issued for the Napa and Russian rivers, the Eel River at Fernbridge and the Sacramento River at Tehama Bridge. A flood watch, a less dire warning, was issued for Northwestern California and for Siskiyou and Modoc counties.
<P>''Flooding could occur with just a few hours of heavy rainfall,'' warned a weather bulletin.
<P>A mudslide closed Interstate 5 in both directions south of Dunsmuir this morning, the Highway Patrol said. The slide occurred about 4:30 a.m. near the Shasta-Siskiyou county line, about 60 miles south of the Oregon border.
<P>''They're looking at a couple more hours before getting the roadway open,'' CHP officer Jim Machado said about 7 a.m.

<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->When Larry Miller says he started to write comedy for television because he failed at everything else, he isn't joking.
<P>He failed in the frozen-food business. Teaching didn't work out, either. He tried selling insurance. That flopped, too.
<P>"Being a television comedy writer was all that was left," smiled Miller, an Alta Sierra resident.
<P>While still a student at the University of Pennsylvania, Miller began writing for Ed McMahon, who at that time had a variety show airing on Channel 10 in Philadelphia. Miller said McMahon was impressed with his writing but couldn't pay him much.
<P>Miller then made the rounds of the Philadelphia television circuit - three stations - writing and acting for each. At that time, around 1950, journeyman writers didn't get paid, so Miller did some acting in sketches to collect $15 a show.
<P>"I enjoyed doing it, but I didn't have the need to appear before an audience," he said. "Some people have a need to be on. I don't."
<P>Acting may have been a diversion, but Miller found his true calling in New York writing for a show called "Beat the Clock." It was the original stunt show, Miller explained, and a model for later programs like Nickelodeon's "Double Dare."
<P>Miller and another writer scripted stunts that were fairly daring by the standards of early-'60s television. Many stunts involved married couples; many involved cans of compressed whipped cream; some involved both.
<P>Then in Southern California, Miller wrote for several other shows and helped develop "The Dating Game" and "The Anniversary Game." In the late 1980s, he returned to his roots and helped develop "Double Dare" and another stunt show, "Fun House."
<P>He has also kept busy - sort of - by writing a syndicated newspaper column, "Miller Light."
<P>"By 1985, I didn't know if I was retired or unemployed," he said in tracing the column's origins. "I needed a reason to get up in the morning."
<P>He writes the column every week, "because a daily column would be too much like work." Last summer, he covered the Republican National Convention in San Diego, which was so light on news that "Nightline" anchor Ted Koppel signed off early in resignation.
<P>"By the time Koppel walked off the show, I had already left and was writing my column at Kinko's for $12 an hour," Miller said.
<P>Miller settled in Alta Sierra about five years ago with his wife Flossie. He said he moved to the area to be closer to his grandson Matthew, who lives in Auburn.
<P>"I got where I am now by just getting old," Miller said. "We retired here."
<P>Miller and his wife travel frequently. They sometimes  travel on cruise ships at no cost in exchange for Larry lecturing on life as a senior citizen.
<P>A diabetic, Miller also lectures to diabetes support groups and writes a monthly column called "Sugar Blues." The column, a humorous look at life with diabetes, is perhaps Miller's proudest achievement.
<P>"It's important to me that people can look at their diabetes and get a little laugh out of it," he said.

<H2>GV man dies in apparent gun accident</H2>
<STRONG>By Shawn Neidorf - Mon, Jan 6, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->A 43-year-old Grass Valley man was killed early Friday evening in what appears to be a gun-cleaning accident.
<P>Sheriff's deputies were called to the scene at a Sutton Way apartment at about 6:20 p.m. after a shot was heard.
<P>John J. Saling was found with a .45 caliber handgun and a cleaning kit. He had been shot in the forehead.
<P>Assistant Sheriff John Trauner said the gun's magazine had been removed, which may have led Saling to believe the gun was unloaded. But a single round remained in the chamber.
<P>Although the matter is still under investigation, the Sheriff's Department said it believes the death was a self-inflicted accident, according to Trauner. He noted that nothing else was out of place in the apartment.

<H2>Longtime NC attorney wins '96 Kilroy award</H2>
<STRONG>By The Union Staff - Mon, Jan 6, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->William B. "Bill" Wetherall, who has practiced law in Nevada City since 1955 and is the author of the city's noted historical preservation law, was named recipient of the 1996 Elza Kilroy Award for outstanding community service Friday.
<P>The Kilroy award, established in 1969, is presented annually by the Nevada City Chamber of Commerce to a citizen whose efforts help make Nevada City a better community.
<P>Wetherall served as Nevada City's city attorney from 1959 to 1979 and spent several years developing the historical ordinance that was adopted by the city council in August, 1968.
<P>The measure created a downtown historical district with architectural controls, strict limits on signs and restrictions on the demolition or removal of old buildings.
<P>Wetherall, who credits many people for creation of the historical ordinance, recently chronicled its development in a 13-page report. The ordinance, he wrote, has allowed Nevada City to retain "a unique character and ambience which is truly representative of its historical past. As a result, the city attracts thousands of visitors each year who contribute greatly to the local economy, thereby maintaining and augmenting property values both within and outside of the historical district.
<P>"Perhaps more important," he concluded, "is the fact that the ordinance has helped spawn a cultural environment which makes Nevada City a better place to live - a city that deserves to be called, and is proud to be called, the Queen City of the Northern Mines."
<P>Wetherall is also a former 12-year director with the Nevada County Fair Board and a former board member of Music in the Mountains. He and his wife, Orene, have resided locally since May 1955. They have three children, four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.
<P>The Nevada City Chamber also recognized contributions to the arts with the annual Dr. Leland and Sally Lewis awards program, established 15 years ago, the Stan Halls Award for architectural excellence, the new construction award and musician's award.
<P>The performing arts award for 1996 went to musician Roger Hodgson, the rural Nevada City resident best-known as leader of Supertramp. Hodgson recorded a new album, "Rites of Passage," and performed in town earlier this year.
<P>All of the award winners were nominated by Chamber of Commerce members and former winners, and selected by a chamber committee.
<P>The awards will be presented at the chamber's installation and awards dinner Saturday, Jan. 18, at Miners Foundry. The public is invited. For reservations, call 265-2692.

<H2>I hereby rolve ...: Making - and keeping - New Year's resolutions</H2>
<STRONG>By Susan Lauer - Wed, Jan 1, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Making that vow to lose weight, quit smoking, get organized - it's that time again to set New Year's resolutions.
<P>"I make resolutions every year," said Grass Valley resident Christina Pollino, 16.
<P>This year she promises herself that she would lose weight - something she has pledged to do other New Year's Days.
<P>This year is different, though, she said: "I'm actually going to get a membership to a gym."
<P>New Year's resolutions can be the impetus to change, so long as a person has the correct mindset and a realistic expectation. Resolutions do not have to be forgotten in a matter of weeks, and neither burdensome or guilt-rendering, say counselors.
<P>"I've made resolutions to paint my house, to be a better friend, get fit  even become a muscle man," said one Nevada City man, who didn't want to give his name because "someone may see my name and realize I haven't come through on my New Year's resolutions.
<P>"It's an embarrassment; I fail every year," he said.
<P>Perhaps Americans in the modern world should take a lesson in practical resolutions from the ancient Babylonians, who started the New Year's tradition 4,000 years ago.
<P>Then, the Babylonians weren't interested about setting outlandish, pie-in-the-sky goals for themselves. Instead, the most popular resolutions of the day were to return all borrowed farming tools and household items and to pay off all debts, according to  Charles Panati's "Extraordinary Origins of Everyday Things."
<P>Something can be learned from the ancients about being realistic and clear on resolutions, say professionals who work with people to set and achieve goals.
<P>"I believe many people sabotage themselves with unrealistic resolutions. You need to make your goals attainable by setting small steps," said Gerry Shea, a therapist of Generations Family Center in Grass Valley.
<P>For example, if the goal is cleaning up your diet, "don't decide carte blanche to go vegetarian," she said. Instead, take a first step of giving up a food like chocolate then eliminate unhealthy foods one at a time.
<P>"Be sure to reward yourself each step of the way," Shea said.
<P>This New Year's Eve, when considering a resolution, try this, suggests Caryl Barnes, owner of Weight Management Workshops in Grass Valley: "Ask yourself, 'If I didn't achieve my goal last year, what got in the way? What's going to make it different this time?"
<P>"Resolutions are basically about setting goals, and that is a learned skill," she said. "Most of us were taught as children to aim from the start to set goals that were virtually unachievable, leading us to incorrectly interpreting that nonachievement as personal failure."
<P>Barnes recommends initially establishing a general direction for growth, such as wanting to be more positive, organized, or to develop more self-love.
<P>"Base your resolution on the direction you want to go. That way, any step taken in that direction can be viewed with pride as forward progress,"she said.
<P>When establishing a specific, short-term goal, be sure it is achievable (do I believe I can do this?), manageable (will this work with my lifestyle?) and measurable (how will I know when it is done?), Barnes said.
<P>This year, as in years' past, one of the most common resolutions is to become more fit. It also is one of the most shattered goals. How can you make this year different?
<P>"What we need to remember is exercise is a lifelong commitment. It is absolutely necessary to maintain a healthy body, mind and spirit," said Monica Avilla, a Nevada City fitness instructor and trainer.
<P>Where people err is they set unrealistic fitness regimes for themselves.
<P>"Try doing aerobics three times a week - going to the gym every other day," Avilla said.  By going easy on the body, "you also don't burn out."
<P>Above all, trainers and counselors say New Year's resolutions should be rewarding and gratifying.
<P>Barnes suggests avoiding resolutions that begin with "I should," "I ought to," "I must," or "I'm supposed to." Those beginnings require a level of judgment. Instead, set a goal with what you want to accomplish. 
<P>"Immediately, the focus shifts to being invested in it with a focus on the positive," Barnes said. "That puts you in a forward motion."
<P>

<H2>Local watercolorist's calendar sold nationally, internationally</H2>
<STRONG>By James Nash - Wed, Jan 1, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->The peaceful Victorian scenes that grace Jerianne Van Dijk's 1997 calendar include some of Nevada County's better-known and more obscure landmarks.
<P>But an buyer of her calendar, "Cottage Gardens," may have trouble recognizing exactly where the scenes were set. And Van Dijk intended it that way.
<P>"These are all nice scenes, very peaceful and small-town," she said. "I kind of wanted to universalize it."
<P>The calendar, Van Dijk's first under her own name, is being sold across the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. It includes watercolor portraits of homes on Nevada Street and West Broad Street in Nevada City and of the Stewart House Restaurant in Grass Valley.
<P>Unless they saw Van Dijk stationed outside their houses with an easel and paintbrush, the owners of the Nevada City homes may be surprised to find their properties portrayed in "Cottage Gardens."
<P>"I just sat there all day and painted, what they call 'plein-air,'" Van Dijk said. "I never told (the owners) that I did their house."
<P>Van Dijk, who lives near Alta Sierra, has done watercolors ranging from gallery pieces to floral embellishments on cheap dishes. She also designs furniture and wallpaper.
<P>Van Dijk specializes in the watercolor medium, but she also dabbles in colored pencil and pastels.
<P>She has pursued her artistic ambitions on two levels: fine art and illustrations. The first satisfies her creative urge; the second pays the bills.
<P>"I went from fine art and realized you just don't make money doing it," she said. "I want to do work that's in demand and make a living."
<P>Van Dijk has illustrated several calendars for Lynn Hollyn, a producer who employs several "ghost" artists. Hollyn instructed Van Dijk to render her scenes in almost excruciating detail, to the point of visual overkill.
<P>"I did it knowing it was too much," Van Dijk said. "You just have to do what they tell you to do. They have several artists that they want to emit the same look."
<P>Van Dijk has done graphic design her whole adult life, but didn't discover watercolor until about 12 years ago. After several years in the Netherlands, she and her husband returned to Nevada County in 1981, with the help of money Van Dijk had earned designing greeting cards.
<P>She currently is working on wine labels for Indian Springs Winery and illustrating scenes of coffee for an upcoming book on the beverage. Van Dijk will not produce a 1998 calendar.
<P>In the meantime, a few copies of her 1997 calendar remain at the Bookseller, Mountain Song and the Indian Springs tasting room. Van Dijk, who flouts the stereotype of the starving artist, wouldn't mind if all those copies sell.
<P>"I think that today, there's artwork on everything, and there's money to be made," she said. "Hey, why not?"

<H2>Cab companies, MADD sponsor free rides home for revelers</H2>
<STRONG>By David Sneed - Tue, Dec 31, 1996</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Durham Transportation and the local chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving will offer free rides home tonight for revelers who have had too much to drink.
<P>Durham Transportation's Dial-A-Ride cab service will donate the services of two taxis in the Grass Valley and Nevada City areas for New Year's Eve, said Paul Manuel, one of the MADD organizers of the event.
<P>Revelers who have been drinking and need a ride home can call 477-RIDE to summon one of the cabs, which will display magnetic signs advertising the service. Fliers have been sent to barkeepers in the Grass Valley and Nevada City area, announcing the service, Manuel said.
<P>Last year, between 30 and 40 people were given free rides home through this program, Manuel said. Although it is impossible to quantify the benefits of such a program, MADD estimates that two of every five Americans will be involved in an alcohol-related crash at some time in their lives.
<P>"Hopefully, it made a difference last year, and hopefully it will make a difference again this year," Manuel said.

<H2>1996: Top stories of Nevada County</H2>
<STRONG>By The Union Staff - Tue, Dec 31, 1996</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->A murder trial, a fatal shooting, deformed frogs, a real estate financial mess, election stunts and unusual law enforcement investigations.
<P>Nevada County in 1996 produced the kind of news that big media organizations love to follow. News publications coast to coast and across the state, and television throughout California, covered these stories.
<P>The Wildwood Estates bond fiasco, which was detailed in-depth in the San Francisco Chronicle's Sunday section in November, was one of many less-than-flattering reports of news from Nevada County. The conviction of Sam Strange for bludgeoning to death two 16-year-old girls, Kimberly Saunders' disappearance, the fatal shooting of a Nevada County man by an off-duty Sacramento County Sheriff's deputy, the Nevada County criminal case against Pacific Gas and Electric, and judicial candidate Bob Litchfield's foot-washing offer also piqued the curiosity of out-of-town reporters and at least one late-night TV talk-show host.
<P>It might appear as if Nevada County had produced an unusual volume of big news in 1996.
<P>Vlae Kershner, regional editor of The Chronicle, said rural California counties routinely generate stories of state and national interest. The Sierra foothill communities' combinations of old residents and new urban refugees and rapid population growth tend to produce "some colorful people" and colorful stories, he said.
<P>"You seem to have a pretty good news area, and population growth (makes it) better for news," Kershner said of Nevada County.
<P>Bill Bauman, news director for Sacramento television station KCRA Channel 3, said viewers may have noticed more coverage of Nevada County this year, but the stories themselves did not cause coverage to increase. He said about a 1 1/2 years ago, Channel 3's news team shifted resources to increase coverage of counties outside of metro Sacramento.
<P>"We realized we were covering too much Sacramento news and not enough from counties like San Joaquin, Stanislaus and Nevada County," he said. "I would say, when we made a decision to reach out (to the Sierra foothills), we discovered some interesting things."
<P>Then again, Bauman admitted his station does not break much news in the Sierra foothills.
<P>"We get all of your newspapers," he said.
<P>Skip Lusk, executive officer of the Nevada County Board of Realtors, said negative news coverage from outside Nevada County probably did not significantly affect Nevada County's positive public image.
<P>"I haven't heard anyone suggest it's spoiling the image of Nevada County," Lusk said. "My take is that most people who follow Nevada County are interested in us because they've come here. ... Tourists don't come up here and worry about whether Sam Strange killed those girls."
<P>Nevada County Supervisor Fran Grattan, however, is concerned about all the negative press.
<P>"I'm concerned that an image of Nevada County is being portrayed contrary to the wholesome values we have in our community. Certainly, having bad news is not good news. This kind of news is not positive for our citizens," she said.
<P>Grattan said she hopes other coverage would "provide a positive balance so people can see the real, true values of Nevada County."
<P>Nevada County news - positive or negative - will likely continue to be widely reported. Kershner said the days when murders and other big stories in rural California counties would remain local has long passed, with the creation of vast news networks and instant reporting.
<P>"There aren't any secrets in California," he said. 

<P>
<HR>
<P>CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS:
<P>MINICK SHOOTING
<P>A Sacramento man's visit to his parent's Penn Valley home turned tragic on Aug. 11.
<P>An off-duty Sacramento County Sheriff's deputy, Shawn Joyce, was teaching his sons how to shoot that evening when, according to Joyce and members of his family, Michael Minick charged him and his 13-year-old son. Joyce said he feared Minick was out of control and might grab his son's .22 caliber rifle.
<P>Joyce told investigators, and later a criminal grand jury, that he fired in self-defense and that he could not physically defend himself because he was recovering from surgery to his right hand. Minick, who was unarmed, died of six gunshot wounds from Joyce's .380 handgun.
<P>The Sheriff's Department's handling of the case angered Minick's friends and family and community members, who argue investigators went out of their way to depict Minick, a parolee, as a dangerous felon. They also point out that Minick, 31, was shot twice in the back. Joyce, who said his police training taught him to shoot in rapid bursts, said Minick never turned away from him.
<P>District Attorney Mike Ferguson argued for a manslaughter indictment, but grand jurors split 8 to 4 against indicting Joyce.
<P>Reacting to the outcry over the two cases, Ferguson has asked the state attorney general's office to review his handling of convicted murderer Sam Strange and Joyce.

<P><HR>
<P>SAUNDERS DEATH
<P>It remains unclear exactly what angered Kimberly Saunders enough that she demanded to be let out of a friend's pickup truck on a remote road in the mountains above Washington in the predawn of Oct. 27.
<P>But the results were tragic - and controversial.
<P>The 36-year-old Napa woman disappeared on Gaston Grade Road about 1 a.m. Oct. 27. Her body was found three weeks later, lying face up in a small creek. Drowning and exposure remain possibilities, but no cause of death has been confirmed.
<P>Saunders' family will likely never let the Sheriff's Department forget a decision to call off a ground search the next day. That decision was based mainly on a report from a woman who claimed she stopped her car and briefly talked to a woman she identified as Saunders from a photograph. People who deliberately make themselves "missing" are not rarities to sheriff's deputies, and as sightings continued coming in, the department, despite the family's protests, turned the search into a missing-person investigation.
<P>Since the discovery of Saunders' body, her family has recruited the support of their state senator, Mike Thompson, to investigate the case.
<P>Thompson's staff is putting together a chronology of events and is talking to the federal Justice Department about an investigation of the Nevada County Sheriff's Department and the state Attorney General's Office.
<P>OOO
<P>SAM STRANGE CONVICTION
<P>After 1 1/2 years, the case of the People vs. Samuel Arola Strange ended Feb. 7 when a jury convicted the 22-year-old for the murders of Crissy Campbell and Dawn Donaldson.
<P>The two 16-year-old girls were last seen alive when a friend dropped them off at Strange's rural Grass Valley home. The jury agreed with District Attorney Michael Ferguson's argument that Strange killed the two girls.
<P>But the verdict was a short-lived conclusion to the case. Many in the community rallied to Strange's cause, and Strange himself told a Superior Court judge in June that two of his acquaintances, Alan Pettus and Dameon Graham, were the real killers. Strange said the two men had threatened the lives of his family if he did not cover up the murders and that he lied to Nevada County Sheriff's detectives out of fear. Pettus and Graham deny any involvement in the slayings, and have not been charged with the crimes.
<P>Superior Court Judge John Darlington denied a request for a new trial and in September sentenced Strange to two consecutive 15-year-to-life terms in state prison. Now in a southern California state prison, Strange maintains his innocence and is appealing the conviction.

<P>OOO
<P>THE ENVIRONMENT:
<P>DEFORMED FROGS
<P>Nevada County made nationwide headlines in a bizarre fashion in October when a population of deformed bullfrogs turned up in a San Juan Ridge pond.
<P>Children playing at an old mill pond near Malakoff Diggins State Historic Park noticed some of the frogs were grotesquely deformed. They caught a few of the weird-looking critters and showed them to their mother, who reported the discovery to authorities. Some of the frogs had extra or stunted limbs while others had deformed eyes and mouths.
<P>The frogs gained instant nationwide fame because similarly deformed frogs were popping up all over the nation, and scientists were baffled and concerned. Frogs are low on the food chain, live in water and have soft permeable skin. For these reasons, scientists believe they can be harbingers of environmental disaster.
<P>The outre discovery caused herpetologists, fishery biologists and environmental health specialists to flock to the pond in an effort to figure out what was going wrong. Leading the flock was Charles Dailey, a biology instructor at Sierra College.
<P>He quickly developed a theory. The deformities were probably not being caused by toxic contamination or a hole in the ozone layer. Rather, a small parasitic worm called a fluke was probably to blame, he said.
<P>The flukes burrow into the frogs during their formative tadpole stage. As a defensive measure, the frogs form a hard cyst around the fluke. If the cyst forms at the frog's leg bud, it causes the leg to bifurcate, or stunt as it grows.
<P>The phenomenon is not a new one, said John Hiscox, a state fishery biologist. Scientists have even been able to duplicate the deforming effect of the cysts by implanting small resin balls into tadpoles and watching them as they develop.
<P>Other scientists are drawing conclusions similar to Dailey's. But no one has figured out why the fluke has proliferated to the degree it can cause so many deformities.
<P>Dailey plans to return to the pond in the spring to take additional samples. He hopes to isolate the fluke and prove it is the cause of the deformities.
<P>OOO
<P>PG&E LAWSUIT
<P>Nevada County is the host of a David-and-Goliath courtroom struggle that has attracted statewide attention.
<P>The Nevada County district attorney's office is pursuing a 700-plus count criminal case against Pacific Gas and Electric for allegedly violating state regulations requiring that power lines be kept clear of brush and tree branches. The case originated with the 1994 Trauner Fire in Rough and Ready. Fire investigators pinpointed the cause as a tree branch growing into power lines.
<P>If PG&E loses the case, other counties are standing in line with similar suits, and the company could face millions of dollars in fines.
<P>Representatives of PG&E say the utility is doing everything it can to maintain thousands of miles of lines and that it has doubled its tree-trimming budget.
<P>A jury trial has been set for Feb. 25.

<P>OOO
<P>GENERAL INTEREST:
<P>CHARTER SCHOOLS
<P>The county's 10 charter schools received attention from the San Francisco Chronicle in November as an example of how public education is becoming creative.
<P>The Chronicle noted that western Nevada County has more charters than any other California county except for Los Angeles, which also has 10. Nevada County has about 500 students in charter schools.
<P>Educators say charter schools are so popular here because they provide flexibility and choice. Charters also emphasize the role of parents in helping to determine what and how their children learn.
<P>State legislators set up the charter school program in 1992,  initially granting 100 charters.
<P>Once a school district secures a charter, the schools are created by groups of parents, teachers and district officials. The schools receive public funds, yet do not have to comply with the burdensome, 6,000-page state education code. A school's charter, which outlines what students are to learn and how the school is to be run, can be revoked if it fails to meet organizers' goals.
<P>OOO
<P>LITCHFIELD FOOT WASHING
<P>Grass Valley attorney Bob Litchfield put Nevada County on the nation's legal map with a single, two-page letter distributed in April.
<P>The judicial candidate finished second in the March primary behind Kathy Butz, despite a Nevada County Bar survey that ranked him near the bottom. After the primary, Litchfield mass-mailed a letter to Nevada County attorneys stating the results had sent a message to him: that he had offended some of his colleagues. As a gesture of his desire to serve them, he offered to wash the feet of every attorney in the county.
<P>Nobody took him up on the offer, but the story ended up in legal newspapers in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Talk-show host David Letterman invited Litchfield to appear on his show (Litchfield declined), and, finally, Playboy magazine used the offer as a short news blurb in a recent issue.
<P>OOO
<P>WILDWOOD ESTATES
<P>For almost two years, the Securities and Exchange Commission has been considering some kind of action against Nevada County regarding a $9.07 million bond issue.
<P>SEC officials have been mum on the subject and, to date, there has been no official action taken. On Monday, County Counsel James Flageollet said he still had heard nothing from the SEC.
<P>"I'm not sure what the delay is," Flageollet said. "Typically, they would have made a determination by now."
<P>The SEC is investigating accusations that Nevada County misled investors in a 1990 issue of $9.07 million in bonds to fund roads and utilities at the Wildwood Estates development.
<P>In December 1995, the SEC offered the county a cease-and-desist order, which the county reportedly rejected. The order would have allowed the county to say it neither admitted nor denied the SEC findings, which could have lowered the county's bond rating.
<P>Developer Michael Montross never built any homes at Wildwood Estates, the bonds defaulted, and a new developer has taken over the project. Montross is being held in the San Mateo County jail on $5 million bail on another case. Prosecutors contend Montross defrauded 30 real estate investors.
<P>Stories in finance trade journals and the mainstream press, including the Los Angeles Times and the San Francisco Chronicle, used the Wildwood Estates bond default as an example of troubles in the world of municipal finance.

<H2>Four awarded rank of Eagle Scout</H2>
<STRONG>By Susan Lauer - Mon, Jan 6, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Four Biy Scouts became Eagle Scouts in Varsity Troop 832 during a ceremony with Congressman Wally Herger in attendance.
<P>To earn the award, the scouts had to complete complex community service projects.
<P>Shawn Percey, 17, a senior at Nevada Union, designed and supervised the construction and installation of a new sign for Pleasant Valley School. In addition to creating the sign's design, he supervised 10 youths and three adults.
<P>Matthew Spitler, 16, a sophomore at Bear River High School, restored a hiking trail for the Empire Mine State Park in Grass Valley. He surveyed the work, developed an operational concept and coordinated the trail restoration with minimal supervision from park personnel. Spitler supervised 10 youths and two adults in finishing the project over a two weekend period.

<H2>Four teens overpower supervisor, steal a van</H2>
<STRONG>By Shawn Neidorf - Mon, Jan 6, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Four teen-age boys living at a private residence for troubled youth tied up their supervisor and stole the facility's van Saturday night.
<P>The boys remain at large, Nevada County Assistant Sheriff John Trauner said this morning. The boys were living at Pioneer House on Fletcher Lane, off Meadow View Drive in the Peardale area.
<P>According to Trauner, the teens overtook their supervisor, Roger Mills, 41, at about 11 p.m. 
<P>They surrounded him, yanked him from the couch to the floor and tied his hands and feet, Trauner said. They also took the keys to the van. They then ransacked the office and house, taking about $12 from the safe and food. The van is a 1992 gray Dodge Grand Caravan, bearing California license plate number 2ELY854.
<P>A 6 a.m. telephone call reported they had been spotted in Benicia, Trauner said. One of the boys is from the North San Juan area, one from Napa, one from King City and another from Hollister, Trauner said noted.
<P>It took Mills about seven minutes to free himself and call deputies Saturday night, according to the assistant sheriff.
<P>Three of the boys are 16, one is 15. Two are Hispanic, two are Caucasian. All are described as having brown hair and eyes. One of the Caucasian boys is 6 feet 1 inch tall, weighing 205 pounds. He was last seen wearing jeans and a gray sweatshirt. The other Caucasian boy is 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighs 140 pounds. He was last seen wearing blue jeans. One of the Hispanic boys is described as being 5 feet 6 inches tall and weighing 139 pounds. He was wearing jeans and a black sweater. The other Hispanic boy is 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighs 215 pounds. He was last seen wearing blue jeans and a sweatshirt.
<P>The van theft followed two previous incidents that night at Pioneer House -.a fight and an attempted suicide.

<H2>Bicycle clue to GV burglary arrest</H2>
<STRONG>By Will Holbert - Wed, Jan 1, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->A suspect in a Grass Valley burglary apparently waited a little too long before leaving the scene of a break-in early Tuesday -  and the delay landed him in the Nevada County jail.
<P>At 6:42 a.m., the owner of Grass Valley Transfer, a moving and storage company, arrived at his Bank Street business and noticed signs of a break-in, according to Grass Valley Police Capt. Jerod Johnson.
<P>The owner called police, who arrived quickly from the nearby police station. Arriving officers noticed a bicycle in the parking lot. They did not think much of it until they noticed the bicycle  missing a few minutes later, Johnson said.
<P>Then they noticed a man quickly pedaling away down Stewart Street, which runs past the back of the police station. An arrest quickly followed.
<P>Officers suspect the bicyclist, Kenneth Ray Ewing, 40, of Grass Valley, of breaking into Grass Valley Transfer and an adjacent business, Nelda and Lennie's Dance Center. Johnson said officers matched Ewing's shoe prints to ones found inside the businesses and matched items stolen to items, including jewelry and candy, found on Ewing.
<P>But officers still do not know why a burglar would wait so long inside a business. The building's were entered sometime after 10:30 p.m. Monday night.
<P>"To tell you the truth, we think, since it was warm and dry, Mr. Ewing might have fallen asleep. It's a possibility," Johnson said.
<P>Ewing was booked on suspicion of felony burglary and a parole violation.

<H2>Trio held for investigation into bank robbery</H2>
<STRONG>By Will Holbert - Tue, Dec 31, 1996</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->A man and two teen-age boys who are believed to have robbed Home Savings of America on Dec. 21 were arrested Monday by Nevada County Sheriff's investigators.
<P>Investigators already knew who they wanted Monday afternoon from tips they had received. They found their suspects at 3 p.m. outside Lake Wildwood, watching water pour over the Lake Wildwood dam from a vista point off Pleasant Valley Road.
<P>The suspected robbers surrendered without a struggle, according to a Sheriff's Department press release. The adult was identified as 26-year-old Kristopher Perry Foreman, a construction worker from Alta Sierra. Foreman was booked for investigation of robbery, criminal conspiracy and giving a police officer false identification. Bail was set at $25,750.
<P>Two boys, ages 15 and 17, were booked into county juvenile hall on similar charges. A fourth 17-year-old boy was arrested but cleared of any involvement after questioning, said Assistant Sheriff John Trauner.
<P>The boys are from the Grass Valley area, according to a press release. Their names were withheld because they are minors.
<P>The group was found with a white, 1985 Ford Tempo at the time of their arrest, the same kind of car seen leaving the bank parking lot after the robbery.
<P>The bank was robbed on a Saturday afternoon during a snowstorm. Three gunmen entered the Glenbrook Basin bank, and each approached a teller and demanded money. They fled with about $8,500.
<P>Investigators did not recover any weapons Monday, but they did find $2,600 in cash, according to the press release.
<P>Trauner said information from the community played a vital role in the investigation, which is ongoing. Investigators put together a number of tips that led them to Monday's arrests.
<P>"Concerned citizens gave us information that proved to be useful. We had a number of citizens who gave us similar bits of information, and we were able to piece together the puzzle," Trauner said.

<H2>Hero stops would-be suicide's plunge off overpass</H2>
<STRONG>By James Nash - Tue, Dec 31, 1996</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->An off-duty Alta firefighter collared a suicidal man shortly after midnight Monday in Colfax and yanked him from a freeway overpass as the man was about to leap to his death.
<P>Tim Milam, a volunteer firefighter who was stopping for gasoline at a Chevron station next to an overpass in Colfax, spotted a drunken man at about 12:30 a.m. Monday leaning over the I-80 overpass. The man threatened to jump in front of a truck.
<P>With no one else at the scene to prevent the 27-year-old man from taking his own life, Milam approached the man, who responded with an obscene gesture.
<P>"I said, 'Here, let me move you out to the center of the lane so you'll make a better target,'" Milam recalled. "That freaked him out. He said, 'Huh?'"
<P>At that point, the man was dangling from the overpass, holding on with only his fingers. He continued to insist he would leap in front of the next passing semi-truck.
<P>With a truck approaching, Milam grabbed the man's hair in one hand and his belt in the other, pulling him from the overpass. Milam then jumped on top of the man and restrained him while Milam's girlfriend, who was in the car, summoned police.
<P>A Placer County sheriff's deputy arrived at the scene about a half-hour after Milam had first approached the man. The man was handcuffed and taken to jail for a 72-hour hold, according to a Placer County Sheriff's report.
<P>"He kept screaming that he would commit suicide by whatever means possible," said Sgt. Rick Armstrong.
<P>The would-be suicide, whose name was not released, was booked on charges of disorderly conduct and public intoxication.
<P>Milam said there was never any question the man would act out his threats. Although the motive for committing suicide wasn't clear, Milam said the man was mumbling in resignation about missing a court appearance.
<P>A driver who witnessed the scene after stopping at the Chevron station praised Milam's courage in saving the man's life.
<P>"That took some strength and adrenaline, both," said Brent Johnson, who happened across the suicidal man after Johnson  had stopped to buy cigarettes. "I wouldn't have even considered it. I wanted to help (the suicidal man), but I didn't want to go down with him."
<P> Milam, who had spent five years as an airborne ranger in the military, said he knew from the beginning to play mind games with the suicidal man instead of pleading with him to save his life.
<P>"You have to keep them off guard," Milam said. "Do something they wouldn't expect."
<P>Milam said that while he did not want to witness the plunge to death, he was not solely concerned with the welfare of the man.
<P>"I didn't want the truck driver coming home for New Year's having a bad day," Milam said.
<P>

<H2>New year's stormy beginning was serious challenge for many </H2>
<STRONG>By Tamara Isaacson - Mon, Jan 6, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Happy New Year! It's ironic to think that we ended 1996 with rain and floods then welcomed 1997 with the same conditions. This is ironic because many people think of New Year's as a time to start over and a time to get a second chance. Resolutions are made in hope that some people may change their lives, but most resolves are usually broken.
<P>How did you ring in the new year? Were you one of the many people who went to a party and rang it in with celebration? Or were you one of the people who went out to a nice dinner with family or friends? Many people stayed home and watched television or played family games, but we cannot forget those people who decided to ring in the new year with lots of sleep. Other people didn't have what you may call "a good time" ringing in the new year.
<P>Many of my friends went to parties or had friends over to their houses, while others sang songs and rang in the new year by candlelight due to power outages. For New Year's, my sister went to her friend's house, and I stayed home with my stepfather, mother, little brother and sister. My brother and sister didn't make it to watch the ball drop in Times Square, but neither did my stepdad because he had been awake since 3 that morning and fell asleep in his chair.
<P>While some people were ringing in the new year, others were desperately attempting to keep their homes from being flooded by rivers that exceeded their banks. On New Year's Day I went with my family on a drive partly to buy a new computer program, but also to look at all the high water.
<P>I was amazed by the amount of water that filled each small indention by the road. I was shocked to find rivers that I never knew existed, or rivers that had possibly just found their place in the world. My heart went out to all those people whose houses were under 2 to 3 feet of water. I also hoped that the people I saw lining the perimeters of their houses with sandbags kept their houses safe and dry.
<P>On Dec. 30, I received my driver's license and, because I am now driving myself around, I have paid a lot of attention to road conditions. I took my driving test in the rain, then noticed that in order to be safe, people need to slow down in this type of weather. With roads flooded, it is always a precaution to stay out of puddles due to the fact that we don't always know how deep that puddle really is, or even if it has a strong current that could force you off the road.
<P>Looking more to the positive side, I hope that everyone has started 1997 with something good. I hope that everyone whose house was flooded has found a way to enjoy themselves and have fun this new year!

<H2>A runner can enjoy natural surroundings  </H2>
<STRONG>By Paul Shigley - Fri, Jan 3, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Early last month, I departed on a long run through Empire Mine State Historic Park and the surrounding area despite threatening skies and trails that were already quite muddy.
<P>After about an hour, the rain started falling. Within 30 or 40 minutes, I was soaked. I couldn't keep droplets off my glasses. A few misplaced steps led to my feet getting good and drenched. Yet I kept going.
<P>The park was a very different place than it was a few months earlier, when bushes wilted in the hot, dry weather and a fine dust covered everything. 
<P>On this day, the park looked fresh and clean. Birds flitted through the manzanita and seasonal creeks gurgled.
<P>Later in the month, I ran through the park during a driving snow storm. The footing was firm where the snow piled up. So long as I kept shaking the flakes from my jacket, I stayed fairly dry. At other times, though, the snow was wetter and an inch or two of slush covered the trail. The wind tore through my wet clothing.
<P>But the sight of snow blowing sideways over Grass Valley and through the towering pines was so breathtaking I stopped in my tracks more than once. I encountered about a dozen other people on foot who were also enjoying the winter scene.
<P>Last weekend, I was in Marin County for a trail race in and around Mount Tamalpais State Park. Although no precipitation fell during the race, days of rain had turned miles of the trail into shoe-sucking muck. Small puddles formed everywhere and some creek crossings were a bit intimidating.
<P>Still, the whole area felt amazingly vital. Every seasonal creek was full. Waterfalls smashed through steep gullies. Dense oak and eucalyptus groves smelled heavenly. The wind carried a taste of salt from the ocean.
<P>New Year's Day found me back in Empire Mine park. I just had to see how the park was faring during the driving rainstorm that had started four days earlier.
<P>My "rainproof" jacket was worthless within minutes, and my shoes got so wet that the insoles were sliding around. 
<P>But - as you can guess by now - I was happy to be out there.
<P>I saw new streams pouring through the underbrush. Every dirt road and trail had become a creek. I watched with jaw agape as Little Wolf Creek pounded over a footbridge that appeared to be barely staying in place. Trees appeared threatening as they swayed in the wind, and broken branches lay scattered everywhere.
<P>The moral of the story here is this: There is no substitute for being out there.
<P>Sure, you can lose weight and improve your cardiovascular system by running on a treadmill or pedaling a stationary bicycle. Step aerobics classes can turn you into a lean machine. Pumping iron can give you massive muscles and a washboard stomach. I'm not knocking any of those activities.
<P>But, no matter the conditions, I'll take my exercise in the outdoors every time. 
<P>Rain in the face and soaked clothes, or, conversely, scorching sun and sweat in the eyes - it all makes for a fuller experience.
<P>You will never leap over babbling brooks, watch rabbits hopping across the forest floor or get screamed at by territorial squirrels while you are in the weight room. 
<P>You will never smell the fresh rain, stop on a dime at the sight of a rattlesnake or watch a bright red sunset from a big hill during an aerobics class.
<P>People are always asking me why I keep heading out the door to run when the weather is so wet.
<P>I don't know exactly how to respond except to ask - How can I not?

<H2>Class-size reduction beneficial, but can Wilson claim credit? </H2>
<STRONG>By Doug Willis - Mon, Jan 6, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Gov. Pete Wilson is taking a lot of credit he doesn't fully deserve for his popular program of reducing class sizes in early elementary grades.
<P>But that's fair, because Wilson has taken a lot of blame over the past six years for things which weren't his fault. A national recession, over which he obviously had no control, for example, led him simultaneously to raise taxes and cut services, prompting criticism from liberals and conservatives.
<P>The recovery from that recession has given the state billions of dollars in extra tax revenue, and the Proposition 98 amendments to the state Constitution enacted by voters in 1988 compel Wilson to give 60 percent of that revenue to schools.
<P>Rather than simply increasing school appropriations and letting local districts decide how to spend the money, Wilson unveiled a plan last summer earmarking most of the extra money to reduce kindergarten through third grade class sizes from nearly 30 pupils per teacher to fewer than 20.
<P>His initial announcement was a full-scale political extravaganza. When the Legislature rejected his proposal for a 15 percent cut in corporate and personal income taxes, that forced Wilson to give even more money to schools, and there was another grand announcement.
<P>Wilson will unveil his budget proposal for the 1997-98 fiscal year this week, and all indications point to another significant increase in tax revenues, 60 percent again earmarked for local schools.
<P>The Republican governor is again pulling out all the stops announcing an expansion of the class-size-reduction program and taking full credit.
<P>Wilson gave a budget-preview speech last week in which he promised another $1.2 billion to nearly double the program to cover an estimated 1.8 million children. Press secretary Sean Walsh says it will be one of the highlights of Tuesday's State-of-the-State address.
<P>''We have the resources to do it. The school districts have demonstrated the will to make it happen. There's no reason to hold them back and every reason to move forward,'' Wilson said, describing the program as ''a revolution in the classroom'' and ''a time for new hope'' for California children.
<P>But in reality, Wilson is only telling local schools how they must spend the extra money that the state is compelled to give them.
<P>''We are not exceeding the Proposition 98 guarantees,'' Walsh conceded. ''Yes, we are setting priorities of how children should be taught.''
<P>Some Wilson critics also say his proposal has serious flaws, and they see a hidden agenda to prevent schools from spending too much of the extra money on pay raises for teachers.
<P>''He's got a grudge against the teacher unions that won't quit. He'll go to any length to punish them. I'm not saying that's his whole motive, but its got to be part of it,'' said one school advocate who declined to be identified because she said she has to try to work with Wilson's administration.
<P>The most serious potential flaws involving finding enough qualified teachers, robbing other school programs to pay for the smaller elementary classes and providing space for the new classes.
<P>Some schools have had problems finding qualified teachers, but most say they have done surprisingly well. They have been helped, among other things, by teachers delaying or coming out of retirement, attracted by the opportunity to teach more effectively in smaller classes.
<P>The class-size reductions pinch other programs because the state doesn't pay the full cost. Instead, the state pays about 80 percent as an incentive for local districts to participate, which means they must cut elsewhere. But 95 percent of California's local districts have opted to join the program on those terms, saying the long-term benefits of smaller K-3 classrooms outweigh cuts in programs for upper grades.
<P>Wilson's plan also pays only $25,000 for each new temporary class building, or about half the total cost.
<P>His proposal for the next fiscal year increases that to $40,000 per building, but would be financed by part of a $2 billion bond issue which wouldn't be submitted to voters until June 1998. That means local districts would have to put up the money first and hope state funds would be there to reimburse them.
<P>But most parents, teachers and school officials are excited about Wilson's class-size-reduction program.
<P>''It's been wonderful. I've been teaching 14 years, and this is the first time I've had fewer than 30 children,'' said Cheryl Hollis, a first grade teacher in Elk Grove, told Wilson when he visited her classroom. ''I've been able to move these children faster (through the curriculum) than any class in my career.''
<P>Although state schools chief Delaine Eastin failed to persuade Wilson to raise funding from 80 to 100 percent of operating costs and to endorse a $3 billion bond issue instead of $2 billion, she still described his proposal for the coming year as ''very positive.''
<P>''This is the most exciting time (for schools) in 20 or 30 years,'' said Eastin, a Democrat who has been at odds with Wilson often in recent years.
<P>Although some troublesome details suggest that the class-size program may not be quite the be-all and end-all that Wilson's rhetoric suggests, there is no doubt that the program is real, and the benefits are real.

<!-- story -->Sierra Nevada Memorial 
<P>Last month I had to go to emergency at our wonderful hospital for what turned out to be a heart attack. This was on November 20, one of the wildest, busiest days our ER has ever seen. There is no way I can praise highly enough the skilled and caring treatment I received. There was Becky, who checked me in; Dr. Zimmerman, the nurses and technicians in ER; and Dr. Mallery who skillfully and firmly informed me of my condition and treatment needed. That night in ICU my nurse, Katey, could not have been better in any way - tender, caring and skilled. A "mended" heartfelt thank you to all.

<P>Sierra Services supporters
<P>Sierra Services for the Blind wants to thank those who have made a large difference to the blind and visually impaired of our community for the Holidays.

<P>Care facility contributors
<P>On behalf of the 350 plus residents of the extended care facilities in western Nevada County, we thank the following people and businesses for their ongoing generosity: those who donated money to purchase gifts, those who came and wrapped those 1,000 plus gifts, and those who shared their love on Christmas morning to distribute those gifts. A special thanks to Jerry Eilers of Long's Drugs who acts as our personal angel to make sure everyone gets something special or needed; the women who shared their talents of crocheting and knitting to create the beautiful lap robes; "Santa George" and "Santa Glen" for always being there year after year with lots of warmth and love, KNCO and The Union for spreading the information about this special event.

<H2>Misses real dancing</H2>
<STRONG>By Ron Gaddis - Mon, Jan 6, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->
<P>Ever try to dance the macaroni? I know it's called the macarania but I have trouble remembering some words. I have even more difficulty doing it. Want to feel like a dork - try it. I did it once and was reminded that most of my hair was gone. I stuck a finger in my ear, there was more blubber on my sides than I thought. My ear-end felt like a rhino's and I was no longer able to hop. I would be doing one thing and everyone else something different than me. I said to myself, "you dork, you've thoroughly embarrassed yourself." Now that I had sort of felt myself up, I was ready for some real dancing. You know the kind where a couple hold each other and glide around the dance floor. I for one would prefer to hold and squeeze a beautiful woman rather than myself. I will never dance alone again unless I'm at home with the blinds closed. I'm going to buy myself a wig, go on a diet, join a gym and learn how to hop. Just maybe I'll be able to get rid of the blubber and rhino butt. If only I could stop eating so many "Macarania nuts." This will be my New Years Revolution.

<H2>Evidence supports recall</H2>
<STRONG>By Earl Hamlin - Mon, Jan 6, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->
<P>In the past weeks I have seen the articles by our district attorney stating the people are using half truths, lack of evidence and misunderstanding of the case for making their judgments of the Minick case, but I would like to ask Mr. Ferguson to explain the evidence in the autopsy report made after the killing. I have seen the report and it is very clear that this was not a case of self defense. The diagram of the body and the shots show without doubt two shots in the back on a 60 degree upward angle. The officer on television stated the victim never turned his back to him at any time. I can only conclude that he was not man enough to stand up and charge the off-duty officer without a grand jury or he was under orders not to charge. I would like to hear about this half-truth, lack of evidence or misunderstanding in person or in The Union.
<P>I think this evidence is enough to support recall of our district attorney, not to mention any of the other cases that have been "half-truths, lack of evidence or misunderstanding" by our officials.

<P>I would like to disagree with your editorial regarding PG&E and tree cutting.
<P>Their contractor has done an excellent job this past year trimming trees in the Cascade Shores area. They have to work within a legal easement and also fight the environmentalists who do not want any trees cut. They also do not have any control over "Mother Nature," heavy wet snow, rain and strong winds. 
<P>I know of one instance where an oak tree, 50 feet from the power line, fell into a power line because of saturated soil and wet snow. It was nowhere near their legal right of way. Please, get all the facts.

<H2>Lights are uplifting</H2>

<!-- photo stuff -->

<!-- story -->
<P>I love the outside Christmas lights which people put on their homes and businesses. I offer my appreciation for the lovely displays. The lights bring me hope and brightness in this time of year when we have less light from the sun. When I see Christmas lights I feel that people are sharing their own light and connectedness with the human family. I am always sad to see the lights disappear in January and would love the lights to stay up all winter. I am appealing to keepers of the lights. Please leave your lights up this winter because they bring such joy. If you feel the same way, spread the word to friends and neighbors. Let's have Nevada County be a beacon of light for others, a county of the lights. Happy New Year. May all your dreams come true.

<P>This is in response to "Two teens arrested after rooftop climb."
<P>Fifteen- and 16-year-old "boys" were apprehended on suspicion of prowling and breaking curfew, then released to their parents.
<P>Whew, that was close. If one or both had been injured, the lawyers and parents would be claiming child endangerment for the owners  maintaining an attractive nuisance and the incident would probably end in an award in favor of the boys, despite their trespassing in violation of the law.

<H2>A few ways to keep yourself busy during the winter doldrums</H2>
<STRONG>By Mike Royko - Mon, Jan 6, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story --><EM>(While Mike Royko is on vacation we're reprinting some old favorites. This column originally ran on Jan. 11, 1981.)</EM>
<P>We've entered the dullest, most depressing time of the year in Chicago. People suffer from the post-holiday blahs. The miserable weather keeps us indoors. Election excitement is over. Football is winding down and baseball hasn't started. Wallets have been tapped out by Christmas spending and the Social Security bite.
<P>So the question we face is how to glide through January, February and March as painlessly as possible; how to find a way to brighten our spirits and keep busy and make the time fly by until spring arrives.
<P>I've talked to several experts in the fields of psychology, social work and recreational therapy, and they've helped me put together a list of things to do that will help you through these long, gray months until the sun and the muggers come out again.
<P>Here are some of their ideas:
<P>Drinking: Getting roaring drunk has always been a remedy for the doldrums, especially in parts of the world that have long, cold winters. In Finland, for example, so many people use this means of fighting off the blahs that the government provides free hangover stations to administer oxygen and massive vitamin doses. So you might consider throwing a log on the fire and becoming absolutely stinko. Every so often, throw on another log, bite the top off another jug and before you know it, April will be here, all the loudmouthed birds will be chirping and you can take a bath, shave off your three-month growth of beard, throw all the empties out in the alley, stagger outside for a breath of fresh air, and walk down to the neighborhood saloon for a drink.
<P>Brooding: Brooding is so often overlooked as an absolutely great way to pass dull time. And it's something you can do any time by yourself. Just pick out all the things that you hate about yourself; or think back to all the terrible mistakes you've made with your life, things that make you feel guilt and shame. Or think about all the cruel and thoughtless ways your friends, relatives, co-workers and neighbors have ever hurt your feelings. Then sit in front of the fire or in a dimly lit room and dwell on them at length. Go over them time after time, reliving each awful and shameful detail. The hours will just fly by. (You can combine your brooding with drinking and have one heck of a time.)
<P>Change lifestyles: By that I mean, you say to your wife or husband and kids: ''I have cabin fever - I've got to get out of the house for a while.'' Then clean out your bank account, move into a high-rise apartment, join a racquetball club, hang out in urban cowboy bars, take a Loveboat cruise, run amok with your credit cards, and carry on with some attractive but shallow and empty-headed young thing. And in the spring, return home looking dazed and tell your loved ones, ''Quick, give me volume A of the encyclopedia. I've got to look up amnesia!''
<P>Winter sports: Cross-country skiing has become very popular and downhill skiing is still growing. There are also winter camping clubs and ice fishing. But I don't recommend any of these. They can give you a heart attack, frostbite, or broken legs. The best winter sport is shooting pool. You meet really fascinating people in pool halls or bars that have pool tables. You can gamble and swear and get in fights and buy and sell stolen merchandise. And even if you're not a good pool player, don't worry. You can play the pinball machines or just hang around. Something is bound to happen.
<P>Correspondence: People don't write letters anymore, and they should. It's a wonderful form of human contact. And it's an inexpensive but constructive way to fill empty time - especially by writing hate letters. So make a list of the 10 or 20 people you hate most and write them long, totally honest letters telling them why you hate them in vivid detail. They don't have to be famous people, although that's always fun. Friends, relatives, neighbors, co-workers, and old flames will do. If you have illegible handwriting and don't type, then consider cassettes. With a cassette, you can growl, snarl, hiss, shriek, weep, and say any obscene old thing that pops into your head.
<P>Novels: You might consider writing an obscene novel. Make yourself the hero or heroine. You might be surprised at how well you write, and the colorful ideas you can come up with. Your book could even be published. And even if it isn't, later in the year you can give it to someone - a friend, loved one, or a stranger to whom you are attracted - as a birthday or Christmas gift.
<P>Binoculars: Powerful binoculars are great fun for high-rise dwellers whose windows look out at other high-rise dwellers. If they are strong enough, you're bound to find someone whose drapes are open. You can watch other people eating, sleeping, talking to each other, having sex, exercising, murdering each other, and all kinds of things. Or you and a friend can open your drapes and pretend to murder each other, and if the police show up, you'll know that somebody was watching.
<P>Holding someone hostage: Usually, husbands take their wives and kids hostage, although boyfriends occasionally seize their girlfriends. Whatever the case, it's a lively wintertime activity. Just fling a chair or lamp through the front window, scream some crazy threats and in no time the police will have your place surrounded and will be talking to you through bullhorns. The TV cameras will show up, so after an hour or two, or even longer, you can surrender to a TV reporter. You might wind up spending a couple of weeks in a nuthouse, which could be a surprisingly interesting way to get through the winter doldrums. And when it's over, you'll have your very own videotape of the police dragging a hysterical you to the paddy car.
<P>Those are just a few of the things the experts recommend. And if you have any pet ways of fighting off the winter blahs, just send them in and I'll be glad to share them with the other readers.
<P>But, please, don't suggest the old reliable ''send out for a cheese and sausage pizza.'' It's loaded with cholesterol and I don't like to recommend anything dangerous.

<H2>That great sucking sound</H2>
<STRONG>By Felix Bachmeier - Fri, Jan 3, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->The Union  should stop running articles that try to pablumize the judicial corruption in this county and come down on the side of the people (Saturday, Dec. 21).
<P>Ninety-some percent of the people never have any contact with the sheriff's department. For these people to say the sheriff's department is clean, is just plain silly. 
<P>If it were not for long-standing official policies of generally sucking up to the amphetamine culture and an array of other crooks, the scenario that got two girls killed and the wrong kid convicted would never have happened. Somebody has got to take a stand here. What's the matter? Is it fear?
<P>There was a time when a small independent newspaper showed courage and laid it on the line only to have their advertisers disappear. Well, it's a different world here now. Things are 180 degrees reversed. The Union  has more to fear from the citizens boycotting its advertisers than from advertisers pulling out to hush the whistleblowers.
<P>Professor Wight got it right! The good old boys are up against a whole array of newcomers whose sense of decency has been violated by this corrupt judicial system. The irritants that make recall efforts successful, that "consistent irritant" the good professor alludes to, pervades this community like a dark shadow. 
<P>As long as the kid, Sam Strange, is denied a new and fair court trial, the irritant, that shameful irritant, is here, in our face, daily.
<P>The Strange case is not the sole problem. It is only another symptom. If your reporter had been awake at the last forum, he couldn't have missed the recurring theme. Speaker after speaker cited incidents of sheriff's deputies sucking up to perps and denigrating victims. Sounds far-fetched? Wait till it happens to you. Yes, it is unbelievable. It is also sickening. People who say the sheriffs are doing a good job should have this experience. Maybe they will.

<H2>This isn't brain surgery, guys</H2>
<STRONG>By Michael Brook - Fri, Jan 3, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->The comments of Mayor Harry Stewart regarding the stop signs on the rebuilt Pine Street Bridge, coming after the recent article and correspondence on traffic circles or roundabouts, were particularly interesting to me as someone who has driven in Europe for over 20 years and now in California for two years.
<P>My impression is that European drivers are often impatient, assertive sometimes to the point of aggressive, and drive faster. The upside is that they seem to be more aware of what is going on around them. I think they use their mirrors more, and I know they use their turn signals a lot more, and they deal pretty well with unexpected hazards. California drivers are usually polite, patient and considerate, but the downside is that they do not like surprises and too often they are asleep at the wheel. Take tailgating on the freeway: In Europe it is a rare form of pretty extreme aggression; here people do it all the time, lah-lahing along  at 65 mph two car lengths from the car in front with apparent unconcern. Distances between cars on a busy freeway in Europe are routinely three times greater than here, because drivers are more aware of the danger.
<P>They may explain why in Europe, traffic circles are used all over the place with great success now that, as when entering a crowded shop, priority is always given to the people who are already in the circle and heading for an exit. Even the French eventually worked that one out. But confront NC/GV residents or Gold Country tourists with a traffic circle (Duh ... ?) and you will have a megadeath fireball in no time. That's why stop signs here mean stop even when it is unnecessary, and that's why the new Pine Street Bridge still has stop signs. Omigod, itsa  itsa bridge ! Like wow, we better stop and figure this one out!

<H2>About the teaching of Ebonics</H2>
<STRONG>By Various writers  - Fri, Jan 3, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Jumping the gun
<P>I was sorry to see that Dr. McAteer, like several national figures, took up the hue and cry against Oakland's "Ebonics" policy. (Letters, Dec. 27) I admit that the initial media reports were pure sensationalism, without the facts to analyze the program being discussed, but that's a very good reason to withhold comment until some information is available. In fact, our educators try to teach our children to get the facts before forming an opinion - as role models, they should practice what they preach.
<P>Now, we are hearing a little more in the press. The professional, concerned officials in Oakland are apparently trying to find a better way to teach English skills to a student population handicapped by poverty, racial discrimination, and a dirth of literate, American-English speaking role models at home and in their neighborhoods. They don't plan to "teach Ebonics" at all; they simply want to find the best tools for their teaching staff to reach the kids and help them make progress.
<P>My guess is that Jesse Jackson, the NAACP, and hopefully Dr. McAteer, will eventually have to retract their initial, uninformed opinions. I certainly hope that we don't get any new laws telling teachers what they can teach - censorship is the enemy of both education and a free society. In addition, any law about 'Ebonics' would clearly be racist in its effect. We need to have faith that professional educators in Oakland, as much as in Nevada County, are trying to find the best ways to reach their students, and faith that if their idea doesn't work, it will be abandoned.
<P>Stephen A. Munkelt
<P>Nevada City 
<P>Rush to judgment
<P> Dr. McAteer describes the Oakland Public School's decision to recognize black English as "declaring Ebonics a language needing to be taught to black youth in their inner city schools."
<P>The program is not that at all. It merely provides materials to teachers to show them how to decode the black American dialect known as Ebonics so that students can more quickly learn standard English.
<P>While Oakland School board members have not done a very good job of supporting their case, the rush to judgment on this issue reveals more about hidden and repressed racism in this country and less about genuine concern regarding the worthiness of educational programs. Even the Rev. Jesse Jackson and NAACP president Kweisi Mfume have had to backtrack after initially blasting the use of Ebonics in Oakland city schools.
<P>It's not a big surprise that Nevada County, one of the whitest counties in the state, tests high in the proficiency of standard English. Yes, we have great teachers and programs but it doesn't hurt that standard English usage is predominant. Dr. McAteer should worry less about what's going on in Oakland and more about how to increase student exposure in Nevada County to black-American culture, a culture that began 300 years ago with the government-sanctioned importation of human chattel to the New World.
<P>Michael P. Anderson
<P>Nevada City
After the Oakland school board decided to teach Ebonics, President Clinton firmly stated, There will be no federal funding for teaching Ebonics. I was proud of him. He said it with authority, showing the leadership worthy of a president. Most Americans agreed with him.
Can anyone explain to me why, the very next evening, he arrogantly attends midnight Mass with his family and received the Holy Sacrament of Communion? It is no secret he had been rebuked by Pope John Paul II, Mother Theresa and evangelist Billy Graham for vetoing a ban on partial-birth abortion. The Rev. Rob Schenck leaned across the rail and whispered, God will hold you to account, Mr. President. Schenck said later the president clearly registered with his face and his eyes that he had heard. The priest said he was physically pulled aside by Secret Service agents while walking out of church. They rifled his pockets and warned him to not contact a lawyer. A White House spokesman said he had no comment.
Why does our president one day show courage and leadership and the very next day blatantly and with great arrogance show disregard for the church? Beats me.

<!-- story -->PG&E getting a bad rap
<P>In response to a statement made in your article titled "Outage prolonged" on Dec. 24, Susan Smith is one of the most misinformed people ever featured in The Union. I wrote a letter to The Union  last year after a big storm, commending the efforts of PG&E, and reminding people the the employees work as hard and as fast as possible to restore electricity. It was Mrs. Smith's decision to have an all-electric house; she should blame the storm for the outages, not the company. It's people like her who are against tree trimming around power lines, and against pole-lines along roads for accessibility. PG&E workers have to take alternate routes way out in the country that require snow shoes and/or a snow cat to reach.
<P>While Susan Smith and others were sitting at home in "cold" houses, I'm sure they never took the time to think of PG&E workers out in the snow, ice, wind and sometimes blizzard-like conditions while restoring their power.
<P>I consider myself lucky this year. My father is an employee for PG&E and was able to open presents with our family for a couple of hours Christmas morning. After we had opened the majority of the presents, he gathered some clothes and said goodbye. He, and the rest of the hard-working employees of PG&E, have worked almost nonstop since Saturday. They get a few five-hour breaks here and there, to take a shower, get dry clothes and sleep a bit.
<P>If a 19-hour-plus working day isn't enough for Nevada County, then what is? By living in the Sierra Nevada foothills you should be prepared for these storms, and take responsibility for your own comfort (e.g. back-up supplies, alternate heating source, etc.).
<P>No one has control over when a storm comes, or the amount of damage it causes. There's only one thing we can do in situations like the one at hand: Appreciate all that PG&E is doing for you, and look at it from their point of view.
<P>Also, I question The Union's  neutrality in covering the story.
<P>Chelsea Fox
<P>Rough and Ready
<P>Thanks to the crews
<P>Thank you to the many PG&E crews who worked long hours to restore heat and light to their many customers.
<P>I, for one, am most grateful.

<H2>Net has been cast</H2>
<STRONG>By Felix Bachmeier - Thu, Jan 2, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Your "poppycock" editorial, Dec. 26th, has got me scratching my head in wonderment. Which way is it?
<P>1. You "applaud Ferguson's courage in taking the risk of asking an outsider to publicly critique his performance," i.e., the California Attorney General Dan Lungren.
<P>2. You say, "The staff of the attorney general's office has proven itself to be professional. There is no reason to doubt that it will encourage justice in Nevada County." (We can all agree that would be a good idea.)
<P>If the second statement is true, and Ferguson did no wrong, there would be no "risk." So, why would that take "courage?"
<P>You say, "Given the wide net cast by those who see a conspiracy there is no one in Nevada Count that can provide the impartial investigation that appears necessary  "
<P>Charging conspiracy theories is wrong here. The facts have cast the net, and the three monkeys have huddled under it by choice. Courage, real courage could be shown by either Ferguson or Darlington at anytime now by delving into the arcane mumbo jumbo of legal litanies and coming up with the reasons why Sam Strange is entitled to a new and fair trial. That would also be the decent thing to do.
<P>Given the fact that Dan Lungren has a good chance of being our next governor he shouldn't be too happy to get mucked in this sticky mess. He won't be able to dance around in legal culture dogma on this one and also satisfy the demands of justice.

<H2>Richter: Is it a duck?</H2>
<STRONG>By Eric Carlson - Thu, Jan 2, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Bernie Richter's column on December 21 about Prop. 209 made me wonder if he is a racist. Prop. 209 is about affirmative action and its primary components race and gender.
<P>Consider the following partial sentences from Bernie Richter's column:
<P>1. " end of government-mandated racial preferences."
<P>2. "  advocates of race-attentive public policy."
<P>3. " ... based on race or ethnicity."
<P>4. "  rights because of skin color."
<P>5. "  about racial preferences and quotas."
<P>5. "  racial preferences." 
<P>7. "  racial discrimination,"
<P>What's wrong with the above partial sentences? There is no mention of gender! 
<P>My question is: if it talks like a duck, is it a duck?

<H2>Exchanging thank-yous</H2>
<STRONG>By Anne Kaessner - Thu, Jan 2, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->My name is Anne Kaessner and I am an exchange student from Germany at Nevada Union High School.
<P>There was an article in The Union about all the exchange students in Nevada County, which, as I and most of the others I talked to think, reflects us as stuck-up foreigners who come to the U.S. and only complain.
<P>Before I came here I was taught the phrase: "It's not better or worse, it's just different." We came here to LEARN the American way of life and not to judge it. It probably is natural that we have dislikes, but a lot of it we really like, even more than in our country. When we dislike something over here or even complain about something, that just means that we are used to different ways of doing it.
<P>I would like to tell you about the great things I experience here in the United States, which are probably even more than the dislikes and that I have already gained so much in the 412 months  I have now been here. I have already learned so much, about the American culture, the language and also about myself. But probably the most important thing is that I have found a new family who accepts me as a family member, treats me as one of theirs and tries to show me as much as possible.
<P>Sure there are some times, when you do not feel so good, think of home too often or just miss those little things at home, which you never thought of being important to you. But maybe those phases are also just valuable experiences.
<P>I know that I have had such a great time here so far in Nevada City and I do not want to miss a second of it, no matter good or bad.
<P>On this way I would also like to thank my host family for giving me such a nice new home ad also all the other people who accept me as a maybe a little different person, but one who is willing to learn.

<H2>How will PG and E cope?</H2>
<STRONG>By Ronnie Paul - Wed, Jan 1, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->I confine my appreciation of ancient relics mainly to museums and antique shops. Nevada County's most blatant artifact, PG&E, needs to be unwrapped from mummification. The determined employees who worked long cold hours during the holidays unfortunately only patched an antiquated system. I notice that other mountain communities such as Tahoe and Switzerland maintain full power through blizzards and avalanches. My concern lies not in the slight inconvenience of melting ice cream and candlelit evenings, but rather in wondering how PG&E will cope with the General Plan's new projected population buildout.

<STRONG>By Tony Rohl - Wed, Jan 1, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->If the new decentralizing and downsizing philosophy of the federal government were to be applied to the problem of where to locate the proposed new Grass Valley post office, a new plan would emerge, one that would address the problems of access and traffic congestion simultaneously.
<P>The new plan would entail having a number of small satellite locations spread throughout the community rather than a large central post office.
<P>There would be small, one-person sites at, or close to, Mill Street, Sutton Way, Colfax Avenue, Hughes Road, Dorsey Drive, Squirrel Creek Road, Alta Sierra, or whatever locations are deemed necessary and convenient, leaving the old post office as a collection station. These neighborhood locations would be walkable by some and only a short drive for the rest. The way I see it, the only people who would suffer from having more and smaller post offices are the ones who make those THIS WINDOW CLOSED signs.

<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->If Ebonics is to be recognized in the Oakland public school system, will this be fair to the minorities: Asian, Hispanic, Caucasian?
<P>Ebonics is the result of joining "ebony" (black) and "phonics" (speech sounds). Shouldn't the Asian and Hispanic children be permitted recognition of "Tanphonics?"
<P>Our African-American children should strive to speak the language used so eloquently by Martin Luther King. We should encourage unity through speaking the same dialect. If not, please tell me where I can purchase an African-American-English, English-African-American dictionary.

<H2>German military presence explained</H2>
<STRONG>By Alan Aspey - Tue, Dec 31, 1996</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->This is in reply to a letter to the editor which appeared a few weeks ago re: a German air force base near Alamogordo, N.M. "Since our son has been stationed at Holloman Air Force Base for the past two years. I asked the public affairs office to reply to the statements contained in the letter published in The Union. I am abstracting pertinent parts of the six-page clarification provided to me by the U.S.A.F. (1) 300 German military members joined the many other tenant units assigned  to Holloman, which benefit from the existing base infrastructure but which operate under the overall supervision of the host U.S. Air Force wing commander. (2) this 'German Tactical Training Center' was activated on May 1, 1996. (3) absolutely no part of the base has been sold, leased or turned over in any way to the German air force or government. The German training unit exists here under the same type of host-tenant agreement as 40-plus other Holloman tenant units. Neither the German air force or German government exercise any authority over the base or its operations, outside of their own training program. (4) the activation of the GAF Tactical Training Center is not a new concept. In fact, our German air force allies have received fighter aircraft training as our guests in the Southwestern U.S. since the late '50s - first at Luke A.F.B., then for 20 years at George A.F.B. and finally since 1992 here at Holloman. Throughout that entire period, German along with thousands of other allied pilots received their undergraduate pilot training at Sheppard A.F.B., Texas. (5) The German government has paid and will pay all costs associated with the establishment and operation of the TTC, including some $42 million in construction costs.
<P>The above five points are taken verbatim from the U.S.A.F.  reply which includes a copy of news release of May 15, 1996, in response to a completely erroneous news media treatment of the initial announcement.

<H2>Demos should thank far right</H2>
<STRONG>By Wally Hardie - Tue, Dec 31, 1996</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->The Democratic Party owes an immeasurable degree of gratitude to the assorted Jesse Helmses, the Pat Robinsons, the Shafleys, the De-wee-wees of the world, the Ralph Reeds, the Ollie Norths, the Bob (B-1) Dornans, assorted fund-gelicals who run in circles crying, "the sky is falling, the sky is falling," laying all of the ills of the world, real and/or imaginary, at the feet of President Clinton.
<P>Had it not been for all of the above and more who wanted Constitutional amendments by the dozen - amendment to execute flag burners, amendments to execute abortionists, amendments to have prayer in public schools, amendment to repeal the First Amendment to the Constitution of separation of church and state, amendment to repeal the Fourteenth Amendment, amendments to balance the budget, for term limits, etc., etc. Had it not been for those who drove the moderate Republicans by the millions to cross party lines, and while they may not have been totally enamored with the choice, they were terrified beyond belief to think of living in the 15th century. The hue and cry for the zygote, the embryo, the fetus. Never mind the well-being of the woman. Never mind the one to one and one-half million children who suffer from malnutrition.
<P>By the way, this isn't called liberalism or any other "ism"  that a few will choke on. It's called being a secular humanist, the care and concern of human beings, rather than the abstract concern of theology.
<P>But in the meantime, let's build a multi-trillion dollar Star Wars defense system to keep the evil empire in check. Thank you, thank you, thank you, should be the first words out of the president's mouth at his inauguration.
<P>The American woman earned her right to vote the hard way and she exercises it. She won her right of choice in a battle that started in the middle of the last century. She isn't about to give that up anytime soon.
<P>For all of the aforementioned: in the American Heritage dictionary there is  a word between realist and realization. Get a grip on it!

<H2>Newspaper careless on lion warning</H2>
<STRONG>By Sarah Jane Fitting - Tue, Dec 31, 1996</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->I never cease to wonder about the mind of The Union. You jump at a chance to make headlines about the cougar. But only when the story has some big shot from the Fish and Game Department telling the gullible public that "the cougar is just a big pussy cat, which would not eat a child."
<P>Not true.  Totally misleading. Children are in imminent danger. Their lives are just as secure as the newspapers portray the mountain lion or cougar.
<P>Recently I witnessed at least six very young children playing outside after dark in a well-lighted wooded area.  The cougar has been sighted in this area at least twice. 
<P>When parents are warned by caring individuals they always quote The Union's  headlines on the cougar.  Do you care more for the cougar and nothing for the child?
<P>Sure, statistics show that the honey bee kills more people than the cougar. By comparison, automobile accidents kill more people than the road sniper.

<H2>On abortion ...</H2>
<STRONG>By Various writers - Tue, Dec 31, 1996</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Joy or despair
<P>It must have been an incredible sight for the shepherds to behold the newborn Christ. Every newborn is a miracle, but to have actually been in the presence of the Son of God, in both His majesty and dependence, must have been overwhelming.
<P>The miracle of birth is just as overwhelming in its beauty today as it was then. To see the birth of one's child after months of expectation is an experience few will forget. Having seen a sonogram of a two-month-old in the womb is the first real picture we get, as prospective parents, of the humanness of that individual. As we see the arms, legs, head and beating heart, we realize that the child within the womb is uniquely individual, biding her time until she's able to survive outside. The womb is the perfect sterile, protective environment for the child.
<P>Or at least it should be - with an average of 4,000 abortions taking place every day including, according to Time  magazine, thousands of partial birth abortions annually, the womb can be a nightmare for one out of three babies. For the mothers, the nightmare continues, with recurring dreams of their aborted children, and a racking, life-long guilt which can lead to deep depression and suicide. According to M. Uchtman, Ohio director of Suiciders Anonymous, they suffer "in-depth, deep depression, anxiety, stress and fears they cannot overcome. By holding a tight grip on their emotions, they tuck all that unexpressed emotion inside themselves, where it keeps growing, like a pressured tumor of pain. Panic and distress grips them after their abortion, until the chilling reality overcomes them and casts them into dark pits of despair and pain."
<P>The extent of their despair is perhaps greatest at Christmas, when they consider the birth of a Savior who stands ready to forgive them. As Christians, we must extend an understanding hand to these women, for none of us is without sin, while at the same time celebrate the birth of Christ, and honor those who, like Mary, have taken on the joys and responsibilities of parenthood.

<P>Make responsible choices
<P>Re: Byron Taylor, Dec. 17:
<P>Mr. Taylor ignores the point of my letter and attempts to change the subject, an attempt I cannot allow. My letter was about the cheapening of life by abortion.
<P>Mr. Taylor says "the real problem is what we do with unwanted babies." Wrong. The "real problem" Mr. Taylor is unintended pregnancies and the subsequent killing of the unborn baby. I suggested abstinence as a positive method of birth control. As I pointed out in my letter the abortion rate is escalating at an absolutely horrible rate and must be stopped.
<P>Some in our society, both men and women, apparently cannot control their sexual urges and some do not accept responsibility for their actions. Men/women use abortion as a safety net for birth control, how else can one explain the 1.3 million increase in abortions annually since Roe vs. Wade? Under the disguise of "choice" it is legal for a person already making one mistake (unwanted pregnancy) to add another mistake (abortion) to it. The point is to stop the killing by making responsible choices, therefore avoiding unwanted pregnancy.
<P>Mr. Taylor's blames society for not adopting all the children available instead of blaming the people responsible for having babies they can't take care of or never wanted in the first place. To blame others is not responsible, it's part of the problem.
<P>Mr. Taylor I know of no "great cities" with slums. And to answer to question as to what would have happened to California's share of the 1.5 million had they not been aborted? They wouldn't be dead.

<P>Protection of mother a sham
<P>This year the United States Senate and the House of Representatives voted to end partial birth abortions after seeing how the procedure was performed.  According to Patrick Moyniham (Democratic abortion advocate)  it was too close to infanticide  for his taste.  
<P>Many pro- abortion congressmen voted with the majority of their colleagues to ban partial-birth abortions. They were, however, stopped by President Clinton, who exercised his veto. Time magazine, which originally said that the procedure was done  only  about 400 times annually, later stated that the actual number was  far higher, perhaps in the thousands. Even the doctors who perform the procedure admitted it was seldom done  to  protect the life of the mother.  The Physicians 92 Ad Hoc Coalition f or Truth (PHACT), a group of over 300 medical specialists, including former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, states emphatically that  partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to protect a mother's health or her future fertility.  Dr. Koop states: "Protection of the life of the mother as an excuse for an abortion is a smoke screen. In my 36 years of pediatric surgery I have never known of one instance where the child had to be aborted to save the mother's life."
<P>Given this evidence, how can anyone justify this medically purposeless procedure, one in which the child is pulled out from the womb by the feet and, before it can draw a breath of air, have scissors jammed into the base of its skull and its brains sucked out?  It appears the Nevada County Coalition for Choice has an answer: it isn't a child to be nurtured and cherished; it is only a choice. What is also appalling is that you and I, as taxpayers, don't have a choice in this matter: we pay for these abortions with our tax dollars.... 
<P>For more facts on partial birth abortion, view the Voice for Life web page at http://www.nccn.net/~voice/ or write to P.O. Box 1774, Cedar Ridge, CA 95924.

<H2>President could learn something from Hippocratic Oath</H2>
<STRONG>By Amy E. Englund - Thu, Jan 2, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->At the very least, when the president is sworn in for the new term, he should take the Hippocratic Oath and follow its "do no harm" command. After all, Bill Clinton has demonstrated a deep commitment to meddling with health care, affecting the lives of human beings, just as doctors do. The president and Congress may view health-care issues as politics and policies. However, human lives are at stake.
<P>H.R. 3136, Public Law 104-121 of the president's "Advancement of America Act of 1996," offers a strong argument for my case. As interest groups, moralists and even Republicans put the pressure on the president to get a grip on the budget problems, Clinton signed the bill. The bill, which cancels cash benefits for Social Security recipients "disabled from drug addiction and/or alcoholism,"  shifted the trauma away from the federal funding and toward the local level. In effect, it "passes the buck," demonstrating a great Presidential strategy.
<P>With the president high on a morality campaign, his motive for meddling seems clear; many Americans would agree that they are tired of supporting a nation of addicts. Yet, while the morality argument makes its case, it is self-defeating. The exemptions of this act defeat the financial and moral purpose; if the addicted recipient is willing to give up his/her primary classification as an addict and accept a new one as mentally ill, the individual may still receive case benefits. What is moralistic or cost-effective about encouraging a population of already chronically ill persons to further their own disability?
<P>Aside from the fact that no doctor or president is in a position to judge which disabilities deserve cash benefits and which do not, there are other moral implications. The government is inviting deception and destabilization into already shaky county systems. Clients have come to these systems with one problem - chronic addiction - and it is being compounded with another. The federal government has contained addiction by paying addicts to stay out of sight; handing out money not always attached to treatment. Now, when it is politically convenient, the president has turned his cheek and taken a morality stance. The result? A nosocomial infection. Infections run rampant in Washington.
<P>County governments are forced to teach clients to manipulate the system and ask for misdiagnosis. Misdiagnosis does harmful things. It creates institutionalized behaviors in clients, allows them to pathologize themselves and trivializes mental illness. A society that fears and ignores the nature of mental illness does not need further invitation to trivialize the matter. This is not "advancement of America." This is ignorance.
<P>California counties have their share of problems trying to get mental illness the awareness and funding deserves. This new law will only compound the budget problems, as persons diagnosed with both mental illness and alcoholism will be more costly to review, assess, and treat than those with a single diagnosis. The "Advancement Act" will not advance us on the county level, but compound financial and moral dilemmas. If the man on the top insists on spreading a nosocomial infection, he needs his own reality check. Maybe we should invite him in for diagnosis!

<H2>Volunteers come through</H2>
<STRONG>By The Union Staff - Mon, Jan 6, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->Even though Nevada County was spared the worst of the flooding that swept northern California in the past week, its residents rose to the occasion.
<P>Emergency-services workers responded quickly and efficiently when waters began rising along creeks and rivers on New Year's Day. They were joined by public works employees from local governments as the threat to roads, bridges and sewer facilities increased with every hour of rainfall. Those public employees worked many long hours, growing ever more tired and soaked, to deal with the emergency. They did a good job, and we thank them.
<P>But the story of an emergency in Nevada County never ends with public employees. Once again, legions of volunteers stepped forward to help with the emergency. Some of the volunteers worked in well-organized teams. The American Red Cross, for instance, once again demonstrated its ability to focus volunteer efforts as it quickly created emergency shelters at the Veterans Memorial Building in Grass Valley, Nevada Union High School and the county fairgrounds. Other volunteer efforts, meanwhile, were simple actions by neighbors helping one another. Time and again, those whose homes were dry gave a hand to those whose homes were threatened.
<P>Once again, the outpouring of volunteer assistance in Nevada County reminds us that there are no strangers in our community, only people we haven't yet met.
<P>Even though the waters are receding, we need to remember that the need for assistance and for patience with one another will continue for months to come.
<P>The American Red Cross needs our continued donations so it can be financially prepared to meet the next disaster. Send contributions to the Red Cross at P.O. Box 250, Grass Valley 95945.
<P>And please remember that the process of rebuilding flood-torn lives will take many weeks and months. Please extend a helping hand where you can until the job is complete.

<H2>Charters: A homegrown challenge</H2>
<STRONG>By The Union Staff - Thu, Jan 2, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->About 200 families in Nevada County have decided to educate their children at home, and that's a figure that contains a challenge for public education as it moves into the next century.
<P>Families choose home schooling as an alternative to traditional schools for a multitude of reasons, ranging from their desire to create a schedule that allows specialized education in the arts to the belief that the family's lifestyle can create high-quality educational experiences.
<P>In many cases, however, parents who choose home schooling cite their desire for their children's education to include more emphasis on values. Those parents who believe public schools don't sufficiently emphasize education in basic values cover a wide swath of the political and social spectrum. It's not merely conservative Christians who talk about values. Liberal families, too, want their children to learn about values and virtues.
<P>One of the strengths of public schools historically has been its ability to draw children from throughout society and provide them with basic education and social skills. Shared experiences in public education have helped knit America together. Any time significant numbers of parents withdraw their children from public education, the knitting begins to unravel. 
<P>But the obvious answer - a greater emphasis on values at public schools - isn't nearly as simple as it appears.
<P>Whose values should be taught? And, if we can win agreement on those virtues that should be instilled in every American, what will we cite as their basis? 
<P>Honesty, for instance, probably would be among the values most parents want their children to learn. But should children learn to be honest because of the Bible's Ninth Commandment or on the basis of humanistic desires to maintain truth in all relationships? Parents who agree on the values they hope to instill in their children are likely to disagree strongly on the reasons these values are important.
<P>The challenge facing schools in Nevada County, then, is threefold:
<P>-- Discover if more emphasis on virtuous behavior is truly the desire of the community.
<P>-- Identify those values which are shared so widely that they can be taught as one of the building blocks of American society.
<P>-- Determine how to teach those values in a way that respects families' basic beliefs.
<P>It may be one of the most difficult tasks facing public schools today. Parents and society as a whole, however, appear to be saying it's worth the effort.

<H2>A resolution for 1997</H2>
<STRONG>By The Union Staff - Wed, Jan 1, 1997</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->As 1997 dawns in Nevada County, we find ourselves bogged down in many of the same issues that have kept the community divided for far too many years. 
<P>We fail to talk to one another. Instead, we shout past one another.
<P>We fail to acknowledge that those with whom we disagree are people who are driven by motives just as pure as our own. Instead, we convince ourselves that our adversaries are demons, motivated only by evil thoughts.
<P>We fail to look for solutions or common ground. Instead, we indulge our taste for petty intrigue and work to widen the divisions and prevent the solution of community issues.
<P>We abandon our ability to exercise good judgment. Instead, we allow our decisions to be determined by old hatreds, senseless prejudices and long-ago quarrels.
<P>Over and over we have repeated this in western Nevada County. We are unable to resolve big questions about development, law enforcement, protection of the environment or the role of government. We are unable to come to agreement on even relatively simple matters such as the value of a stop sign at the end of a bridge.
<P>Before you raise a finger from this newspaper to point it in the direction of your neighbor, remember that each of us who lives here - whether for a month or a lifetime - played a role in creating the current atmosphere.
<P>It is certainly too much to hope for an end to this in 1997. Old grudges die hard, and many people have much at stake in the continuation of our status quo.  And all of us are afraid - afraid of our adversaries, afraid of a future that isn't entirely in our control, afraid of people who are more liberal than us, more conservative than us or just plain different from us.
<P>If we hope to resolve the questions that face us, however, we need to overcome our fears. We need to challenge our habits.
<P>Let us suggest a New Year's resolution for Nevada County:
<P>Take a moment today and identify the person who is your adversary in the community, the person whose opinions and viewpoint anger you the most.
<P>Then, tomorrow, call your adversary. Invite your adversary to lunch, for a beer after work, for a cup of coffee. Listen to what your adversary has to say. See if you share common ground that might help resolve a community issue. You don't have to agree; just listen.
<P>Will open-minded listening and a search for common ground actually make a difference?
<P>We don't know, but it's obvious that the other path - fear and recrimination - hasn't worked.

<H2>A very wet wish for some sun</H2>
<STRONG>By The Union Staff - Tue, Dec 31, 1996</STRONG><P>
<!-- photo stuff -->
<!-- quote stuff -->
<!-- story -->It wasn't three months ago, you may recall, that everyone you met on the street in Nevada County was complaining about summer's heat - the heat that seemed to have lasted forever.
<P>Nevada County has a hard time agreeing on anything, but the community was close to unanimous in its hopes for some cooler, wetter weather.
<P>Now look what that brought us!
<P>The first serious rainstorm of the season came on Oct. 19. Since then, Grass Valley has received 38.67 inches of rain while 44.9 incheshas poured onto Nevada City. (Those figures were accurate at 7 a.m. today; by now, they're wildly outdated - possibly by several inches.)
<P>To get this into context, remember back to the rainy winter of 1994 and 1995. That's the year when more than 100 inches of rain fell on western Nevada County. Parents of small children slowly went mad attempting to entertain their offspring indoors, lovers of the outdoors grew ever more frustrated as one rain-filled weekend was followed by another, and everyone in town got just a little cranky.
<P>Even in that record-setting winter, rainfall totals on Jan. 1 were a mere 22 inches in Grass Valley and 27 inches in Nevada City. If the rains continue at this rate, we could end up with 160 inches of precipitation by June 1.
<P>Or, as those who have lived around here for decades can tell us, it could stop raining tomorrow - and not rain again for months.
<P>Right now, that sounds pretty good. We have a simple New Year's wish. We want some sunshine one of these days, and the sooner the better.

Yes, we won the <b>Grammy for Best Spoken Comedy Award</b> earlier this year, for our recording of <b><I><a href="/cgi-shl/html_web_store.pl?page=10000005.html&cart_id=8186035.316">Crank Calls</a></I></b> by <b>Jonathan Winters</b>.

His recording <b><I><a href="/cgi-shl/html_web_store.pl?page=10000091.html&cart_id=8186035.316">Deraindamaged</a></I></b> is the caustic, incisive commentary of one of today's funniest young performers.

<P>
CRANK CALLS

<p>GRAMMY AWARD WINNER FOR BEST SPOKEN WORD COMEDY RECORDING!

<p>        When Jonathan Winters, the elder statesman of surreal 
improvisational comedy, leaves a
message at the tone the result is comic genius.

<p>        It seems that Jonathan's peripatetic buddy Jim Smith 
is quite the elusive fellow.  Regardless
of season or time of day, Jonathan can never reach Mr. Smith by 
phone...but that's a stroke of luck
for the fans of Winters' brand of inventive off-the-cuff antics.  
CRANK CALLS  captures for posterity
actual phone messages left by Winters on Smith's answering machine.  
The result is uninhibited,
unscripted, and uniquely Winters.

<P>
<p><b>Nominated for Best Spoken Word NAIRD Indie award! of 1994</b>

<p>Tina Scacciapensieri is the caustic, sexy and very funny 
heroine of this book.  Half Italian, half Jewish and
totally Brooklyn, she won't admit she needs some advice.  
She is pregnant and everyone expects her to marry
her plumber boyfriend, Vinnie.  But Tina's not so sure: 
"It's the ones in suits I like.  The good suits.  You
can tell.  That's the kind of guy I wanna go out with.  
Not the jerks I see.  I mean, Vinnie's got a suit, but
it's green."  Even her best friend Angie is surprised by 
some of Tina's decisions.

interviews, secret files and the latest scientific and computer enhancements of film and evidence, <b><I>Case Closed</I></b> not only uncovers where the Warren Commission erred but also demolishes the leading conspiracy
theories, putting to rest once and for all speculation about involvement of the CIA, FBI, and the Mafia, and
the supposed links between Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.

<h3>By Daniel J. Boorstin<br>
Read by Christopher Cazenove</h3>
<P>
<p>A vivid, sweeping and original history of man's greatest adventure: his search to discover the world around
him - the relationship of the heavens to his planet, the elusive and mysterious dimension of time, the vast and
colorful range of plants and animals, the intricate workings of his own body, the surprising variety of human
societies past and present.  Boorstin's flair for the vivid anecdote, for fresh points of view and for the
dramatic relationship of ideas has made him the most readable of our eminent historians.

<P>
<p>THE PULITZER PRIZE-WINNING AUTOBIOGRAPHY

<p>He went to Vietnam the son of a military legend, but when 
Lt. Lewis B. Puller, Jr. tripped a booby-trapped
howitzer round, his career as a soldier ended and the battle 
to reclaim his life began.  Facing years of
reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation, he nearly succumbed 
to relentless pain, depression, alcoholism and
a father's unrequited legacy.

<p>FORTUNATE SON is the powerful and moving chronicle of a 
different kind of hero, one who overcame the
enormous physical and psychological scars of war to find a 
courage -- and a victory -- of his own, until he
took his life in May of 1994.

<h3>By Hedrick Smith<br>
Read by Michael Hanson</h3>
<P>
<p>Pulitzer Prize- winner Hedrick Smith's  RETHINKING AMERICA is a 
provocative inside portrait of America
at a crucial crossroads.  Smith leads us into the schools and 
businesses of America to show how our
traditional approach to commerce and education is obsolete for 
the new global economy -- and how our
innovators are succeeding by rethinking America.  From classrooms 
to companies to government,
RETHINKING AMERICA points the way to creative and effective new 
ways to think, teach, work, and
succeed in the future, and it shows how the American innovators 
are doing just that.

<p>Measuring this country against its major competitors, Smith 
shows how global competition has radically
altered the way people work, what schools need to teach, and the 
nature of power and people's relationships
on the job.  He discloses how differently decisions are made and 
power is wielded in the corporate
boardrooms of America, Germany, and Japan.  Education is where 
the race begins.  Smith contrasts what
American school teachers emphasize, compared with skills and 
values taught elsewhere.

<p>HEDRICK SMITH's twenty-six year career with The New York Times 
took him to Vietnam, Cairo, Paris, and
Washington as well as to Moscow, where his reporting from 1971 to 
1974 won him a Pulitzer Prize.  His
books include the best-sellers The Russians; The Power Game: How 
Washington Really Works; and The New
Russians.  He is a fellow of the Foreign Policy Institute at the 
Johns Hopkins School of Advanced
International Studies.  He has created, reported for, and hosted 
three PBS mini-series: Inside Gorbacev's
Russia, The Power Game, and Challenge to America.

<P>
CRANK CALLS

<p>GRAMMY AWARD WINNER FOR BEST SPOKEN WORD COMEDY RECORDING!

<p>        When Jonathan Winters, the elder statesman of surreal 
improvisational comedy, leaves a
message at the tone the result is comic genius.

<p>        It seems that Jonathan's peripatetic buddy Jim Smith 
is quite the elusive fellow.  Regardless
of season or time of day, Jonathan can never reach Mr. Smith by 
phone...but that's a stroke of luck
for the fans of Winters' brand of inventive off-the-cuff antics.  
CRANK CALLS  captures for posterity
actual phone messages left by Winters on Smith's answering machine.  
The result is uninhibited,
unscripted, and uniquely Winters.

<P>
<b><i>Original comedy from one of the fastest rising stars in the business!!!</i></b>

<p>Vince Valenzuela has been called "wonderfully sick and delightfully twisted" and with good
reason.  He calls his humor, "sarcastic, observational comedy via exaggerated characterization". 
Whatever you call it, DERAINDAMAGED is hilarious proof that the youngest of five kids raised by a
Mexican father and a chain-smoking German/English mother on a teacher's humble salary in the
eternally grey, rain-soaked environment of Seattle has an uncanny ability to raise the mundane events
of everyday living to a new level of absurdity.

<p>DERAINDAMAGED reveals the hypocrisies, double standards and dysfunctions of human behavior,
pop-culture, inane social trends, relationships, sex, and current events via what Vince describes as
"thought provoking cynicism.  He has already gained much national recognition from his appearances
on A&E's "Evening at the Improv", HBO's "Loco Slam", USA's "Up All Night" and <I>Entertainment
Tonight</I>.  Now, DERAINDAMAGED gives us one of comedy's fastest rising talents at his devastatingly
funny best!

<h3>By Lee Gruenfeld<br>
Read by Frank Muller</h3>
<P>
<p>Lee Gruenfeld, a former management consultant with an international 
professional services firm, is a
pilot, computer expert, and well known speaker on business and 
advanced technology.  The author of
IRREPARABLE HARM, he lives in Southern California.

<p>In California, a black pilot scarred by combat during World 
War II is about to do battle in the skies once
more...In Washington, an aging FBI agent has locked into the 
mind of a sociopath who has created a way
to grab control of any plane in the sky...In Minnesota, a local 
police chief sends his men after a suspect -
while a psychologist at a computer terminal hundreds of miles 
away knows that the person they seek is
already gone...

<p>A brilliant extortionist nicknamed Captain Marvel has figured 
out how to make airline navigational systems
go haywire at will, holding hostage the entire U.S. air traffic 
system and, in effect, the American public.  FBI
agent Jack Webster and his former assistant, Dr. Amy Goldberg, 
head a team of bureaucrats and techno-
wizards assigned to stop the mad genius as he engages them in a 
high-tech cross country game of cat-and-
mouse.  Bo Kinkaid, an ace flying pilot decorated in Vietnam and 
WWII, is drawn into the web of intrigue
as events unite him and Agent Webster in a fateful intersection 
with the terrorist.

<p>For generations, the dragonriders had dedicated their lives 
to fighting Thread - a dreaded biological organism
that periodically rained from the sky to ravage the land.  
On the backs of their magnificent telepathic
dragons, the Pernese riders flew to burn the deadly spores out 
of the air before they reach the planet's
surface.  But the greatest dream of the dragonriders was to 
find a way to eradicate Thread completely, so
that never again would their beloved Pern be threatened by destruction.

<p>Carol Matthau epitomizes a kind of glamour not known today.  In her inimitable voice -- sly, unflinching,
incisive, and hilarious -- she tells her stories of:

<p>The company she's kept: Gloria Vanderbilt, Oona O'Neill Chaplin, Rex Harrison, James Agee, Karen Blixen.

<p>The husbands she's had: William Saroyan (twice) and Walter Matthau (still).

<p>The life she's lived:  A childhood in foster homes that was transformed into a Park Avenue debutante's
adolescence; a lifetime friendship with Truman Capote.  Here is a life of ambiguous privilege, private tragedy,
and public joy.

<p>For the first time, nationally recognized authorities teach 
their extraordinary seven-step method which allows
us to talk with our Angels.  In clear fashion, ANGELSPEAKE 
explains that Angels are God's messengers,
providing comfort, healing, guidance, and love, and that the act 
of writing to our Angels means that we can
take the initiative and actively ask for help, for understanding, 
for love.  We can take control of our lives
while we get Angelic support.

<p>Beautifully written, with a basic message that has universal 
appeal, ANGELSPEAKE is an easy and practical
guide for anyone seeking a more fulfilling life.

<p>Barbara Mark and Trudy Griswold are sisters.  They have perfected 
their system through years of working
with people one-on-one and teaching classes in Angel communication 
techniques.  They were featured on
"Good Morning America" where their workshop on how to contact Angels 
was part of a series called
"Spirituality in America."  Barbara lives in San Diego, California, 
and Trudy lives in Westport, Connecticut.

backlash that, as she amply demonstrates, has worked on two levels: convincing women that their feelings
of dissatisfaction and distress are the result of too much feminism and independence, while simultaneously
undermining the minimal progress that women have made at work, in politics and in their own minds.

The many aspects of peace are presented in the form of stories 
and  poems specifically for children; peace 
among people living in different lands as well

races and among brothers and sisters.  
Some of its contents are funny and fanciful, others are serious and 
moving.  All celebrate the hope for a peaceful world.

<P>
<p>Until this book, Elvis Presley's family history and early years had remained largely unexplored.  As Elvis'
cousin, co-author Earl Greenwood probes Presley's life from a unique and personal perspective.  Greenwood
grew up alongside Presley and later served as both his press agent and confidant.  Greenwood reveals
personal insights and shares family secrets to paint a stunningly intimate and candid portrait of Elvis Presley
from his boyhood in rural Tupelo, Missippi, through his skyrocketing success and tragic death.

absurdity, <b><I>Breaking the Silence</I></b> is as forthright and engaging as Hartley herself.

<P>
THE VERY FIRST GOLDY BEAR MYSTERY FEATURING THE INTREPID CATERING SLEUTH

<p>Catering the wake of her son's favorite teacher is not Goldy's idea of fun.  Particularly 
when her former father in-law passes out, nearly felled from rat poison!

<p>Investigating officer Tom Schulz, though smitten with Goldy and her food, is forced to shut 
down her business.  That's the last straw, so Goldy sets out to find the culprit who planted 
the poison.

<p>Everyone -- from Goldy's ex-husband's other ex-wife to her eleven year-old son Arch -- 
seems to know more than Goldy does.  But as she begins following the recipe to its logical 
conclusion, Goldy discovers that some very unsavory ingredients are flavoring the 
neighborhood and poisoning her own family with the bitter taste of deceit and revenge.

<h3>By James A. Michener<br>
Read by David Dukes</h3>
<P>
<p>With his bestselling book <b><I>Centennial</I></b>, James A. Michener turns to the history of his own country in this
sweeping novel set in Colorado.  The story concerns what used to be called, "the winning of the West" - the
story of the land and the Indians who inhabited it and of the people of many nations who came to drive them
out.

<p><b><I>Centennial</I></b> is based solidly on the facts of history, but history is only the setting.  The real story is that
of the host of characters involved in dramatic events and conflicts.

<P>
<p>Goldy Bear agrees to cater the first College Advisory Dinner 
for Seniors and parents at the exclusive Elk Park
Prepatory School. Sure, the competition among students is fierce, 
and some of the parents act as if they'd
kill to get their kid into a big-name college, but as Goldy ladles 
out sumptuous fare, the only deadly things
she encounters are snobbery and boredom...until she steps outside.

<h3>By Clancy Carlile<br>
Read by Courtney B. Vance</h3>
<P>
<p>In the tradition of Larry McMurty, CHILDREN OF THE DUST 
is a sweeping and historically accurate
account of the Oklahoma Land rush of the 1880s.  Gypsy Smith, 
a mixed-blood black-Cherokee agrees to lead
a caravan of black settlers into the untamed Oklahoma territory 
on their journey to a new life.

<p>Gypy's story plays counterpoint with that of John Maxwell, 
a white schoolteacher whose affection for his
Indian students forces him to confront his own "enlightened" beliefs.

<p><I>The landmark book from the author of <b>And The Band Played On</b></I>

<p><b>Once in a generation comes a book that can change the world.</b>

<p>Author Randy Shilts follows his bestseller, <b><I>And the Band Played On</I></b> with this sweeping investigation of the
situation of gay men and lesbians in the military over our nation's history.  With thousands of documents
obtained through the Freedom of Information Act, Shilts offers the first in-depth look at the behind-the-scenes
decision making that resulted in the fierce purges of gays in the military over the past thirty years. 

<p>With its epic scope this book provides the basis of a national debate not only on the issue of lesbians and gays
in the military but on the broader issue of the place of homosexuals in America life.

<P>
<p>Set in the West and sometimes in Alaska, these stories are about women who are smart and susceptible to
love, and men who are wild and hard to pin down.  The heroines in these stories are part daredevil, part

<p>Three generations of fire and fame, they were born to star, born to dazzle!

<blockquote>
<p>SENDA:  She fled the pogrom-haunted woods of her childhood for the scented palaces of St. Petersburg and
stardom on stage.

<p>TAMARA:  Golden-haired star of the Silver Screen, her face was her fortune and Hollywood her kingdom.

<p>DALIAH: The film idol of millions -- in her the legend lives on.

<p>Three lives burning with power and passion.

<P>
<p>        A flu suddenly becomes deadly and kills more than
20 million people.  Malaria, once easily treated, has become
one of the most persistent diseases of our time.
Smithsonian biologists Paul Ewald and Alan Herre believe
a critical influence on the spread and deadliness of
disease -- evolution -- has been overlooked.  Their studies
may provide critical information on how viruses become more
virulent, including such complex ones as HIV.  Probe the
theories of evolution that could lead to changes in the
treatment of infectious disease.

<P>
<b><i>Original comedy from one of the fastest rising stars in the business!!!</i></b>

<p>Vince Valenzuela has been called "wonderfully sick and delightfully twisted" and with good
reason.  He calls his humor, "sarcastic, observational comedy via exaggerated characterization". 
Whatever you call it, DERAINDAMAGED is hilarious proof that the youngest of five kids raised by a
Mexican father and a chain-smoking German/English mother on a teacher's humble salary in the
eternally grey, rain-soaked environment of Seattle has an uncanny ability to raise the mundane events
of everyday living to a new level of absurdity.

<p>DERAINDAMAGED reveals the hypocrisies, double standards and dysfunctions of human behavior,
pop-culture, inane social trends, relationships, sex, and current events via what Vince describes as
"thought provoking cynicism.  He has already gained much national recognition from his appearances
on A&E's "Evening at the Improv", HBO's "Loco Slam", USA's "Up All Night" and <I>Entertainment
Tonight</I>.  Now, DERAINDAMAGED gives us one of comedy's fastest rising talents at his devastatingly
funny best!

<h3>By Antonio R. Damasio<br>
Read by Antonio R. Damasio</h3>
<P>
<p>DESCARTES' ERROR is a journey of discovery, from the story 
of Phineas Gage, the famous nineteenth-
century case of behavioral change that followed brain damage, 
to the contemporary re-creation of Gage's
brain; and from the doubts of a young neurologist to a testable 
hypothesis concerning the emotions and their
fundamental role in rational human behavior.

<p>Drawing on his experiences with neurological patients 
affected by brain damage (his laboratory is recognized
worldwide as the foremost center for the study of patients), 
Damasio shows how the absence of emotion and
feeling can break down rationality.  In the process, Damasio 
offers a novel perspective on what emotions and
feelings actually are: a direct sensing of our own body states, 
a link between the body and its survival-oriented
regulations, on the one hand, and consciousness on the other.

<p>Certain to spark impassioned debate and change forever the 
way in which we conceive the relationship
between mind and body, DESCARTES' ERROR, will be remarked on 
for its optimism, and its faith in the
human spirit.

<p>Over the past decade Americans have come to accept the importance of good nutrition and to understand its
role in prolonging and improving the quality of our lives and the prevention of disease.  In the last few years
scientists have proven that certain compounds found in both common foods and dietary supplements, "smart
nutrients", can actually improve mental capacity.

<p>Robert Haas is a <I>New York Times</I> bestselling author of nutritional books.  In <b><I>Eat Smart, Think Smart</I></b>
he offers the first comprehensive blueprint for building a safe and effective dietary program for increasing
and improving your mental facilities.

<P>
<p>Israel's secret services have made the headlines perhaps more often than those of any other country.  The
capture of Adolph Eichmann, the rescue at Entebbe, the raid on the Iraqi nuclear reactor - such daring,
flamboyant success stories as these are merely the most visible aspects of this small country's complex
intelligence community.

<p>Here is an in-depth and objective history of all the branches of that community by award-winning CBS News
correspondent Dan Raviv.

<P>
<p><b>A major motion picture from the producer of FORREST GUMP starring 
Robert DeNiro and Wesley
Snipes</b>

<p>Two men.

<p>One is a baseball star.  He has an ex-cheerleader for a wife 
and a girl in every big league town.  The ball
comes off his bat like a firecracker.  Bobby Rayburn isn't just a 
ballplayer.  He's a god.

<p>The other has a wife who's left him.  His bank balance slides 
towards zero while his child support and car
payments soar through the roof.  He hates his job and the product 
he pushes.  But his license plate reads,
"WNSX."  Gil Renard isn't just a knife salesman,  He's THE FAN.

<p>But what happens when the barrier between idolator and idol 
collapses?  What happens when Gil Renard
sacrifices everything he has left to raise the Sox from the depths 
and to rescue Bobby Rayburn from what
threatens to be an irreversible slump?  What happens when Gil 
Renard crosses the white line and anoints
himself a Player in the Game?

<p>What happens when the adoration of THE FAN becomes the kiss 
of death?

Read by Bob Simon</h3>
<P>
<p>On the fifth day of the Gulf War, CBS News' Chief Middle Eastern correspondent Bob Simon and his crew
of three stepped across a deserted border post between Saudi Arabia and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.  With this
fateful foray into enemy territory, "CBS Four," as they were quickly known around the world, descended
into a gulag of terror, interrogations, beatings and starvation.

<p>Simon recounts with chilling detail his ordeal at the hands of his Iraqi captors.

a collection of the stories that made him one of America's national treasures.

<p>George Burn's career spanned the history of modern show business: he starred in big-time
vaudeville; in radio, television, the movies, and the recording industry: an on the nightclub stage.           

<p>This collection of the beloved centenarian's favorite and funniest stories come directly from his
private stock.  From recollections of events in his past to tales about friends and performers who have
crossed his path -- including Al Jolson, Groucho Marx, Jack Benny, Bob Hope, Ann-Margaret, and
Goldie Hawn -- George Burns left us this very personal and very funny record of his wit and charm.

<P>
<p>In <b><I>Gilligan, Maynard & Me</I></b>, Bob Denver takes us backstage and behind the scenes of Dobie Gillis and
Gilligan's Island, two of the most popular shows in television history.  Denver tells what it was like to be
plucked from obscurity to portray America's most celebrated beatnik, Maynard G. Krebs and then to become
Gilligan, the world's favorite stranded castaway.

<p>Containing stories about the cast and crews of Denver's various shows, <b><I>Gilligan, Maynard & Me</I></b> also
provides a genial insider's view of how Hollywood and television work.  A must for all baby boomers and
show-biz buffs, <b><I>Gilligan, Maynard & Me</I></b> is sure to put a smile on the face of anyone who has ever
relished the outrageous antics and self deprecating slapstick of that television original, Bob Denver.

<p>Arnie Goldman hasn't seen his high school buddy for some time.  Now at twenty-five, he has crippling
rheumatoid arthritis and depends on a pair of aluminum crutches for mobility.  When Redso Wolff re-enters
his life, he brings with him earthy Billy Rubin, who, until recently, has led a sheltered life controlled by her
eccentric rabbi father.  A love triangle of obsession and lust develops and Billy is forced to choose between
them.

<h3>By William A. Henry, III<br>
Read by Frank Ferrante</h3>
<P>
<p>Two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning critic William A. Henry, III, delivers the definitive biography of the
legendary Jackie Gleason, one of the greatest entertainers of all time and a man who truly was larger than
life.

<p>From the nightclubs where he spent his paycheck, to his signing of an $11 million contract with CBS and
Buick that made him the highest-paid star in the business, Jackie Gleason had it all: money, power, and
fame.

<p>Yet beneath the facade of Gleason's public persona, the merry roisterer, was a deeply private and angry man
who was often lonely and depressed.

It started with a mysterious and seemingly 
innocent postcard, but from that point nothing was to remain the 
same in the life of Griffin Moss, a quiet 
artist living in London.  Over the course of this best-selling trilogy, 
Griffin's world is turned upside down by Sabine, 
a strangely exotic woman living on a tropical island 
thousand of miles away.

<p>Beginning in GRIFFIN & SABINE, the relationship 
between the title characters unfolds in a series of 
postcards and letters.  SABINE'S NOTEBOOK, the second 
book, follows Griffin on a journey while he 
struggles to maintain his precarious link to reality, 
and to Sabine.  Finally, THE GOLDEN MEAN, builds toward 
a powerful conclusion that will satisfy the millions 
of readers and listeners entranced by the imaginative and 
enigmatic union of Griffin and Sabine.

<p>INCLUDES PORTIONS OF HALDEMAN'S ORIGINAL RECORDINGS

<p>When H.R. Haldeman died, he left behind a profound legacy 
that few knew existed -- four years, three
months of diaries, which he wrote and dictated daily during 
his tenure as Chief of Staff for President Richard
Nixon.  These diaries, never before published, offer a fascinating 
portrait of an era and a White House that
still haunt American history and politics to this day.

<p>THE HALDEMAN DIARIES is an historic audio document from 
Haldeman's original recordings, which
reflects an unvarnished insider's view of the triumphs and 
tragedies of the Nixon administration.

<h3>By Peter Hoeg<br>
Read by Maxwell Caufield</h3>
<P>
<p>        Peter Hoeg's first novel, THE HISTORY OF DANISH DREAMS, 
established him instantly in Scandinavia
as one of the most exciting writers today.  Intricate, sprawling, 
and often hilarious, this is a family
novel unlike any other.  Through a series of vividly imagined and 
wildly colorful characters, Hoeg gives
us a very different account of the twentieth century, which in 
Denmark encompasses the transition
from a medieval society to a modern welfare state with its accompanying 
cultural revolutions.  The cast
includes a count who builds a wall around his estate and stops 
all of his clocks to prevent the passage
of time; an old lady who presides over a powerful newspaper dynasty 
and predicts the future
accurately in print despite being illiterate; and Adonis Jensen, 
who causes his vagabond parents great
sorrow through his inability to steal.  Reminiscent of the work 
of the magical realists but with a
distinctive Nordic twist, THE HISTORY OF DANISH DREAMS is a truly 
magical novel.

<P>
<p>Pamela Jacoby is a police officer; the man questioning her is an innovative psychiatrist.  The interrogation
is crucial because it involves the brutal murder of Pamela's lover, the very man her doctor paired her with
to help her solve her deeply rooted problems.  The explosive revelation that results shocks the police
department and reveals the depths of Pamela's torment.

<P>
<p>        When writer Harriet Mahoney answered an ad to ghostwrite 
a book based on the life of Isabel
Krug, a sexy blonde with a tabloid past, little did she know that 
her escape from New York would end
up a free-fall into happiness.  After Harriet moves into Isabel's 
Cape Code retreat she is drawn into
Isabel's freewheeling soap opera of a life.  Soon, Harriet's memories 
of her bagel-baking ex-boyfriend
fade into oblivion as the two women write Isabel's louder than 
life memoir and Harriet wins the
affection of a gentle man who appreciates in her what other men 
have failed to see.

<p>Witty, sage, and compassionate, filled with zany and endearing 
characters, ISABEL'S BED is a truly
enchanting and enormously entertaining experience.

<P>
<p><I>The <b>New York Times</b> bestseller!</I>

<p>The Kennedy that emerges from this book is, behind his playboy facade, vastly more driven and more serious
than historians have ever before portrayed him.  Though Joseph Kennedy reluctantly transferred the family's
political mantle to his second son in 1944, the presidential dream that the ambassador had reserved for his
eldest son was JFK's own secret ambition.

<p>In this riveting family saga, we see the true Jack Kennedy, warts and all; a symbolic, relentlessly honest yet
sympathetic story of the struggles of youth.

<h3>By Diane Mott Davidson<br>
Read by Barbara Rosenblat</h3>
<P>
<p>Nobody whips up a deliciously wicked mystery like Diane 
Mott Davidson.  Her intrepid sleuth, Goldy Bear,
smoothly blends criminal investigations with irresistible dishes 
from her budding Colorado business,
Goldilocks' Catering.  The result is a decadent double-decker of 
mouthwatering mystery and recipes to die
for...

<p>It should be the happiest day of Goldy's life.  After years 
of struggling to put the disaster of her first
marriage behind her, she has finally found the courage to love 
again and soon she'll be walking down the
aisle.  But moments after Goldy's put the finishing touches on 
the scrumptious reception feast and just before
the ceremony is to begin she receives an urgent call from the 
groom.  The wedding is off and the reason is
murder.

<P>
<p>Littlejohn McCain, an 82-year-old North Carolina farmer, 
goes out into the Blue Sandhills on the hottest day
of the year to sit in the afternoon sun on the edge of Maxwell's 
Millpond, wait for the monkey, and pray for
an act of God.  Why?

<p>Littlejohn is not as he appears.  He is a man whose father 
lost a leg in the Civil war, and whose daughter and
grandson are fighting more personal battles in the very 
different world of the 20th century.  Now, in the
summer of 1989, with the loose ends all tied up, he 
reflects on a life that has been filled with terrible secrets
and unexpected redemption.  A life of Old Testament proportions.

<h3>By Peter Forbath<br>
Read by Maxwell Caulfield</h3>
<P>
From the acclaimed author of THE LAST HERO and HONORABLE MEN comes this 
extraordinary novel set in the late 15th century at the time of the Portuguese discovery of 
the Congo.  LORD OF THE KONGO is the story of a friendship between a Portuguese cabin 
boy and a Congo prince, and of the tragic events -- the creation of a black Portuguese 
"kingdom", the fomenting of civil and religious wars, and the fatal introduction of the slave 
trade -- that dooms both young men.  Based on real events and real people, this is a great, 
sweeping historical novel in the tradition of SHO-GUN, about the collision of European 
culture with Africa.

<p>Having saved virtually every letter her father wrote to her between the years 1938, when she was eleven years
old, and 1967, Groucho's  letters to his daughter Miriam show the ups and downs of Groucho's career, his
two divorces and subsequent remarriages and Miriam's often tumultuous young adulthood.  Groucho is
revealed as a man deeply concerned with holding his family together and as a sometimes firm, always loving
father who never hesitated to say exactly what he thought.

<p>Elizabeth-Anne Hale arrived in New York with four small children, no husband -- and a dream that seemed
impossible to everyone but herself.

<p>In the free-wheeling world of high finance, in the relentless realm of hard work, and in the arms of the
brilliant dynamic man she desperately needed in the greatest gamble of her life, she made her passionate
dream come true.  And she became the first of the Hale women to learn the high price of having all that
money could buy, all that desire could demand...

<h3>By  Smithsonian Institution<br>
Read by Margaret Geller and John Huchra</h3>
<P>
<p>        Astrophysicists Margaret Geller and John Huchra are 
redrawing a map of the universe.  Using advanced instruments
ranging from an array of mirror telescopes mounted in a
rotating building high above the Arizona desert, to x-ray
images from orbiting telescopes in space, the two are
painstakingly pinpointing galaxies millions of light
years across time and space from earth.  In the process,
Geller and Huchra have discovered a remarkable structure
to the arrangement of galaxies: they are arranged as though
on the surface of great "soap bubbles," separated by vast areas
of other mysterious phenomena: dark matter.  Their virtual
adventure through space is as tantalizing as any on earth.

<p>Christa Kenwood, a world famous ex-model, decides to open a modeling agency in America's newest mecca,

its owner, Johnny Rosetti, on a path of violent revenge.  Christa's first big account is the phenomenally
successful designer Mary McGregor Whitney.  When Mary and Lisa both fall in love with Rob Sand, a

<p><b>The <I>New York Times</I> bestseller!</b>

<p>A vibrant celebration of our ability to smell, taste, hear, 
touch and see.  Poet, pilot, naturalist, journalist,
essayist and explorer, Diane Ackerman weaves together scientific 
fact with lore, history and voluptuous
description.  The resulting work is a startling and enchanting 
account of how human beings experience and
savor the world.

<p>A NATURAL HISTORY OF THE SENSES is at once an ingenious 
exploration of the physical processes
underlying our perceptions and an eloquent ode to life; a rare 
combination.

<p>DIANE ACKERMAN was born in Waukegan, Illinois.  She received 
her B.A. from Pennsylvania State
University and an M.F.A. and Ph.D. from Cornell University.  
Her poetry has been published in many
leading literary journals.  Ms. Ackerman has received the 
Academy of American Poet's Lavan Award and
grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the 
Rockefeller Foundation among other recognitions. 
She has taught at Columbia and Cornell Universities, and she 
is currently a staff writer for <I>The New Yorker</I>.

<p><b><I>On the Line</I></b> examines how the 1992 presidential race became a "call-in campaign."  It details the discovery
of talk shows by America's political candidates and explores how this permanently altered the rules of the
political game. <b><I>On the Line</I></b> also features King's lively anecdotes about the candidates' revealing off-air
comments and his dealings with their campaign managers, spokespeople and strategists.

<p>From an impoverished childhood in Sledge, Mississippi, Charley Pride ascended into the pantheon of country
music, winning three Grammys, selling more than twenty-five million records in the U.S. alone, and
garnering thirty-one gold albums.

<p>Pride was signed to RCA in 1965, but is was not until after he scored several radio hits that he made his first
major public appearance, and the country world discovered the color of his skin.  Since then, Pride has
become a potent symbol of the new South.  Pride has had thirty-six #1 singles and is rated by Billboard as
one of the top twenty bestselling artists of all time, earning himself a permanent place in country music
history.

<P>
<p>Framed for a crime she did not commit, Tara Bent escapes to 
New Orleans, where she meets Jarrett
McKenzie, a grieving widower on his journey home to the rich, 
unspoiled beauty of his Florida farmland. 
Jarrett, torn between his loyalty for his Seminole half brother 
and his own way of life, is drawn to Tara
hoping she might fill the empty spaces in his life.  Despite her 
fear of the Seminoles, Tara accompanies Jarrett
to his home deep in the Florida swamps, envisioning a life far 
different from the one she fled in New Orleans.

<p>Trapped in a lush yet frightening, unsettled land, Tara must 
choose between a passionate stranger and the
danger awaiting her back in "civilization".  She cautiously 
surrenders her fear and hatred of the Indians and
joins Jarrett in his resistance to President Jackson's relentless 
and bloody persecution of the Seminoles.  But -
- in one shattering moment -- Tara's past catches up with her, 
threatening to destroy the fragile bonds of
their growing love.

<P>
<p>SAINT MUDD  begins with a haunting double murder and ends 
with the discovery of the killers by Grover
Mudd.  In between, St. Paul, "the poison spot" of the Depression, 
comes to teeming life.  All the legendary
gangsters of the era -- Baby Face Nelson, Alvin Karpis, the 
Barker boys, John Dillinger -- visit St. Paul to
play and loot and kill.  And they roam free in a city full 
of corrupt cops, crooked politicians, graft, bootleg
liquor, and opium dreams, amid a few failed saints.

<p>The prime would-be saint of the novel is Mudd himself, 
a St. Paul newspaper reporter who was gassed in the
Great War and is now a consumptive, disillusioned by what 
is happening to his town, and at the same time,
suicidally idealistic.  One other potential saint is Stormy 
Day, a gentle black woman whom Grover Mudd has
come to love.  But he is also attracted to the beautiful 
blond moll Roxanne Schultz.  

<p>The action moves through these pressure points nonstop 
from beginning to end, in a clamor of high energy
and stylized set pieces that will remind readers of 
E.L. Doctorow's  Billy Bathgate, William Kennedy's Legs
and the novels of John Dos Passos.

<h3>By Dennis Mcfarland<br>
Read by William Schallert</h3>
<P>
<p>SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND is the story of a brother and sister, now 
in their seventies, propelled on an
unforseen journey into their pasts by a shocking event in the present.  
Francis Brimm, a celebrated news
photographer, has spent his peripatetic life as a professional 
voyeur, peering out with his camera at the lives
of others but avoiding any gazes inward.  Now retired, he returns 
to his childhood home the Gulf Coast of
Florida and reacquaints himself with his sweet-tempered older 
sister, Muriel, whose circumscribed life has
been the opposite of his own.

<p>Both brother and sister are haunted by images from the past, 
and when Francis stumbles upon evidence of
a gruesome local murder, it shakes them profoundly.  Gripped by 
a "creeping vine of memory," they
gradually confront their blindness to the hidden truths about 
their lives.

<p>DENNIS MCFARLAND's short fiction has appeared in <I>The New Yorker</I> 
and elsewhere.  His first novel, The
MUSIC ROOM was published to wide acclaim in 1990.  He lives in 
Boston with his wife and two children.

<P>
Ever wonder how Karl Marx might have pitched Coca-Cola?  What kind of sales tactic Walt 
Whitman would have hit on to sell Fab laundry detergent?  Or how Shakespeare would have plugged 
Shout stain remover ("Out, out' damn spot!")?  Wonder no more, because Joey Green has tackled 
these and other advertising gems -- including Kafkas's take on Raid Kills Bugs Dead and Nietzche's 
musings over Where's the Beef?  So whether it's Herman Melville on Tidy Bowl or Robert Louis 
Stevenson poring over Dr. Pepper and Mr. Hyde, you'll find a unique cultural experience here on every 
page!

<h3>By Catherine Coulter<br>
Read by Juliet Mills</h3>
<P>
<p><I>The first book in the <b>Bride Trilogy</b> from bestselling author Catherine Coulter.</I>

<p>Douglas Sherbrooke, Earl of Northcliffe, is a man besieged.  He must have an heir and the time has come to marry.

<p>Melissande Chambers, the exquisite eldest daughter of the Duke of Beresford, is the obvious choice for
Douglas to wed.  When duty calls him away to France he loses the hand of the fair Melissande and must
marry her sister, Alexandra.  While Alexandra is attractive and intelligent, she certainly cannot compare to
Melissande.  Yet, slowly Alexandra's boundless spirit wins over Douglas and he learns to love with his heart,
not his eyes.

<b>A video documentary about the Airstream trailer phenomenon -- Our first video!</b>

<p>SILVER PALACE takes the viewer on a journey into 
the lifestyles of the Airstreamers (the "silver-bullet" 
of recreational vehicles) when over 6000 Airstreamers 
from all over the U.S., Canada and from as far 
away as Australia, converge for the "Thirty-third 
International Wally Byam Caravan Club Rally".  Then 
it's westward ho as we follow the "Maple Leaf Trail 
Caravan" exploring along the way this unique 
culture of nomadic retirees.  In interviews, coverage 
of rally activities, and vintage film of Wally Byam, 
the inventor of the Airstream trailer and namesake 
of the organization which celebrates the RV's, SILVER PALACE 
takes the viewer on a one-of-a-kind voyage 
across America and Canada.

<p>Nothing was too much for Helene Junot. She was the most successful woman in the fashion world.  Women
envied her, men desired her. With her beauty and brains she built the greatest magazine empire on Earth. 
But Helene never forgot the horrors of her childhood in France during the war.  She vowed to repay the <b><I>Sins</I></b>
visited on her family seven-fold, as she brilliantly schemed her way to the top.

<h3>By Suzanne Finstad<br>

<P>
<p><I>A true story of passion, deceit, and attempted murder . . .</I>

<p>Barbra Piotrowski's life seemed as charmed as that of a fairy tale princess:  A straight "A" student with
ambitions to become a doctor, she also possessed blond-goddess looks which won her scores of beauty titles. 
When she met Richard Minns, a dashing Texas millionaire and body builder extraordinaire on the slopes of
Aspen, Barbara thought she had found her Prince Charming.

<p>She was wrong.  Minns completely took over her life, moved her to Houston without telling her about his wife
of twenty-five years, and then, hired assassins to kill her.

<h3>By  Smithsonian Institution<br>
Read by Robert Laughlin</h3>
<P>
<p>         The ancient language of the Mayans, Tzotzil, preserves
valuable knowledge of plants useful in food, medicine, and even
construction.  It is a living, beautiful language, spoken by
thousands in the Chiapas region of present-day Mexico.  But it
has been, until now, an unwritten language.  Smithsonian
anthropologist Robert Laughlin is working
with Mayans living in Mexico to write a Tzotzil dictionary,
insuring the preservation of the language and of the knowledge
that it carries.  With the power of words, a
renewed sense of self-respect has led some Mayans working
with Laughlin to new insights on questions of the
meaning of cultural identity.
