<CENTER><A NAME="20"><H2><STRONG>Bar Associations </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER><P>
Bar associations are professional groups for attorneys. Bar associations
view helping the public as an important part of their mission. <P>
In Minnesota, lawyers have formed the Minnesota State Bar Association (MSBA),
an organization with almost 14,000 members. Each member also belongs to
one of 21 district bar associations. These associations serve their members
by providing continuing legal education and a forum for discussing concerns
of the legal profession. They also serve the public, providing lawyer referrals,
informational booklets and pamphlets, a telephone information service, and
a variety of public education programs. Most of these services are available
at little or no cost. <P>
Consumers should consider taking advantage of bar association services when
they are seeking general information While not providing legal advice, these
resources can help one decide whether to pursue a case, what actions to
take, and what type of lawyer to contact.<P>
<P>
<A NAME="30"><H3><STRONG>The Minnesota State Bar Association </STRONG></H3></A><P>
The Minnesota State Bar Association is a statewide organization for attorneys,
with almost 14,000 attorneys members throughout Minnesota. The 1996 officers
are: Lewis A. Remele, Jr., President; John Nys, President-Elect; Mark Gehan,
Jr., Treasurer; and Sheryl Ramstad Hvass, Secretary. The Executive Committee
members at large are: Thomas Clure, Gregory Gray, and Jarvis Jones. The
Executive Director of the Bar Association is Timothy Groshens, and the Associate
Executive Director is Mary Jo Ruff.<P>
In recent years, the Bar Association has worked to improve communication
between the legal profession and the public, promoting increased levels
of the public's understanding of the law. The Bar Association has also heightened
the public's awareness of the numerous positive contributions that lawyers
make to the community that often go unnoticed.<P>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="40"><H2><STRONG>Publications and Information Resources </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER><P>
<P>
<A NAME="50"><H3><STRONG>Publications </STRONG></H3></A><P>
Legal associations offer dozens of pamphlets, booklets, and fact sheets
that cover legal topics from divorce to real estate. <P>
MSBA's free pamphlets provide a quick overview of 11 common legal issues.
Topics include adult abuse and neglect, bankruptcy, buying a home, wills,
child abuse and neglect, coming of age, getting a divorce (English and Spanish
versions available), getting married, and being a witness. Two particularly
helpful pamphlets discuss lawyers and how to work with them. The pamphlet
<STRONG>Selecting a Lawyer</STRONG> offers suggestions on finding and selecting
an attorney. <STRONG>Helping Your Lawyer Help You</STRONG> gives hints
on working effectively with a lawyer and avoiding wasted time and money.
Single copies of these pamphlets are free; there is a small charge for larger
quantities. To order, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to:
<P>
Pamphlets<BR>
MSBA<BR>
514 Nicollet Mall, #300<BR>
Minneapolis, MN 55402<BR>
or call (612) 333-1183 or 1-800-882-6722.
<P>
The Minnesota Legal Services Coalition, an organization of programs serving
the civil legal needs of low-income Minnesotans, offers more in-depth information
on selected topics through its booklet series. The booklets discuss topics
including divorce (English and Spanish versions available), tenants' rights,
and the rights of senior citizens, and make recommendations on what steps
to take and how and when to contact a lawyer. A single copy of each booklet
costs $4, plus tax. To order, contact the Minnesota Legal Services Coalition,
40 Fourth Street East, 726 Minnesota Building, St. Paul, MN 55101, or call
(612) 228-9105. <P>
Other organizations offer more specialized information. The Hennepin County
Bar Association (HCBA) has compiled a booklet on the legal concerns of young
adults. Called Legal Stuff, the booklet answers questions about employment
law, marriage, voting rights, and draft registration, among other issues.
More than 10,000 copies of the booklet have been distributed to high school
students. To order, contact the HCBA.<P>
HCBA also publishes two booklets that focus on the health care decisions
facing senior citizens. The first is a booklet on living wills. A living
will describes for doctors and loved ones what medical treatment an individual
would like to receive or avoid in case of terminal illness. The booklet
describes how living wills are used and includes a form that the reader
can use to write such a will. <P>
The second publication is a booklet on the durable power of attorney for
health care decisions. State law allows an individual to appoint another
person to make health care decisions when that individual is no longer able
to communicate his or her own wishes. The booklet describes how consumers
can use these documents to control how health care decisions will be made
for them if they become incapacitated. This booklet includes the necessary
forms for making the designation. <P>
The forms for both the living will and durable power of attorney for health
care decisions can be completed without assistance from a lawyer. The documents
are legal when they have been properly witnessed, either with the signature
of two witnesses or a notary public. The booklets can be ordered from the
HCBA for $2 each or $3.50 for a set of both. <P>
<P>
<A NAME="60"><H3><STRONG>Tel-Law </STRONG></H3></A><P>
Explanations of legal issues are available through Tel-Law, a service of
the HCBA. Tel-Law is a free, telephone-accessed library of recorded legal
information on common subjects. It is available by touch-tone phone 24 hours
a day. Each tape runs from three to five minutes and gives an explanation
of a particular topic. More than 80 tapes are available, covering issues
such as how to select and work with lawyers, credit and bankruptcy, landlord-tenant
issues, family law, wills, estates and trusts, consumer law, home ownership,
and employment. <P>
To use the tapes effectively, listeners should be prepared to take notes.
It is possible to listen to a tape more than once to make sure that the
information is understood completely. Many Tel-Law tapes offer suggestions
on where to find other resources that deal with the topic. Contact Tel-Law
at (612) 332-2114. For an informational brochure send a self-addressed stamped
envelope to Hennepin County Bar Association, 514 Nicollet Mall, #350, Minneapolis,
MN 55402, or call (612) 340-0022.<P>
<P>
<A NAME="70"><H3><STRONG>Lawyer Referral Services </STRONG></H3></A><P>
Consumers who are unsure of how to locate an attorney can use this Guidebook,
and may also consider contacting one of several lawyer referral services
operated by bar associations and other nonprofit organizations. The advantage
of a lawyer referral service is that it saves consumers the trouble of wading
through the phone book to find an attorney with the proper qualifications
to handle their case. <P>
Lawyer referral services attempt to match the consumer with a lawyer in
his or her community. MSBA operates the Statewide Attorney Referral Service,
which handles more than 30,000 consumer calls each year. The service's panel
of lawyers includes nearly 300 attorneys who practice throughout Minnesota.
<P>
Attorneys who participate in this referral service have agreed to provide
a free 30-minute consultation for each case. The referral service charges
consumers $20 when there is a consultation with a lawyer. If a consumer
does not consult a lawyer, there is no referral fee. If a consumer decides
to hire a lawyer through the service, the consumer and lawyer negotiate
fees privately. The service does not set fees for its lawyers. <P>
Separate attorney referral services operate in Hennepin, Ramsey, Dakota,
and Washington counties. These services list only lawyers in the particular
county. There are fees for these referrals. In addition, Minnesota Women
Lawyers will refer cases involving all areas of law to the 120 women lawyers
listed on that organization's referral service. Callers are given the names
of up to three lawyers, and the referral is free. As with the other referral
services, the consumer and the lawyer negotiate fees privately. Most of
the lawyers listed in the Minnesota Women Lawyers' Service practice in the
Twin Cities area.<P>
Several other nonprofit organizations also offer attorney referrals. For
example, Chrysalis Attorney Referral Service handles cases for women who
contact them. In addition, Resources and Counseling for the Arts provides
attorney referrals for artists. <P>
Referral services are listed at the end of this section. <P>
<P>
<A NAME="80"><H3><STRONG>Public Education in the Law </STRONG></H3></A><P>
Many consumers are confused about the law and the legal system. Local and
state bar associations increasingly are offering education programs aimed
at the general public. <P>
Both the Ramsey County Bar Association (RCBA) and HCBA offer speakers who
will talk with groups about legal issues. Topics range from consumer protection
to real estate to living trusts. To arrange for a speaker to talk to a community
group, contact RCBA at (612) 222-0846 or HCBA at (612) 340-0022. There is
no charge and the speakers are experts in their particular area of law.<P>
Several law programs are televised in Minnesota. In the Twin Cities, Law
in Action airs once a week on Cable Channel 6, the metro-area public access
channel. The program features interviews with prominent attorneys and judges
and offers insight into legal topics in the news. Lawyers on the Line, a
call-in, question-and-answer program airs in Duluth. In western Minnesota,
Legal Lines airs on local cable channels in the Appleton area. <P>
Law-related education for students is available through bar association
programs. The Minnesota High School Mock Trial Competition introduces more
than 1200 students each year to the legal system. In the program, student
members of mock trial teams play the roles of lawyers and witnesses and
argue a case. Each team is coached by a volunteer lawyer and a teacher,
and competitions between schools are judged by local attorneys. Students
not only learn about the legal system, but they develop research and speaking
skills through the program. Each year, the mock trial competition culminates
in the State Mock Trial Tournament. The tournament brings together the top
12 teams statewide for a two-day competition. The final trial is held before
a member of the Minnesota Supreme Court. The winning team goes on to the
National Mock Trial Tournament. <P>
Students who do not participate in mock trials may learn about the law through
two textbooks on law available through the MSBA. <STRONG>The Student Lawyer</STRONG>
is used in more than 100 high schools statewide to give ninth and tenth
graders an introduction to the law. In addition, about 50 elementary schools
in the state use <STRONG>A Look at Law,</STRONG> which is a learning program
on law for upper elementary grades. <P>
Several bar associations and legal organizations sponsor an innovative summer
internship program for inner city youths. The program began in 1993 and
placed more than 50 students from disadvantaged backgrounds in law firms
during the summer. The program gives the student a good summer job, and
exposes them to the legal profession and work in an office. The first year
of the program was so successful it is being expanded to include more students
and other professions in future years. <P>
On Law Day, May 1, most local bar associations send members out into the
community to talk about legal issues. In the Twin Cities, hundreds of lawyers
are available in local shopping malls to answer specific questions about
legal issues and give general legal advice at no charge. <P>
<P>
<A NAME="90"><H3><STRONG>Resolving a Dispute Over Fees </STRONG></H3></A><P>
Bar organizations do not provide legal advice nor are they a place to register
a complaint about a lawyer. However, Minnesota's district bar associations
do offer a forum for consumers to work out fee disputes with their attorneys,
the most common type of complaint between a consumer and a lawyer. Called
fee arbitration panels, these groups are made up of local lawyers and consumers
who listen to each side of a dispute. The panel then helps the parties involved
reach a settlement. Regional fee arbitration panels can be contacted through
the local district bar association. If one cannot find that number in the
telephone book, the county court administrator or the MSBA can point one
in the right direction. <P>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="100"><H2><STRONG>Attorney General's Office </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER><P>
The Attorney General's Office is often referred to as "The People's
Lawyers." That is true, but more often than not people think of the
Attorney General working for taxpayers somewhat indirectly as a lawyer on
behalf of state government. The Attorney General also plays an important
role as the "People's Advocate." It is in this role that the Attorney
General is able to offer some direct legal services to the public and work
on behalf of the "little guy."<P>
In Minnesota, Attorney General Hubert "Skip" Humphrey III has
developed a vast array of consumer, environmental, and health fraud services
that the public can easily access. In fact, Minnesota has become a leader
and a model for many states in offering prompt and helpful customer service
through the Attorney General's Office, especially in the area of consumer
services.<P>
The next paragraphs provide an overview of some of the helpful and useful
services available from the Attorney General's Office.<P>
<P>
<A NAME="110"><H3><STRONG>Consumer Protection Division </STRONG></H3></A><P>
The Consumer Protection Division of the Attorney General's Office consists
of professional mediators who handle consumer complaints and consumer specialists
who answer between 400 and 500 telephone calls per day. The mediators in
Consumer Protection work to resolve disputes between consumers and various
types of businesses, such as auto dealers, mortgage companies, landlords,
and sweepstakes companies. The specialists who answer the consumer phone
lines provide basic information to callers about a wide variety of consumer-related
issues, including auto repair and other auto issues, landlord-tenant issues,
credit and collection issues, and home repair issues, among others.<P>
The Consumer Protection Division also publishes numerous brochures and booklets
on various consumer topics. Some of the most popular are the brochures on
landlord/tenant issues, the Minnesota Lemon Law, and the Used Car Warranty
Law. Recently, the Consumer Division completed a series of booklets on home
ownership, including <STRONG>The Home Buyer's Handbook, The Home Seller's
Handbook,</STRONG> and <STRONG>The Refinancing Handbook</STRONG> These
booklets are designed to help consumers understand the complexities of buying,
selling, and refinancing their homes.<P>
For more information about these services, contact the Consumer Division
at the following address: Minnesota Attorney General, Consumer Protection,
1400 NCL Tower, 445 Minnesota Street, St. Paul, MN 55101. The phone number
for Consumer Protection is (612) 296-3353 and the TDD number is (612) 297-7206.
The toll free number for voice and TDD is 1-800-657-3787.<P>
<P>
<A NAME="120"><H3><STRONG>Environment </STRONG></H3></A><P>
The Attorney General's Office is involved in a number of environmental programs.
Minnesota law provides substantial criminal penalties for several serious
environmental violations, particularly those that involve illegal transportation
and disposal of hazardous wastes and illegal discharge of hazardous air
and water pollutants.<P>
The Attorney General's Office has two environmental crimes investigators
on staff to work on these types of cases. Information on suspected criminal
violations of environmental laws may be reported by calling or contacting
one of the environmental crimes investigators at the following address:
Minnesota Attorney General, 1400 NCL Tower, 445 Minnesota Street, St. Paul,
MN 55101. The phone number for the environmental crimes program is (612)
296-7575 and the TDD number is (612) 297-7206. The toll free number for
voice and TDD is 1-800-657-3787. Complaints can also be reported to the
Minnesota Pollution Control Agency at (612) 296-6300 or 1-800-657-3864.<P>
The Attorney General's Office also serves as legal counsel to state environmental
agencies and is frequently involved in civil enforcement activities related
to violations of environmental laws. Although the Attorney General's Office
cannot provide legal advice or represent individuals, the office frequently
answers questions related to the legal aspects of the implementation and
enforcement of environmental laws. These questions are most often answered
by staff from the Environmental Protection Division at (612) 297-3471 and
the Agriculture and Natural Resources Division at (612) 297-2735.<P>
Finally, to help build a more environmentally sustainable future for Minnesota,
the Attorney General's Office has developed a grades K-6 and separate grades
7-12 curriculum guide for teachers and an activity guide for children that
are available through the office's Special Projects Group at the following
address: Minnesota Attorney General, 102 State Capitol, St. Paul, MN 55155.<P>
<P>
<A NAME="130"><H3><STRONG>Health Care Fraud and Overbilling </STRONG></H3></A><P>
The Attorney General's Office investigates and prosecutes health care providers
who engage in fraudulent billing practices.<P>
If a consumer reviews the statement of benefits paid by the insurance company
to the health care provider (such as a dentist or doctor) and sees that
the payment includes services that were never provided, such as getting
a tooth pulled or two office visits in one week, the consumer should contact
the insurance company or the Attorney General's Office.<P>
Medicaid recipients receive a monthly statement of benefits which lists
all of the providers who were paid by the state for services billed in the
preceding month. This statement is attached to the MA card they receive
every month. If the recipient sees a payment made for something never received,
such as a filled prescription or a doctor's visit, the recipient should
contact the Department of Human Services at the number listed on the bottom
of the statement. The Department of Human Services looks into the matter
to find out if it was a negligent error on the part of the provider, or
if there is evidence of a pattern of fraud. If it appears that fraud is
taking place, the matter is referred to the Attorney General's Office for
further investigation, such as conducting searches and taking formal statements.<P>
The Attorney General's Medicaid Fraud Unit has worked with the Travelers
Company and Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Minnesota to prosecute health care
providers who have billed both the state Medicaid program and the insurance
companies for services that were never provided, for more expensive services
than those actually provided, and for people who were never even seen by
the practitioner.<P>
Although many of the cases the Attorney General's Office prosecutes come
as referrals from insurance companies and the Department of Human Services,
often employees or former employees who are tired of watching their bosses
cheat the system contact the office. Many times they ask to keep their identity
confidential so the employer will not know that the illegal practices have
been reported by a person who is employed there. Other cases are reported
to the Attorney General by concerned family members who feel that their
sick loved one is being taken advantage of.<P>
The FBI estimates that as much as one in every ten dollars spent on health
care is lost to fraud, overbilling, and abuse. This cost is passed on to
consumers in increased premiums and taxes for Medicaid and Medicare. What
may appear to be a single error to the consumer may in fact be a broad pattern
of fraudulent billing the provider has spread around to many patients. Paying
attention to the statements the insurance company or Medicaid program issues
and questioning discrepancies can save the health care system and taxpayers
millions of dollars each year.<P>
<P>
<P>
<CENTER><A NAME="140"><H2><STRONG>Legal Resources </STRONG></H2></A></CENTER><P>
Lawyers have expanded their efforts to reach out to the public and provide
helpful services to consumers. Free information, referrals, and a variety
of educational programs are only a telephone call away. Consumers seeking
information would be wise to make that call as one of their first steps
in pursuing a legal matter.<P>

The attorney general is designated by the Florida Constitution as the state's chief legal officer and a member of the Florida Cabinet. As the chief legal officer, the attorney general oversees the Department of Legal Affairs. When the state is sued, the attorney general usually provides the defense. The attorney general also defends most appeals arising from criminal convictions in the state courts, opposes major challenges to the general laws of Florida, and issues formal legal opinions on questions relating to the application of state laws.<P>
Criminal law enforcement is an official responsibility of the Attorney General's Office through the Office of Statewide Prosecution. The Attorney General's Office is also the chief enforcement agency for antitrust and consumer protection laws and for civil prosecution of criminal racketeering.<P>
As a member of the Florida Cabinet, the attorney general is one of six officials who meet together regularly with the governor as the board of directors of a number of state agencies. In addition to having a vote on the Cabinet, the attorney general advises on legal issues related to the Cabinet and represents the governor and Cabinet in litigation.<P>
Elections for the position of attorney general are held every four years. The current Florida attorney general is Robert A. "Bob" Butterworth. Mr. Butterworth was elected in 1986. He was re-elected in 1990 and 1994.<P>

The Florida Bar is an organization consisting of attorneys and judges licensed to practice law in the state of Florida. The current membership of The Florida Bar is approximately 52,000; about 43,000 of whom reside in the state. The purpose of The Florida Bar is to provide services for both its membership and the general public. For attorneys, The Florida Bar provides interpretations of the Rules of Professional Conduct, administers Continuing Legal Education (CLE) seminars and programs, publishes The Florida Bar <STRONG>News</STRONG> and The Florida Bar <STRONG>Journal,</STRONG> and otherwise endeavors to maintain the integrity of The Bar while assisting in the professional growth of its membership.<p>
For the general public, The Florida Bar administers a number of programs aimed at improving the manner in which legal services are provided in the State of Florida. Among these programs are the Fee Arbitration Program, which helps clients and lawyers resolve fee disputes, the Client's Security Fund, which compensates clients for losses due to misappropriation of funds by errant Florida lawyers, and the Law Related Education Program, which promotes "legal literacy" among Florida's young people. The Florida Bar also investigates the unlicensed practice of law, investigates complaints made against attorneys, maintains the Florida Call-A-Law service, which provides recorded information on a variety of basic legal topics, and maintains a public information office providing news releases, educational pamphlets, and other promotional materials.<p>
The Florida Bar is headquartered in Tallahassee on a five-acre site just three blocks from the capitol. The Florida Bar's other branch offices are located in Miami, Tampa, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale.<P>

Persons who are unsure of how to locate an attorney may contact one of several lawyer referral services operated by bar associations and other organizations. A referral service will attempt to match the client with a lawyer in his or her community. If a client decides to hire a lawyer through the service, the client and lawyer negotiate fees privately between themselves; the service does not set fees for its lawyers.<P>

<P>
<B>RICHARD D. HANNIGAN</B>: Mr. Hannigan has practiced Workers' Compensation Law for the past 23 years. For the past 20 years, he has exclusively limited his practice to the area of workers' compensation, representing insurance companies and employees from 1973 to 1991, and now limits his practice to serving the injured worker. Mr. Hannigan has lectured and published articles on workers' compensation for the Illinois State Bar Association, the National Business Institute, and the Lake County Bar Association. Having successfully represented workers' compensation clients in the Supreme and Appellate Courts of the State of Illinois, Mr. Hannigan possesses the technical knowledge of guiding a case through the maze known as "Workers' Compensation." His knowledge of the law in the workers' compensation field contributes to his clients' ability to obtain the best possible results at the Illinois Industrial Commission.
<P>
<B>Education</B>: JD 1973, John Marshall Law School (Illinois Appellate Defender Program); BS 1970, University of Dayton.
<P>
<B>Admitted</B>: 1973 Illinois; 1975 Arizona; 1973 U.S. Dist. Ct. (N. Dist. IL).
<P>
<B>Employment History</B>: 1991-present, Richard D. Hannigan, Ltd.; 1973-91, Law Offices of Anthony V. Fanone.
<P>
<B>Professional Associations</B>: ISBA (Council Section 1992-96); Workers' Compensation Lawyers Assn. (President 1992; Vice President 1991; Secretary 1989-90; Board Member 1984-88, 1993-95); Lake County Bar Assn. [Workers' Compensation Section (Chair 1988, 1991)].
<P>
<B>Firm</B>: Mr. Hannigan and his associate practice law exclusively representing injured workers in Lake, McHenry, Cook, and Kane Counties. His staff and paralegal have over 25 years' experience in handling the injured worker's case. Having represented insurance companies gives Mr. Hannigan unique insight into what the insurance company is doing to the injured worker and how to fight for that worker's rights. The first consultation is free. Fees range from $100.00 for a statutory loss to 20 percent of amounts recovered for all other workers' compensation claims.

<STRONG>Donald H. Nichols</STRONG>: Mr. Nichols' current practice is exclusively devoted to trial work. After graduating from law school in 1971, Don Nichols was selected to teach and assist students at the University of Minnesota. During this time, he handled hundreds of cases and obtained an early exposure to the court room. Within a few years he wrote his first legal publication and had begun lecturing to other lawyers and judges on many different aspects of trial practice. Each year, he has lectured to several hundred lawyers and judges about various aspects of trial practice. As a result, he has become respected on many aspects of trial practice. Several lawyers have not only sought his advice on behalf of their own clients, but many lawyers have retained him on a personal basis. One of the greatest compliments a lawyer can have is to be asked to represent another lawyer who is in a difficult situation. This confidence has been frequently bestowed upon him. In over 20 years of trial work, he has tried many well known cases. Some have been landmark cases in the areas of criminal and civil law. One of the first cases to establish the right of an executive to leave an employer and work for a competitor was such a case.<P>

<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 6, 1996 - Nov/Dec</PRIssue>-
<P>
<P><P>Be on Target.&quot;  That was the theme of a Supplier Cost Reduction Effort (SCORE) program held by Chrysler wiring harness supplier EWD, llc, a division of Yazaki Corp., on Aug. 28, with a goal of generating at least 500 cost-saving ideas.<BR>

<P><P>That target was shattered even before the event began, with about 750 submissions. By the end of the day, 2,727 SCORE ideas had been generated.<BR>

<P><P>About 250 employees from EWD's Troy, Mich., engineering facility and representatives from the company's Mexican manufacturing plants were involved in the daylong effort to glean SCORE ideas. Chrysler Procurement and Supply representatives Chris Pratnicki of Electrical Supplier Management and Rita Hendricks of the Electrical Continuous Improvement Team also participated.<BR>

<P><P>EWD employees were assigned to 12 different teams, which competed to generate as many SCORE proposals as possible. At the end of the day, the teams and individuals with the most ideas were given special recognition.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;This process has brought our people together,&quot; said Norm Livingston, EWD's Director -- Sales Planning. &quot;The use of cross-functional teams was a way to improve communication by getting people in different areas to talk to each other.&quot;<BR>

<P><P>&quot;Even if just 10 percent -- or 270 --of the suggestions officially become SCORE proposals, that's a super result,&quot; said Debra Walker, Chrysler SCORE Supervisor.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;We plan to do this every year,&quot; Livingston added. &quot;This is a first step in our continuous improvement process -- we're just getting started.&quot;<BR>

<P><h3><center><PRTitle><B>  </B><B>Suppliers attend CST Showcase Event</B></PRTitle><BR>

<P> </center></h3><BR>

<P>
<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 6, 1996 - Nov/Dec</PRIssue>-
<P>
<P> <P>Chrysler suppliers were given an introduction to Chrysler's Seven-Step Corrective Action Process in an Extended Showcase Activity at the Consortium for Supplier Training (CST) fourth-quarter meeting held in October on the Auburn Hills, Mich., campus of Oakland Community College (OCC). OCC is part of a national network of colleges and universities working together within CST to deliver world-class training to the extended enterprise.<BR>

<P> <P>Preceding the session, Jeff Stoner, Manager - Operations, said, &quot;We at Chrysler are very excited about this program. It gives us the opportunity to reach our whole supplier base through a nationwide network that provides core quality training at a reasonable cost.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
 <P>The introduction to Chrysler's Seven-Step Corrective Action Process took place in OCC's Advanced Technology Center and was facilitated by Ellen Dolsen, a Supplier Training Center instructor at OCC.<BR>

<P> <P>&quot;The Seven-Step Corrective Action Process is Chrysler's method of reporting and tracking problems and nonconformance issues that are related to suppliers,&quot; Dolsen said. &quot;And in relation to this process, we define a 'supplier' as anyone - internally or externally - who provides product or services to any Chrysler facility.&quot;<BR>

<P> <P>The session provided an overview of the entire process, but focused only on the first step with a team exercise that introduced session participants to the thinking behind the process.<BR>
 <BR>
 <P>&quot;This introduction was designed as a 'teaser,' &quot; Dolsen said. &quot;We wanted to give you a feel for what the complete course involves. It's hands-on and it challenges you.&quot;<BR>

<P> <P>The complete Chrysler Seven-Step Corrective Action Process course is available to suppliers in a single four-hour class, according to Dolsen. &quot;In class, we spend an appropriate - but not necessarily equal - amount of time on each of the steps, and we demonstrate how the process helps you develop an effective problem-solving strategy,&quot; she added.<BR>

<P> <P>At the conclusion of the introductory session, Brad Carter of Siemens Automotive said, &quot;I've taken problem-solving training before, but this process would certainly be helpful.  I'm taking this information back to share with my colleagues.&quot; <BR>

<P> <P>Beginning with the next issue of Supplier, the Seven-Step Corrective Action Process will be featured in a new multipart series.<BR>

<P> </center></h3><BR>

<P>
<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 6, 1996 - Nov/Dec</PRIssue>-	<BR>
 <P>Chrysler played a significant  role in the sixth annual 	Automotive Industry Action Group (AIAG) Auto-Tech conference at Detroit's Cobo Center in September. <BR>
 <BR>
<P>The company received a corporate award from AIAG, and a Chrysler employee was honored with an individual award during the annual Outstanding Achievement Awards Dinner. <BR>

<P><P>Chrysler representatives also participated in 15 information sessions during the three-day event. <BR>
 <BR>
<P>&quot;Our achievement awards honor individuals and corporations within AIAG who have fostered an unsurpassed spirit of cooperation within the industry,&quot; said AIAG Chairman Derryl Barringer during the awards ceremony. <BR>
 <BR>
<P>&quot;This cooperative spirit reaffirms our continuing efforts and dedication to being the best.&quot;<BR>
 <BR>
<P>Chrysler, Ford and General Motors were recognized with AIAG Corporate Achievement Awards for their efforts &quot;in forging a common quality system for our industry  - QS-9000,&quot; Barringer said. <BR>

<P> <P>&quot;We look at this as an award not just for the company, but for the whole quality team behind the development of QS-9000,&quot; said Cynthia Hess, Director - Quality and Supplier Development and Executive - Procurement and Supply Process Team, who accepted the award for the company. <BR>

<P> <P>Richard Tervo, a Senior Business Analyst with Chrysler's Information Services, was one of 12 individuals honored at the dinner. Tervo's contributions to AIAG include committee service, writing for AIAG's ActionLine magazine and conducting presentations during the Auto-Tech event.<BR>

<P> <P>&quot;I'm very proud of this award,&quot; Tervo said. &quot;Chrysler provides an excellent opportunity to get involved with AIAG - to work with others in the industry and gain a larger perspective.&quot;<BR>

<P><h3><center><PRTitle><B>  </B><B>Big Three, major suppliers discuss CAFE, other issues with Clinton officials administration officials</B></PRTitle><BR>

<P> </center></h3><BR>

<P>
<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 4, 1996 - Jul/Aug</PRIssue>-
<P>
<P>
<P><P>The Joint Automotive Supplier Governmental Action Council discussed several issues affecting the automobile industry June 12 at the White House with Clinton administration officials.<BR>

<P><P> &quot;To be specific, we think key decision makers understand the urgency of the CAFE (Corporate Average Fuel Economy) issue, and that increases in CAFE will hurt jobs in the United States,&quot; said Chrysler Chairman Bob Eaton, who serves as co-chair of the council.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;We explained that today's healthy industry is the result of several key factors: foremost, a freeze in CAFE standards has given U.S. manufacturers a strong foothold in the popular light-duty vehicle market, which has produced jobs, profits and increased market share,&quot; Eaton said. <BR>

<P><P>&quot;We also told the White House that our dialogue and partnership over the last few years have been a welcome start to moving away from the traditional 'command and control' approach Washington has had with this industry in the past. We are hopeful that today's dialogue will lead to continued opportunities to work together to solve these critical issues through rational policy that will protect the automotive industry's global competitiveness and economic health.&quot; <BR>

<P><P>Eaton added that the council expressed continued support for most-favored-nation trade status for China and pledged continued efforts to develop new opportunities in the Chinese market, &quot;which will be a key part of continued growth for the industry and our economy,&quot; Eaton said.<BR>

<P>
<P><P> &quot;And finally, we made it clear that the U.S. automotive industry's success over the last few years has been intimately tied to the strong yen/dollar relationship,&quot; Eaton said.<BR>

<P><P> &quot;Since continued weakening of the yen will put a serious drag on U.S. manufacturing across the board, we encouraged the administration to carefully weigh its global monetary and economic policy with these concerns in mind.&quot; <BR>

<P><P>The Joint Automotive Supplier Governmental Action Council, which represents 33 companies, was established in 1992. The council includes the chief executive officers of the 	Big Three and 30 major U.S. automotive suppliers. <BR>

<P><P>The council's supplier members include such corporations as General Electric, Textron, AlliedSignal, Lear Corporation, Guardian Industries, DuPont, Goodyear and Bethlehem Steel. <BR>

<P><P>The council is an important instrument for showing that the auto industry is more than just the Big Three, according to Rob Liberatore, Chrysler Vice President_Washington Affairs.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;It puts a different face on the auto industry,&quot; Liberatore said. &quot;The auto industry is a vast network of suppliers beyond the Big Three. Instead of just being a Detroit industry, we are a national industry when you consider the supply base.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;If it has a significant effect on the Big Three, it's going to have a significant effect on suppliers.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 5, 1996 - Sept/Oct</PRIssue>-Suppliers asked to respond to lead time/authorization packages <BR>

<P><P> Chrysler has been compiling lead time, authorization, common process and tool capacity information for parts for the 1997 model year and beyond from suppliers.<BR>

<P><P> The third and final supplier mailing was in July.  Suppliers who received this package either have not responded to previous mailing or submitted incomplete responses.  This mailing also captured new parts placements.<BR>

<P><P> The goal of the initiative is to ensure that Chrysler's database has the most up-to-date information that will allow the company to gain a clear understanding of supplier capacity limitations.  This will ensure that appropriate supplier tool capacity is in place upfront.  It also will decrease the chances of unforeseen parts shortages, which can result in Chrysler schedule changes.<BR>

<P><P> Both Chrysler and its suppliers must work to eliminate waste in processes and improve production flexibility.  Suppliers should review their lead time/authorization levels and examine opportunities for continuous improvement.<BR>

<P><P> Supplier ratings for model year 1997 are based on timely completion and submission of the data requested in the mailings.  However, in subsequent model years, Chrysler anticipates altering the criteria to measure continuous improvement in the lead time and authorization categories.<BR>

<P><P> So far, 800 suppliers have responded to the survey.  Twenty-five percent of the part responses indicate reduced authorization levels.  Suppliers who have not responded are strongly encouraged to submit their worksheets as soon as possible.<BR>

<P><P> The collection of supplier data for current parts continues through Oct. 1, and final input of this information is scheduled for mid-October.<BR>

<P><P> Through such joint efforts, Chrysler hopes to continuously review shared business processes and identify improvement opportunities, resulting is a leaner, more efficient and flexible Extended Enterprise.<BR>

<P><P> A help line is available at (810) 512-1002 to answer questions about the package.<BR>

<P><h3><center><PRTitle><B>  </B><B>Superimpac focuses supplier information, training needs</B></PRTitle><BR>

<P> </center></h3><BR>

<P>
<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 6, 1996 - Nov/Dec</PRIssue>-	<BR>

<P><P>Chrysler's Supplier Performance Improvement Package, or Superimpac, was featured in an Auto-Tech session presented by Brenda Hendrieth, Chrysler Procurement Support Specialist and Carolyne Brown, Project Coordinator - Oakland (Mich.) Community College Business and Professional Services. <BR>

<P><P>&quot;The purpose of Superimpac is to provide supplier evaluation results, encourage communication and introduce performance improvement tools,&quot; Hendrieth said.<BR>
 <BR>
<P>&quot;The challenge is to reach all levels of the Extended Enterprise - every tier of suppliers - with Superimpac.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;Strong supplier partnerships rely on communication,&quot; Hendrieth added. &quot;To meet our corporate goals, suppliers must speak the same language as Chrysler.&quot;<BR>

<P><P>Superimpac focuses on strategic planning and training to foster improvement and enhance communication. &quot;Supplier rating results plus targeted training (the Industry Collaboration on Education) equal performance improvement,&quot; Hendrieth said.<BR>

<P><P>With Superimpac, suppliers are assisted in targeting areas that need performance improvement, linking their annual Chrysler supplier rating results with gaps in performance and addressing those gaps using recommended training or other performance enhancements. Hendrieth said the ultimate goal is to develop strategies for continuous improvement.<BR>
 <BR>
<P>An important training resource available to suppliers is the Consortium for Supplier Training (CST). CST offers a standardized curriculum available across the country, through local community colleges and universities. <BR>

<P><P>Oakland Community College (OCC) in Auburn Hills, Mich., is one of the seven designated Supplier Training Centers, and is sponsored by Chrysler in the consortium. <BR>

<P><P>Brown described OCC as &quot;a one-stop training center with both general and customized training. We offer a complete performance improvement system.&quot;<BR>

<P><P>Suppliers should refer to their Superimpac binders, which were mailed to Chrysler suppliers last December, to take advantage of the tools available to them. The binder contains 150 pages of information, a video guide, a copy of current supplier evaluation criteria and each supplier's evaluation from the previous year.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;Don't focus on the training and courses available; focus instead on continuous improvement,&quot; Hendrieth said. &quot;Develop a strategic plan and then use the courses as tools to fulfill that plan.&quot; <BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<P> </center></h3><BR>

<P>
<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 4, 1996 - Jul/Aug</PRIssue>-
<P>
<P>
<P><P>About 100 major suppliers representing every major parts system on Chrysler's minivans joined Windsor (Ontario) and St. Louis South assembly plant and platform team members for a supplier event in Windsor June 28. The day included a visit to Windsor Assembly for a firsthand view of a learning line in action. A learning line is a small portion of the assembly line where new processes are tested and perfected. Supplier representatives also had an opportunity to see their products assembled on Chrysler minivans during a tour of the facility. <BR>

<P><P>First, though, suppliers listened to Chrysler executives discuss various aspects of the company's plans for its minivan Extended Enterprise.<BR>

<P><P>In his introductory remarks, Tom Norman, Chrysler Minivan Platform Supply Executive, provided an overview of the event, which had the theme of continuous improvement. He also gave background comments regarding the information packets that each supplier received. Items included an executive summary, quality profile, Supplier Cost Reduction Effort (SCORE) results for the 1996 model year and a product suggestion form.<BR>

<P> <BR>
<P>Tom Stallkamp, Chrysler Executive Vice President - Procurement and Supply and General Manager - Minivan Operations, told suppliers that Chrysler controls about 50 percent of the U.S. minivan market, with 13 other competitive minivans sharing the remainder. Stallkamp congratulated suppliers on their work with Chrysler, but added that manufacturing and assembly plants offer Chrysler and its Extended Enterprise the greatest opportunity for streamlining. He added that Chrysler and its suppliers need to reduce costs jointly to ensure that entry-level minivan buyers view Chrysler's selections as attractive and cost-competitive. Stallkamp called on suppliers and the company to focus on increasing value for the customer.<BR>

<P><P>Ralph Sarotte, Chrysler General Product Manager - Minivan Operations, addressed market conditions, customer profiles, a review of upcoming competitors' minivans, Chrysler's 1997 minivan changes and a cost overview. Sarotte said that two-thirds of Chrysler's minivans sold for the 1996 model year were long-wheelbase. Three-quarters of all 1996 Chrysler minivans were sold with the driver's-side sliding door. Sarotte reiterated that Chrysler and its Extended Enterprise need to focus on reducing costs and increasing quality.<BR>

<P>
<P><P>Gordon Rinschler, Chrysler General Manager - Minivan Platform Engineering, outlined various opportunities for streamlining. Chrysler's quality improvement strategy includes re-energizing existing quality initiatives; streamlining continuous improvement measures, the product assurance planning process and QS-9000; focusing on higher mileage durability issues for the minivans; and ensuring a smooth launch for the 1997 minivan.<BR>

<P><P>Rinschler added that Chrysler and its suppliers need to stress variation reduction in their manufacturing processes through measurement-based decision-making and a focus on robustness. Chrysler also is working to strengthen its Extended Enterprise. Rinschler encouraged suppliers to visit their own suppliers to coordinate efforts to manage the value chain. He added that the Extended Enterprise needs to use launch curves more effectively for employee training and quality audits.<BR>

<P><P>Bernie Bedard, Chrysler Manager - SCORE and Continuous Improvement, stressed the need for supplier participation in SCORE. He reviewed the program's philosophy and goals and encouraged suppliers to develop similar programs with their own suppliers.<BR>
 <BR>
<P>Tom Kuskowski, Chrysler Material Supply Senior Specialist, discussed a new program called the part plan. This topic received particular emphasis and was highlighted on a tour suppliers later received at Windsor Assembly.<BR>

<P><P>At the facility, suppliers saw an engine-cradle-assembly learning line, which stresses human infrastructure; level and balanced schedules; value-added activities; and robust, capable and in-control processes. The learning line's goal is to maintain only two hours' worth of material. The central material area restocks parts on an as-needed basis. A standard operating procedure, detailing each process, is identified on the learning line. Statistical process control maintains robustness measurements. Operators also have a checklist for daily use to ensure all procedures are completed.<BR>

<P><P>Following their introduction to the learning line, suppliers were taken on individual tours of the plant to see the role their components play in Chrysler minivan production.<BR>

<P><P>Albert Schaller, President of Schaller Corporation, was one of the body-in-white and exterior suppliers participating in the event. Schaller supplies drawn extrusion tapping plates for a number of Chrysler products, including the 1996 minivans. The minivans alone have 34 Schaller-supplied components on them.<BR>

<P>
<P><P>Albert Schaller said his company has been with Chrysler's minivan program since its inception, and that the vehicle has played a large role in his company's growth.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;It's nice to find out how successful the product is,&quot; Schaller said, referring to the morning presentations on Chrysler's position in the minivan market.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;I think we're aligned well with Chrysler's goals and that we mirror many of Chrysler's programs,&quot; said Steve Bell, AlliedSignal Engineering Manager, who also attended the event. &quot;I think that by setting up similar processes and goals, we will both continue to prosper.&quot; After the plant tour, suppliers received an overview of quality reports from Windsor Assembly Plant Manager Adrian Vido.<BR>

<P><P>Bill Wolf, St. Louis Assembly South Plant Manager, said that Chrysler and its suppliers have to begin in small areas, such as learning lines. &quot;Look at problems and get to the root cause,&quot; Wolf said. &quot;Look at why the mistake was made, not at the person who made the mistake. Get after the five whys, not the five whos.&quot;<BR>

<P> <BR>
<P>Vido concluded the day's presentation by adding that Chrysler and its suppliers have to motivate employees by &quot;driving passion&quot; into people. He said managers need to communicate energy and the importance of a focus on quality. Vido added that this can happen when people own the process.<BR>

<P>Procurement and Supply brings stronger quality emphasis in focus<BR>

<P> <P>At Chrysler, our desire ids to drive continuos improvement in quality, reliability and customer satisfaction in all aspects of business operations.  Over the past year, we have organized our supplier quality area to enhance our relationships with our supply base and continue to build a world-class Extended Enterprise.<BR>

<P><P>Supplier quality specialists are now commodity-based and will have common requirements that suppliers need to meet in order to achieve variation reduction, waste elimination and continuous improvement.  Common quality requirements among platforms are mandatory if we want to increase overall customer satisfaction. The supplier quality specialists are now the single point of contact with the supply base.<BR>

<P><P>Along with the supplier quality specialists, we created two quality groups that will work on specific issues within the supply base.  The supplier development group will work on chronic systemic problems at supplier locations and assist in the overall management and development of supplier systems.  This group will work project-by-project as issues arise.  The process specialist group is a technical team, and the members bring many years of plant processing experience to resolve and prevent process-based quality problems.<BR>

<P><P>This new organization is our way of taking a proactive approach toward quality improvement.<BR>

<P><P>The changes in our quality area should be very noticeable in the coming months.  Consistency, standardization, discipline - these are what drives a quality product.  We are confident that this reorganization will give us consistency, as now both employees and suppliers will find their roles in the quality process are clarified.<BR>

<P><P>Also, you will see more standardization or our requirement processes, which will ease communication flow.<BR>

<P><P> Last, our two new activities should add the discipline required both inside Chrysler and within our supply based to make processes, both current and future, more reliable and to instill proactive thinking in all aspects of quality.<BR>

<P>
<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 5, 1996 - Sept/Oct</PRIssue>-SCORE reaches $1 billion; sets sights higher for 1997<BR>

<P><P> Chrysler announced a record $1 billion in cost savings through  its 1996 model-year SCORE (Supplier Cost Reduction Effort) campaign at a special event held July 31 at the Chrysler Technology center.<BR>

<P><P> Hundreds of onlookers lined up all four levels at Tech Plaza and heard Tom Stallkamp, Executive Vice President-Procurement and Supply and General Manager-Minivan Operations, and Francois Castaing, Executive Vice President-Vehicle Engineering and General Manager-Power Train Operations, address them and the invited guests gathered on the lower level.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;It's been good to see such a variety of people here,&quot; said Castaing.  &quot;I see engineers, manufacturing personnel and suppliers.  This demonstrates that the SCORE program is based on good listening-to each other and to our supplier partners.&quot;<BR>

<P><P>Castaing added that the combination of dollar savings and positive attitude provide a &quot;recipe for success in the future.&quot;<BR>

<P><P> Stallkamp echoed Castaing's emphasis on communication.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;Communication is the most important component of SCORE,&quot; he said.  &quot;This is more than a purchasing and engineering program.  It reaches throughout the corporation and throughout the Extended Enterprise-that is how we will grow.&quot;<BR>

<P><P>Stallkamp also noted that the 1996 model-year SCORE stretch goal - $1 billion - was met June 14, thanks to SCORE suggestions from suppliers that were received at a rate of about 100 a week.<BR>

<P><P> The 1997 SCORE goal - $1.2 billion - and a new SCORE logo and awareness campaign also were announced by Stallkamp.<BR>

<P><P>The 1997 Score campaign will be highlighted by a new slogan: &quot;SCORE and Quality - Keep 'em Revvin' in '97,&quot; penned by J.R. Rosati of Procurement and Supply, and Roger Benvenuti of Corporate Services.  Rosati and Benvenuti each received the use of a Chrysler Sebring Convertible for one week for the winning slogan.<BR>

<P><P> Stallkamp's unveiling of the new SCORE banner was punctuated with a balloon drop from the ceiling of Tech Plaza, featuring read, white, and blue balloons.<BR>

<P><P> Bernie Bedard, manager - SCORE and Supplier Continuous Improvement, closed the event.  &quot;I'm sure, through everyone's efforts, we will celebrate meeting the 1997 SCORE goal right here with all of you next year,&quot; predicted Bedard.<BR>

<P><P>A similar event was held at the same day at the Plymouth Road Office Complex in Detroit and included Bernard Robertson, Vice President-Engineering Technologies and General Mannager-Jeep and Truck Operations, in addition to Stallkamp and Castaing.<BR>

<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 5, 1996 - Sept/Oct</PRIssue>-Supplier Development team focuses on coaching<BR>

<P><P> Chrysler's Supplier Development team, lead by Gary Andrews, Director - Supplier and Technical Assistance, focuses on developing and improving suppliers with systemic issues that inhibit their ability to provide quality components.<BR>

<P><P>The team consists of six Chrysler senior quality specialists.  Their responsibilities include coaching suppliers on the implementation of quality programs, as well as assisting those involved in programs identified as high-risk or using new technology.  I addition, Special Suppliers will be able to receive consultation on quality practice enhancements.<BR>

<P><P> &quot;It was an integral part of the recent Procurement and Supply reorganization,&quot; said Timothy Sprung, Senior Quality Specialist.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;It provided an opportunity for an all-new program that no one at Chrysler had tried before, and that's to really work with and develop the supplier's ability to implement quality systems from a senior management vision to the process on the manufacturing floor.&quot;<BR>

<P><P> Suppliers Development employs a systems focus to analyze supplier's operations, incorporating discussions with their management teams and to visits to manufacturing locations to jointly develop an action plan for short- and long-term systems corrections.<BR>

<P><P> Initial  response to these Chrysler efforts has been positive, judging from early supplier feedback.<BR>

<P> </center></h3><BR>

<P>
<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 4, 1996 - Jul/Aug</PRIssue>-
<P>
<P><P>Chrysler suppliers interested in continuously improving their evaluation results are encouraged to seek performance solutions 	by using the Supplier Performance Improvement Package (Superimpac) and the Industry Collaboration on Education (ICE). <BR>

<P><P>&quot;Superimpac links the Chrysler Supplier Rating Criteria to the ICE curriculum,&quot; said Victoria Kohl, Director _ Oakland (Mich.) Community College (OCC) Workforce Development Forum. &quot;OCC and Chrysler are available to help companies implement tools: gap analysis, training plan development, training resource identification and measurement and evaluation. It allows us to be more proactive and directive,&quot; Kohl added.<BR>

<P><P>Kohl said that Superimpac offers Chrysler, its suppliers and the educa-tional community a measurable way to determine where companies need training and what type of training 	to deliver. <BR>

<P><P> &quot;I think it was hard for a company that wanted to improve to know before Superimpac 'how do we improve?' &quot; said Carolyne Brown, Project Coordinator _ OCC Business and Professional Services. Brown said that training options now are clearer and that success can be measured more easily through Chrysler's supplier performance evaluation systems.<BR>

<P><P>Kohl explained that the ICE section of Superimpac describes skills directly linked with Chrysler's supplier evaluation measurements. The assessment tools in Superimpac help suppliers target where their performance deficiencies lie and then offer an entire curriculum of skills based 	on possible training solutions. OCC 	is Chrysler's designated Supplier Training Center in the Consortium for Supplier Training (CST). Each of the seven corporate members of the CST sponsors a local educational institution as its training center.<BR>

<P>
<P><P>&quot;This network (of training centers) is ready to take training and expand it so it reaches more suppliers at more locations,&quot; Kohl said. &quot;Independently, we, as a community college, link to 	the technology and the discipline in which Chrysler has invested. Then, dependently, we are there to roll out the newest Chrysler version of a discipline and its training package.&quot; <BR>

<P><P>Kohl added that OCC and the other training centers (along with the University of Toledo [Ohio] and St. Clair College in Windsor, Ontario) have recognized Superimpac as a valuable tool and are ready to deliver consistent high-quality training and services to the supplier community.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;We focus on Superimpac as a megaplan, bringing in the right components and instruments within Superimpac and taking other resources and bundling them for improvement 	of an organization, helping it attain 	its independent goals and improve customer satisfaction,&quot; Kohl said.<BR>

<P><P>For more information about using Superimpac to link evaluation results to performance improvement, call Kohl at (810) 540-1835.<BR>

<P>
<P><P>Supplier Johnson Matthey developed a unique way to celebrate production of its 50-millionth catalyst for Chrysler this past summer.<BR>

<P><P>It offered all of its employees in Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey a $550 rebate on any new Chrysler Corporation product purchased between Oct. 1 and Nov. 30. <BR>

<P><P>&quot;We try to encourage the partnership that Johnson Matthey has with Chrysler,&quot; said Jay Hoffman, Johnson Matthey Sales and Marketing Manager. &quot;We believe we have a very good relationship with Chrysler, and the employee rebate was one way to recognize that.&quot;<BR>

<P><P>&quot;This announcement from Johnson Matthey demonstrates a commitment to Chrysler beyond the supply of exhaust-system components,&quot; said Kelly Lynch, Chrysler Minivan Chassis Systems Buyer. &quot;We often talk about the Extended Enterprise and the significant role each member has to add value to our ultimate customers. In this case, we have a second-tier supplier - a Platinum Pentastar recipient - that has continually exceeded Chrysler's objectives for product quality, Supplier Cost Reduction Effort (SCORE) and continuous improvement, adding extra value to the purchase experience for its employees while promoting the sale of Chrysler products. This helps to further strengthen the relationship between Johnson Matthey and Chrysler.&quot;  <BR>

<P><P>The rebate was additive to incentives offered by Chrysler Corporation or its dealerships during the period. <BR>

<P><P>Johnson Matthey's Catalytic Systems Division has met all of Chrysler's catalyst-coating requirements for 12 years. <BR>

<P><h3><center><PRTitle><B>  </B><B>Suppliers, Dodge City launch all-new Dakota</B></PRTitle><BR>

<P> </center></h3><BR>

<P>
<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 4, 1996 - Jul/Aug</PRIssue>-
<P>
<P><P>The next-generation Dodge Dakota compact pickup truck began production in July at Chrysler's Warren (Mich.)Truck/Dodge City Complex. To prepare for production, suppliers were invited to the plant in May to discuss their role in the successful launch of the vehicle and to view the all-new Dakota. <BR>

<P><P>During the half-day program, about 400 people representing 170 suppliers heard presentations on the Supplier Material Requirements Tracking (SMART) system, logistics, just-in-time delivery, the engineering change process and materials handling. Also included in the program were overviews of the Supplier Cost Reduction Effort (SCORE) program and the Supplier Performance Evaluation Rating System (SUPERS).<BR>

<P>
<P><P>The culmination of the event was a discussion of the importance of quality to a successful launch.<BR>

<P><P> &quot;I cannot overemphasize the need for us to work closely, hand-in-hand, to ensure that this launch is successful,&quot; said Warren Truck Plant Manager Roy Smith. &quot;You are the experts. We have selected the top suppliers available. If each of you completes your piece of the puzzle correctly, together we can maximize our success.&quot;<BR>

<P><P>Smith added that the successful launch of the Dodge Ram Pickup in 1994 was due largely to hands-on supplier involvement.<BR>

<P><P>Much discussion focused on logistics. &quot;Communication is the key to planning logistics,&quot; said Roger Whitton, General Manager - Schneider National Logistics, which is the lead logistics carrier for the Warren plant and its suppliers. &quot;Any changes in size, packaging and other items should be communicated as early as possible.&quot; <BR>

<P><P>&quot;The partnership among Chrysler, its suppliers and the carrier make just-in-time (delivery) work, and again, we want to emphasize communication,&quot; said Tom Wiley, Jeep and Truck Manager - Inventory and Cost Control. &quot;If there is a problem, let us know. We can work with you if alerted.&quot; Over- and under-shipments both jeopardize efficiency and create waste, Wiley added.<BR>

<P>
<P><P>&quot;Efficiency must extend beyond the relationship between Chrysler and its first-tier suppliers,&quot; said Mike Leon, Chrysler Transportation Associate. &quot;To improve costs, effective transportation and lead logistics integration must reach to every level.&quot; <BR>

<P><P>Dakota suppliers also learned that SUPERS should improve delivery by communicating delivery requirements, focusing on the process and measuring delivery performance. Chrysler's SMART program, although just recently introduced, is critical to efficient component delivery. SMART compliance also accounts for 5 percent of suppliers' SUPERS ratings. <BR>

<P><P>Engineering change procedures must be managed according to the established change notice process, which can be completed on-line. The process improves implementation time; allows for parallel processes rather than sequen- tial processes; serves to better manage cost, quality and timing; and improves the success rate of changes, change documentation and communication. <BR>

<P><P>The materials-handling procedures discussion highlighted the types of returnable containers used to support Dakota's production. It also stressed meeting the rack-and-container delivery schedule.<BR>

<P>
<P><P>Bernie Bedard, Chrysler Manager - SCORE and Supplier Continuous Improvement, emphasized the SCORE program's importance and identified ways Dakota suppliers can meet their goals through design, manufacturing, sourcing opportunities and quality improvement. <BR>

<P><P>&quot;Quality is the primary focus of this and every launch,&quot; said Mel Cameron, Chrysler Manager - Vehicle Quality. &quot;We cannot be successful without partnering with our suppliers to ensure that top quality standards are met every step of the way.&quot; Cameron highlighted the Dakota launch supplier quality plan.<BR>

<P><P> &quot;We will rely on supplier representatives on-site daily at Warren Truck during the launch to help ensure quality,&quot; Cameron said. &quot;You must keep us informed of any problems so that together we can reduce things gone wrong.&quot; Suppliers had an opportunity to preview the Dakota 	at the end of the event. <BR>

<P><P>&quot;It was an interesting first trip to Detroit for me,&quot; said Randy Jones, Manager - Production Control at Delbar Products, a supplier of the Dakota's outside rearview mirrors. <BR>

<P><P>&quot;Meeting with everyone involved in production, as well as the people ultimately responsible for the vehicle, put things in perspective and gave me 	a better appreciation for the whole process.&quot;<BR>

<P><P>&quot;(The Dakota) is a very nice-looking truck,&quot; said Kathie Owen, Product Engineer - Florida Products, a supplier of Dakota wheel covers. &quot;This whole event was very informative. I gathered a lot of names and phone numbers that will be helpful in the future.&quot;<BR>

<P><h3><center><PRTitle><B>  </B><B>'Pay-as-painted' program brightens SCORE savings for Chrysler, PPG</B></PRTitle><BR>

<P> </center></h3><BR>

<P>
<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 6, 1996 - Nov/Dec</PRIssue>-
<P>	<BR>
<P>Chrysler and PPG Industries are adding three Chrysler assembly plants - Sterling Heights (Mich.), St. Louis South and Windsor (Ontario) - to their &quot;pay-as-painted&quot; partnership for the 1997 model year.<BR>

<P><P>Pay-as-painted is a system that works to continuously improve quality, reduce costs and eliminate waste through a team effort to optimize paint material use and processes. In model year 1996, Chrysler and PPG each saved approximately $5 million through PPG's Supplier Cost Reduction Effort (SCORE) program.  <BR>

<P><P>&quot;It's a win-win focus,&quot; said Sherry Bronder of Chrysler's Paint and Energy Management Department. &quot;We reduce usage and optimize the quality of the vehicle through consistent material application. PPG wins because it becomes entrenched with us, and the focus is on all the elements occurring in the paint shop. <BR>

<P><P>&quot;PPG isn't just isolated in the delivery of the product. PPG works with Chrysler maintenance and paint shop personnel, quality-control specialists and every group affecting the paint process. PPG is a partner with Chrysler in every sense of the word, sharing in 	the problems as well as the benefits and savings.&quot; <BR>

<P><P>The pay-as-painted program started in Chrysler's Belvidere (Ill.) Assembly Plant near the end of the Dodge Dynasty/Chrysler New Yorker production run in the early 1990s. <BR>

<P><P>According to Mark Nardelli of Chrysler Exterior Quality and Supplier Management, the companies continued their partnership with the introduction of the Dodge and Plymouth Neon. In its first year, pay-as-painted saved almost $1 million for Chrysler and PPG each. As a 	result, the program was expanded to Chrysler's Bramalea and Pillette Road Truck Assembly plants in Ontario. <BR>

<P><P>&quot;It's a communications tool,&quot; added Terry Tepfenhart, PPG Chemfil Chrysler Accounts Manager. &quot;One of the largest benefits in the plants is that there's no finger-pointing. We're getting better together in the best interests of both parties. <BR>
&quot;It's always been a team effort. In our weekly meetings, we identify unfavorable conditions and resolve problems.&quot;<BR>

<P><P>Here's how the program works: Chrysler and PPG form teams at both the corporate and plant levels, with each organization assuming responsibility for various tasks. <BR>

<P><P>Both companies focus on reducing paint use while maintaining quality, durability and reliability. <BR>

<P><P>&quot;The program helps us target consistent usage,&quot; said Bronder. &quot;The PPG and Chrysler teams focus on making efficiency and quality improvements based on continuous monitoring and measurement of the paint used.&quot;<BR>

<P><P>PPG owns the paint inventory of all unopened containers, all materials above minimum plant processing levels and all materials in bulk storage tanks. Chrysler owns minimum paint levels in the plants' process tanks and lines, including the electrocoat bath.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;Before, large amounts of paint were delivered to the mix room waiting to be used,&quot; said Bronder. &quot;Now, PPG owns the inventory and is better able to manage the overall paint supply.&quot;<BR>

<P><P>Pricing is based on actual per-vehicle usage that determines targeted material usage for the next year. Price per gallon multiplied by the usage target equals the purchase-order price per vehicle.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;Before, if someone left a valve open and paint spilled, it was considered a cost of doing business,&quot; said Don Venable, PPG Industries Sales Manager - Coatings and Resins. <BR>

<P><P>&quot;Now, with the weekly meetings, the teams in the plants identify where they had waste and develop some resolution to prevent that from happening again. It's an adjustment that doesn't become part of Chrysler's per-unit cost. Under the old system, PPG didn't have much of an incentive to help Chrysler find leaks.&quot;<BR>

<P><P>The environment also benefits from the program. <BR>

<P><P>&quot;We've had a significant reduction in volatile organic compounds since pay-as-painted was introduced,&quot; Nardelli said.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;We are continuing to drive down paint usage because we're wasting less of it. That adds value to the customer because the vehicle doesn't cost as much and adds to Chrysler and PPG profits.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;The way the system is set up works as positive reinforcement for both Chrysler and PPG,&quot; Nardelli added. 	&quot;I think that's what has contributed to its success.&quot;<BR>

<P><h3><center><PRTitle><B>  </B><B>Dakota suppliers save Chrysler $27 million through SCORE</B></PRTitle><BR>

<P> </center></h3><BR>

<P>
<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 4, 1996 - Jul/Aug</PRIssue>-
<P>
<P>Chrysler's suppliers working on the Dodge Dakota identified $27 million in cost savings to Chrysler through the company's Supplier Cost Reduction Effort (SCORE) program. The savings were realized even before Dakota production began. <BR>

<P><P>&quot;Through our SCORE program, 1997 Dodge Dakota suppliers submitted 190 proposals,&quot; said Tom Stallkamp, Chrysler Executive Vice President - Procurement and Supply and General Manager - Minivan Operations. &quot;Without question, working closely with our suppliers through the Extended Enterprise continues to play a key role in our success story.&quot;<BR>

<P><P>Becker Manufacturing, which submitted 10 SCORE proposals, led the list of suppliers in cost reduction, with $2.5 million in savings for the design and build of the Dakota.  <BR>

<P><P>Becker eliminated several steps in the manufacturing process for interior quarter-trim panel bolsters. The company used a simplified one-stage process that included receiving the cloth or vinyl material already filled with foam. In the past, the bolsters' manufacture called for several labor-intensive steps, which included filling the cloth or vinyl with the foam. The new process removed $10 and two pounds from each Dakota, for a total cost savings of close to $500,000 for that proposal alone.<BR>

<P><P>Textron Automotive saved Chrysler $1.7 million with its SCORE proposal. Textron manufactures an interior panel that is visible just below the rear window of Dakota's cab and above its rear seats. Traditionally, the rear panel is produced by securing vinyl or cloth around a piece of foamboard. <BR>

<P><P>Realizing the panel's only purpose was aesthetic - to hide steel that exists above the seats and under the rear window - Textron simplified the part, reduced steps in its manufacturing process and drove costs out of the system by using an injected molded polypropylene.  <BR>

<P><P>&quot;The SCORE program is an excellent example of how Chrysler is committed to working with suppliers as partners in a long-term relationship,&quot; said Stallkamp. &quot;Instead of bidding out every part to the lowest bidder, we have established honest, two-way communication that allows 	us to work together and build a cost-efficient vehicle.&quot;<BR>

<P> </center></h3><BR>

<P>
<P><p><PRIssue>Issue 4, 1996 - Jul/Aug</PRIssue>-
<P>
<P><P>Chrysler's Extended Enterprise has demonstrated that stretch goals are indeed achievable. When the 1996 model-year goal to achieve $1 billion in approved Supplier Cost Reduction Effort (SCORE) submissions was established, more than a few people expressed surprise.<BR>

<P><P>However, together, as partners, Chrysler and its suppliers proved the doubters wrong on June 14, by reaching $1.007 billion in approved SCORE proposals.<BR>

<P><P>Since SCORE began in 1989, dollar goals have increased, the program's purpose has broadened and Procurement and Supply has kept SCORE alive by heightening awareness and designing processes and system improvements to further enable SCORE participation. The start of SCORE On-line in 1994 aided in nearly doubling weekly submissions and reducing by half the approval time required for nonengineering submissions.<BR>

<P><P>The 1997 model-year goal is $1.2 billion - a 20-percent increase from 1996. This is an attainable goal if SCORE participation continues to increase. Currently, 47 percent of our production suppliers comprise an untapped group of companies that have yet to participate.<BR>

<P><P>SCORE is here to stay because 	it is Chrysler's preferred method of conducting business - working with our supply partners to produce cars and trucks that people want to buy, enjoy driving and want to buy again. So, it's my pleasure to say to all of our supply partners who were part of achieving our 1996 model-year SCORE goal - thanks a billion!<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>EAGLE ANNOUNCES PRICES OF ALL-NEW 1995 TALON SPORTS COUPE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation today released prices of the all-new, completely redesigned 1995 Eagle Talon sports coupe.  The Talon is available in three performance levels -- ESi, TSi and the top-of-the-line TSi AWD (all wheel drive). <BR>
	The Talon ESi, which is significantly improved and includes more content over its predecessor, arrives with no increase in base price.  The base manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) for the 1995 Talon ESi is $14,362, which is the same base price as the 1994 Talon ES.  In addition to an all-new chassis and fully independent double wishbone suspension, the 1995 ESi features dual airbags and a more powerful engine -- a new 140 horsepower 2.0 liter, DOHC, 16-valve, four cylinder powerplant designed and built by Chrysler Corporation.  The engine is mated to a Chrysler-built five-speed manual transmission.<BR>
	The exhilarating power of the TSi and TSi AWD continues as the Talon signature and a source of enjoyment to driving enthusiasts who seek a balance of performance, handling and control.  A  turbocharged 2.0 liter, DOHC, 16-valve, four cylinder engine powers both TSi models, producing 210 horsepower, an increase of 15 horsepower over previous Talon TSi models.     <BR>
	<BR>
(20894-S)	(more)<BR>
-2-<BR>

<P>	The base MSRP for the 1995 Eagle Talon TSi is $17,266;  the base price of the Talon TSi AWD is $19,448.<BR>
	Four-wheel disc brakes are standard on all ESi and TSi models.  Four-wheel anti-lock brakes are available on all Talons.<BR>
	The 1995 Eagle Talon features an all-new exterior and interior design.  The new Talon has a longer wheelbase and a wider track than earlier Talons, and a chassis that is 50 percent stiffer.  Combined with the refined double wishbone suspension and increased horsepower, the 1995 Talon represents unprecedented performance in its price class.<BR>
	The all-new 1995 Talon successfully reinforces the Eagle mission:  to provide sophisticated, expressive, technologically-advanced products that inspire driving confidence.<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation's December sales capped the strongest year in the company's history, surpassing last year's record December sales rate by 1 percent.<BR>
	<P>U.S. sales totaled 179,804 vehicles, compared with December 1995's 177,803. <BR>
	<P>Chrysler finished 1996 with U.S. sales of 2,450,826 vehicles, breaking a calendar-year record of 2,208,057 from 1988. The sales rate for 1996 was 13 percent ahead of 1995, when 2,164,343 Chrysler vehicles were sold in the United States. Car sales were 5 percent ahead of the previous year and truck sales -- including minivans and Jeep&reg; vehicles -- were up 17 percent.<BR>
	<P>&quot;We set annual records for total sales, truck sales, minivan sales, Jeep&reg; sales, Dodge sales -- our U.S. sales are up more than 60 percent since 1991. Perhaps more important, our annual dealer sales of cars and trucks to retail customers has nearly doubled in that period,&quot; said James P. Holden, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing. <BR>
	<P>&quot;Consumers sent strong messages to us in 1996 -- they appreciate innovative and exciting vehicles that are good values. And the great cars and great trucks Chrysler is building will keep giving them things to appreciate,&quot; Holden said.<BR>
	<P>&quot;We have been consistently outperforming the industry in sales and our share of the market has grown substantially. We plan to continue to capture customers from our competitors. And we expect the strong loyalty of Chrysler customers to become even stronger,&quot; Holden said.<BR>
	<P>In addition to overall and retail records for December, the month's results included record sales of:<BR>
	<P>-- Chrysler's JA body compact sedans, the Plymouth Breeze, Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus.<BR>
	-- Dodge Intrepid, Ram Pickup and Viper.<BR>
	-- Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee and Wrangler.<BR>
	-- Chrysler Sebring Coupe and Sebring Convertible.<BR>
	<P>The list of calendar-year U.S. sales records set in 1996 is even longer. In addition to total vehicle and retail sales records, Chrysler notched new high sales marks for trucks, minivans, Dodge Truck and the Dodge Division, the Chrysler-Plymouth Jeep/Eagle Division, combined Neon models, and JA-body compacts.<BR>
	<P>Individual calendar year records were set for:<BR>
	<P>-- Chrysler Town &amp; Country and Sebring Coupe.<BR>
	-- Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee and Wrangler.<BR>
	-- Dodge Ram Pickup, Caravan, Neon, Stratus and Avenger.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>EXCITEMENT, COMPETITION AND FANS<BR>
DRIVE DODGE INTO THE RAM TOUGH WORLD OF <BR>
NASCAR SUPERTRUCK RACING</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>   The rationale for Dodge's involvement in NASCAR SuperTruck is short and to the point:  It simply makes sense.  For Dodge, and its hot-selling Dodge Ram full-size pickup, the blend of excitement and performance dovetails perfectly with the marketing strategy for the truck and the Dodge brand.   <BR>
	Dodge announced its expanded involvement in the NASCAR SuperTruck series here today, where it revealed the trucks and drivers for four SuperTruck teams.  In addition, Dodge has established a lucrative contingency program to encourage privateers to pilot Dodge Ram trucks.  <BR>
	&quot;We didn't sit around in lab coats, dissecting business plans and marketing strategies to come to the decision that NASCAR SuperTruck was the right place for Dodge Ram,&quot; said Dodge General Manager Martin R. Levine.  &quot;This is not only an exciting arena to showcase the leading-edge design and power of the Ram, but the competitive nature of this series mirrors the truck marketplace.<BR>
(37895)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	&quot;It has now been two years since we introduced the new Ram, and we have made serious inroads into the full-size truck market.  We are at the point where we now compete head-to-head with the other top truck manufacturers for customers all across the country.  It is a natural fit to compete with these same manufacturers on the race track, in front of the people who will buy our trucks.&quot;<BR>
	Launched just two years ago, the Dodge Ram has rapidly moved into the top level of the full-size truck market.  Sales have grown almost 400% since 1993.  Dodge now claims 16 percent of the full-size market, compared to 4.4 percent in 1993.  <BR>
	In the individual segments of the market, Standard Cab market share has been as high as 26 percent of the segment, compared to 3.6 percent prior to launch of the new Ram, while Club Cab share has gone from 6 percent to 10 percent.  Dodge's share of the diesel truck market has always been strong, with the Cummins-powered Dodge trucks outselling all other diesel competitors.  Pairing the new Ram with the Cummins diesel has earned even higher market share, with Dodge now claiming over 40 percent of the segment.<BR>
-more-<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>

<P>	&quot;Fans of the NASCAR SuperTruck series want to see their truck on the track, and thanks to the success of Ram, we have a lot of owners in the stands,&quot; Levine said.  &quot;And if they don't own one already, chances are they're thinking about buying one.&quot;<BR>

SUPER BOWL FANS TO INTERACT WITH NEON ADS<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation will conduct its first full-scale test of  interactive advertising on the Super Bowl using commercials that launch Neon, its newest small car.<BR>
	Chrysler will quiz subscribers to Interactive Network (IN), Inc. about Neon advertising right after the big game.  IN is a Sunnyvale, Calif. company whose subscribers can play along with the Super Bowl on a wireless laptop, handheld device equipped with a keyboard and liquid crystal display screen.<BR>
	Subscribers watch the game on regular TV and enter predictions of the plays called for each upcoming down.  They will also pit their predictions against Sam Wyche, Tampa Bay's head coach.<BR>
	IN alerted subscribers this week about watching for Neon advertising during the Super Bowl.  At the end of the game, viewers will be asked to participate in a survey about what they have seen and have a chance to win Chrysler promotional items.<BR>
	&quot;We're not so concerned about how many people we reach,&quot; said Arthur C. (Bud) Liebler, Vice President of Marketing and Communications.  &quot;We're more interested in how this use of the technology will be received and what people remember of our Neon advertising.&quot; <BR>
(04294)	(more)<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	IN subscribers will be asked questions such as where the Neon will be sold, what it will cost, what features Neon offers and what is the Neon's tagline.<BR>
Last year, IN conducted a similar promotion with Pepsi and nearly 750 viewers participated.  About 92 percent of those surveyed correctly identified the name of a new cola Pepsi was introducing and had recall of 87 percent or better on previous Diet Pepsi ad campaigns.<BR>
	IN has subscribers in San Francisco, Chicago and Sacramento.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER TEAMS UP WITH NEW YORK METRO UTILITIES<BR>
TO FUEL CNG VEHICLE SALES TO FLEETS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>In just a little more than five months of the 1994 model year, Chrysler Corporation sold nearly three times as many compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles as it did in all of 1993.  And a new partnership with three New York and New Jersey utility companies should fuel even more fleet sales.<BR>
	Chrysler sold 1,106 CNG vehicles through March 14 -- a 150 percent increase from the entire 1993 model year total of 445.<BR>
	According to Mike Clement, Chrysler's manager of alternative fuel vehicle sales and marketing, federal and state tax deductions and incentives from Chrysler, Brooklyn Union, Consolidated Edison and Public Service Electric and Gas will help build a base of fleet customers in the Northeast.<BR>
	A similar program in California is beginning to build interest for CNG vehicles among fleet customers, Clement added.  Chrysler was recognized in January by the state of California as the first company to reach the lowest emission status possible to date for natural gas-powered vehicles.<BR>
	The Chrysler vehicles -- the 1994 Dodge Caravan, Caravan C/V, and Plymouth Voyager -- are the first to be certified by California Air Resources Board (CARB) as Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV).  The only cleaner burning vehicles on the market today are electric vehicles.<BR>
(11594)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	Last year the full-size CNG Dodge Ram Van and Wagon were certified by California as the first Low Emission Vehicles (LEV).  In fact, Brooklyn Union and Public Service Electric and Gas helped finance the development of Chrysler's CNG Ram Van and Wagon in 1991-92, Clement added.<BR>
	Chrysler has launched similar programs with utility companies in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento, and will set up partnerships in Baltimore, Washington, D.C., Atlanta and Chicago over the next three months.<BR>
	&quot;With significant incentives and tax exemptions, it's going to create a fairly sizeable market, maybe 2,000 vehicle sales this calendar year,&quot; Clement said.  &quot;CNG vehicles are one more viable solution to our air quality management problems.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler offers a $2,000 fleet incentive for the 1994 Ram Wagon and Ram Van and a $500 fleet incentive for 1994 minivans.  Fleet customers should also contact Brooklyn Union, Consolidated Edison and Public Service Electric and Gas for additional incentives offered by the utility companies.  Lastly, companies purchasing CNG vehicles will be eligible for a federal income tax deduction of $2,000 per vehicle and a New York state sales tax exemption for the incremental cost of purchasing a certified, low-emissions vehicle.<BR>
	Compressed natural gas is about 30 percent cheaper than gasoline -- about 80 cents a gallon as compared to $1.10 a gallon of gasoline.<BR>
	CNG minivans and full-size vans have a range of 100-150 miles city and 150-200 miles highway.  While a CNG vehicle has somewhat less range than their gasoline-powered counterpart, the performance in every-day driving is virtually the same, Clement said.<BR>
(more)<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>
	&quot;While somewhat limited, the 100-200 mile range of the CNG vehicles is enough to entice potential fleet customers,&quot; Clement said.  &quot;Best of all, these vehicles are ideally suited for inner-city use and that's where the air quality problems are greatest.<BR>
	&quot;Also, many fleet customers have a fixed driving pattern with a limited range.  A plumber in New York isn't likely to make a house call in Albany!&quot;<BR>

WITH HOOP DREAMS COMMUNITY OUTREACH</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Coping with pressures. Accepting personal responsibility. Confronting lifes challenges.<BR>
	Those issues and more are evident in the critically acclaimed documentary film - Hoop Dreams, a true story about two teenage boys and their families who pursue their dreams of playing professional basketball in the NBA.<BR>
	Thats why we created the Chrysler Hoop Dreams Challenge, said A.C. Bud Liebler, Chryslers Vice President-Marketing and Communications. Were challenging youth and families all across America to use this film to examine and discuss tough issues, to break down stereotypes, and to explore the real meaning of personal success.<BR>
	The Chrysler Hoop Dreams Challenge, a community-educational outreach program for young adults in 23 major metropolitan areas, will be launched in conjunction with the PBS premiere television broadcast on Wednesday, Nov. 15 at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. Hoop Dreams will air in the <BR>
Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area on WETA Channel 26.<BR>

<P>(40795-A)					-more-<BR>
- 2 -<BR>

<P>	The outreach program includes publication and distribution of student workbooks and teacher-facilitator discussion guides to middle and high schools, a centralized coordination of the program elements by the Center for the Study of Sports in Society (CSSS), the National Consortium for Academics and Sports (NCAS) and KTCA-TV. PBS outreach coordinators will also be utilized along with NCAS and local community leaders for combined school and community outreach efforts, which will benefit young athletes seeking professional careers in sports.<BR>
	According to the National Collegiate Athletic Association, of the 433,000 young people playing high school basketball or football in their senior year, only 23,625 are selected for college teams. And of that number, only 279 will be selected as professional rookies in any given year.<BR>
	The essence of the film goes far beyond the basketball court, said Liebler. We believe its important for young people and their parents to discuss the issues raised in the film. Its one small way we can all help to create a world of greater understanding.<BR>
	Liebler, who found the film compelling, said that a balanced education must include a strong academic foundation with the kind of cultural acceptance that fosters independent thinking.<BR>

<P>	Thousands of gifted athletes who have functioned as superstars throughout their high school and college years face considerable trauma if they are insufficiently prepared to compete in the non-athletic area, according to Earle B. Higgins, a former NBA player and Chryslers Special Supplier Relations Specialist. <BR>
	Higgins, who also heads Athletes Learning Educational Resources Training (A.L.E.R.T.) Organization, said that those 279 young people fortunate enough to become professional rookies frequently discover that their sports career ends in one or two years.<BR>
	A.L.E.R.T. provides free tutorial assistance, guidance and counseling that allows young people to develop realistic goal setting skills.<BR>
	Our young people should have a chance to be the best they can be academically and athletically, said Higgins.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER WILL REROUTE WIRING HARNESS ON SOME 1994 VEHICLES</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation has notified the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) that it will recall an estimated 110,000 1994 Chrysler Concorde, New Yorker and LHS; Dodge Intrepid; and Eagle Vision models to reroute the transmission wiring harness.<BR>
	In a small number of cases, the wiring may come in contact with the right-side steering tie rod.  A wire for one of the circuits in the harness may short due to possible abrasion over time, causing an electrical malfunction of that circuit.     <BR>
	The models being recalled were built from late July through early December, 1993.  Changes have already been made to every vehicle in production since December.  While the majority will not experience a malfunction, Chrysler will replace the wiring harness bracket with a revised design to reroute the harness, inspecting wires for damage and adding a plastic sleeve over the wiring for additional protection.  Any owners experiencing a problem can take their vehicle to their dealership and the vehicle will be repaired immediately, while all-new components to remedy the condition will be available in March.<BR>
	There have been no accidents or injuries. <BR>

<P><B>1994 LH TRANSMISSION WIRING HARNESS RECALL</B><BR>

<P><B>Q.</B>	<B>What's the problem?</B><BR>
	<B>A.</B>	The transmission wiring harness may come into contact with the right side steering tie rod and can short out one of several circuits in the harness, depending on which wire in the harness is exposed by the rubbing contact.<BR>
<B>Q.	What happens?</B><BR>
	<B>A.</B>	A wire for one of the circuits in the harness -- transmission control, park/ neutral switch, backup lights or speedometer signal --may short, causing and electrical failure of that circuit.<BR>
<B>Q.	What caused the problem on the 1994 models?</B><BR>
<B>	A.</B>	A redesigned harness bracket resulted in a routing which didn't allow adequate assembly clearance to the tie rod.<BR>
<B>Q.	How was the problem discovered?</B><BR>
<B>	A.</B>	Investigation of nine field reports of improper transmission performance determined the cause to be shorting of a wire due to rubbing contact with the tie rod.<BR>
<B>Q.	What are you doing to prevent future problems?</B><BR>
<B>	A.</B>	We have redesigned the bracket to prevent contact with the steering tie rod and added a protective sleeve over the wiring.<BR>
<B>Q.	Why is this safety related?</B><BR>
<B>	A.</B>	Two of the potentially affected circuits involve FMVSS systems -- backup lights and the transmission park/neutral switch ignition interlock system.  Also, engine dieout may occur.<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P><B>Q.	Are the transmission control conditions safety related?</B><BR>
<B>	A.	</B>No.  The primary condition is default of the electrical control system which can cause the transmission to stay in second gear.<BR>
<B>Q.	Are any Canadian vehicles affected?</B><BR>
<B>	A.</B>	Yes, about 15,000 additional vehicles are in the Canadian market.<BR>
<B>Q.	When will owners be notified?</B><BR>
<B>	A.</B>	We expect sufficient parts to be available in a few weeks.  This condition is not an immediate concern because rub through is a long term process.  The early failures which discovered the condition were caused by the harness bracket also being bent during the assembly.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>  Chrysler Corporation today announced the base  manufacturer's suggested retail price for the all-new 1995 Dodge Avenger, a fun-to-drive sport coupe characterized by expressive styling, outstanding interior room,  comfort, safety and value, at $13,771 (including destination charge). <BR>
	Avenger, available in base and ES trim levels,  successfully brings to coupe buyers a car with true balance -- the enjoyment and style of smaller specialty sport coupes, yet with the interior room of the larger, traditional two-door coupes -- all at a price that represents unprecedented value.<BR>
	Standard equipment includes a Chrysler Corporation-designed and built 2.0-liter, 16-valve DOHC4-cylinder engine, five-speed manual transmission, a fully independent double-wishbone suspension, and power-assisted speed-sensitive steering.  Also standard are comfort and convenience items such as AM/FM stereo radio, tilt steering colimn, 6-way adjustable driver's seat with recliner memory, electric rear window defroster, remote fuel door release and tinted glass.<BR>
	Driver and passenger airbags are standard on all Avengers.  <BR>
	In addition to equipment found on the base Avenger, the ES adds a 2.5-liter, 24-valve SOHC V-6 engine, a four-speed automatic transmission, a handling (46994-S)	(more)<BR>

<P>-2- <BR>

<P>suspension package that adds a rear stabilizer bar, air conditioning, four-wheel antilock brakes, rear spoiler, integrated fog lights, and 16-inch cast aluminum wheels.  The base MSRP for the Dodge Avenger ES is $17,621 (including destination charge).<BR>
	&quot;The Dodge Avenger provides the style and features usually found on cars  costing thousands of dollars more,&quot; said Paul Wilbur, planning chief for the Avenger program.  &quot;That's the definition of true value.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;We're bringing one of the most significant new entries in recent memory into the 2-door coupe market,&quot; Wilbur continued,  &quot;and we're doing it at a price that is affordable to a wide range of buyers.&quot;<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced new base prices for all Chrysler Town &amp; Country, Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager models, and for Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan SE, LE, and ES models, and for selected options, effective September 25.<BR>
	 The average increase for the affected short- and long-wheelbase minivan models, including options, is 2.4 percent.  Its the first Chrysler minivan pricing action since mid-1994.<BR>
	We deferred cost increases and elected to price our all-new 1996 minivans aggressively when they were introduced last spring, Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President -- Sales and Marketing and General Manager -- Minivan Operations, said.  Since their introduction, and with more than 100,000 units already on the road, Chryslers 1996 minivans are confirmed as the undisputed value leaders in the marketplace -- a position well continue to hold.<BR>
  	Chrysler also announced that beginning in January 1996, Anti-Lock Braking Systems will be optional on Dodge Caravan and Grand Caravan base models, as well as on Plymouth Voyager and Grand Voyager base models.  <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>ULEV EMISSION STATUS FOR CHRYSLER CNG VEHICLES<BR>
 TO CREATE `SIZEABLE' FLEET MARKET</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  A &quot;fairly sizeable&quot; fleet market will evolve for compressed natural gas vehicles (CNG) as a result of Chrysler Corporation's being recognized by the state of California as the first company to reach the lowest emission status possible to date for natural gas-powered vehicles.<BR>
	The Chrysler vehicles -- the 1994 Dodge Caravan, Caravan C/V, and Plymouth Voyager -- were certified by California Air Resources Board (CARB) last month as Ultra Low Emission Vehicles (ULEV).  The only cleaner burning vehicles on the market today are electric vehicles.  Last year the full-size CNG Dodge Ram Van and Wagon were certified by California as the first Low Emission Vehicles (LEV).<BR>
	There are currently 75 CNG refueling stations in Southern California and more than 600 will be added to the region by the year 2000.  A majority of the existing stations have been built by Southern California Gas Company, which has led the charge with Chrysler to help create an infrastructure for CNG vehicles.  <BR>
	Mike Clement, Chrysler's manager of alternative fuel vehicle sales and marketing, estimates Chrysler can sell 2,000 CNG minivans in 1994.  In 1993, Chrysler sold about 50 electric vehicles, 445 CNG vans and 5,432 vehicles that can run on a methanol-gas mixture.  <BR>
(07394-A)		(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>

<P>	&quot;With significant incentives and certain tax exemptions, it's going to create a fairly sizeable market,&quot; Clement said.  &quot;CNG vehicles are one more viable solution to our air management problems.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler is scheduled to launch similar programs in San Francisco, New York City and in the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. corridor by the end of April, and nine other cities with major pollution problems by the end of the year.<BR>
	The incentives virtually negate any price penalty created by converting a vehicle to CNG.  The manufacturer's suggested retail price will be about $22,000 for CNG minivans and $17,400 to $26,200 for full-size vans.  <BR>
		The incentives include more than $1,750 from SoCal; a $500 fleet purchase incentive for minivans and $2,000 for full-size vans from Chrysler; a federal income tax deduction of $2,000 per vehicle, and a state sales tax exemption for the incremental cost of buying a certified, low-emissions vehicle.<BR>
	Additional incentives with funding caps are available as well.  California Energy Commission will offer a $1,500 incentive for minivans and $1,000 for full-size vans (up to $500,000 in 1994).  The state of California offers an income tax credit of $1,000 on minivans and up to $2,000 on full-size vans (up to $750,000 in 1994).  <BR>
	Compressed natural gas is cheaper than gasoline -- about 80 cents a gallon as compared to $1.10 a gallon of gasoline.  More importantly, emissions from these CNG vehicles will be significantly less and in fact, very comparable with an electric vehicle when emissions from power plants to generate the electricity are included.       	(more)<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>
	CNG minivans and full-size vans have a range of 100-150 miles city and 150-200 miles highway.  Current battery technology for electric vehicles can only provide a range of less than 100 miles.<BR>
	&quot;While a CNG vehicle has somewhat less range than their gasoline-powered counterpart, the performance in every day driving is virtually the same,&quot; Clement said.  &quot;Performance can be a drawback for electric vehicles and the $100,000 price tag is a big detriment.&quot;<BR>
	While somewhat limited, the range of CNG vehicles is enough to entice potential fleet customers, Clement said.<BR>
	&quot;Many fleet customers have a fixed driving pattern with a limited range,&quot; Clement explained.  &quot;A plumber in Los Angeles isn't likely to make a house call in San Diego!&quot;<BR>
	Target markets include shuttle vehicles for airports, van pools and military bases; delivery trucks and courier services; utility trucks; vehicles used within a production plant compound and service trucks for trades such as plumbers, electricians and carpenters.<BR>
	Other potential users might include environmental organizations, educational institutions, health care providers and organizations servicing children and the elderly.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation today announced the appointment of a new distributor for Poland, Chrysler Jeep&reg; Import Polska, based in Warsaw.

       Columbus, Oh -- </B>They had done their homework and their comparison shopping.  The 84 Honda had served them well, but it was tired.  And then there was Alexandra, 10 months and growing.  Have playpen, stroller, diaper bags, will travel.<BR>
	And so it was with a specific objective in mind that the Columbus, Ohio family entered Bob Caldwells Chrysler-Plymouth showroom in Columbus late in August, and introduced themselves to salesman Ted Gallant.  They were in the market for a new minivan.  <BR>
	It was a quick process of selection -- all recorded in numbers and option codes -- a 1996 Plymouth Voyager SE on paper -- a computerized order entry -- a major purchase for the Lombards, a routine day for Ted Gallant.  Chrysler computers processed the data, relayed the order to the Windsor, Ontario assembly plant in bar codes and dutifully reminded Bill Craffey, a manager in the sales reporting department in Highland Park, Michigan, that another minivan sale was recorded . . . number 5,000,000.  <BR>

<P>(38195)	- more -<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	That was then, this is now.  All the numbers on paper, computerized order forms, option codes and bar codes have given way to a gleaming new, Dark Rosewood, Plymouth minivan. Its in the street in front of the Lombards home, surrounded by a Chrysler special delivery team -- assembled almost from the moment Craffey picked up the phone to announce that number 5,000,000 had come through.    <BR>
	The special delivery team includes Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton, Executive Vice President Ted Cunningham, Vice President Bud Liebler, Ohio Lieutenant Governor Nancy Hollister and Bob Caldwell and his dealership employees -- some 200 company representatives in all.  In a show of support, the Goodyear blimp hangs overhead.  McDonalds is serving a block breakfast.  There are lights and cameras, balloons, police roadblocks and the local high school marching band, a juggler and some guy on a unicycle, and oh, its 7:30 in the morning!  And the Lombards have no clue whats about to happen.<BR>
	Bob Eaton personally delivers the keys to the new Plymouth, along with a $5,000 Savings Bond for Alexandras education because as Ive been telling everyone wholl listen, its important to save for the future.  Lieutenant Governor Hollister then presents the Lombards with a special Ohio license plate -- 5MILNTH -- and there are other gifts: built-in child seats, a combination CD and tape player, Plymouth shirts for the family.  And lastly, the minivan is free, compliments of Chrysler Corporation.<BR>
	Just how big a deal is this little Plymouth Voyager SE?<BR>

	At a dealership rally the evening before, Ted Cunningham, who heads both sales and marketing and minivan operations, answered that very question.  Lots of vehicles have sold in record numbers -- beginning with the Model T, he said.  Lots of popular models have dotted the landscape over the years.  But no other vehicle, anywhere in the world, has so completely changed the automotive landscape like this one has.<BR>
	Why, because minivans are an essential part of every familys transportation needs today, because Chrysler has the most versatile minivan lineup, and because if youre in the market, the best choice is still a Chrysler, Plymouth or Dodge minivan  -- feature for feature, dollar for dollar, he said.  <BR>
	But thats been true from the beginning.  Whats newsworthy here is that in recent years Chrysler has grown the segment, managed and led the minivans evolution, and has now successfully re-invented one of the worlds greatest inventions.<BR>
	When Chrysler introduced the minivan 12 years ago, there was no known segment or customer base to build from, and there was no road map to follow.  But the magic wagon ended up establishing a new market that outstripped the wildest projections.  There are now more than 20 competitive minivan models in the U.S. market.  The segment has grown from 100,000 units sold in 1984 to well over one million units per year. <BR>

<P>	<BR>
- more -<BR>
	- 4 - <BR>

<P>	 During the past three years, Chrysler has consecutively sold more than a half-million minivans per year, and Chrysler remains on top of the market with more than 40 percent of sales.  This year the company is projecting sales of 700,000 of its minivans worldwide. <BR>
	The Lombards probably only care about one of them.  And Chrysler is delighted to welcome the Lombards to its large and growing family of minivan customers.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>U.S. CLASSROOMS TO RECEIVE UNIQUE AIR BAG SAFETY COURSE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B>  <BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>In the wake of recent public concern about air bags and children, Chrysler Corporation, the American Automobile Association (AAA), and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) announced today that schools and day care centers across the U.S. will receive special educational materials on air bag safety. The campaign is one of the largest efforts of its kind ever conducted, and will be supported by a host of other prominent safety, law enforcement and medical organizations. <BR>

<P><P>A letter announcing the<I> ABC's of Air Bag Safety--The Back is Where It's At</I> educational program will be sent to more than 300,000 teachers, principals, school board and PTA presidents representing some 160,000 day care and private and public elementary schools across the nation.  The materials developed by Chrysler and LifetimeLearning Systems of Fairfield, Connecticut, and with guidance from safety experts and educators, will be delivered to schools in January.<BR>

<P><P>&quot;Our message is simple: air bags are life-saving devices and saving lives everyday,&quot; said Chrysler Chairman and CEO Robert J. Eaton.  &quot;But special precautions must be taken when driving children in air bag equipped vehicles. Children risk injury if they are unbelted, belted improperly or otherwise too close to the instrument panel when an air bag inflates.  Parents and children alike need to know that to play it <U>safe</U>, kids need to ride in the back seat whenever possible.  Infants in rear-facing child seats <U>must</U> ride in the back seat, no exceptions.&quot;   <BR>
<P>	The <I>ABCs of Air Bag Safety</I> is structured to encourage good safety habits in children through traditional classroom learning.  Concerns about air bags, prompted by the deaths of more than 30 children, motivated Chrysler, AAA, AAP and other organizations to join forces to educate parents and children alike on proper occupant protection.  Teaching safety in the classroom during the formative years provides an opportunity to instill positive attitudes and behavior that students will retain for life.  Professionally-developed instructional materials ensure that the lessons are age-appropriate and prepared in usable formats for teachers.<BR>
<P>	&quot;It's never too early to begin teaching children about the importance of auto safety,&quot; said AAA President Robert L. Darbelnet.  &quot;Despite all of our efforts, almost 60% of children killed in vehicle crashes are unrestrained.  We believe this training program will go a long way toward reducing these numbers.  Our involvement continues AAA's long history of work in child passenger safety.&quot;<BR>
<P>	&quot;As a child health safety advocate, the AAP enthusiastically supports ways to educate both children and parents about automobile safety,&quot; said AAP President Robert Hannenmann, M.D.  &quot;The <I>ABCs of Air Bag Safety</I> materials emphasize the importance of children riding in the rear seat of an automobile because it is the safest place for them to be.&quot; <BR>
<P>	The National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) also is supporting the program and asking its ten regional offices to promote it in states and communities.  NHTSA reports that air bags have saved more than 1,500 lives, but warns that certain safety rules need to be followed for maximum benefit and to prevent injury or death to children.  The agency advises that children age 12 and under should ride in the back seat, either in a child safety seat or using the vehicle's lap/shoulder belts, depending on the child's age and weight.<BR>
<P>	&quot;Many parents understandably are concerned about air bags and want information on how their children can ride safely,&quot; said NHTSA administrator Dr. Ricardo Martinez, a board-certified emergency physician.  &quot;They also want their children to be able to make smart choices about personal safety.  This important educational campaign delivers on that need, and should become the forerunner of continuous efforts to make safety a routine part of classroom learning.&quot;<BR>
<P>	The <I>ABCs of Air Bag Safety</I> educational materials will seek to convince children that it is &quot;cool&quot; to sit in the back seat, using the slogan, <I>The Back is Where It's At! </I> Included in the comprehensive package for teachers are brochures explaining why the back seat is the safest place for children to ride, an instructional video, teachers' guides, wall posters, colorful stickers for the children to use, and more than 30 million take-home pamphlets so parents will better understand the importance of requiring their children to ride in the back seat.<BR>
<P>	In addition, each student will receive a &quot;Family's New Year Resolution&quot; pledge form designed to encourage a family discussion--and decision--that all children will ride in the back seat, buckled up.<BR>
<P>	Although Chrysler is enabling the program by providing the funding, with the advice and counsel of the AAA and the AAP, many other organizations with an interest in education and highway safety, in addition to NHTSA, are supporting it enthusiastically.  Included are the American Federation of Teachers, Emergency Nurses CARE, International Association of Chiefs of Police, Fraternal Order of Police, National Association of Governors' Highway Safety Representatives, the Air Bag Safety Campaign, National Safety Council, Optimist International, and the American Medical Association.<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>  Chrysler Corporation is notifying approximately 1,500 owners of 1995 Eagle Talon models so that dealers can  reinforce a panel to which the ABS hydraulic unit is attached.<BR>
	Eagle Talons are manufactured by Diamond-Star Motors, a subsidiary of Mitsubishi Motor Corporation.   MMC has determined that a support panel provides inadequate strength for the ABS hydraulic unit and has developed a panel reinforcement system consisting of the addition of two support brackets.  <BR>
	Chrysler is notifying customers of affected Eagle Talon models and  asking them to bring their cars to Eagle dealers for the modification.<BR>
	The need to reinforce the support panel was discovered during endurance testing.   There have been no complaints from owners and no injuries have been reported. <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Hundreds of thousands of miles make up the off-road and four-wheel-drive trails that stretch across the nation's land. <BR>
	Maintaining the quality of that land must be the highest priority of every sport utility driver.<BR>
	&quot;Nature has a funny way of awakening the senses,&quot; says Ed Brust, General Manager-Jeep and Eagle Division. &quot;But when you venture beyond the paved road, be sure your sense of responsibility gets turned on as well.&quot;<BR>
	Jeep&reg; is a founding member of &quot;Tread Lightly!&quot;, a non-profit organization designed to promote off-highway use ethics and practices.<BR>
	&quot;Our message is simple, use common sense and stay off unmarked trails,&quot; Brust said. &quot;To reinforce this, we only show our Jeep&reg; products in settings that include an approved road or trail.&quot;<BR>
	The &quot;Tread Lightly!&quot; pledge can be easily summarized:<BR>
	Travel only where motorized vehicles are permitted--never blaze your own trail.<BR>
	Respect the rights of hikers, skiers, campers and others to enjoy their activities 		undisturbed.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(08994)	- more - <BR>
	- 2 -<BR>

<P>		Educate yourself by obtaining travel maps and regulations from public agencies, 		complying with signs and barriers and asking owners' permission to cross 		private property.<BR>
	Avoid streams, lakeshores, meadows, muddy roads and trails, steep hillsides, 		wildlife and livestock.<BR>
	Drive responsibly to protect the environment and preserve opportunities to enjoy 		your vehicle on wildlands.<BR>
	&quot;We made a long-standing effort to be environmentally responsible, long before it became politically correct to do so,&quot; added Brust. &quot;Endorsing `Tread Lightly!' makes perfect sense to us at Jeep.&quot;<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation is notifying owners of 1,500 1994 model year 3500 series four-wheel drive (4WD) Dodge Ram Cab &amp; Chassis trucks to bring their trucks to Dodge dealers to have a track bar reinforcement strut installed.  Affected trucks were built between October 1993 and June 1994.<BR>
	The front suspension track bar bracket attachment on the affected vehicles may have inadequate fatigue strength due to poor weld quality from a supplier, resulting in the potential for a long-range durability failure if the truck is operated at or near its maximum gross vehicle weight for extended periods.  Failure of the track bar bracket attachment may result in front axle vibration and the potential for directional control difficulty.  <BR>
	The track bar attachment bracket failure was experienced during severe &quot;worst case scenario&quot; off-road durability testing at Chrysler's Proving Grounds in Chelsea, Michigan.  There have been no owner reports of track bar failures. <BR>
	Dodge dealers will install the track bar reinforcement strut at no cost to owners.  <BR>

<P>(51294-S)	# # # #<BR>
<B>RAM TRACK BAR ATTACHMENT RECALL Q &amp; A</B><BR>

<P>Q: How many Ram trucks are affected?<BR>
A: About 1,500 3500 series 4x4 Dodge Ram Cab &amp; Chassis trucks, built between October 1993 and June of 1994. <BR>

<P>Q: Are any other Ram pickup models affected?<BR>
A. No.<BR>

<P>Q: How did you discover this problem?<BR>
A: We discovered it at our Proving Grounds in Chelsea, Michigan, when the track bar attachment failed on two 3500 series 4x4 Dodge Ram Cab &amp; Chassis trucks during severe &quot;worst case scenario&quot; off-road durability testing.<BR>

<P>Q: Why did the attachment fail?<BR>
A. Engineering analysis determined that the track bar attachment failed due to fatigue resulting from poor weld quality.  <BR>

<P>Q: Have owners been notified?<BR>
A: Notifications are now being mailed to owners. <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>JEEP&reg; GRAND CHEROKEE TSI OFFERS SPORTY PERFORMANCE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B>  <BR>

<P><B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee, already the gold standard in the compact sport-utility segment, now offers a sportier look with the debut of Grand Cherokee TSi. <BR>
	<P>&quot;All editions of Jeep Grand Cherokee appeal to the upscale buyer in the compact sport-utility segment, but TSi appeals to the customer who wants the sportiness associated with sports-sedans and the versatility and capabilities of a Jeep vehicle,&quot;  said Martin R. Levine - General Manager Chrysler/Plymouth and Jeep/Eagle Division.<BR>
	<P>Including destination charges, the suggested base price for a two-wheel-drive Grand Cherokee TSi is $29,849; the suggested base for the four-wheel-drive version is $32,423. <BR>
	<P>Grand Cherokee TSi is available with the best-in-segment 5.2-liter, 220 horsepower V-8 engine that produces 300 foot-pounds of torque or the standard 4.0-liter, 185 horsepower I-6 engine which produces 220 foot-pounds of torque at just 2400 rpm.<BR>
	<P>Equipped with road-gripping 16-inch Goodyear Eagle ES performance tires and the Jeep Quadra Coil touring suspension, Grand Cherokee TSi delivers superb handling, while maintaining the legendary Jeep off-highway capability.<BR>
	<P>Unique to the Grand Cherokee TSi exterior are aggressive 16-inch five-spoke aluminum wheels accented in sparkle silver,  iris blue TSi pinstriping, and nameplates that set TSi apart from the Grand Cherokee Laredo, Limited and Orvis Editions.<BR>
	<P>Unique interior features on Grand Cherokee TSi include body-contoured perforated leather seating surfaces; 10-way, adjustable power seats with lumbar and recline adjustments; and rustic Bird's Eye Maple woodgrain accents on the instrument and door panels.  Also standard on TSi is a station surfer's dream:  at-your-fingertips steering wheel mounted stereo system controls.<BR>
	<P>Levine added, &quot;Grand Cherokee TSi will attract buyers with a different demographic profile from our current Laredo and Limited buyers.  The TSi buyer is slightly younger than Laredo and Limited buyers.  More are single males, with a greater percentage having attended college with incomes higher than Laredo owners, but less than Limited owners.&quot;<BR>
	<P>All Grand Cherokees are available with Select-Trac, full-time 4WD; Quadra-Trac, all-time 4WD; or 2WD.  Unique to Jeep, Quadra-Trac is capable of providing any ratio of power &quot;on-demand&quot; -- virtually from zero to 100 percent -- to the front and rear axles.<BR>
	<P>Jeep Grand Cherokee TSi will be assembled at Chrysler Corporation's Jefferson North Assembly Plant in Detroit and Chrysler Corporation's Graz Assembly Plant in Graz, Austria, and sold in North America and mainland Europe.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>THE FACTS ARE ON THE TABLE, CHRYSLER CHAIRMAN<BR>
URGES STATE TO RE-EVALUATE ZEV MANDATE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Sacramento -- </B> With recent technology audit reports stating that advanced batteries for electric vehicles will not be ready by 1998, Chrysler Chairman and CEO Robert J. Eaton today urged California environmental regulators to re-evaluate the impending sales mandates for electric vehicles.<BR>
	Speaking to the Comstock Club, Eaton said the issues being raised by the auto industry over the last several years have been validated by recent reports commissioned by California, New York and the U.S. Government.<BR>
	The issue has been and continues to be the lack of a high-performance, low cost battery, Eaton said.	Last month the battery audit team appointed by Gov. Wilson issued a report saying the technology simply isnt going to be available to produce a viable electric vehicle by 1998. <BR>
	Now that the facts are on the table, Eaton said that the time has come for California and the auto industry to move forward together to find workable solutions to the clean air issues.<BR>
	We (the industry) have a role to play in the solution -- a reasonable and proportionate role, Eaton said.  And were prepared to play it.<BR>
(more)<BR>
(41195)<BR>
	-2-<BR>
	Its a role that Eaton said the industry has been playing for many years, noting that the significant progress made by the auto industry in meeting clean air challenges is often overlooked.	<BR>
	For example, a 1996 Dodge Caravan traveling about 250 miles puts fewer smog-forming emissions into the air than a 1965 vehicle traveling just two miles.  Or to put it another way, driving that same Caravan just 60 miles, would release fewer emissions than the same 1965 vehicle sitting parked in a driveway all-day with the motor off, Eaton said.<BR>
	 Eaton cautioned that the idea of mandating technologies and sales volumes is the wrong approach.  But he applauded the Governors recent actions on evaluating the effectiveness of regulations in the state, and urged a close look at the ZEV mandate.<BR>
	Governor Wilson has made it clear that hes against mandates imposed by Washington on the people of California, Eaton said.  I was encouraged to learn that in September, Governor Wilson signed an executive order telling all state agencies to review each of the 28,000 regulations affecting business in this state, and recommended a list be developed of those that should be repealed.  Needless to say, I believe that the 1998 electric vehicle mandate would be a great place to start.<BR>
	Eaton said that Chrysler is committed to working on electric vehicle technology, adding that despite the mandate, he could see a day when the dream could become a reality.  <BR>
(more)<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>
	We are in the personal transportation business, and we believe that there could be a significant demand for a practical, workable, cost-effective electric vehicle, Eaton said.  We want to build one.  Wed like to build it tomorrow!  If we could, we would.  But we cant build one that meets all of those conditions.  Nobody can.  And that is a fact that cant be ignored.<BR>
	Eaton said the idea of simply mandating a technology is flawed, and cautioned that taking this approach will rush the wrong technology to market,  disappointing consumers.  The end result will be a further delayed introduction of the technology, if and when it becomes viable.  <BR>
	There are sensible, practical ways to deal with this issue, Eaton said.  But simply telling companies, This is what you will build, and telling consumers, This is what you will buy, is not one of them.  We need to strike a balance between what society wants; what technology can deliver; and what the consumer will accept.  You cannot achieve that balance by simply passing a law.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>- Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee offers a new level of sophistication in safety, comfort, handling and appearance for 1995 in a package that combines luxury with legendary Jeep performance and utility.  <BR>
	Jeep Grand Cherokee is offered in four trim levels for 1995: the base model SE, Laredo, Limited and the new Orvis&reg; Edition.  The SE and Laredo -- and for the first time in 1995, the Grand Cherokee Limited -- are also offered in two-wheel drive in addition to four-wheel drive.  <BR>
	Grand Cherokee set the benchmark in occupant protection with its standard driver-side air bag, standard four-wheel anti-lock brake system, and front and rear door beams for side impact protection.  Safety equipment for 1995 has been enhanced with the addition of standard four-wheel disc brakes and an available integrated child safety seat.<BR>
	New improvements for 1995 also include larger all-terrain tires on the Up Country suspension package, and an Orvis Edition model -- a joint project with The Orvis Company, the oldest continuously operating supplier of outdoor sporting equipment in the United States.<BR>
(42794) 	(more)<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	Because both companies share a grand outdoor heritage and an appeal among discriminating customers, Jeep has become the &quot;official vehicle of Orvis&quot;.<BR>
	The new Orvis Edition model includes the same features as the Limited model, plus eye-catching exterior paint in Moss Green.  The interior is<BR>
Champagne with Dark Green and Roan Red accents on the seats and door panels.  The Up Country suspension package and Trailer Tow Prep is standard on all Orvis Edition Grand Cherokee models.<BR>
	Comfort and convenience features available on Grand Cherokee models include a valet key and lock system, a glove compartment lock, removable rear headrests, an upgraded AM/FM stereo cassette and an Infinity &quot;Gold&quot; power amplifier with eight speakers.  Also available are front bucket seats and 60/40 split rear bench seat, floor-mounted transmission controls, a security alarm system, automatic temperature control, power windows and locks and a night-vision safety interior rear view mirror.<BR>
	Grand Cherokee powertrain choices are impressive.  The standard Grand Cherokee power plant is a 4.0 liter, in-line six-cylinder fuel-injected high-output engine that produces a peak 190 horsepower and 225 pound feet of torque.<BR>
	As the first V8 offered in its class, Grand Cherokee's optional multi-point fuel-injected 5.2 liter engine has been improved for 1995 with a new camshaft.  The new V8 provides a peak 220 horsepower at 4,400 rpm and 300 pound feet of torque at just 3,200 rpm.  The torque boost improves off-line acceleration feel and helps to deliver the highest trailer towing capacity of any vehicle in its class when properly equipped.  <BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>The Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Wrangler sport-utility vehicles are designed to be tough and unstoppable on any terrain. Still, every Jeep owner and enthusiast is urged to have the highest respect for the environment.<BR>
	Chrysler Corporation's Jeep brand is committed to the demonstration of responsible four-wheeling in all of its advertising.<BR>
	&quot;Every ad we produce must meet the criteria we have established in concert with our Jeep Environmental Council,&quot; said Mary Meyers, Manager - Jeep Advertising.  &quot;The Council's primary objective is to ensure that Jeep stands for leadership in responsible four-wheeling.&quot;  <BR>
	The Jeep Marketing Environmental Council is made up of representatives from the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, &quot;Tread Lightly!&reg; &quot;, Jeep Jamboree USA, California Association of Four Wheel Drive Clubs, The United Four Wheel Drive Association and the Jeep and Eagle Division of Chrysler Corp.<BR>
	The Council was established in 1989 to provide guidance in the development of Jeep communications that portray an environmentally responsible image as it relates to four-wheel-drive activity.  <BR>

<P>( more ) <BR>
-2-<BR>

<P>	&quot;We realize that our position in communicating with outdoor enthusiasts includes taking a responsible position toward the preservation and use of our natural resources,&quot; Meyers said.   <BR>
	The council's mission statement is comprised of three objectives:<BR>
minimize the potential for creating Jeep advertising and merchandising that could depict vehicles being used improperly off-highway, provide guidelines for the development of environmentally responsible marketing and communications, and serve as an authoritative, credible review board. <BR>
	Chryslers commitment is endorsed by a Corporate policy which consists of environmental principles to guide its employees worldwide in an environmentally responsible manner, both in their daily activities and business practices.<BR>
	Chrysler is a leading corporate force in Tread Lightly!, an educational program designed to inform off-highway and other recreational vehicle users of their responsibilities to the environment.<BR>

FOR NEW CUSTOMER SALES AND SERVICE SURVEYS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  Chrysler Corporation and its three dealer councils, in cooperation with the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA), today announced the creation of new surveys to better track and assess customer satisfaction during the first 18 months of ownership.  <BR>
	&quot;In our ongoing effort to delight our customers, we invited our dealers to help us design surveys that would be both measurable and produce actionable feedback,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Chrysler Executive Vice President - Sales &amp; Marketing and General Manager - Minivan Operations.  &quot;The dealer input was invaluable.  It helped us to focus on measuring those things over which dealers have control, further enhancing the continuous improvement focus of our surveys.&quot;  <BR>
	NADA has endorsed the Chrysler program as part of the association's ten-year push for greater uniformity and realism in how manufacturers measure and assess customer satisfaction with dealership sales and service performance.  <BR>
	&quot;We applaud Chrysler for bringing in its dealers as partners in these key efforts to assess and improve customer satisfaction, &quot; said NADA President Bill Dodge.  <BR>

<P>	&quot;Dealers are committed to sales and service excellence.  As the new Chrysler surveys show, dealers can offer significant insight to manufacturers as part of their shared commitment to enhancing customer service,&quot; Dodge said. <BR>
 	The task force that designed the new surveys is composed of Chrysler staff, research specialists and representatives from the corporation's Chrysler-Plymouth, Dodge and Jeep&reg;/Eagle dealer councils. <BR>
	&quot;Being a full-fledged member of the team represents a huge step forward in our relationship with Chrysler,&quot; said Bill Golling III, President of Bill Golling Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., and Chairman of the Detroit Zone's Chrysler-Plymouth Dealer Council.  &quot;The new surveys will be valuable tools in running our business and customers will find them much more user friendly.&quot;  <BR>
	Also representing the dealers on the team were Rob Robbins, Owner of Crestwood Dodge, Inc., and Vice Chair of the National Dodge Dealer Council, and Joe Ricci, Owner of Joe Ricci Automotive and Past Chairman of National Jeep/Eagle Dealer Council.  <BR>
	&quot;The surveys will help us be even more responsive to our customers' needs,&quot; said Robert S. Clark, Manager - Customer Relations and Surveys.   &quot;Dealer involvement in the project added a fresh perspective and dovetailed with our Customer One training.  The front-line field experience from our three dealer council representatives was instrumental to the project's success.&quot;  <BR>

<P>		The SSI survey is mailed to customers within 5-10 days of purchasing a vehicle. The CSI survey tracks customers through 18 months of ownership.  All customers will receive one survey about every six months, either after the performance of warranty service or after six months if no warranty service has been performed.  <BR>
	Piloting of the new surveys begins this month with mailings to the customers of approximately 200 dealers selected to test the program during the fourth quarter.  Implementation throughout the Chrysler dealer network is targeted for 1995.  <BR>

<P><B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B><U>Trailer Boats</U> magazine named Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee &quot;1997 Tow Vehicle of the Year&quot; for the second consecutive year, an unprecedented occurrence in the 15-year history of the competition.  <BR>
	<P><U>Trailer Boats</U> nominates four to six vehicles in a specific class for its annual towing competition.   Vehicles with similar tow ratings are given a trailer/boat combination and tested in 10 towing categories and five non-towing categories.  The towing portion of the test included tongue weight, visibility, flatland towing, mountain towing, engine performance, transmission, launch ramp, fuel economy, ride/control and braking.  Included in the non-towing categories were price, performance/handling, fuel economy, comfort/layout, and significance for towing and around-town driving.<BR>
	<P>This year's &quot;Tow Vehicle of the Year&quot; competition included the Chevrolet Tahoe, Ford Expedition, Ford Explorer and Jeep Grand Cherokee.  <BR>
	<P>&quot;We were impressed with Jeep Grand Cherokee and how high it scored in all categories -- always scoring at or near the top.&quot; said Bob Kovacik, <U>Trailer Boats</U> Towing Editor.  &quot;Before we started &quot;Tow Vehicle of the Year&quot; tests, we always thought the larger vehicles would win.  However, we found that larger isn't always better and we were amazed by the towing capacity and performance of the Grand Cherokee.&quot;<BR>
	<P>&quot;Jeep vehicles are known for their legendary capability and towing capacity is a significant part of overall vehicle capability,&quot; according to Martin R. Levine - General Manager, Chrysler/Plymouth and Jeep/Eagle Divisions.  &quot;We are thrilled that <U>Trailer Boats</U> named Jeep Grand Cherokee &quot;1997 Tow Vehicle of the Year&quot; for real-life applications, and winning this honor two years straight is of even greater significance.&quot;<BR>
	<P> <U>Trailer Boats</U> magazine tested the Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo equipped with the 5.2-liter, V-8 engine with 2WD.  Last year, Jeep Grand Cherokee equipped with the 4.0-liter, I-6 engine was named <U>Trailer Boats</U> &quot;1996 Tow Vehicle of the Year.&quot;<BR>
	 <P>For 1997, Grand Cherokee is available in the Laredo, TSi, Limited and Orvis edition models.  Engine options include the standard 4.0-liter, 185 horsepower I-6 with maximum rated torque of 220 foot-pounds at just 2400 rpm, or an optional 5.2-liter, 220 horsepower V-8 with 300 foot-pounds of torque at 2800 rpm.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation has been awarded a U.S. Patent on its network Repository database design by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  Chrysler used the Reposition to manage its worldwide data network and associated computing resources.<BR>
	The Repository design is unique in that it allows the network manager to represent a logical network configuration as an arbitrarily complex arrangement of physical devices.  It also allows any-to-any relationships between physical devices and logical network entities.  The design can be implemented on any relational database management system, and enables the correlation of data between multiple network element management systems.<BR>
	The Repository serves as a source of data for many systems at Chrysler, including network trouble ticket tracking, network change requests, computer and software inventory, and financial reporting.  It allows automation of such tasks as billing verification, trouble ticket generation, and network configuration.  By providing a single place to store this information, it eliminates duplication and allows access corporation-wide to authorized users.<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>
(18494)<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>

<P>	Chrysler developed the Repository because there was no product on the market that provided a single source of information to support centralized network management by Chrysler's Telecommunications organization.<BR>

NEW SITE FOR CLEVELAND PARTS DISTRIBUTION CENTER</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  Chrysler Corporation's Mopar Parts Division announced today that it has initiated plans to relocate its Cleveland area parts distribution center to a new site in Streetsboro, Ohio.  The distribution center is currently located 15 miles away in Solon, Ohio.<BR>
	Pending various approvals -- including the company's request for local property tax abatement -- a final decision is expected in early August.  <BR>
	The distribution center will be a 340,000-square foot office and warehouse complex with 28-foot ceiling clearances and state-of-the-art material handling and order-picking equipment.  The project cost is estimated at nearly $20 million.<BR>
	&quot;We've completely outgrown our present facility in Solon with no expansion opportunities,&quot; said Richard Radkewich, Cleveland Parts Distribution Center Manager.  &quot;In addition, the combination of superior freeway access and a more efficient facility configuration will improve parts delivery to our dealers and enhance service to owners of Chrysler vehicles.&quot;<BR>
	<BR>

<P>(26895)	- more -<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>

<P>	The new distribution center in Streetsboro will be located on 30 acres in a 300-acre office and industrial park at the intersection of the Ohio Turnpike and State Highway 14.<BR>
	The entire workforce of 116 employees at the current site is expected to be transferred to the new Streetsboro location upon completion.  Construction is expected to begin in August, and conclude sometime later this winter.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>OURAY'S JEEP&reg; JAMBOREE, THE BREATH-TAKING ADVENTURE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Ouray, Colorado, known for its beautiful autumn colors, will host Chrysler Corporation's seventh annual Jeep&reg; Jamboree September 22-25.<BR>
	Mark Smith, Chrysler Corporation's Jeep and Eagle Division technical consultant and Jeep Jamboree Founder, named Ouray his favorite. &quot;I think it's the most beautiful Jamboree that goes to elevated heights to make the view notably memorable, especially with the bright fall colors sprouting now.<BR>
	&quot;At heights of 13,000 feet, you can see for miles.  This is something you can't imagine, you just have to see it for yourself -- Ouray County is like the Little Switzerland of America. Completely amazing,&quot; he added.<BR>
 	This Jamboree features Jeep vehicles -- Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Wrangler -- roughin' it over old miner's rocky mule trails, visiting the Uncompahgre National Forest with its waterfalls and vivid array of fall colors, traveling past Box Canyon Falls and abandoned mines, and eating at desolate ghost towns.<BR>
	Smith says the breath-taking adventure will take participants past silver and gold mines where the echoes of whistling tunes from miners and the<BR>

	- 2 -<BR>
sounds of picks and shovels hitting the ground, from a century past, are still vivid memories.<BR>
	One miner's trail Jeep sport-utility owners will travel is Imogene Pass, one of the highest trails in Colorado at 13,100 feet, known for its Camp Bird gold mine that produced over $26 million in the eighteen-hundreds.  Another miner's trail Jeep owners will travel is Engineer Pass leading to the elevated Animas Forks, one of the better looking ghost towns.<BR>
	While driving slowly past these western ghost towns, Ed Brust, General Manager of the Jeep and Eagle Division advises every driver to follow the Jeep Jamboree's &quot;Tread Lightly!&quot; program and show respect for nature by protecting the surroundings.<BR>
	&quot;When you venture beyond the paved road, it is important to remember your responsibilities to the environment,&quot; Brust said. &quot;At Jeep, our message is simple, use common sense and stay off unmarked trails.<BR>
	&quot;Jeep vehicles are legendary for doing things others cannot, and the real power of a legend is where it takes you.  It's a part of the Jeep mystique to be able to venture to some seldom seen, hard-to-reach place.&quot; <BR>
	Smith says this Western venture to the hard-to-reach Ouray offers Jeep enthusiasts a chance to experience the trails of the Old West and imagine the sights and sounds of the &quot;boomtown&quot; and settlers during the prosperous times, the hootin' and hollerin' at the saloons and the &quot;whistling-while-you-work&quot; songs in the dusty hallways of the old mines.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER, SUPPLIERS, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY TO RESEARCH HYBRIDS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B>  <BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced a four-year cooperative agreement valued at $84 million to develop hybrid propulsion systems for automobiles.<BR>
	&quot;Chrysler and the DOE are pooling their resources to develop advanced propulsion systems,&quot; said Francois J. Castaing, Executive Vice President of Vehicle Engineering.  &quot;By joining forces, we can develop the technology faster and at less cost.  This leverage will be strengthened by involving suppliers.  All of the resources represented in the agreement will flow to the automotive supply base.<BR>
	&quot;With this agreement, Chrysler expects to significantly advance its already substantial existing hybrid programs.  This effort will also complement work being done through similar DOE contracts with Ford and General Motors.<BR>
	This is Chrysler's first major cooperative agreement under the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV), a government-industry union to work on technologies which would make it possible for Chrysler, Ford and GM to build mid-sized cars that get up to 80 miles per gallon while maintaining the performance, utility and affordability of today's cars.<BR>
	DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary joined Castaing in announcing the agreement at Chrysler's Technology Center in Auburn Hills.<BR>
	&quot;Our goal is to create jobs while protecting the environment,&quot; said Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary.  &quot;this program demonstrates how economic development and job creation can go hand-in-hand with environmental quality.&quot;<BR>
	Hybrid propulsion systems convert energy from two sources of power.<BR>
	A variety of hybrid subsystem approaches will be studied, including direct-injection diesel engines, electric motors, flywheels, ultracapacitors, high- powered batteries, control electronics and others.  Hopefully, this will lead to selecting the preferred hybrid architecture that will be further developed for production.<BR>
	The PNGV program goals are:<BR>
	-	Improving the competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing:<BR>
	-	Incorporating technology when it becomes commercially viable;<BR>
	-	Developing a production prototype vehicle by 2004 capable of up to three times fuel efficiency, 0-60 mph in 12 seconds or less, carrying five to six passengers and a range of 380 miles -- all for no more cost than today's mid-sized sedans, adjusted for economics.<BR>
	&quot;Right now, the marketplace isn't demanding improved fuel efficiency,&quot; Castaing said.  &quot;Customer surveys tell us it's far down on the list of priorities.  So, customers won't pay more for these new technologies.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;Hitting the cost target is an absolute must, but it is a significant challenge.  A lot of technologies are going to have to mature and become cost competitive in a compressed timeframe for us to make these cars affordable.<BR>
	&quot;It's a noble experiment in a new, cooperative relationship between government and industry and it needs to run its course.<BR>
	All of Chrysler's research efforts are integrated into the overall vehicle creation process, Castaing explained.<BR>
	&quot;We will not do research for the sake of research,&quot; Castaing said.  &quot;The same core values and ideals that drive our product creation process will also drive our PNGV research projects -- quality, speed of execution, controlled costs, innovation and excitement.&quot;<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee offers a new level of sophistication in safety, comfort, handling and appearance for 1995 in a package that combines luxury with legendary Jeep off-highway performance and utility.<BR>
	Jeep Grand Cherokee is offered in Laredo, Limited and the new Orvis&reg; Edition.  The Laredo - and for the first time in 1995, the Grand Cherokee Limited -- are also offered in two-wheel drive in addition to four-wheel drive.  <BR>
	Grand Cherokee set the benchmark in occupant protection with its standard driver-side air bag, standard 4-wheel Anti-lock Brake System, and front and rear door beams for side impact protection.  It has enhanced its safety equipment for 1995 with the addition of standard four-wheel disc brakes.<BR>
	New improvements for 1995 also include larger all-terrain tires included in the Up Country suspension package, and an Orvis Edition model - a joint project with The Orvis Company -- the oldest continuously operating American supplier of upscale fly fishing tackle and outdoor sporting equipment in the United States.<BR>
	The new Orvis Edition includes the same luxury features of the Limited model in eye-catching Moss Green exterior paint.  The interior is Champagne leather with Dark Green and Roan Red accents on the seats and door panels.  The Up Country suspension package and Trailer Tow Prep is standard on all Grand Cherokee Orvis Edition  models.<BR>

<P>(08895) 	(more)<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	<BR>
	Because both Jeep and The Orvis Company share a grand outdoor heritage and an appeal among discriminating customers, Jeep has become &quot;the official vehicle of Orvis.&quot;<BR>
	Comfort and convenience features available on Grand Cherokee models include a valet key and lock system, a glove compartment lock, removable rear headrests, and an upgraded AM/FM stereo cassette. <BR>
	Also included are 60/40 split rear bench seat, power windows and locks, and  floor-mounted transmission controls.  A security alarm system, automatic temperature control,  night-vision safety interior rear view mirror , and an &quot;Infinity Gold&quot; power amplifier with eight speakers are available on the Limited Edition.<BR>
	Grand Cherokee powertrain choices are impressive.  The standard Grand Cherokee power plant is a 4.0-liter, in-line six-cylinder fuel-injected high-output engine that produces a peak 190 horsepower and 225 pound-feet of torque.<BR>
	The Grand Cherokee's optional V-8 -- the first available in its class -- offers a  multipoint fuel-injected 5.2-liter engine that has been improved for 1995 with a new camshaft.  The new V8 provides a peak 220 horsepower at 4,400 rpm and 300 pound-feet of torque at just 3,200 rpm.  This torque boost improves off-line acceleration feel and helps to deliver the highest trailer towing capacity of any vehicle in its class when properly equipped. <BR>
	To channel power where it's needed, Jeep Grand Cherokee offers a selection of three transfer-cases:<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Continuing its process-redesign efforts of creating efficiencies and consolidating suppliers, Chrysler Corporation announced today the single sourcing of its Yellow Pages advertising and has named the Detroit office of Bozell Worldwide Advertising as the agency of record for the business.<BR>
	In addition, the consolidation will lead to the formation of a single Yellow Pages company within Bozell, combining the planning, buying, and placement needs of all Chrysler brands including Dodge, Jeep&reg;, Eagle, Chrysler, Plymouth, Mopar Parts, Leasing and Rental, and Service.<BR>
	The Yellow Pages industry, one of the largest advertising businesses in the country, publishes over 5,920 books each year with an estimated $9.5 billion in annual billings.<BR>
	We view the change in operation as a long-term competitive advantage that will streamline efficiencies, maximize negotiating clout, and result in dollar savings, said A.C. Bud Liebler, Vice President, Marketing and Communications, Chrysler Corporation.<BR>
(41395)	- more -<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	The new organization will be a stand-alone subsidiary of Bozell, and will be headquartered in separate offices in the same building as Bozell Detroit.  The new division will report to Bozell Detroit President R. Kimberly Gaynor.  The unit will handle all TradeMark listings, Trade Name advertising and display advertising exclusively for Chrysler.<BR>
	Previously, Bozell handled Yellow Pages advertising for the Chrysler-Plymouth and Jeep-Eagle accounts, as well as Mopar Parts, and Service.  <BR>

       Boston, Ma -- </B>  Chrysler Corporation's Eagle brand continues to soar with &quot;Eagle Encounter,&quot; an outdoor lunchtime festival aimed at extending the complete brand image to its target audience -- young and energetic business professionals.<BR>
	The &quot;Eagle Encounter,&quot; one of the Eagle brand's many integrated marketing programs, will be held Thursday, Oct. 13 from 11:30 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. at Noel Park in Larimer Square, off the 16th Street Mall in Denver.  The event is designed to establish one-to-one consumer relationships.<BR>
	The Eagle Encounter lunchtime events feature interactive activities that exemplify the Eagle customer's lifestyle including comedy, jazz, cooking demonstrations, in-line skating, painting workshops and vehicle design exhibits.  The outdoor activities and exhibits expose Eagle to professionals during the lunchtime hours of their hectic workday.<BR>
	&quot;Potential buyers will not be told what to think of the vehicles, rather they will take part in a total experience which will help them identify with the brand,&quot; said Ed Brust, General Manager - Jeep&reg; and Eagle Division.  &quot;Marketing of vehicles is no longer a one-way street, rather it is a two-way philosophy which encourages dialogue, interaction and relationships with customers.&quot;<BR>
(42494)	(more)<BR>
- 2 -<BR>
	Moreover, the lunchtime Encounters extend the brand's Eagle &quot;Test Drive&quot; campaign to get customers unfamiliar with the brand turned on to Eagle.  Representatives equipped with cellular phones will be at the lunchtime sites to invite festival-goers to call 1-800-2 TEST EAGLE for product information and to schedule test drive appointments.<BR>
	&quot;From the beginning, Eagle has been successful in attracting youthful, upscale and well educated customers.  Now we need to build on this success and reach out to more of these independent and open-minded customers,&quot; said Brust.  &quot;By taking our image to the customer, Chrysler is making it easy and fun to be part of the Eagle experience.&quot; <BR>
	The first &quot;Eagle Encounter&quot;  was held in Boston Oct. 6 at Faneuil Hall.  A third is scheduled for Oct. 27 in Atlanta.<BR>
	&quot;This unique direct-to-consumer marketing event represents Chrysler Corporation's significant commitment to its newest brand and establishes new paths of communication with potential buyers,&quot; added Brust.<BR>
	The 1995 Eagle lineup includes the all-new Eagle Talon and refined versions of the Eagle Vision, Eagle Summit Sedan, Coupe and Wagon.  <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>June was the best retail sales month in Chrysler's history,&quot; Theodor R. Cunningham, Chrysler Executive Vice <BR>
President -- Sales and Marketing, proclaimed. <BR>
	&quot;Spurred by some timely incentive offers, consumers  rushed our dealerships -- setting no less than 19 all-time Chrysler records for total vehicles, total trucks, numerous car and truck models, and our Dodge and Jeep-Eagle Divisions.  But the best record of the bunch is our all-time high retail performance -- right on the heels of a retail record for the month of May, set just last month,&quot; Cunningham said.<BR>
	Total vehicle sales of 236,404 were 12 percent better than last June and surpassed Chrysler's previous all-time best of 230,386 cars and trucks, set in March 1994.  Corporate retail sales in June were 16 percent higher than last year, and topped 200,000 for the first time in the Company's history.  Retail sales for the Dodge Division topped 100,000 for the first time.  <BR>

	Car sales of 89,418 were 19 percent higher than last year, and the highest in nearly six years.  The total included all-time best performances from Dodge Neon and Stratus, Plymouth Neon and Chrysler Cirrus.  <BR>
		Combined Neon sales totaled 31,412 -- beating the old record of 24,468, set just last month.  Combined sales of Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus also set an all-time mark at 18,404.  It was a record June for combined sales of Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, and Chrysler Concorde, New Yorker and LHS, with a total of 25,883 units.<BR>
	Total truck sales increased eight percent over last year to 146,986, and beat the previous all-time best of 141,715, set in March 1994.  Total Minivan sales of 57,798 set a new June record, while Chrysler Town &amp; Country had its best month ever with sales of 4,851.<BR>
	Total Dodge truck sales of 73,990 included a best-ever performance by Dodge Ram, with sales of 23,268 -- the 19th consecutive monthly record for Ram.  <BR>
	Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee also turned in a best-ever sales performance of 29,307 units -- wiping out the old record of 27,805, set just last month, and leading both Jeep and the Jeep-Eagle Division to an all-time total sales record.  It was Jeep-Eagle's second consecutive 50,000-plus month. <BR>
	Dodge and Jeep-Eagle Divisions also set new records for the second quarter, on sales of 313,171 and 139,937 units, respectively.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>1997 DODGE DAKOTA WINS OFF-ROAD MAGAZINE'S<BR>
 &quot;TRUCK OF THE YEAR&quot; AWARD</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B>  <BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>The 1997 Dodge Dakota was awarded  Off-Road Magazine's &quot;Truck of The Year&quot; award, the publication announced today.  The all-new Dakota Club Cab 4X4 easily out-pointed several pickup and sport-utility competitors, according to the editorial staff at Off-Road, who evaluated the vehicles for the award. <BR>
	<P>&quot;Dakota strikes a rare compromise between styling and truck capability, which will prove to make it very popular for both work and play,&quot; said Steve Stillwell, Editorial Director for Off-Road.  &quot;Instead of trying to be completely different from Ram in styling, Dodge realized the customer appeal of Ram and put it into a more compact package.  This is a huge plus.&quot;<BR>
	<P>All-new or substantially re-done pickups and sport-utility vehicles were eligible for the award, voted on by the magazine's editorial staff after on- and off-road evaluations.  Included in the judging were, among others, Ford Expedition  and F-250 pickup, Land Rover Defender and Toyota 4Runner.<BR>

<P>	<P>In their review of Dakota, Off-Road Editor Brent Ross wrote, &quot;To our eye, and for our market, the '97 Dakota is the most innovative, will have the greatest impact on shaping future trucks, will prove enormously popular in both stock and modified form, and delivers stellar all-around performance at a reachable retail price.&quot;<BR>
	<P>&quot;We're very proud of this recognition,&quot; said Dodge General Manager Ray Fisher.  &quot;We realize the responsibility Off-Road has in making sure they've picked a truck that can handle the rigors of off-road driving, as well as general commuting, given the knowledgeable readership of this magazine.<BR>
	<P>&quot;We knew we had a hit on our hands when the first Dakota came off the line and it's great to see that Off-Road feels the same way.&quot;<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Dodge Division and the Skip Barber Group announced today the formation of a long-term partnership that will make Dodge the official car and engine supplier for all Skip Barber teaching and racing operations.  Included in the agreement are the Dodge/Skip Barber Driving School, the Skip Barber Racing School, the Skip Barber Formula Dodge Race Series and the SCCA- and FIA-sanctioned Barber Dodge Pro Series.  Dodge will also be the official car and truck of the Lime Rock Park race track in Northwest Connecticut.  The agreement runs through 2001.<BR>
	Dodge will supply all vehicles for all Skip Barber operations, which include racing and driving schools at more than 20 locations across the country, as well as provide engines for the Racing School, the Formula Dodge Race Series and the Barber Dodge Pro Series. <BR>
	&quot;This is a truly momentous agreement for Dodge,&quot; said Marty Levine, Dodge General Manager. &quot;This agreement signifies how far Dodge has come as a brand.  We believe we're the best choice to provide not only the breadth of vehicles and engines, but the performance image that is essential to be associated with an organization like Skip Barber.&quot;<BR>

<P>	This year is the 20th anniversary for the Skip Barber Racing School, the world's largest.

Notable graduates include racing stars Michael, John and Jeff Andretti, Jeff Gordon and rising star Bryan Herta, as well as celebrities Tom Cruise, Paul Newman, Al Pacino, Victoria Principal and Jerry Seinfeld.  <BR>
	&quot;Dodge is a natural fit for our school activities and racing operations,&quot; said Skip Barber, president and CEO of the Skip Barber Group.  &quot;The range of products Dodge offers, from the front-wheel drive Stratus to the rear-wheel drive Viper to the all-wheel drive Stealth, allows instructors in the Dodge/Skip Barber Driving School to demonstrate all the different driving scenarios necessary to completely educate a student.<BR>
	&quot;For our Racing School and Formula Dodge Race Series, these sophisticated Dodge motors will not only give us more horsepower, but tremendous reliability, as well.&quot;  <BR>
	The Dodge/Skip Barber Driving School will utilize production Dodge passenger cars, while the Skip Barber Racing School will put students through their paces in Formula Dodge open-wheel race cars.  All Racing School and Race Series cars will be powered by stock, virtually unmodified 2.0-liter Dodge engines. <BR>

       Los Angeles, Ca -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today unveiled its newest Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV), and announced it is the first major manufacturer to receive Inherently Low Emission Vehicle (ILEV) certification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for four of its compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles.<BR>
	At a press conference at the Eco-Expo environmental exhibition at the Los Angeles Convention Center, Chrysler officials rolled out the all-new Dodge Caravan CNG, and announced the EPA ILEV designation for its CNG pickups and vans.<BR>
	&quot;The introduction of the new Dodge Caravan CNG continues a three-year string of introducing new alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and will insure that Chrysler continues its AFV sales leadership,&quot; said Reg Modlin, manager of Chrysler's Environmental and Energy Planning.  &quot;Being the first major manufacturer to receive ILEV certification for our other CNG vehicles also solidifies Chrysler's commitment to bringing meaningful alternative fuel vehicles to market.&quot;<BR>
	The new ULEV Dodge Caravan CNG will be available as a late 1996 model year vehicle and is the company's sixth major alternative fuel vehicle introduction in three years.   In 1994, Chrysler was the nation's leading seller of AFVs with sales of about 6,000 total units; approximately 1,500 were CNG vehicles. <BR>
	The ULEV standard is the most stringent and difficult to achieve short of the Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) -- or electric vehicle -- standard mandated in California.  ILEV is certification for a vehicle under federal -- not California -- schedules that requires only trace tailpipe emissions plus no evaporative emissions. <BR>

<P>	With the ILEV designation for its CNG vehicles, Chrysler is the <B>world's first </B>company to be certified in most of the stringent low emission categories as outlined by Federal and California law.  <BR>
	Last year, the current Chrysler CNG minivan was certified as the first ULEV; in 1993 the Chrysler TEVan was certified as the first Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV); and in 1992, the full-size Dodge Ram Van CNG was certified as the first Low Emission Vehicle (LEV).<BR>
	Chrysler's Dodge Ram Van CNG, Dakota CNG, and Ram Pickup CNG are also expected to be certified at the ULEV level for 1996.  Chrysler's 3.3-liter V-6 engine will power the minivan and the 5.2-liter V-8 will power the full-size van and the pickup trucks.<BR>
	&quot;While most manufacturers are planning small four-cylinder gasoline-powered ULEVs and ILEVs for the turn of the decade, large displacement engines are a much more difficult proposition,&quot; Modlin said.  &quot;Using CNG may be the most technically feasible and cost effective way of providing larger displacement engines at the ULEV level.<BR>
	&quot;Initially, the lack of widespread development of sufficient CNG fueling infrastructure and limited range due to the fuel storage constraints make CNGs most appropriate for fleet applications,&quot; Modlin added.<BR>
 	The CNG minivan stores the natural gas in five main tanks strapped to the underside of the minivan body providing the equivalent of about 10 gallons of  gasoline.  The energy density of natural gas is less than that of gasoline so fuel storage constraints mean range is limited to about 180-220 miles, depending on driving conditions and habits.<BR>
	Vehicles operating on natural gas produce less carbon monoxide (CO) and non-methane hydrocarbon emissions than comparable gasoline-powered vehicles.  Nitrogen oxide emissions are controlled by a special three-way catalyst.  <BR>

       Cleveland, Oh -- </B> When you see the Dodge Neon on the highway, you think of a sporty fun-to-drive car with lots of personality.   But bolt in a roll cage and six-point racing harness and instantly that personality changes to a fast and nimble racing car.  Toss in a few Hollywood celebrities and local personalities and you have an exciting, energetic race car series.  That's exactly what you will get at the Dodge Neon Challenge.<BR>
	Last month's Dodge Neon Challenge in Detroit, a part of the ITT Automotive Detroit Grand Prix weekend, was not only an exciting race for the spectators but it was a very competitive race for the drivers.<BR>
	Sean Patrick Flanery, star of the ABC series &quot;The Chronicles of the Young Indiana Jones,&quot; successfully defended his title for a second year.  In second place was Csaba Csere, editor-in-chief of <I>Car and Driver</I> magazine, who came in less than one car length behind Flanery.<BR>
(29295-S) 	-more-<BR>
	-2-<BR>
	&quot;This year had a bunch of fast people in the line-up,&quot; said Flanery, who had to work for his victory.  Csere passed him in the first lap and Flanery finally regained the lead in the next-to-last lap.  &quot;It was close.  It was exciting every lap.  I never looked in my rearview mirror and saw a whole car, it was a windshield.&quot;<BR>
	Perry King from FOX-TV's &quot;Melrose Place&quot; agreed, &quot;This is the most competitive celebrity race I've ever seen.  We have so many good drivers.&quot;   King finished fifth behind Tony Swan, auto writer for the <I>Detroit Free Press</I>, and Alfonso Ribeiro, Carlton of NBC's &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel Air,&quot; who finished third and fourth, respectively.  The top five drivers battled it out in both the practice and qualifying sessions as well as the race.<BR>
	The racers not only had fun in the race but were impressed by how well the car handled.  Even those who never sat behind the wheel of a race car could handle the Dodge Neon at speed on the difficult road circuit.<BR>
	Ribeiro said, &quot;I love it.  It handles really well.  You can do anything you want to it and it responds.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;It's the most neutral handling front-wheel drive car I've ever driven in my life.  I'm thinking about buying one and racing it.  It's a great car,&quot; adds Flanery.<BR>
	All of the drivers attend training at the Skip Barber Driving School prior to the event.  Dodge supplies all vehicles to the Skip Barber Driving and Racing Series.<BR>

<P>-more-<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>
	The real winner of the Dodge Neon Challenge is the March of Dimes.  Chrysler will donate $10,000 to the Campaign for Healthier Babies at each of the three races this year. <BR>
		The 4-door Dodge Neon ACR (American Club Racer package), equipped with a SOHC 2.0 liter 132 horsepower engine, was the star in last year's celebrity series.  It also achieved instant success on the club racing circuit as 170 amateur racers competed around the country in road racing and autocross events.<BR>
	New for 1995 is the even sportier version of the car, the Neon ACR Coupe, which has sold over 1,500 units this year.  With a DOHC 2.0 liter 150 horsepower engine, the Neon Coupe is this year's celebrity challenge car.  Look for even more excitement and rave reviews from Hollywood.<BR>

AWARD FOR TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION</B></PRTitle><BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Epcot Center, Fl -- </B>DISCOVER magazine named Chrysler Corporation's Patriot hybrid-electric race car the winner of its Automotive &amp; Transportation Technological Innovation Award at a ceremony held here today.<BR>
          The DISCOVER Awards recognize breakthrough technologies and<BR>
honor the men and women whose creative genius improves the quality of everyday life. Winners were selected from a group of 35 finalists by a distinguished panel of judges in seven categories--automotive &amp; transportation, aviation &amp; aerospace, computer hardware &amp; electronics, computer software, environment, sight, and sound.<BR>
          The Chrysler Patriot is Chrysler's &quot;laboratory on wheels&quot; for development of advanced hybrid-electric powertrains which could play a significant role in future  vehicles. Patriot is a pure research vehicle that could one day demonstrate its advanced technology on the race track. It utilizes a liquified natural gas turbine with turbo-alternators, and an electro-mechanical battery (flywheel) developed by SatCon Technologies Corporation, which was named co-recipient of the award.<BR>

<P>                                                        (2)<BR>

<P> Much of this technology was transferred from defense and aerospace applications.<BR>
      Chrysler initiated the program in 1993. The automaker has a special team of engineers and scientists that is managing the program and is developing the car's powertrain controller and some of its fueling system. <BR>
      Patriot's hybrid powertrain will be capable of delivering 500 horsepower, enabling the car to reach speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour.<BR>
       &quot;As Chrysler's Patriot Team and our contractors continue to explore hybrid technologies, we are honored and excited by this Award from Discover,&quot; said Francois J. Castaing, Chrysler's Vice-President of Vehicle Engineering and General Manager--Powertrain Operations. &quot;We have made good, steady progress in developing the very complex hybrid powertrain in the past 12 months, and we look forward to 'track testing' the car in the months ahead.&quot;       <BR>
       Research from the Patriot program will fuel the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV), which is a partnership between the federal government's National Laboratories and the Big Three automakers to develop a vehicle with up to three times the fuel efficiency of today's vehicles, in a cost-effective package.<BR>

<B> </B>  <BR>

<P><B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B><U>Four Wheeler</U> magazine today named the 1997 Jeep&reg; Cherokee &quot;Four Wheeler of the Year,&quot; marking the second consecutive year a Jeep vehicle has won this prestigious award from America's oldest four-wheel-drive enthusiasts magazine and the fifth time overall since the award program began in 1974.<BR>
	<P>&quot;Being named <U>Four Wheeler</U> magazine's &quot;Four Wheeler of the Year&quot; is spectacular news to all of us at Jeep,&quot; said Martin R. Levine, General Manager - Chrysler/Plymouth and Jeep/Eagle.  &quot;This award highlights the all-new interior, new features, classic design and value of Jeep Cherokee, while drawing attention to the authentic Jeep capability.&quot;  <BR>
	<P>This year's &quot;Four Wheeler of the Year&quot; competition included:  Chevy Blazer ZR2, Ford Explorer, Ford Expedition, Jeep Wrangler, Lexus LX450 and Toyota 4Runner.   <BR>
	<P>According to John Stewart, <U>Four Wheeler's</U> editor, &quot;It was a tough competition this year, but our <U>Four Wheeler</U> team thought Jeep Cherokee was the best all-around vehicle with its outstanding performance, off-highway capability and classic styling.  The solid front axle and traditional design all packaged at the right price made Jeep Cherokee stand out in the crowd.&quot; <BR>
	<P><U>Four Wheeler</U> rates four-wheel-drive vehicles in five performance categories and in nine empirical tests.  Subjective performance judging includes mechanical operation, on-road ride and handling, off-highway performance, interior design and function, and exterior appearance.  Emperical ratings include fuel economy, interior noise, braking, acceleration, cargo capacity, ground clearance, and suspension travel.<BR>
	<P>A four-wheel-drive vehicle must be new or significantly revised for the model year to be eligible for the annual <U>Four Wheeler</U> competition.  For 1997, Jeep Cherokee has an all-new interior, and its first exterior refinement since it debuted as the first four-door compact sport-utility vehicle in the 1984 model year, as well as significant improvements to fit-and-finish and overall body integrity.<BR>
	<P>The most visually evident change in Cherokee is the &quot;modular&quot; instrument panel which includes a new heating, ventilation and cooling system; accessory and radio controls; an available combined cassette/CD with premium speakers; and twenty amp power outlet and cigar lighter.  Jeep Cherokee retains its classic exterior with an overall rounder appearance at the front and rear with new grille, fascias, bodyside moldings and wheels. <BR>
	<P>Jeep Cherokee first won &quot;Four Wheeler of the Year&quot; in the 1984 model year when it was originally introduced.  Similarly, the Jeep Grand Cherokee was &quot;Four Wheeler of the Year&quot; when introduced in 1993, and again in 1996 when it was virtually redone.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation today officially announced its latest step into the information age with its debut of a corporate home page on the World Wide Web.  <BR>
	Visitors to the company's corporate site are invited to take an on-line tour of several areas within the Chrysler Technology Center (CTC) and have the opportunity to explore and interact with the day-to-day goings-on inside Chrysler Corporation.  The home page, developed cooperatively between Bozell Worldwide and Poppe Tyson, gives users the option to visit five different areas in CTC, including Technology, Environment, Library, Executive Offices and Showroom, which will include individual sites for each of Chrysler's brands.  Inside each area pictures, video and text guide the user.  The Chrysler Corporate address is <I>http://www.chryslercorp.com.</I><BR>
	Chrysler and Plymouth brand sites are currently ready for visitors.  Plymouth can be reached at <I>http://www.rossroy.com/plymouth.htm</I>.  The Chrysler brand's address is <I>http://www.rossroy.com/chrysler.htm</I>.  Jeep&reg;, Eagle and Dodge home pages will be open by the end of June.<BR>

	&quot;Chrysler Corporation is on the cutting edge of technology, so it is only natural for us to explore the Internet, but this is also a technology that we believe will sell cars today, not 10 years from now,&quot; said Jim Julow, Chrysler Corporation's Director of Marketing Operations.   &quot;The corporate home page is an essential addition to our current activity in other interactive areas, including on-line services and interactive television test sites.  But this is work-in-progress, we will continue to add and modify our site to encourage repeat visits.&quot;<BR>
	Visitors to the Executive Offices area of Chrysler's home page will find a video greeting from Chrysler Corporation Chairman Robert Eaton as well as a brief overview on the company's vision for the future.  The  Technology area contains information on the company's latest concept cars and its five testing centers actually located at CTC.  Environment touches on Chrysler's alternative fuel, recycling and conservation programs.  The library offers a chronological look at the company's history, a summary of its education programs and articles from an on-line version of the <I>Chrysler Times</I> -- the Corporation's weekly employee newspaper.  The Showroom will provide information on the individual car lines and will link the Corporate home page to the Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge, Jeep and Eagle sites.<BR>
	Besides reaching Chrysler's home page through its Web site address, surfers can access the Chrysler site through special links with independent on-line publications such as <I>HotWired</I>, Time Warner's <I>Pathfinder</I> or the soon to be announced brand home pages.  Visitors to any of these sites can access Chrysler's home page with a simple click of the mouse.<BR>

	&quot;We are branching out from traditional media and investigating alternative ways to reach current and prospective consumers, and the Web fits that description,&quot; said Christine MacKenzie, Chrysler Corporation's Manager, Corporate Advertising.  &quot;With a growing number of consumers tapping into the Web, our home page will allow more people to be exposed to detailed information on Chrysler and its products in a way that is most familiar and comfortable.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler also has teamed up with Internet Profiles Corporation (I/PRO) to monitor cyberspace traffic on its site.  I/PRO can report how many visitors a home page has and what they visit in the site.<BR>
	&quot;There is a clear need for measuring advertising effectiveness, interactive included, &quot; said Julow.  &quot;Because we know the profile of the new car buyer is that of those currently 'surfing the Net', I/PRO will assist us in determining our reach to these important audiences.  We are aiming to reach consumers with the technology they are accustomed to using.&quot;<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Boston -- </B>For Richard Drorbaugh, the Junior Chamber International (Jaycees) World Ride Against Cancer is coming to an end.  But the ride has just begun for his ongoing fundraising efforts and Chrysler Corporation's involvement with the Jaycees nationwide.<BR>
	The long-distance bicyclist concludes his amazing 11 and 1/2 month, six-continent, 32-country trek to benefit cancer research and awareness, at the Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park in Boston, at 10:30 a.m., on Saturday, May 28.  Chrysler-Plymouth, a division of Chrysler Corporation, donated the use of a Plymouth Voyager minivan and Plymouth Neon small car for use by the team during the U.S. portion of the tour.<BR>
	&quot;The Neon has been instrumental in advancing our routes and accommodations, but perhaps most appreciated for transporting our equipment and supplies,&quot; said Drorbaugh.  &quot;We're very thankful to Chrysler-Plymouth for use of the Neon and the Voyager.  It meant not having to navigate with 50 pounds of equipment strapped to our bicycles, as was the case in other countries.&quot;<BR>
	Drorbaugh, 31, who has witnessed three members of his family die of cancer, founded World Ride Against Cancer.  He is a member of the Massachusetts Jaycees and was instrumental in securing international Jaycees support.<BR>
(19094)	- more -<BR>
-2-<BR>
	Fundraising efforts will benefit the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Jimmy Fund, a teaching affiliate of Harvard Medical School.  To date, Drorbaugh and fellow cyclists Jeffrey Ebert and Peter McIntyre have raised more than $20,000.  But Drorbaugh will continue to receive donations until at least September.<BR>
	People who want to contribute to the World Ride Against Cancer can mail a check to: Jaycees World Ride Against Cancer, care of American Automobile Association, 175 Highland Ave., Needham Heights, Mass., 02194.<BR>
	Chrysler Corporation has been heavily involved with the Jaycees across the country.  Currently, Chrysler is implementing a Neon test drive program that will mean cash donations for nearly 300 chapters across the country.<BR>
	It is anticipated that Jaycees nationwide will earn $75,000 through program participation.<BR>
	In addition, Chrysler worked with the Austin, Texas chapter of the Jaycees when it launched the Neon to the media there in January, to provide members of the media a history of the area and transportation while in town.<BR>

IS FIRST OF ITS KIND IN NORTH AMERICA</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Chelsea, Mi -- </B>Chrysler Corporation is building North America's first fully automated durability road to substantially reduce development time and to increase the rigors of testing... while at the same time decreasing the toll it takes on drivers.<BR>
	The Automated Durability Road is under construction at the Chrysler Proving Grounds in Chelsea, Mich. It is expected to be fully operational in mid-summer 1995.<BR>
	The facility will provide Chrysler with a number of advantages to its current body and chassis development testing. With the human being removed from the situation, the road and, therefore, the testing, will be more rigorous than any at Chrysler test facilities.<BR>
	&quot;The way we do body and chassis testing today is so harsh that it is endurance testing for the driver as well as the vehicle,&quot; said Sue Cischke, Executive Engineer -- Chrysler Proving Grounds and Durability Testing.<BR>

<P>
<P>(more)<BR>

<P>(21694-S)<BR>
-2-<BR>
	The stress on the human body means drivers are limited to how much time they can spend behind the wheel.  The current accelerated test for body and chassis development work (simulating 100,000 miles of ordinary customer usage) takes approximately six weeks. The Automated Durability Road will reduce testing time to less than two weeks.  <BR>
	In addition to time and human factors, the new facility will help assure that future Chrysler cars and trucks are developed and built to high standards, said Cischke.<BR>
	The three-lane, 1.3-mile oval track is designed to accommodate 20 vehicles at a time.  The primary testing lane will be made up of blocks of Wisconsin granite set at varying heights in concrete to simulate an extremely rough road. <BR>
	An outside lane is a pull-off lane. A third lane, pocked with deep chuckholes, allows for even more rigorous testing of trucks than currently is available. Vehicles receive instructions and send their signals from a guide wire planted in concrete in the center of each lane. <BR>
	Audio frequencies control the vehicle guidance system, while high radio frequencies emitted from six transceivers around the track handle the monitoring system.<BR>
	Quality and repeatability of testing will increase with the Automated Durability Road, said Cischke.  Data within the vehicle will be accumulated and transmitted directly to a computer through telemetry. <BR>
	<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>
	-3-<BR>
	In addition, each vehicle will know its location and its proximity to the other vehicles on the track. Vehicles will automatically turn into the service area and fueling stations. The vehicles will have built-in safety features. Although vehicles can travel in either direction, they will programmed to automatically recognize and stop when people are nearby.<BR>
	The vehicle will monitor engine rpms, shock and coolant temperatures, oil pressure, the electrical system and the vehicle speed, which can be changed during testing.  The Chelsea system will use speeds below 30 mph in the rough surfaces while speeds in the outside (smooth) lane will reach 55 mph.<BR>
	In addition to the track itself, construction also includes two support buildings. One will house fueling stations and service bays to inspect the vehicles during and after testing, plus an area to install computer equipment into test vehicles. A second facility will be used to cool shocks during summer months.<BR>
	The Automated Durability Road represents a $9 million investment by Chrysler. It is one of numerous improvements made to the Chrysler Proving Grounds during its 40-year history.<BR>

	&quot;PLYMOUTH PLACE&quot; INTERACTIVE SHOPPING AREAS EXPANDING TO<BR>
 FIVE MORE U.S. MARKETS INCLUDING WASHINGTON/BALTIMORE</B></PRTitle><BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Washington D.C. -- </B> Based on successful test market<BR>

<P>results in Milwaukee and Portland, Oregon, Plymouth Division of Chrysler Corporation has expanded its &quot;Plymouth Place&quot; interactive shopping areas to five more cities, including the Washington D.C. and Baltimore areas.<BR>
		&quot;Test market results from our first Plymouth Place stores show a substantial, sustained increase in sales and awareness of the Plymouth brand,&quot; said Plymouth National Marketing Plans Manager Steve Bruyn, as Chrysler demonstrated one of its newest stores at the Montgomery Mall in Washington D.C.  &quot;We are confident that the expansion of Plymouth Place to more markets will have the same result and allow us to win back a significant share of the economy car market.&quot;<BR>
	Plymouth Place is an ideal first step in the shopping process, when people are &quot;just looking.&quot; No salespeople are on site. Instead, there are product advisers who can answer questions and refer interested customers to a Chrysler-Plymouth dealer in the area.<BR>

<P>
<P>(33995-A)	(more)<BR>
	-2-<BR>
	The first Plymouth Place in-mall shopping stores were opened earlier this year in Portland and Milwaukee to raise awareness of the Plymouth brand among consumers, many of whom are buying a new vehicle for the first time.  Plymouth Place locations in Washington/Baltimore, as well as St. Louis, Dallas and San  Diego started operations within the last two weeks.<BR>
	The main feature of Plymouth Place is an interactive kiosk called the `Tech Cart.'  The futuristic computer has a touch-activated system which lets users select vehicle options, check pricing and view running footage of the Plymouth Neon and Voyager minivan. Users can get a printout of their chosen vehicle to take to a dealership for ordering.<BR>
	Specifically, Plymouth's retail sales jumped 78 percent in the Milwaukee area and 58 percent in the Portland area in the first four months of Plymouth Place operations in those areas. That compares with a national increase of 42 percent in the same period.<BR>
	 Moreover, almost 44,000 consumers visited Plymouth Place in Milwaukee between February 1 and May 31, with about 7,200 obtaining a Tech Cart printout. In Portland, more than 22,700 people visited Plymouth Place. Of those, about 7,000 obtained Tech Cart printouts.<BR>
	The number of printouts is significant. &quot;This is a process that can take more than 15 minutes,&quot; said Bruyn. &quot;That means customers are showing more than idle curiosity when they come to Plymouth Place.&quot;<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>

<P>
<P>-3-<BR>
		Plymouth Place not only provides a glimpse at the future of car shopping, but also shows the future of Plymouth.<BR>
	 &quot;We are answering the needs and wants of many younger buyers who have grown up with computers and are used to relying on new technology to get information,&quot; said Bruyn. &quot;Plymouth Place is the ideal spot to meld this technology with the car shopping process.&quot;<BR>
	Plymouth has been undergoing a complete revitalization, as Chrysler repositions the brand to meet the needs and desires of younger buyers -- especially women -- seeking a high blend of style, value and versatility. With the Neon subcompact coupe and sedan and the redesigned Voyager/Grand Voyager minivans already in the line, Plymouth will soon introduce the Breeze, a compact sedan based on the successful Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>RECORD MONTH FROM MIDSIZE SEDANS PACE BEST AUGUST<BR>
IN FIVE YEARS FOR CHRYSLER</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Bolstered by record August sales from its Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid and Eagle Vision sedans, Chrysler Corporation posted its best August (total &amp; retail) in five years on sales of 163,858 units.  This represents a five percent increase over last year, with total retail sales (149,445) up three percent.  <BR>
	Total truck sales (102,904) rose eight percent from a year ago, led by August individual records from Dodge's Ram (19,989) and Dakota (10,685) pickups and the entire minivan line.  Overall minivan sales of 36,171 units beat last year's record of 35,704.<BR>
		The record months from Concorde (5,402), Intrepid (10,422) and Vision (2,186) helped Chrysler Corporation post a four percent increase in car sales from last month on sales of  60,954 units.  Total car sales were unchanged from August of a year ago.<BR>
	&quot;Like a great football team, our depth is one of the keys to our success.   This month, record sales from our midsize sedans shows the overall strength of our team,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Chrysler Executive Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing and General Manager - Minivan Operations.  <BR>
<B>(38994)	-more-</B><BR>

<P><B>-2-</B><BR>

<P>	&quot;With all the great products we've been introducing over the past couple of years, sometimes it's easy to lose track of the products that signaled the Corporation's turnaround: Chrysler Concorde, Dodge Intrepid and Eagle Vision.  But this is living proof that America certainly knows about them.&quot; <BR>
	Sales of the Dodge and Plymouth Neon continue to be strong.  Total sales for Neon were 19,883 in August.  <BR>
		In addition to a record from the Eagle Vision, Eagle Talon had its best August ever on sales of 2,864 units, topping the 1991 record of 2,755.  Jeep&reg;-Eagle Division kicked off a major advertising and marketing campaign at the end of August to expose more Americans to the Eagle brand.<BR>
	With one month remaining in the model year, Chrysler continues to build on already established model year records for total truck sales: 1,256,355 in 1994 versus 1,190,746 in 1988, up 14 percent; Dodge Truck sales: 625,388 in 1994 against 573,713 in 1993, up 18 percent; and Jeep sales: 394,614 in 1994  versus 380,191 in 1993, up 15 percent.<BR>

MICHIGAN DNR, STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL<BR>
AND CHRYSLER CORPORATION REACH UNIQUE AGREEMENT		</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>The State of Michigan and Chrysler Corporation have reached a precedent-setting agreement that will allow for an expeditious clean-up and re-use of some 285 acres of industrial property currently owned by Chrysler in the cities of Detroit, Highland Park and Trenton.<BR>
	Working as a team, representatives from the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the Office of the Attorney General and Chrysler, reached an agreement in the form of a consent decree that defines clean-up criteria for ten parcels of land at the former Jefferson South site in Detroit, Chrysler Center in Highland Park and the former Trenton Chemical facility.<BR>
	The agreement also gives Chrysler and future owners of the properties assurances that environmental issues -- once resolved to current regulatory standards -- will not become a future liability.<BR>
	&quot;We feel very positive about this agreement,&quot; said Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton, &quot;everyone -- the public, the municipalities, the State, future users of this property and Chrysler, came away winners.<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>
(48694)	<BR>
	- 2 - <BR>

<P>	&quot;Our top priority is to return surplus urban properties to a use that will benefit the community,&quot; Eaton said.  &quot;Often, environmental concerns complicate their marketability and redevelopment potential.  This agreement clearly defines the clean-up criteria and assures that once completed, the clean-up is a final solution.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;Ths agreement further demonstrates the effectiveness and determination of the Department of Natural Resources to be a national leader in the revitalization of our urban environment,&quot; said Roland Harmes, Director, Michigan Department of Natural Resources.  &quot;We are committed to ensuring that industrial properties can be reused to promote a healthier social, economic and natural environment for the citizens of our state.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler will voluntarily clean-up the property under the consent decree with the State.  Potential future owners may also receive a covenant not to sue and other protection from the state relating to liability for historical environmental conditions.<BR>
	&quot;Hopefully,&quot; Eaton added, &quot;this agreement will encourage additional voluntary clean-ups by owners of other surplus urban properties in the state.&quot;<BR>
	The clean-up -- based on work plans developed with the MDNR -- has already begun at some of the parcels.  Efforts at other parcels will begin in a timely fashion to allow redevelopment as soon as possible.<BR>

	 &quot;PLYMOUTH PLACE&quot; INTERACTIVE SHOPPING AREAS EXPAND<BR>
 TO FIVE MORE U.S. MARKETS INCLUDING DALLAS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Dallas -- </B>- Based on successful test market results in Milwaukee and Portland, Oregon, the Plymouth Division of Chrysler Corporation has expanded its &quot;Plymouth Place&quot; interactive shopping areas to five more cities including three Dallas-area shopping malls.<BR>
		&quot;Test market results from our first Plymouth Place stores show not only a substantial, but a sustained increase in sales and awareness of the Plymouth brand,&quot; said Plymouth National Marketing Plans Manager Steve Bruyn. &quot;We are confident that the expansion of Plymouth Place to several more markets will have the same results and help us win back a significant share of the economy car market.&quot;<BR>
	Plymouth Place is an ideal first step in the shopping process, when people are &quot;just looking,&quot; and may be wary of sales pressure. Each mall site has product advisers who are knowledgeable about the Plymouth product line and can refer interested customers to a Chrysler-Plymouth dealer in the area.<BR>
	<BR>

<P>
<P>(35695)	-<B>more-</B><BR>

<P><B>-2-</B><BR>
	The main feature of Plymouth Place is an interactive computer called the `Tech Cart.'  It has a touch-activated system which lets users choose vehicle options, check pricing and even compare specifications to the competition. Users can also get a detailed printout of their chosen vehicle to take to an area dealership for ordering.<BR>
	The success of Plymouth Place in the early and very diverse Milwaukee and Portland test markets is evident. Plymouth's retail sales jumped 78 percent in the Milwaukee area and 58 percent in the Portland area in the first four months of Plymouth Place operations in those areas. That compares with a national increase of 42 percent in the same period.<BR>
	 Moreover, about 65,000 consumers visited Plymouth Place in Milwaukee between February 1 and July 31, while more than 35,000 people visited Plymouth Place in Portland. Of those, more than 20,000 obtained Tech Cart printouts.<BR>
	The number of printouts is significant, because accessing the full range of the Plymouth Place Tech Cart's information can take more than 15 minutes. &quot;That means customers are showing more than idle curiosity when they come to Plymouth Place,&quot; said Bruyn.<BR>
	Plymouth Place is not only provides a glimpse at the future of car shopping, but also shows the future of Plymouth.<BR>

	&quot;We are answering the needs and wants of many younger buyers who have grown up with computers and are now used to relying on new technology to get information,&quot; said Bruyn. &quot;Plymouth Place is the ideal spot to meld this technology with the car shopping process.&quot;<BR>
         The first Plymouth Place in-mall shopping stores were opened earlier this year in Portland and Milwaukee to raise awareness of the Plymouth brand among consumers, many of whom are buying a new vehicle for the first time.  Plymouth Place locations in St. Louis, as well as the Washington/Baltimore area and San  Diego started operations within the last four weeks.<BR>
	Plymouth has been undergoing a complete revitalization as Chrysler repositions the brand to meet the needs and desires of younger buyers -- especially women -- seeking a high blend of style, value and versatility. With the Neon subcompact coupe and sedan and the redesigned Voyager/Grand Voyager minivans already in the line, Plymouth will soon introduce the Breeze, a compact sedan based on the successful Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus.<BR>
<B>	</B>The three Plymouth Place locations in the Dallas area include: Prestonwood Town Center, North East Mall and Irving Mall.<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation, which set a volume sales record for the 1996 model year, also established U.S. market share records for total truck sales and for its Dodge and Jeep&reg;/Eagle divisions.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>The all-new 1995 Chrysler Cirrus, unveiled today at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Mich., will be the first product to bear the brand's new badge.  The badge -- which has the appearance of a seal and ribbon bearing the Chrysler name -- represents a return to tradition for the brand.  It will adorn the grilles of all future Chrysler products as well.<BR>
	If it looks familiar to some, that's because the badge appeared on the first Chrysler car in 1924.  In addition to serving as a vehicle identifier, the badge was Chrysler's corporate symbol, before it was replaced by the Pentastar in the fall of 1962.<BR>
	&quot;The new badge is an emblem richly steeped in engineering innovation and heritage,&quot; said Steve Torok, Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager.  &quot;It's very fitting that we blend this tradition for the first time with our new Cirrus.&quot;<BR>
	The badge was as appropriate for that first Chrysler car as it is for the latest, Cirrus, since the 1924 model received numerous accolades for its engineering achievements.  Similarly, it has represented for many years a continuing rich heritage of engineering achievement in automotive design for the Chrysler name.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation is notifying owners of 7,000 1994 model year Dodge Ram 1500 and 2500 light duty pickup trucks that were built <U>without</U> a rear bumper that their trucks may not comply with federal fuel impact integrity standard requirements.  Owners are being instructed to bring their vehicles to their local Dodge dealer to have a rail reinforcement bracket installed at no cost.<BR>
	Chrysler said that during a rear impact compliance test, fuel leakage occurred in excess of that allowed by the federal standard.  Analysis determined that the fuel leak was caused by impact distortion of the left frame rail which contacted and damaged the fuel filler hose and its attachment nipple.  Chrysler's subsequent testing and analysis confirmed the condition.  Corrective action was immediately taken and vehicles were contained to prevent further shipment.<BR>
	There are no known accidents or injuries related to this condition.<BR>

<P><B>RAM FRAME RECALL</B><BR>

<P>Q: How many Ram trucks are affected?<BR>
A: About 7,000 Ram 1500 and 2500 light duty pickups built <U>without</U> a rear bumper. <BR>

<P>Q: Do other Dodge Ram pickup models have the same problem?<BR>
A: No.  <BR>

<P>Q: How did you discover this problem?<BR>
A: It was first discovered during a NHSTA rear impact compliance test.  Chrysler subsequently experienced similar test results with a Dodge Ram of the same configuration.<BR>

<P>Q: Why does this fuel leakage occur?<BR>
A: The fuel leak was caused by impact distortion of the left frame rail which contacted and damaged the fuel filler hose and its attachment nipple.  <BR>

<P>Q: What's the fix?<BR>
A: A rail reinforcement bracket is attached to the frame.<BR>

<P>Q: What if an owner has installed an aftermarket bumper?<BR>
A: We will still make the structural improvement.<BR>

       Rubicon Springs, Ca -- </B>  Homecomings have become a tradition in the United States. For years, individuals have travelled hundreds of miles to be reunited with those they share a common bond with -- Jeep&reg; owners are no exception.<BR>
	The birth place of the Jeep Jamboree, Rubicon Springs as the locals call it, is not shown on many maps. This weekend, however, hundreds of Jeep owners will venture to Rubicon Springs, California, for the annual Rubicon Trail Jeep Jamboree. <BR>
	&quot;It's basically in the middle of nowhere, somewhere between Cadillac Hill, Devil's Peak and Lost Corner Mountain,&quot; states Mark A. Smith, founding father of the Jeep Jamboree Program. &quot;That makes it especially attractive to Jeep owners -- they're different -- show them a mountain and they'll go over it.&quot;<BR>
	The Jamboree legend was born in 1952 when Smith and his colleagues in the El Dorado County foothills led a small group of Jeep enthusiasts over the treacherous Rubicon Trail from Georgetown to Lake Tahoe. The number of participants grew each year until the event had to be limited to 400 vehicles. 	<BR>

<P>	In 1979, a separate Jamboree, limited to 150 Jeep vehicles, was started. Today Chrysler Corporation's Jeep Eagle Division sponsors 26 Jamborees across the United States for Jeep owners. Jamborees are viewed as a perfect fit for Jeep. <BR>
	Jeep is a founding member of &quot;Tread Lightly!&quot; a non-profit organization designed to promote off-highway use ethics and practices.  Every sport-utility driver also understands that maintaining quality of the land must be of the highest priority, said Michael Kane, Manager, Jeep Marketing.  <BR>
	&quot;When you venture beyond the paved road, its important to remember your responsibilities to the environment,&quot; said Kane.  &quot;At Jeep, our message is simple, use common sense and stay off unmarked trails.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;Jeep vehicles are legendary for doing things others cannot and the real power of a legend is where it takes you,&quot; said Kane.  &quot;It's a part of the Jeep mystique to be able to go to some seldom seen, hard-to-reach place. True Jeep enthusiasts, the people with us here this weekend, understand this.<BR>
	Smith adds that safe and responsible driving are only a part of it. &quot;The people you meet along this trail become your friends,&quot; he said. &quot;Mark my words, every year you are going to want to come back to the middle of nowhere to do this all over again.&quot; <BR>
	For information regarding this year's remaining Jamborees, contact Jeep Jamboree headquarters at (916) 333-4777.<BR>

</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Jeep&reg; Wrangler, the Jeep vehicle that epitomizes fun and outdoor adventure, wades into the 1994 model year with an even more definitive performance profile, augmented by new convenience and safety features.<BR>
         Wrangler's high-output 4.0-liter, in-line 6-cylinder engine receives a higher performance torque converter, which translates into added responsiveness.<BR>
	Also, for the first time since its introduction in 1987, Wrangler offers an optional 3-speed automatic transmission with its 2.5-liter, multi-point fuel-injected 4-cylinder base engine.<BR>
	The 1994 Jeep Wrangler lineup includes the entry-level &quot;S&quot; model, featuring the standard 2.5-liter, 4-cylinder engine, which has 123 horsepower at 5,250 rpm and 139 pound feet of torque at 3,250 rpm.  A 5-speed manual transmission is standard with the 2.5-liter engine.<BR>
	Wrangler SE and the upscale Wrangler Sahara models feature as standard the high-output 4.0-liter, 6 cylinder engine capable of 180 horsepower at 4,750 rpm and 220 pound feet of torque at 4,000 rpm.  A 5-speed transmission is standard and a 3-speed automatic optional with this engine.<BR>
	The 1994 Wrangler features a center high-mounted stop light as an added, easily visible safety alert for vehicles that may be following.<BR>

<P>
<P>(09594)	- more -<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>

<P>	Along with Jeep Cherokee, Wrangler will incorporate non-CFC R-134A refrigerant in its air conditioning system later in this model year.  This refrigerant is viewed as less threatening to the earth's atmospheric ozone layer.  Grand Cherokee was introduced with the R-134A refrigerant.<BR>
	Wrangler continues in 1994 as the icon of the Jeep brand.  Its classic styling, open body design symbolizes its reputation for toughness, durability and four-wheel-drive capability.<BR>
	It features a removable hard or soft top. An optional easy-operating soft top with full doors will be available late in the model year.  A fold-and-tumble rear seat is optional on the Wrangler &quot;S&quot; and standard on the Sahara.<BR>
	Off-highway enthusiasts will have at their disposal Jeep's popular &quot;Command-Trac,&quot; part-time, shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive system, standard on every Wrangler model.  The shift-on-the-fly feature allows for easy shifting from two-wheel- to four-wheel-drive high when weather or traction conditions warrant.<BR>
	In addition to a wide assortment of standard equipment, popular options include air conditioning, rear window defroster for hard top models, 20-gallon fuel tank, power steering, AM-FM Cassette ETR stereo, sound bar, tilt wheel, Trac-Loc rear differential, intermittent wipers, center console, a lock for the glove box, an add-a-trunk lockable storage unit and full-face steel or aluminum wheels.<BR>
	There is, of course, only one Jeep and the 1994 Wrangler is the heart and soul of it -- the authentic, affordable, no-compromise fun and freedom machine.<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>When you see the Dodge Neon on the highway, thoughts of it being just an efficient, low cost, grocery-getter come to mind.  But bolt in a roll cage and six-point racing harness, toss in a few Hollywood celebrities, and you instantly have a fast, great handling, and wildly fun race car series.<BR>
	In last year's ITT Automotive Detroit IndyCar Grand Prix Neon Challenge, Sean Patrick Flanery, star of the ABC television series &quot;The Chronicles of Young Indiana Jones,&quot; took the lead early in the race and finished two seconds ahead of <U>Detroit Free Press</U> auto critic Tony Swan.<BR>
	&quot;I got a run on him coming out of the corner and had just enough juice to try to squeeze through without hitting the wall,&quot; said Sean Patrick Flanery of his race-winning maneuver.  &quot;Between this and the Skip Barber Racing School, this has been the greatest six days of my life.<BR>

<P>(22795-S)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	&quot;It's the most neutral handling front-wheel drive car I've ever driven in my life.  I'm thinking about buying one and racing it.  It's a great car,&quot; said Flanery. <BR>
	Last year's racers not only had fun in the race but were impressed with how well the car handled.  Even those who never sat behind the wheel of a race car could handle the Dodge Neon at speed on the difficult Detroit Grand Prix street circuit.<BR>
	&quot;I had an absolute blast!&quot; said Michael Castner from E! Network.  &quot;The best part about it is the car handles beautifully.  It hugs the road and doesn't surprise you at all.&quot;<BR>
	The 4-door Dodge Neon ACR (American Club Racer package), equipped with a SOHC 2.0 liter 132 horsepower engine, was the star in last year's celebrity series.  It achieved instant success on the club racing circuit, too, as 170 amateur racers competed around the country in road racing and autocross events.<BR>
	New for 1995 is the even sportier version of the car, the Neon ACR Coupe.  With a DOHC 2.0 liter 150 horsepower engine, the Neon Coupe is this year's celebrity challenge car.  Look for even more excitement and rave reviews from Hollywood.<BR>

1995 model year Jeep Cherokees built between June 1994 and early-February 1995, to have the driver-side air bag module inspected.  A small number of air bag modules may have been assembled without an arming lever.  If the arming lever is missing, the air bag will not deploy.<BR>
	This condition was discovered during routine testing at the air bag supplier, Breed Technologies, Inc.  Improved controls were immediately instituted to prevent this condition from occurring in the future.<BR>
	Although fewer than 0.04 of one percent of the vehicles are estimated to have this condition, Chrysler will inspect all affected 1995 Jeep Cherokee air bag modules and replace any faulty units at no cost to owners.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Miami Beach, Fl -- </B><B>  </B> Chrysler Corporation today at the Miami Auto Show announced the price of the all-new 1996 Chrysler Sebring Convertible, a car with the fun and versatility of a convertible, yet with the practicality and quietness of a primary car -- in other words, a convertible that can be used on a daily basis. <BR>
	 The Sebring Convertible is available in two models -- JX and top-of-the-line JXi.

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  Ross Roy Advertising, a Bloomfield Hills, Michigan agency, has been given the responsibility for coordinating and producing Chrysler advertising specifically designed for interactive media.<BR>
The agency also has primary responsibility for direct mail advertising programs.<BR>
	&quot;As we continue to try various interactive channels -- from computer games to CD-ROM programs to our own home page on the World Wide Web -- it's becoming clear that we need a central agency to coordinate the messages and make the right choices,&quot; Jim Julow, Director of Marketing Operations, said.<BR>
	While the creation of brand advertising will continue to be the responsibility of BBDO for Dodge,  and Bozell Worldwide for Chrysler-Plymouth and Jeep-Eagle, Ross Roy will have a hand in content, design and delivery of Chrysler messages that are uniquely interactive.<BR>
	&quot;We believe interactive marketing and advertising has tremendous potential even today for delivering meaningful product information and for selling cars and trucks.  However, it's very new to us and very different from traditional methods,&quot; Julow said.<BR>
(24895)	- more -<BR>

	&quot;We've moved from 'one to many' marketing through mass reach advertising, to 'one to one' with the more recent emphasis on targeting specific individuals through direct mail, CD-ROM and other means.

NEON ADVERTISING AVOIDS FORMULA,<BR>
HOPES TO APPEAL TO DIVERGENT GROUPS <BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> The challenge:  to communicate the breakthrough features of a new and unique small car among very divergent groups -- from Generation X to Boomers to Empty Nesters.<BR>
	The popular formula:  assume all small car buyers are under 30, watch MTV around the clock, dress in grunge clothes and want their advertising to be as frenzied as a music video.<BR>
	In avoiding such assumptions, Chrysler Corporation marketing executives are confident the advertising campaign for Neon, the company's newest small car from Plymouth and Dodge, will make a statement, be bold and different, without giving the viewer a headache.  More importantly, according to Arthur C. (Bud) Liebler, Vice President of Marketing and Communications, it will give all potential customers what they want -- pertinent product features and benefits.<BR>
	&quot;Who says you can't have creative, entertaining advertising and, at the same time, equip consumers with enough information to make a decision,&quot; Liebler said.  &quot;In the end, viewers will know the Neon is fun to drive, responsive, reliable, safe, stylish, roomy -- all this for thousands less than the competition.  I don't care what the life stage -- from grunge to gray hair -- we all want good value and that's what Neon offers!&quot;<BR>
(04694-B)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>

<P>	The 30- and 60-second spots shown on the Super Bowl Jan. 30 have helped create awareness.  More than 75,000 Neons have been ordered in the first month and production is sold out through March.  What follows on the 1994 Winter Olympics on CBS ought to sustain the momentum, Liebler said.<BR>
	Borrowing a page from the movie, &quot;Edward Scissorhands,&quot; shrubs are fashioned in the shape of a Neon in the spot &quot;Topiary.&quot;   The copy focuses on the environmental contributions of Neon -- parts coded for recycling,  a reduction in factory emissions and an air conditioning system that is free of chloroflourocarbons (CFC).<BR>
	&quot;Transport&quot; and &quot;Accordion,&quot; emphasize Neon's cab-forward design, which gives more room to passengers and less to machine.  &quot;Slingshot&quot; and &quot;Powerplant,&quot; play up Neon's best-in-class performance and its 16-valve, single overhead cam engine with 132 hp.<BR>
	&quot;Town Car&quot; mentions safety advantages such as dual air bags, optional anti-lock brakes and impact management systems.  &quot;Earthmover&quot; makes a point about the car's suspension and handling.  &quot;Coats&quot; features the car's six-layer paint job for a long-lasting finish.    <BR>
	&quot;We resisted the temptation to stereotype Generation X,&quot; Liebler said.  &quot;That turns off the very consumer we're targeting, a group which abhors being labeled and categorized with broad sweeping statements.  We concentrated on Neon's unexpected product benefits and unique, likeable personality.&quot;<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>

<P>-3-<BR>
	The subcompact market splits almost evenly between people under 35 and people over 35.  Generation X small car buyers are excited about their purchase and are highly involved with their vehicle, almost as if the car is a trusted, fun companion.<BR>
	Two-thirds of Generation X buyers are women and, while incomes are in the mid-$30,000 range, they have a higher disposable income.<BR>
	Whereas members of Generation X tend to be striving and optimistic, those over 35 are more typically cynical and harder to sell.  They are &quot;boomers,&quot; not &quot;yuppies,&quot; with incomes in the low $40,000 range.  Sales are more evenly split between men and women.  Many are married with kids, and because of house payments, they have less disposable income.<BR>
	&quot;These boomers look at cars as basic transportation, a way to get from point A to point B,&quot; Liebler said.  &quot;They are resigned to buying a subcompact primarily because they cost less.  How exciting can that be?<BR>
	&quot;For many of them, the thrill of buying a new car is gone and they're jaded.  They've given up hope that a small car can offer all that they really want and still be the most affordable car in its class.  But when they shop the Neon, they're in for a big surprise.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler has purchased 70 spots on the Winter Olympics, 53 spots on prime time network programming, 48 spots on late night network programming and several spots on professional and college sports broadcasts.  The cable buys include several spots on Comedy Central, VH-1 Center Stage and the Sci-Fi Channel.<BR>
(more)<BR>
-4-<BR>

<P>	As with recent Dodge Intrepid and Dodge Ram launches, the company will have a heavy commitment to outdoor advertising.  Billboards will reach 70 percent of the target audience 10 times during the month of February.  Bus advertising will be used in markets that have large downtown populations but few effective downtown outdoor boards.<BR>
	The magazine plan includes traditional newsweeklies, general interest and national newspapers, but also includes publications such as Details, Spin, Rolling Stone, Request, Pulse and Premiere.  Buys with magazines such as Outside, Backpacker, Bicycling, Scuba Diving and Runner's World reflect the active lifestyle of Generation X. <BR>
	BBDO Advertising in Detroit is the agency.<BR>

 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation today reported first quarter 1994 net earnings of $938 million, or $2.55 per primary common share.  The first quarter profit was Chrysler's best quarter ever, exceeding the previous record of $801 million in second quarter 1984.  The first quarter 1994 results also established these new quarterly records:<BR>
 Highest quarterly pretax earnings of $1,543 million, surpassing the previous record of $1,224 million in fourth quarter 1993. In the first quarter of 1993, pretax earnings were $880 million.<BR>
 Highest quarterly total sales and revenues of $13.2 billion, surpassing the prior record of $12.0 billion in fourth quarter 1993. In the first quarter of 1993, total sales and revenues were $10.9 billion.<BR>
	 Highest primary earnings per common share for any first quarter of $2.55, surpassing the previous record of $2.50 in first quarter 1984.  In the first quarter of 1993, primary earnings per common share before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was $1.57.<BR>

<P>(14494)	(more)<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>

<P>	On March 31, 1994, Chrysler sold the wiring harness operations of its Acustar division and entered into a supply agreement with the purchaser for net proceeds totaling   approximately $225 million.   The resulting pretax gain of approximately $196 million was deferred and will be recognized over the five-year term of the agreement.<BR>
	The net loss of $(4,436) million for first quarter 1993 included charges totaling $(4,966) million for the cumulative effect of changes in accounting for postretirement and postemployment benefits.  Excluding these first quarter 1993 charges, after-tax earnings for first quarter 1994 were $408 million, or 77 percent, better than first quarter 1993 after-tax earnings of $530 million. 	Robert J. Eaton, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer said:<BR>
	&quot;We owe our record-setting success in the first quarter to the outstanding reception our products have received in the marketplace.  Our dealers have ordered just about all we can build through the remainder of the 1994 model year, especially Dodge Ram, Dodge and Plymouth Neon, Jeep Grand Cherokee and Chrysler, Plymouth and Dodge minivans.<BR>
	&quot;In the case of the Dodge and Plymouth Neon, we have received 137,500 orders to date and customer acceptance has been outstanding.  In fact with the retail customer demand for Neon, we haven't had the opportunity to build dealer inventories.  <BR>
	&quot;We see the steady improvement in industry sales continuing and this, combined with the underlying strength of our car and truck business, has persuaded us to approve capacity increases and significant new hiring over the next three years.  <BR>
(more)<BR>
	- 3 -<BR>

<P>	&quot;Our success makes us all the more determined not to lose sight of the things we need to do to make Chrysler a true world class competitor -- further improve quality, lower costs and achieve continuous improvement in all areas of our operations.  These basic principles will continue to drive everything we do in the future.&quot;<BR>
	Other highlights:<BR>
	 	Chrysler's first quarter 1994 U.S. and Canadian retail unit sales were 243,229 cars and 382,066 trucks and minivans -- an increase of 8 percent and 26 percent, respectively, over first quarter 1993.<BR>
	 Combined U.S. and Canadian car and truck market share remained constant with the first quarter of 1993 at 15.7 percent, in an industry which grew nearly 18 percent compared to first quarter 1993.<BR>
	 	Chrysler's worldwide factory unit sales for first quarter 1994 were 740,598 -- a 15 percent increase over first quarter 1993 and a 13 percent increase over fourth quarter 1993.<BR>
	 	International retail sales in first quarter 1994 were 28,305 units, up 27 percent over first quarter 1993.  Chrysler sold 16,882 vehicles in Europe, an increase of 22 percent over the 13,786 units sold in the same 1993 period.<BR>
	 Chrysler Financial Corporation reported first quarter 1994 pretax earnings of $75 million compared to $50 million in the first quarter of 1993.  <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>JEEP&reg; GRAND CHEROKEE BUILDS ON ITS REPUTATION</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee's reputation for combining a new level of performance, handling, luxury, safety and comfort with legendary Jeep off-highway capability is enhanced for 1994 with additional refinements and features.<BR>
	The Grand Cherokee is the first vehicle in its class to offer standard a driver's side air bag, and it is the only one in its class with a V-8 engine.  In addition, four-wheel disc brakes now are standard on Grand Cherokee Limited models.<BR>
	From the important standpoint of safety, front and rear door beams have been added for side impact protection.<BR>
	Available in a four-door bodystyle only, the 1994 model lineup has been revised.  The base model 1994 Grand Cherokee has been renamed SE and now comes with an upgraded list of standard features.  The previous Grand Wagoneer version has been discontinued to allow expanded production of Laredo and Limited models.  The SE and Laredo may be ordered in two-wheel or four-wheel drive models.<BR>
	Other new features provided on 1994 Grand Cherokees include asymmetrical off-road tires, upgraded wheels and tires on Laredo, valet key and lock system, <BR>
upgraded AM/FM stereo radio with cassette, Infinity &quot;Gold&quot; 120-watt power amplifier and eight speakers in six locations, quarter-panel storage net on Limited models, convenience area net, glove compartment lock and removable rear seat headrests.<BR>

<P>
<P>(09394)	- more - <BR>
	- 2 -<BR>

<P>	Grand Cherokee comes standard with a high-output, fuel-injected, 4.0-liter, in-line 6-cylinder engine, which produces 190 horsepower at 4,750 rpm and 225 pound feet of torque at 4,000 rpm.  It is capable of generating 0 - 60 mph acceleration performance in 9.2 seconds with a 5-speed manual transmission and 10.7 with the 4-speed automatic.<BR>
	Grand Cherokee's optional multi-point, fuel-injected, 5.2-liter V-8 delivers 220 horsepower at 4,800 rpm and 285 pound feet of torque at 3,600.  This engine affords Grand Cherokee a trailer towing capacity of 6,500 pounds, the highest in its class when properly equipped.  Some industry observers have compared Grand Cherokee's superb on-highway handling to luxury sedans and, arguably, it handles better than any other sport utility vehicle, both on and off the highway.<BR>
	Grand Cherokee transfer case offerings -- the heart of any four-wheel-drive system -- include a &quot;Command-Trac&quot; part-time system designed to allow drivers to switch from two-wheel-drive to four-wheel-drive, the latter for inclement weather or off-highway use; a &quot;Select-Trac&quot; unit that is a full-time, four-wheel-drive system that can switched to two-wheel drive or left in the full-time four-wheel-drive mode; or &quot;Quadra-Trac,&quot; which adjusts automatically to changing road surfaces.  All these transfer cases offer a low range, four-wheel-drive mode for extreme conditions.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>DODGE VIPER GTS-R RACE CAR INTRODUCED<BR>
FOR WORLD CLASS COMPETITION</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Pebble Beach, Ca -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today introduced the Dodge Viper GTS-R  a limited-production racing car designed for worldwide GT-class competition.  To be available in up to a 700-horsepower configuration, it is the highest performance production-derived racing car developed and produced directly by an American manufacturer.<BR>
	&quot;This is a no holds-barred, competition car for the world's great events such as the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 24 Hours of Le Mans,&quot;  said President Robert A. Lutz.  &quot;Our goal is to offer a factory-built racing Viper that gives private race teams the design, engineering and race-readiness they need for winning on any level.&quot;<BR>
	Ever since Chrysler introduced the Dodge Viper RT/10 in 1992, Lutz said, enthusiasts the world over have asked if a racing version was in the cards.  The carbon-fiber bodied Viper GTS-R is based on the Viper GTS Coupe which is due to start production next year.<BR>
	&quot;Producing GTS-R is an ambitious project, but one which we believe is extremely logical,&quot; noted Lutz.  &quot;It fits perfectly into our long-term vision for Viper  to develop a history and tradition that rivals the other great sporting marques of the automotive world.  A competition heritage is vital to this vision.&quot;<BR>
(32895-S)					(more)<BR>

<P>						- 2 -<BR>
	Like all production Vipers, GTS-R is also a bold statement about Chrysler's corporate culture.  The car is the offspring of an elite team  less than a dozen members of Viper Engineering who formed the core GTS-R development group. 	They used the same advanced tools and facilities  the CATIA computer-aided design network,  Aerodynamics Laboratory and Computational Fluid Dynamics programs  that Chrysler's platform teams use every day to develop vehicles faster and more cost-effectively than any other automaker.  This allowed the GTS-R team to develop the first car from the concept stage in fewer than nine months.<BR>
	Confident of the car's power capabilities, the GTS-R team engineered a lightweight body incorporating effective aerodynamic improvements, while maintaining the Viper Coupe's classic shape.  They worked in a close partnership with Reynard Racing Cars, the British firm that is fast emerging as the dominant IndyCar chassis builder.<BR>
	 In terms of pure engine power, GTS-R is almost in uncharted territory  even with the horsepower restrictions required by the sanctioning bodies.  The base engine is an 8.0-liter, 525-hp V-10 and is a lightly modified production engine.  For international endurance or GT sprint competition, teams can purchase fully race-prepared 650- or 700-horsepower engines as an option.<BR>
	&quot;These proverbial Hammers of Thor produce close to 700 pounds-feet of torque  about 300 more than a healthy IndyCar engine,&quot; said Lutz.  &quot;When you enter a gunfight with the world's best and fastest GT cars, you bring a big gun.&quot;<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation has made a renewed commitment to its youngest brand, launching a totally coordinated effort referred to as &quot;Team Eagle&quot;.<BR>
	&quot;We want the Eagle brand to be known for products that offer styling, technology and performance -- there's no question that the 1995 line-up does that,&quot; said A.C. (Bud) Liebler, Vice President Marketing and Communications.  &quot;The problem is, these terrific products are the best-kept secrets in the industry. But, that's going to change.&quot;<BR>
	Though successful at attracting incremental buyers to the Chrysler Corporation, research showed Eagle that the brand had relatively low awareness in the marketplace. In response, the brand has stepped up its efforts and is working to further build awareness with the Eagle Team, formed to develop a business plan to tackle the Eagle brand-building initiative.<BR>
	The brand is combining the product superiority of its line-up, with a totally coordinated approach involving merchandising, advertising, public relations and the more than two thousand dealers. The name of the campaign...&quot;The Eagle Test Drive&quot;.<BR>
(36694)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	&quot;Utilizing the &quot;Test Drive&quot; theme, Eagle will generate an unprecedented one-to-one dialogue between our prospects, owners and dealers,&quot; said Liebler. <BR>
&quot;This is just one of the ways Chrysler is developing long-lasting, individual relationships with customers through the new two-way marketing philosophy.&quot;<BR>
	In this campaign, more customers than ever before will see, hear about and experience the Eagle line-up. They are being invited to call the Eagle Information Center at 1-800-2 TEST EAGLE for product information and schedule test drive appointments.<BR>
	&quot;There has been a renewed emphasis on training in our dealerships -- hands-on product and customer service training,&quot; Ed Brust, General Manager - Jeep&reg; and Eagle Division said.  &quot;Every Eagle dealership has designated an Eagle Advocate who works with the Eagle Information Center (EIC) to better serve the needs of current and potential Eagle customers.&quot;   <BR>
	Brust noted that the center is already proving to be a terrific sales tool with prospects calling and requesting test drives at dealerships.<BR>
	&quot;We have worked very closely with our Dealer Advertising Associations and Dealer Council to maximize our advertising efforts and expand our reach like never before,&quot; said Brust. &quot;This has resulted in the most comprehensive national advertising and marketing campaign in the brand's history.&quot;<BR>
	Brust adds that the brand has also intensified its public relations efforts. &quot;We'll reach opinion leaders and the media with the Eagle message in ways we've never done before,&quot; he said. &quot;We'll take our products to the customer...making it easy and fun to be part of the Eagle experience.&quot;<BR>
(more)<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>
	Brust explained that when Team Eagle was launched, it had very specific objectives -- to establish basic brand and product awareness building a personality for Eagle that customers could identify with.<BR>
	&quot;It was important that we create one message, one voice from our dealer associations, from national advertising, from public relations and every other communication that touches our prospects,&quot; said Brust. &quot;We needed to make the most of our combined resources.&quot;<BR>
	Brust says the new campaign strategy is simple,  &quot;Target our special buyers and get more people talking about Eagle.&quot;	<BR>

       Daytona Beach, Fl -- </B>To the movie industry, the &quot;sneak preview&quot; is a common occurrence.  The idea is to give a select group of fans an early look at a future product in order to build excitement for its national debut.  Dodge Division of Chrysler Corporation is borrowing on the sneak preview concept for the debut of its new Avenger sport coupe.  Dodge will use the four-event International Race of Champions (IROC) series as an extended sneak preview of its Avenger, the production version of which won't hit dealer showrooms until late 1994. <BR>
	Dodge will campaign race-prepared Dodge Avengers in the 1994 IROC series, a four-race &quot;All-Star&quot; series, where 12 of the world's top drivers compete in identical cars, separated only by skill and experience.  <BR>
	&quot;Over the past four years, IROC has been a great exposure program for Dodge,&quot; said Martin R. Levine, General Manager, Dodge Division.  &quot;It has put Dodge - and the performance image of `The New Dodge' - in front of a huge television audience.  So when we were looking at ideas to launch the Avenger, IROC was a natural choice for building excitement.&quot;<BR>

(07694)<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	The Avenger IROC will make its debut on February 18 at Daytona International Speedway for round one of the series (Television broadcast on ABC-TV, March 13 at 4:00 p.m. EST). Following Daytona, the series moves to Darlington International Raceway in Darlington, S.C., on March 26 (ABC-TV, May 5 at 3:00 p.m. EST); followed by Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega, Ala., on April 30 (ABC-TV, June 12 at 4:30 p.m.).  The four-race &quot;preview&quot; will conclude with the introduction of the production version of the Avenger, in conjunction with the season finale at Michigan International Speedway (MIS) on July 30 (ABC-TV, August 14 at 5:00 p.m. EST).<BR>
	&quot;We are confident that by the end of the IROC season, race fans will have made the tie-in to Avenger and IROC,&quot; Levine said.  &quot;So, the natural site for the introduction of the car would be an IROC track like MIS.  By then, anticipation should be extremely high.&quot;<BR>
	While the Avenger is an integral part of Dodge's commitment to the series, IROC means more to Dodge than just a venue to debut this car.  It means the opportunity to expose the entire exciting product line to racing enthusiasts.<BR>
	&quot;We use IROC as a showcase for our entire Dodge line,&quot; Levine said.  &quot;Our cars and trucks are exciting, performance-oriented vehicles, from our new Neon to our totally redesigned Ram pickup to the Viper.  There is a car or truck for everyone at Dodge and we want to make sure everyone knows it.&quot; <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>MOPAR ACCESSORIES FOR WRANGLER AND CHEROKEE MAKE LIFE A LITTLE EASIER ON THE JEEP&reg; JAMBOREE TRAIL</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>If you're planning to take your Jeep&reg; Wrangler or Cherokee on a Jeep Jamboree off-road expedition, you'll want to be sure that your vehicle is properly outfitted.  Chrysler Corporation's Mopar Parts Division offers a variety of factory-engineered accessories to improve vehicle safety and utility, and to protect your Jeep's appearance while on the Jamboree trail.<BR>
	High on the Jeep Jamboree equipment needs list are safety-oriented accessories such as skid plates, winches and tow hooks, and off-road and fog lights.  Mopar offers Bumper-Mounted Winches in 6,000 and 8,000 pound capacities, to help your fellow adventurers when they're stuck in the muck.  A hidden style winch is available for Cherokees.<BR>
	For Jeep Jamboree Trails rated 4 and above, properly mounted tow hooks are required, to give your trail mates something to latch onto when you're the one who's stuck.  Mopar tow hooks are made of heavy-duty forged steel, great for winching your Cherokee or Wrangler out of the tightest spots.  And if your Jamboree trail is riddled with rocks and ruts, a skid plate is essential to protect your undercarriage from potential damage.<BR>

<P>
<P>(14694)	- more -<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>

<P>	It's not uncommon to encounter rain or fog on the Jamboree trail.   Mopar fog lights can be &quot;life savers&quot; because they increase visibility and minimize glare.  And if you do any night time trail riding, Mopar Performance off-road lights help illuminate those dark forests and canyon trails.  Mopar Performance off-road and fog lights come in several sizes, in black, stainless steel, and bright chrome finishes.  <BR>
	Mopar Grille/Brush Guards protect your vehicle from trail brush and tree limbs.  They are manufactured of heavy duty, rust-resistant aluminum and are available in silver or black.  Wrangler Guards are also available in a gold finish.<BR>
	Other popular Mopar appearance protection accessories for the Jamboree excursions are Front End Covers for Wrangler and Cherokee.  These covers provide protection against the mud, stones, debris, and insects you'll encounter on the back-road trails.  Unique two-piece construction allows you to open the hood without removing the cover.<BR>
	For those who want to maximize storage space in their Wrangler, the Mopar Add-A-Trunk creates three cubic feet of practical storage space behind the rear seat.  This accessory provides a safe, secure, out of sight place to lock valuables.<BR>
	In the summer, the trails can get pretty hot.  A Mopar Sun Bonnet for your Wrangler provides protection from the sun, yet allows a breezy, open air feel.  It's made of durable vinyl and comes in frost white, black, spice, mint- green, salmon, orchid, yellow, or red.  To protect your cargo from the elements, a matching Mopar Tonneau <BR>
Cover is also available in each color.<BR>

<P>- more -<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>

<P>	Another practical accessory you'll appreciate is a Mopar Spare Tire Carrier.  Mounting your spare tire on a rear outside tire carrier increases interior storage space and allows more convenient access to the spare tire.  To keep your spare clean and dry, a Mopar Spare Tire Cover is offered in colors that match the Sun Bonnet and Tonneau Cover.  A special Jeep Jamboree version is also available, to let people know you're a true Jeep off-road adventurer.<BR>
	Before heading off on your Jeep Jamboree expedition, see your local Jeep and Eagle dealer for a copy of the Wrangler or Cherokee accessory brochure.  The brochures provide detailed information on these and many other Mopar factory-engineered accessories for the Jeep Wrangler and Cherokee.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>No matter how tough and unstoppable Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Wrangler  are designed to be, there are certain obstacles that will bring them to quick halt -- wildflowers, plants and streams, for example. <BR>
	Chrysler Corporation's Jeep brand is committed to the demonstration of responsible four-wheeling in all of its advertising. In fact, a 1993 Jeep print ad uses a photo of a wildflower with the verbiage, &quot;At Jeep, This Is A Stop Sign&quot;.  <BR>
	&quot;Every ad we produce must meet the criteria established by the Jeep Environmental Council,&quot; said David R. Rooney, Manager-Jeep and Eagle Advertising. &quot;They have laid out a strict set of guidelines for us to adhere to such as making every attempt to show our vehicles on approved roads or trails.&quot;<BR>
	The Jeep Marketing Environmental Council consists of representatives from the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, California Association of four-wheel-drive clubs, the United Four Wheel Drive Association and the Jeep/Eagle Division of Chrysler Corporation.<BR>
	They were established in 1989 to provide guidance in the development of Jeep advertising and merchandising campaigns and to help project how the public sector and environmentally conscious consumers may react to the campaigns.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>(09194)	- more - <BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>

<P>	Rooney explained that the council's mission statement is comprised of three objectives. <BR>
	&quot;The council minimizes the potential for creating Jeep advertising and merchandising that could depict vehicles being used improperly off-road,&quot; he said. &quot;They provide guidelines for the development of environmentally responsible advertising and merchandising and serve as an authoritative, credible review board.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler Corporation's commitment is endorsed by a Corporate policy which consists of environmental principles to guide its employees worldwide in an environmentally responsible manner in their daily activities and business practices.<BR>
	&quot;We realize that our position in communicating with outdoor enthusiasts includes taking a responsible position toward the preservation and use of our natural resources,&quot; said Rooney.<BR>
	He added that Chrysler remains a leading corporate force in `Tread Lightly', an educational program designed to inform off-highway and other recreational vehicle users of their responsibilities to the environment.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>RECORD MINIVAN SALES LEAD THE WAY<BR>
TO CHRYSLER'S BEST JULY IN SIX YEARS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler's total July sales of 167,884 vehicles<BR>
 were driven by new records in all three basic product groups -- Minivans, pickup trucks, and sedans.  It was the best July in six years, and marked a five percent increase over last year.<BR>
	&quot;It was the best July in six years in retail sales, as well as total sales,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing and General Manager - Minivan Operations.  &quot;Chrysler and its dealers are still outperforming the market on Minivans and Ram trucks, even with unheard-of  low days' supply of product; and sales of our LH family of sedans continue to increase.&quot;<BR>
	For total truck sales, it was a different story: Best July in Chrysler history, and the sixth consecutive 100,000-plus month, with sales of 111,621 -- a 14 percent jump over last year.  The record was set despite an 11 percent drop in sales of popular Jeep Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Wrangler models due to shortages brought on by high demand and model changeover.   <BR>

<P>(34894)	<B>-more-</B><BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivans led the way, with both individual and combined records, and with total sales of 46,941.  Dodge Ram sales set an all-time high for July, with sales of 17,027 beating 1978's 16,786.  Combined Dodge truck sales rose 32 percent to beat a July record set in 1987.<BR>
	Due in part to model changeover and lower inventory of discontinued models, total car sales of 56,263 slipped eight percent compared to last year, despite record performances by Dodge Intrepid and Chrysler New Yorker and LHS. Combined with the Chrysler Concorde and Eagle Vision, the LH sedans turned in their best July on sales of 22,333.  Plymouth and Dodge Neons combined for sales of 17,391.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>	The road to the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta will be a grueling one for cyclists.  In an effort to support young cyclists, Plymouth has formed &quot;Team Plymouth,&quot; one of the ten professional cycling teams from the United States.  Plymouth's support of cycling will help further the sport in America, contributing to the development of Olympic hopefuls and helping to narrow the gap between American cycling and European cycling.<BR>
	&quot;We're excited to have the chance to help some of America's top cyclists reach the Olympics,&quot; said Chrysler-Plymouth General Manger Steve Torok.  &quot;Just like the 'New Plymouth,' the best times are ahead for these riders.&quot;<BR>
	Team Plymouth is managed by Strada Racing Club, Inc., of Tempe, Ariz.  Supporting corporate sponsors include Phoenix-based America West Airlines and Domenic's Cycling Imports.  Cycling-related sponsors include Thule Roof Rack Systems, Endura Energy Drink, Giro Helmets, Gore Ride-On Cables, Oakley Sunglasses, Pearl Izumi Clothing, Profile Equipment, Serrota Bicycles, Shimano Components, Stoker Energy Bars, Torelli Equipment, Ultimate Support System's Stands, Vittoria Tires, and Wheelsmith Fabrications' Spokes.<BR>

	Team Plymouth boasts a squad of eight top young cyclists, most notable is Brian Smith, the current British Professional Champion and former member of the Motorola Cycling Team.  Joining Smith is Timm Peddie, a member of the 1992 U.S. Olympic Team.  Peddie is the 1992 U.S. Olympic Trials Champion and a two-time member of the U.S. National Cycling Team.<BR>
	In addition to Smith and Peddie, Team Plymouth includes David Anthes - three-time Champion of La Vuelta de Bisbee Stage Race and 1989 Collegiate National Champion; Tom Ebeyer, Doug Loveday, Tom Idzorek and Drew Miller - a two-time champion of the Tour of the Gila Stage Race.  Roberto Gaggioli - the winningest cyclist in the world in 1987, 1988, 1991, and 1993 - has raced the majority of the season with Team Plymouth and efforts are underway to make him a permanent member of Team Plymouth.  <BR>
	&quot;Along with helping to develop young cyclists, the intent of Team Plymouth is to expose the Plymouth name and its products to a young, active group of people.  Cycling is a great fit for Plymouth,&quot; said Gary Graebe, Director of Team Plymouth.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>The all-new 1996 Dodge Caravan became the first minivan to win the <I>Motor Trend</I> Car of the Year award, presented today by C. Van Tune, the magazines Editor.  This marks the second consecutive year a Chrysler Corporation vehicle has won the coveted prize.  The Chrysler Cirrus was named the 1995 recipient.<BR>
	In awarding the all-new minivan the honor, the editors of <I>Motor Trend</I> said, Ever since Chrysler Corp. created the minivan market in 1984, each successive new competitor has aspired to make its entry more carlike.  With the 96 Caravan ... the segment decisively moved beyond a significant milepost.  The Caravan isnt merely carlike -- its quite simply a <I>car</I>.<BR>
	Were obviously ecstatic to win this award, said Theodor R. Cunningham, Chrysler Corporation Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing, and General Manager, Minivan Operations.  It represents an endorsement of what weve been saying all along about our new minivans, that they set new benchmark levels of ride, handling, quietness, space efficiency and innovative new features never before experienced in a minivan.<BR>

<P>	The Dodge Caravan -- as well as the Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country -- offers a critically acclaimed driver-side sliding door, as well as thoughtful, useful features such as Easy Out Roller Seats&reg;, dual zone climate control, and a windshield wiper de-icer.<BR>
	The Caravan has consistently outsold the competition each year, with sales of nearly 270,000 units in calendar year 1994.<BR>
	The Chrysler Corporation trio of minivans are made for the North American market in St. Louis, Mo., and Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and for pan-European markets in Graz, Austria.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Merchandising for the 1995 Chrysler Cirrus will reach people who fit a specific buyer profile -- young and moving up.  	Consumer-based programs featuring Cirrus include VIP demonstration and test drives,  the Prodigy computer access network, and outlets like TicketMaster and Brooks Brothers.<BR>
	&quot;We'll continue to reinforce that the Chrysler brand is a legitimate alternative purchase for up-market buyers,&quot; said Steve Torok, Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager.  &quot;Also, that Chrysler is an 'all-new' company that produces quality, leading-edge technology products.&quot;<BR>
	But seeing -- or driving -- is believing.  And Chrysler has identified a number of venues for consumers to see and drive the new Cirrus compact sedan:<BR>
	    Chrysler will, along with its dealers, target opinion leaders and decision makers in several top markets across the country, to conduct demonstration drives of the Cirrus.  Cars will be delivered to those individuals and picked up two or three days later.  Drivers are then asked to fill out an evaluation form on their experience.  <BR>

<P>(35194)	-more-<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	Similarly, a VIP experiential drive program will be held targeting African-Americans whose demographics match the Cirrus market profile. <BR>
	&quot;Research has shown us that, for every VIP demonstration drive conducted, three additional people drive the vehicle and three more are passengers,&quot; said  Jim Cherfoli, Chrysler-Plymouth National Merchandising Manager.  &quot;It has been and should continue to be a very effective means for us to increase awareness with our target buyers.&quot; <BR>
	    Beginning in November Chrysler will hold receptions at each of nine Frank Lloyd Wright-designed buildings and homes in major metro markets including New York, Los Angeles and Detroit.  Those in attendance of the tour, in conjunction with<I> House Beautiful</I> magazine, will be able to take Cirrus test drives.<BR>
	    Guests at approximately 20 top-rated resorts across the country will be afforded the chance to drive a Cirrus for one day, in exchange for providing feedback via a short questionnaire.  It is expected that the program will generate between 2,000 and 3,000 test drives.     <BR>
	     Participants in and spectators at the Chrysler-sponsored<I> Black Enterprise</I> Golf and Tennis Challenge can test drive a Cirrus at the Labor Day weekend event, to be held at the PGA Resort and Spa, in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.  The event features sports and entertainment celebrities and government officials including Shaquille O'Neal, Earvin &quot;Magic&quot; Johnson, Denzel Washington, Oprah Winfrey, Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown, David Dinkins and the Reverend Jesse Jackson.<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>
	In addition, Chrysler will offer test drives at a number of other events it sponsors, including: the Nutcracker on Ice, that runs during the month of December in approximately 20 markets, offering free tickets to members of local ice skating clubs; and the 150 Drive for the Chrysler golf events, starting in February, where spectators receive one dozen golf balls.<BR>
	The Prodigy computer access network is also included in the Cirrus merchandising arsenal.<BR>
	Cirrus will be featured in the Prodigy on-line system beginning in September.  Subscribers can receive an immediate printout of Cirrus specifications, standard features and options.<BR>
	&quot;There's no question, Prodigy members show a greater propensity for purchasing new vehicles,&quot; added Cherfoli.  &quot;In some cases, our vehicles are purchased at more than seven times greater rates by Prodigy subscribers than by the general population.&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler will employ additional inventive tactics to make specific prospect audiences more aware of Cirrus. <BR>
	Through TicketMaster, showgoers will receive product information on Cirrus.  For instance, those attending adult contemporary and top '40s concerts (in line with Cirrus' target buyers), purchasing tickets through TicketMaster will find Cirrus information on their ticket envelope.<BR>
	And Chrysler will advertise Cirrus in next spring's Brooks Brothers catalog, including promotion in the more than 100 Brooks Brothers clothing stores nationwide, providing awareness of the car in the top 50 ADIs.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>The 1995 National Geography Bee Champion, 13-year-old Chris Galeczka, isn't going to Disneyland.  Nor will he spend his entire 10-day, all-expense paid minivan vacation at the typical historic sites which come to mind.<BR>
	The place Chris most wants to visit as part of his Chrysler Corporation-sponsored &quot;Dream Geography Journey&quot; is... the Mall of America in Minneapolis.<BR>
	&quot;I saw the pictures of the Mall of America, and it looks 20 times the size of Saint Peter's,&quot; said Galeczka after being crowned Geography Bee Champion and winning a $25,000 college scholarship.   &quot;There's a miniature roller coaster inside the Mall that I've always wanted to ride.&quot;<BR>
	And ride it he will.  Chris and his family will leave their home in Sterling Heights, Mich., on Saturday, August 5th, heading for Minneapolis.  They'll stop off in Ludington, Manitowic and several other towns, before arriving on August 8th in Minneapolis for a three-day stay at the Mall of America Grand Hotel.<BR>

	&quot;We think it's great that Chris Galeczka has chosen Mall of America as his dream vacation destination,&quot; added Julow.  &quot;Chrysler designed the Dream Geography Journey contest as a way to make learning about geography fun and entertaining.

       Washington D.C. -- </B>- This year's 1995 National Geography Bee Champ, 13-year-old Chris Galeczka from Sterling Heights, Mich., is not going to Disneyland, but he is going to the Mall of America in Minneapolis.<BR>
	Why?  Because in addition to the $25,000 college scholarship, Chrysler Corporation, corporate sponsor of the National Geography Bee, is awarding a <BR>
10-day all-expense paid minivan vacation to the destination of Chris' choice in the continental United States as part of its Dream Geography Journey contest.<BR>
	Chrysler also awarded a second minivan dream vacation earlier today to Connecticut state-level winner Stephen Fan for his &quot;most creative entry&quot; in the Dream Geography Journey contest.  <BR>
	Galeczka, who was a finalist at last year's National Geography Bee competition, chose the Mall of America because he wants to experience the Mall's impressive size, and because he wants to have fun during his summer vacation.<BR>

<P>(24095)	-more-<BR>

	&quot;I saw pictures of the Mall of America, and it look's like it's twenty-times the  size of St. Peter's,&quot; said Galeczka after being crowned Geography Bee Champion.  <BR>
	&quot;There's a miniature roller coaster inside the Mall that I've always wanted to ride,&quot; Galeczka added.  &quot;We're also going to stop at the Six Flags Amusement Park outside of Chicago on our way there.  I hear that's bigger than Disneyland!&quot;<BR>
	Chrysler's Dream Geography Journey, developed in conjunction with this year's Bee, asked each state-level finalist to show their practical knowledge of geography by planning their own 10-day minivan dream vacation.<BR>
	&quot;With the Dream Geography Journey, the students got a chance to take geography out of the classrooms and onto the roads of America,&quot; said Jim Julow, Director of Marketing Operations for Chrysler Corporation.  &quot;Like the National Geography Bee, we think this contest will continue to educate and excite the students and their families about the world we live in.&quot;<BR>
	Fan's &quot;most creative&quot; entry, &quot;The Great Smokey Road Trip,&quot; included an audio cassette tape narrative featuring background music related to the places he planned to visit.  In addition, Fan included a photo album with hand drawn colored-pencil drawings chronicling his dream trip to the Smokey Mountains.<BR>
	&quot;The caliber of entries we received was truly first-rate,&quot; said Julow.  &quot;These students not only have an outstanding knowledge of geography, but many also have a flair for writing, drawing and dreaming.&quot;<BR>

SET FOR GRAND PRIX WEEKEND</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B><B> </B>Chrysler Corporation and the Southeast Michigan Dodge Dealers are sponsoring the inaugural <U>Neon Challenge</U> as part of the ITT Automotive Detroit IndyCar Grand Prix weekend.  Hollywood celebrities, local Detroit personalities and national and international automotive media will compete in race-prepared Dodge Neons in a 30-minute SCCA-sanctioned race around the Raceway on Belle Isle Park.<BR>
	Mark-Paul Gosselaar, who stars on the NBC comedy series &quot;Saved By The Bell:  The College Years,&quot; Crystal Bernard from the hit NBC comedy series &quot;Wings,&quot; Sean Patrick Flanery of the ABC television series &quot;The Chronicles of Young Indiana Jones,&quot; Frank Beard from the rock group ZZ Top and Michael Castner, who currently hosts the new E! series &quot;F.Y.E!,&quot; will be the out-of-town celebrities competing in the <U>Neon Challenge</U>.<BR>
	Local radio and television personalities who will participate include Mark Champion from WWJ, Steve Kostan of WRIF and Erik Smith from WXYZ-TV.  Carl Galeana, President of the Southeast Michigan Dodge Dealer Association, also will join the fun.<BR>
	National automotive media participants will include Barry Winfield from <U>Car and Driver</U>, Joe Rusz of <U>Road &amp; Track</U>, Denise McCluggage from <U>AutoWeek</U>, Daniel Charles Ross from <U>Motor Trend</U>, Doug Weisz from <U>Automobile </U>and Tony Swan from the<U> Detroit Free Press</U>.  Henny Hemmes, representing <U>The Washington Times</U>, from the Netherlands and Tiff Needell from the British Broadcasting Company's (BBC) &quot;Top Gear&quot; program are crossing the ocean to compete.<BR>

<P>(19894-S)	(more)<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	Emerson Fittipaldi, two-time Indianapolis 500 winner, Formula One world champion and the 1989 PPG Indy Car World Series champ, will serve as Grand Marshal of the <U>Neon Challenge</U> race in addition to competing in the ITT Automotive Detroit Grand Prix the same day.  Fittipaldi, who is a consultant to Chrysler, will meet with the <U>Neon Challenge</U> drivers to share his knowledge of the course.<BR>
	Drivers in the<U> Neon Challenge</U> will complete training at the Skip Barber Driving School prior to the event.<BR>
	Why did Dodge select Neon to race?  &quot;The definition of performance has evolved and so has the definition of Dodge performance vehicles, as exemplified by Viper, Stealth, Ram and the personality and performance of the new Dodge Neon,&quot; says Marty Levine, general manager of Dodge Division.  &quot;Neon is the spirit of Dodge--affordable and fun to drive.&quot;<BR>
	Neon was designed with performance in mind.  The image of the little car with the big personality is coming through loud and clear.<BR>
	Neon's friendly, smiling face, with big round headlamps, give it a distinctive playful feature.  But at some angles, it takes on a slightly impish, more aggressive performance-minded stance that is the first indication that there's more here than meets the eye.<BR>
	&quot;Small car customers told us that they wanted a quick, agile car with a responsive powertrain,&quot; adds Levine.  &quot;They said that fun-to-drive means more than just a powerful engine--it's a combination of engine performance, steering response and control.  It's the perfect match for the young buyer of the 1990s, who doesn't want to sacrifice core values like safety and environmental responsibility for performance.  Neon gives them both.&quot;<BR>
	Neon Challenge activities on Belle Isle for the weekend include a practice session on Friday, June 10, at 6;15 p.m.; the qualifying race on Saturday, June 11 at 1:10 p.m.; and the <U>Neon Challenge</U> on Grand Prix Sunday, June 12, at 10:45 a.m.<BR>
	When not in use during race weekend, the full stable of Neons, along with some Dodge concept vehicles, will be showcased for public viewing in their own paddock in the general admission area of the track.<BR>
	The <U>Neon Challenge</U> is part of the weekend of Grand Prix events.  Tickets are available through the Grand Prix hotline at 313-259-7749, through Ticketmaster at<BR>
810-645-6666 or through any Ticketmaster outlet.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>ALL-NEW DODGE AVENGER PROVIDES A BALANCE<BR>
OF STYLE, PERFORMANCE AND COMFORT</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>	The Dodge Division of Chrysler Corporation has introduced the all-new 1995 Dodge Avenger, a highly expressive sport coupe offering a level of balance rarely seen in automobiles of this type -- sporty design and roominess; spirited driving and comfort; and value and affordability.<BR>
	Available in base and ES trim levels, the Dodge Avenger appeals to a growing number of buyers who desire the image of a sporty car, yet require more room and comfort than provided by smaller sport coupes.<BR>
	&quot;The Avenger is all-new from the ground up,&quot; explains Joe Caddell, General Product Manager for Chrysler's Small Car Platform team.  &quot;We created the Avenger with a new set of customers in mind.  We believe that there is a sizable market of buyers that want roominess and comfort but simply aren't willing to give up the sporty image and feel.  These buyers are typically single or couples not in the child-raising lifestage.  People will find that Avenger represents a new choice, but just in the Dodge line-up, but in the marketplace as well.  There just aren't that many products out there that will compete for the same buyer.&quot;	<BR>

<P>(33594-S)	(more)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- 2 -<BR>

<P>	The Dodge Avenger is straight out of the Chrysler design studios, creators of such design successes as the incomparable Dodge Viper sports car.<BR>
	The Dodge Avenger is built around a spirited Chrysler Corporation-designed and manufactured 2.0-liter, 16-valve, DOHC, four cylinder engine producing 140 horsepower.  The engine is mated to either a Chrysler-built 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission.<BR>
	The Avenger ES is powered by a 2.5-liter, 155 horsepower, 24-valve, SOHC V-6 engine matched to a Chrysler 4-speed automatic transmission.<BR>
	All Avengers ride on a four-wheel, fully independent double wishbone suspension that provides an outstanding balance of ride comfort and handling agility.  The Avenger ES suspension is further upgraded for increased road-handling capability.<BR>
	Other notable standard features include power speed-sensitive steering, tinted glass, stainless steel exhaust system, and rear defroster.  Inside, standard equipment includes driver and front passenger air bags, full instrumentation, AM/FM stereo radio with digital clock, tilt steering wheel, bucket seats with driver's seat manual height adjusters and memory recliner, full console and split folding rear locking seat.<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>-3-<BR>

<P>	Avenger ES standard equipment adds integrated fog lamps, 16&quot; aluminum wheels, four wheel disc anti-lock brakes, functional dual exhaust tips, and rear decklid spoiler.  Notable ES interior upgrades include standard air conditioning, AM/FM stereo cassette radio, leather-wrapped steering wheel, speed control, floor mats and trunk cargo nets.<BR>
	Stunning design-by-Chrysler appearance is the ultimate attraction of the new Dodge Avenger, creating a fresh new look in the compact sport coupe market.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation set a new May record with total vehicle sales of 209,487 -- the highest in eight years -- and also established a new May record for retail sales.    <BR>
	&quot;In the face of the uncertain selling climate we've had so far this spring, May was a terrific month.  But it's even more exciting to see that 88 percent of our total business in May was done at retail,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President -- Sales and Marketing. &quot;Three of our newest car lines and our Jeep&reg; vehicles all set best-month-ever records, two divisions had their best May ever, and minivan retail sales rose five percent over last year.  Spring came a little late this year, but it seems to have finally arrived.&quot;<BR>
	Trucks also set new May records for both total and retail sales.  Of the 134,879 units sold, Jeep vehicles accounted for 45,499 -- an all-time sales record.  Jeep Grand Cherokee sales of 27,805 represented a 33 percent increase over last year and the best sales month in its three-and-a-half year history.  Dodge Ram set a new sales record for May of 23,003 units -- the 18th consecutive monthly record.  Both Jeep-Eagle Division and Dodge Division enjoyed their best May performances ever.  Chrysler Town &amp; Country also set a May sales record of 3,608 units. <BR>
(23995)	- more -	<BR>

	Total car sales of 74,608 included all-time records for combined sales of Dodge and Plymouth Neon with 24,468, Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus with 14,044, and Dodge Avenger and Chrysler Sebring with 6,434.  Dodge Intrepid also set a new sales record for May on sales of 12,477 units -- its 22nd consecutive monthly record. <BR>

       Los Angeles -- </B>The Plymouth Prowler joins hundreds of hot rod owners in the 3,000-mile, 10-day <B><I>Hot Rod</I></B> magazine Power Tour from Los Angeles to Norwalk, Ohio, beginning tomorrow.  While the tour should prove fun and exciting for the hot rod enthusiasts and the thousands of spectators along the route, it's &quot;all in a 10-days-work&quot; for members of Team Prowler.<BR>
	&quot;The Plymouth Prowler pays homage to the rolling art of hot rods, and traveling across the country with the many classic hot rods will be extra special for the team,&quot; said Craig R. Love, Team Prowler's Executive Engineer.  &quot;But our main purpose is to use the Power Tour as an engineering and development run for Plymouth Prowler as we get closer to production.&quot;<BR>
	Love says that staying close to the hot rod community is another reason the team is participating in the Power Tour.<BR>
(more)<BR>

	&quot;Since we first introduced Plymouth Prowler as a concept vehicle in 1993, we've been talking with and listening to many of the leaders of the hot rod community,&quot; said Love.  &quot;Beyond the engineering aspects of our participation in the Power Tour, this is another example of our support for the people and machines of this uniquely American group.&quot;<BR>
	The Power Tour leaves Los Angeles May 10 with the following pit stops before reaching the final destination at the Power Festival in Norwalk:<BR>
	May 10	Las Vegas -- 5 p.m. Cruise Party at Sahara Hotel<BR>

<P>	May 11	Grand Junction, Colo. -- Night stop at Grand Junction Hilton<BR>

<P>	May 12	Englewood, Colo. -- 6 p.m. Cruise Party at Gunther Toady's<BR>

<P>	May 13	Goodland, Kan. -- 5 p.m. Dinner at NW Kansas Vocational <BR>
			Tech School<BR>

<P>	May 14	Liberty, Mo. -- 5 p.m. Cruise Party at Winstead's<BR>

<P>	May 15	Springfield, Ill. -- 5 p.m. Cruise Party at Rock n' Roll Hardees<BR>

<P>	May 16	Lansing, Ill. -- 4 p.m. Cruise Party at Lansing Airport<BR>

<P>	May 17	Mt. Clemens, Mich. -- 5 p.m. Cruise Party in downtown 				(estimated 35,000 people and 400-500 hot rods)<BR>

<P>	May 18	Norwalk, Ohio -- 10:30 a.m. Hot Rod Power Festival begins at 			the Norwalk Raceway<BR>

<B> </B>  <BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Vail, Colorado -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today unveiled the new 1997 Jeep&reg; Cherokee in front of thousands of Jeep owners and their families at the second annual Camp Jeep, a two-day outdoor adventure near Vail, Colorado.  The 1997 Jeep Cherokee features all-new interior and refined exterior for the first time since its introduction as the first compact four-door sport-utility vehicle in the 1984 model year.<BR>
	<P>&quot;The unique bond between Jeep owners and their vehicles made Camp Jeep the ideal location to show off the new Jeep Cherokee,&quot; said Ed Brust, General Manager of Chrysler's Jeep and Eagle Division.  &quot;We wanted our owners to be the first to see it.  The active young families and singles here this weekend are the primary demographic targets for Cherokee.&quot;<BR>
	<P>Brust added that Camp Jeep creates a unique opportunity for Jeep owners to meet one-on-one with the Chrysler men and women who are the faces behind Jeep.<BR>
	<P>&quot;We learn valuable lessons by listening to customers this way,&quot; continued Brust.  &quot;We've used customer feedback to guide the changes we've made to improve the Cherokee for 1997.  It also helps us make sure that we don't compromise the character and originality that Cherokee owners treasure.&quot;<BR>
	<P>The 1997 Jeep Cherokee retains its classic lines, outstanding performance, capability and the legendary Jeep character that defined the compact four-door sport-utility market when first introduced in the 1984 model year.<BR>
	<P>Cherokee's all-new interior features a &quot;modular&quot; instrument panel -- which more easily accommodates assembly of left- and right-hand drive configurations -- and includes standard dual air bags for improved safety.  Also new and improved on the 1997 Jeep Cherokee are:  new electrical systems; improved heating, air conditioning and ventilation; reduced noise, vibration and harshness; a convenient center stack that includes all heating, ventilation and cooling controls, accessory and radio controls; an available combined cassette/CD player with premium speakers and 20-amp power outlet plus cigar lighter.<BR>
	<P>The classic lines of the exterior remain, but with a more rounded appearance at the front and rear of the vehicle.  A new stamped steel liftgate with hidden hinges is significantly easier to operate and has an inside pull-down handle.<BR>
	<P>The base engine on 1997 Cherokee SE is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder that generates 125 horsepower and 150 foot-pounds of torque.  Available on Cherokee SE and standard on Sport and Country is a 4.0-liter in-line six-cylinder engine, which generates 190 horsepower and 225 foot-pounds of torque.  Both engines were extensively refined in the Jeep powertrain program for the 1996 model year.<BR>
	<P>In addition, Jeep Cherokee is available with 2.5-liter turbo diesel engine for export to more than 100 countries.  Nearly one of every three Jeep Cherokees built at the Toledo Assembly plant are sold outside North America.<BR>
	<P>In the last 16 months, the results of a full-line Jeep product renewal program are complete with the introduction of the 1997 Jeep Cherokee and the introduction of the all-new 1997 Jeep Wrangler and Jeep Grand Cherokee, which was redesigned for the 1996 model year.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>NEW EAGLE ADVERTISING ENCOURAGES<BR>
TAKING &quot;THE EAGLE TEST DRIVE&quot;</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> The all-new 1995 Eagle Talon is being launched with an advertising campaign that challenges everyone to take &quot;The Eagle Test Drive.&quot;<BR>
	A series of witty 30-second spots are part of the most comprehensive communications campaign in the Eagle brand's history.  The advertising not only launches the all-new Eagle Talon, but also generates awareness for Chrysler Corporation's newest brand.<BR>
	&quot;We know for sure that people who drive Eagle cars love them,&quot; said Ed Brust, General Manager, Jeep and Eagle Division.  &quot;From the beginning, Eagle has been successful in attracting youthful, upscale, well educated customers.  This brand building campaign will help us reach more of them.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;The Eagle Test Drive&quot; theme is direct and coordinated and focuses on the styling, technology and performance the full-line of Eagle -- Talon, Vision and Summit -- vehicles deliver.<BR>
	&quot;In keeping with the non-traditional approach we have always taken with Eagle advertising,&quot; said David Rooney, Manager, Jeep and Eagle Advertising, &quot;the new spots deliver both an attitude and personality that is Eagle:  honest, confident and witty -- in a fresh, <BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
stylish way that we believe will create the awareness necessary to be noticed in today's competitive marketplace.  They close with a call-to-action to encourage people to move from advertising awareness into our showrooms.&quot;<BR>
	The television-based campaign features Greg Kinnear, the host of TV's &quot;Later&quot; (NBC) and &quot;Talk Soup&quot; (E! Entertainment Television).  Kinnear uses his unique style to encourage a varied mix of people -- including car enthusiasts, young professionals, accountants, lawyers, an off-duty police officer, and a biker -- to take &quot;The Eagle Test Drive&quot; while the spots point out, often in humorous ways, the product features and pricing advantages of Eagle Talons, Visions and Summits.<BR>
	&quot;Kinnear's friendly and engaging style, and witty personality, complements our brand and products in a way that we feel will cut through the clutter and get people talking about our vehicles,&quot; Rooney added.<BR>
	Whether addressing pricing and leasing, styling, performance, unique third-party endorsements or hearing surprising reactions from competitive car owners, the spots close with an amusing Kinnear comment or gesture and the 1-800-2-Test-Eagle &quot;call-to-action&quot; number which encourages the viewing audience to take &quot;The Eagle Test Drive&quot;.<BR>
		&quot;We want  to make the car buying process easier, more pleasurable, and<BR>
more informative,&quot; said Rooney.  &quot;Before walking into a showroom, prospective customers have the opportunity to call the Eagle Information Center to learn more about our vehicles and even schedule a test drive.&quot;<BR>
	In all, 18 television commercials were produced.<BR>
	(more)<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>
	One spot for Vision TSi features off-duty police officer, Kirk Harris, test driving the 3.5 litre 24 valve Eagle Vision on a test track.  Kinnear asks, &quot;You think you can handle ALL that power, officer?&quot;  Very sternly, the officer responds, &quot;We're trained to go fast.&quot;<BR>
	After the test drive, Kinnear asks the officer how fast he was going.  When Officer Harris responds, &quot;I don't know, I wasn't' paying much attention,&quot; Kinnear pulls out a radar gun and states, &quot;Well, I was ... I'm going to need you to step out of the car, sir.&quot;<BR>
	The first Eagle Talon advertising airs tonight (August 18) on CBS's &quot;Late Show with David Letterman.&quot;  It will be followed by the biggest, most visible media schedule ever for the Eagle brand, said Rooney.<BR>
	&quot;We are combining our national and dealer advertising message and media budgets to maximize effectiveness and resources through one message, one voice,&quot; Rooney said.  &quot;Our national media will put Eagle where we want to be -- in a broad range of prime time, sports, comedy, latenight and specials.  It will be coordinated with local dealer association ads placed on local news, prime access and independent station programming.&quot;<BR>
		In addition to Letterman, Eagle TV will run on regularly scheduled network programs such as  &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, &quot;Home<BR>
Improvement&quot;, &quot;Frazier&quot; and NFL football.  The spots will also be seen on high profile programs such as the season premier of Melrose Place and new network shows and major special events such as Steven Spielberg's &quot;Earth 2 Pilot,&quot; &quot;Sports Illustrated 40th Anniversary&quot; on NBC, and the David Letterman special on CBS.  <BR>
(more)<BR>

	Radio advertising, featuring Kinnear and the same creative theme, will run on network and syndicated programming.<BR>
	Eagle print advertising kicks off this month with a 4-page insert that begins with a shot of the Eagle crest and opens with the headline, &quot;Test This&quot; ... featuring an aggressive Talon TSi all-wheel drive vehicle.  The back cover continues ...  &quot;With This&quot; ... providing a guide on &quot;how to&quot; take &quot;The Eagle Test Drive&quot; and key product facts and highlights to look for.<BR>
	This will be followed by a series of print ads in key lifestyle, business, and newsweekly publications, as well as enthusiast publications, featuring emotional headlines such as this Eagle Talon TSi ad:  &quot;They say power and control are the ultimate aphrodisiacs.  Choose your passengers carefully.&quot;<BR>
	Outdoor billboards, featuring a &quot;tear-off&quot; concept like ads seen on workplace bulletin boards, will be placed in key markets across the U.S.  The &quot;tear-off's&quot; feature the 1-800-2-Test Eagle number (1-800-283-7832).  Over the course of the three months the billboards are up, tabs will be torn off, emphasizing how interest in the all-new Eagle Talon grows.<BR>
	The Eagle campaign was created by the Detroit office of Bozell Worldwide, Inc.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>MINISTRY OF TRANSPORT'S TYPE DESIGNATION SYSTEM APPROVAL</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>		&quot;We appreciate the Japanese Ministry of Transport's ( MOT) decision to grant Type Designation Approval (TDA) approval to our distributor, Chrysler Japan Sales, Ltd. (CJSL), for the right-hand drive Jeep Cherokee.  We expected this move by the end of March and reflected it in our volume projections this year.  It is the result of several years of work by Chrysler and our Japanese distributor.<BR>
		&quot;The TDA approval historically has not been made available to import products.  It is still not in place for all other Chrysler products sold in Japan.  This designation has not been granted to Chrysler Corporation, but rather to our Japanese distributor, of which Chrysler holds a 15 percent interest.  <BR>
		&quot;Under the current Type Notification System, all other Chrysler products sold in Japan are forced to undergo an estimated four-hour registration process at MOT's land office before delivery to customers can take place.<BR>
		&quot;In the U.S., Japanese vehicles are not subject to this treatment.  Therefore, although Chrysler is pleased with the new classification, we recognize that the process that requires these classifications is itself a barrier to entry, and should be eliminated.&quot;  <BR>
(10994)	(more)<BR>

<P>
<P>Q:		YOU SAY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN YEARS TO ACHIEVE.  WHAT DO YOU MEAN?<BR>

<P>A:		Chrysler has made considerable investment in product - about $30 million - to produce a right-hand drive Jeep Cherokee for the Japanese market, despite the fact that volumes did not warrant it.  Background work leading up to CJSL's application for TDA has been on-going.  The last step in the process was the application.<BR>
Q:		WILL CHRYSLER'S FUTURE VOLUME INCREASE AS A RESULT OF THE TDA APPROVAL?<BR>

<P>A:		Chrysler's planned volume in 1994 is for 10,000 Jeeps.  Those orders were in hand prior to the designation, and therefore cannot be attributed to it.  The designation will eliminate steps to get those vehicles into the hands of Japanese consumers.<BR>

<P>Q:		IT SEEMS THE JAPANESE ARE REALLY MAKING AN EFFORT TO OPEN THEIR MARKETS, YET YOU STILL ARE NOT SATISFIED.  WHY NOT?<BR>

<P>In 1994, total import penetration into Japan from all countries was 201,481 vehicles, out of a market of 6.5 million.  That is 3.12 percent.   Last year, Japanese exports to the U.S. totalled 1.6 million units, out of a market of 14 million.  Imports from Japan were about 11.4 percent of the U.S. market, and total imports (excluding those from Canada and Mexico) were 15.3 percent.  <BR>

<P>Therefore, by any definition, the Japanese market is not open.  The U.S. takes in 5 times more imports by percent of market than Japan.  As long as the trade deficit between the U.S. and Japan is $59 billion, we will not be satisfied.<BR>

<P>Q:		WILL THIS ELIMINATE ALL DIFFICULTIES IN PROCESSING CHRYSLER VEHICLES IN JAPAN?<BR>

<P>This is the most expedited designation an imported vehicle can have in Japan, but is a long way from eliminating all difficulties in processing the Jeep Cherokee, let alone the other vehicles that we would like to sell in Japan which do not have this designation.<BR>

<P>The four hour registration process at MOT's land office is an obvious disincentive to any sales people working in Japan with a choice of selling an imported vehicle or a Japanese vehicle.  They lose a half day with the sale of every imported car not certified under the TDA system.<BR>
(10994-A)<BR>
(more)<BR>

<P>Q:		DOES THIS SIGNAL THE OPENING OF THE JAPANESE MARKET TO AMERICAN PRODUCTS?<BR>

<P>It is a small step toward eliminating some of the burdens of exporting Jeeps to Japan. It does not mean that Japan has provided reciprocal access to their market.  There is still a long way to go.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Connecticut Geography Bee winner Stephen Fan, of Norwich, Conn., may have lost the National Geography Bee title, but he is still a winner.  <BR>
	The 13-year old took top creative honors in Chrysler's Dream Geography Journey and as a result he's headed West.<BR>
	The Dream Geography Journey competition, developed in conjunction with the 1995 National Geography Bee, asked students to show their practical knowledge of geography by planning their own 10-day minivan dream vacation.  Fan mapped out a winning route to the Great Smoky Mountains.<BR>
	The first leg of Fan's &quot;Great Smoky Road Trip&quot; begins in Norwich, Conn. on August 9.  The trip continues for 10 days through Hershey, Pa.,  Pittsburgh, Pa.; Fallingwater, Pa.; Kentucky Horse Farm, Lexington; Mammoth Cave National Park; Chattanooga, Tenn.; and Ruby Falls.  On the journey home, Fan continues on the Blue Ridge Parkway to Richmond, Va.; Baltimore, Md.; and Philadelphia, Pa.<BR>

	While on his trip, Fan and his family will tour the Hershey's chocolate factory, Frank Lloyd Wright's &quot;Fallingwater,&quot; and The Biltmore Estate.  They will also explore the Mammoth-Flint Cave System, Fort McHenry and the National Aquarium in Baltimore, and Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia.<BR>
	&quot;With this Dream Geography Journey contest, the students got a chance to take geography out of the classrooms and onto the roads of the continental United States,&quot; said Jim Julow, Director of Marketing Operations for Chrysler Corporation.  &quot;Like the National Geography Bee, we think our contest will continue to educate and excite the students and their families about the world we live in.&quot;<BR>
	<B><I>Please note:  Stephen and his family will be available for interviews and photo opportunities as they load their minivan with luggage on Tuesday, August 8 from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Wednesday, August 9 at 7 a.m. at their Norwich home:</I></B><BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER BRIEFING DEALERS ON EFFECT OF OTC PROPOSAL</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation officials are meeting with Chrysler dealers throughout the Northeast states this week to prepare them for the economic impact of impending Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) clean air regulations.  <BR>
	In all, 11 dealer groups in cities from Boston to Richmond, Virginia are being briefed on the competitive and pricing issues they may be facing if the OTC adopts its current petition which includes a Zero Emission Vehicle (or electric vehicle) mandate for some states.  While Chrysler announced last May that it will have an electric vehicle to meet the mandate, it is asking dealers to get behind an alternative 49-state plan that the EPA is evaluating which would meet the OTC clean air goals at much lower cost to consumers.<BR>
	With the EV mandate, which is currently in place in Massachusetts' and New York's Clean Air Act State Implementation Plans (SIP), car prices in the Northeast could jump by as much as $2,700 to off-set the high cost of electric vehicles.  <BR>
 	Since the OTC petition is patterned after California's program which affects only the seven manufacturers with vehicle productions higher than 35,000 in that state, significant competitive business issues are at hand for dealers.<BR>
	<BR>
(more)<BR>
(38194-S)<BR>
-2-<BR>
	&quot;For instance, Chrysler and Mitsubishi offer a joint-venture vehicle built by Diamond-Star Motors in Normal, Ill. that's marketed as the Eagle Talon and the Mitsubishi Eclipse,&quot; said Reg Modlin, manager of Environmental &amp; Regulatory Affairs.  &quot;While the two vehicles are essentially the same car marketed under different names, the Mitsubishi product would be priced thousands of dollars lower, since Mitsubishi is not affected by the regulation due to lower production volumes.  If you're the consumer, which vehicle would you buy?&quot; <BR>
	Chrysler officials contend the 49-state plan will fully meet the clean air goals of the OTC states, but at a cost of about $500, or possibly less.  Otherwise, dealers are faced with the electric vehicle mandate which calls for two percent of a manufacturers vehicles to be electric in 1998.  However, very low driving range performance due to cold weather conditions and high projected costs pose a poor market outlook for electric vehicles in the Northeast.<BR>
	Costs were compiled in a study by Sierra Research, an independent research firm in Sacramento Calif., which estimated electric vehicles at about $21,000 above gasoline vehicles in the 1998-2000 time frame.  Absorbing that cost, as well as other parts of the OTC Low Emission Vehicle program, across Northeast vehicle inventories could boost prices by more than $2,700 per vehicle.  Dealers would also lose the ability to trade vehicles from inventory with neighboring states outside of the OTC, hampering their ability to do business as usual.<BR>

<P>(more)<BR>
-3-<BR>
	&quot;Clearly, the research shows that an electric vehicle mandate is an ineffective and costly option,&quot; said Modlin.  &quot;Its cost (the EV mandate) will increase the price of other cars and could have a detrimental impact on the region's economy.  There are other options which will meet the Massachusetts Clean Air Act credit goals without the EV mandate that will not cost consumers and dealers exorbitant amounts of money. These options have been opposed politically.	<BR>
	&quot;What it really comes down to is that consumers will ultimately pay the price of whatever regulatory plan is implemented,&quot; Modlin said.  &quot;The ZEV option is by far the most costly.  But the real shocker is that the cost will not net an improvement in air quality over other less costly options.  EPA has already conducted a draft analysis which indicates increased electricity production in coal burning plants for an EV fleet could off-set the effect of the EV mandate.&quot;<BR>
	The draft analysis, as reported in the Wall Street Journal and Business Week, assessed the effect of increased coal-burning electricity production to fuel the ZEV fleet.  When fully accounted and averaged across the fleet, indications are electric vehicles offer no air quality advantage over the very low emission gasoline vehicles scheduled for the late '90s.<BR>
	Cities on the tour to date include Hartford, Connecticut;  Bangor, Maine;  Baltimore, Maryland; Boston, Massachusetts; Lebanon, New Hampshire;  Albany, Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse, New York;  Providence, Rhode Island; and Richmond, Virginia. <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> In 1991, a car unlike any other appeared at the front of the Indianapolis 500 field.  Fast, loud and unrestrained, it reintroduced the classic American sports car and showcased the beginning of a Chrysler Corporation product renaissance.  On May 26, 1991, one of the first chapters in the history of Dodge Viper RT/10 was written.<BR>
	Fast-forward exactly five years to May 26, 1996, where Viper historians will pen another exciting chapter in the car's short but storied history as the 1996 Dodge Viper GTS Coupe will pace the 80th running of the Indianapolis 500.<BR>
	The 1996 Indy 500 will mark the first major public introduction of the next generation of Viper, the Viper GTS Coupe.  The metallic blue Viper will not require any powertrain modifications in order to meet Indy pace car standards and is nearly identical to the production version due out in the Spring of 1996.<BR>

	&quot;As members of the Viper team, we hold a special affection for the Indy 500,&quot; said Dodge General Manager Marty Levine.  &quot;The 1991 race was the major launching pad for Viper, exposing it to the millions of race fans all over the world as a vehicle worthy of pacing America's most famous race.  The Viper pace car not only allowed us to show the creative spirit of Chrysler Corporation, but helped re-position Dodge as the performance division of the Company.&quot; <BR>
	The 1991 race was indeed a significant mile marker in the development of Viper.  Originating from a discussion among some of Chrysler's senior executives -- President Bob Lutz, Vice President of Design Tom Gale and Vice President of Vehicle Engineering Francois Castaing, along with racing legend Carroll Shelby -- the idea behind Viper was to meld the back-to-basics performance of the classic '60s roadsters with the technology and refinement of the '90s.<BR>
	After the overwhelmingly positive reaction following Viper's debut as a concept car at the 1989 North American International Auto Show, the &quot;go-ahead&quot; was given in May of 1990 to make a limited-run production version.  By May of 1991, a prototype version would be the first Viper to be driven in public, pacing the 1991 Indianapolis 500.  The media attention and television exposure on ABC-TV's broadcast of the race would spark a media and consumer frenzy unlike anything Chrysler had ever seen.<BR>

	Just six month later - and exactly three years after its debut at the auto show - the first production Viper would headline the 1992 North American International Auto Show and fill the dreams of prospective owners from around the world.<BR>
	Appropriately enough, the 1996 Dodge Viper GTS Coupe pace car will be driven by one of its fathers, Chrysler President and Chief Operating Officer Robert A. Lutz, an accomplished rally driver and pilot.<BR>
	&quot;No matter where you are in the world, the Indianapolis 500 is recognized as an American tradition,&quot; Lutz said.  &quot;To be a part of it in 1996 is going to be one of the biggest thrills of my life.&quot;<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> After carefully reviewing the multitude of product offerings available in today's automotive marketplace, Evelyn Y. Davis has made a decision on which new vehicle is best for her:  the all-new 1995 Chrysler Cirrus LX.<BR>
	Davis, the well-known shareholder advocate and editor of &quot;Highlights and Lowlights&quot; (a publication that reports on major shareholder meetings and the Washington, D.C. scene), will be presented the keys to her Cirrus by Chrysler Corporation Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert J. Eaton in September  in Washington, D.C.  Davis will be one of the first in the nation to take delivery of the new sedan.<BR>
	Eaton made the promise to personally deliver the Cirrus to Davis following Chrysler Corporation's annual meeting earlier this year in Toledo, Ohio.  Davis had said she was shopping for a vehicle that suited her personal needs.  She asked for specific information from each of the Big Three CEOs  before deciding on the Cirrus.<BR>

<P>(37394)	- 2 -<BR>

<P>	Developed to go head-to-head with the major import competition, the luxury sports sedan features Chrysler's cab-forward architecture for a roomy interior, and offers more standard equipment at a lower cost than any vehicle in its class.<BR>
	Standard features include dual airbags; four-wheel antilock brakes; a 2.5-liter, 24-valve V6 engine; one of the largest trunk volumes and the largest trunk pass through in its class; rear seat heat; two cup holders capable of holding sport bottles; a juice holder for rear seat passengers; remote keyless entry with a panic alarm; and an available integrated child safety seat.<BR>
	Production of Chrysler Cirrus began this month at Chrysler Corporation's Sterling Heights (Mich.) Assembly Plant, and will go &quot;officially&quot; on sale at Chrysler/Plymouth dealerships throughout the United States at the end of October 1994.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>The new Dodge Stratus will be introduced for the first time to millions of television viewers during the Super Bowl game on Sunday, January 29.<BR>
	A 30-second spot just prior to the opening kick-off will be followed by two additional 30-second airings during the game's first quarter -- all featuring the Stratus, the all-new four-door compact sedan from Dodge.<BR>
	&quot;We want to accomplish three things for Stratus with these ads,&quot; said Martin R. Levine, Dodge General Manager.  &quot;We want people to see the car, we want to establish awareness for the new name, and we want to position the car.  The Super Bowl allows us to accomplish those objectives by providing millions of viewers -- many of whom are in the Dodge Stratus target market -- and by being perfectly timed from a strategic point of view for our launch.&quot;<BR>
	Levine said the new advertising will set the foundation for a unique campaign that will continue to roll out through the vehicle launch period -- a strategy similar to last year's Super Bowl introduction of the Neon.  &quot;Without giving away our surprise, I can only say that this advertising is unique, and the car will be the star,&quot; he added.<BR>
(00895)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	For Dodge, the impact of Super Bowl advertising will be made even stronger this year by a one-minute commercial featuring the Division's complete lineup which will also air in most major markets during the game's first quarter.  The ad, entitled 'Changes' will be sponsored through a cooperative effort in those markets by Dodge Dealer Associations.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Ellis, Kansas -- </B>Walter P. Chrysler left his boyhood home in Ellis, Kansas to work for the railroad business. He was later inspired by a sleek car in the Chicago Auto Show to start working for the automotive business in Detroit. This past weekend Chrysler Corporation honored him by participating in the museum dedication ceremonies. <BR>
	The weekend activities brought out 850 people to the Hometown Barbeque on Friday.  On Saturday, 950 people attended the Mopar Classic Car Parade with 150 Chyrsler vehicles. They stayed for the ribbon cutting ceremony and went through the museum.<BR>
	The keynote speaker at the ribbon cutting ceremony was Patrick J. Keegan, Director of Corporate Merchandising and Special Events, and he is on the Chrysler Historical Foundation Advisory Committee. He spoke about Walter P. Chrysler's history and introduced Ellis, Kansas as the place where Chrysler acquired his values to build, what is today, one of the top ten Fortune 500 Corporations.<BR>

<P>	Walter P. Chrysler's great-grandson, Frank P. Rhodes, Jr., organized the museum and spoke at the ceremony. Rhodes said this year is special because it's the 40th Anniversary of the Walter P. Chrysler Boyhood Home, adjacent to the new museum.<BR>
	Rhodes said his family donated Walter P. Chrysler memorabilia to the museum including original letters written by Chrysler while working on the railroad and at Buick, and films of Walter P. Chrysler's life dating 1928, 1930 and 1940. <BR>
	A 1924 Chrysler convertible Phaeton prototype car and a 1989 Dodge Viper concept car  will be on display for the next six weeks at the museum. <BR>
	To add to the museum, Chrysler Corporation donated $60,000 to the project including filling the museum gift shop with Mopar merchandise.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>When Chrysler engineers and designers need a respite from creating new vehicles at the new Chrysler Technology Center (CTC) in Auburn Hills, Michigan, they can walk outside to a nature trail which wanders a quarter mile through nearby woods and wetlands.<BR>
	They can ponder work on their latest automotive developments as woodpeckers and great blue heron fly above the woods where white tail deer, red fox and muskrats also make their homes.  That is just some of the wildlife on site, according to a CTC site study by Swanson Environmental Inc.<BR>
	According to Kathy Spillane, Chrysler's manager of Environmental Code compliance, &quot;Architects designed CTC to highlight the surrounding nature.  Our environmental goal was to create a harmonious relationship between the development and the site.&quot;<BR>
	The design and construction of the CTC resulted in an unusual relationship between high technology and nature.<BR>
	&quot;At dusk, before the crews would leave for home, a few of them would take time to visit the nature trails to observe the deer,&quot; said Bob Kupisch, <BR>

<P>retired program manager of Construction and Planning.<BR>
	Two-story glass walls in the main employee dining room overlook a grove of black walnut trees.  A landscaped part with flowering crab trees and seasonal flowers tops the guest parking structure.  Elm, maple, willow and dogwood are among the 4,000 trees planted around the complex.<BR>
	An evaluation road for testing vehicles encircles 20.5 acres of wetlands inhabited by scores of turtles, green sunfish, frogs and toads.<BR>
	&quot;Chrysler monitors the water run-off from CTC to the Galloway Creek north of CTC.  They inspected the water for purity and run-off rates.<BR>
	&quot;We are very concerned that the water of the Galloway Creek is as pure when it leaves the site as when it flowed into it,&quot; Kupisch said.<BR>
	Chrysler created detention ponds to protect the creek.  Water from parking lots and roads drain into one of three detention ponds, according to Lynn Drinan, Chrysler environmental safety specialist.  These ponds are equipped with a slow sand filter system which filters out oils, greases and sediment.<BR>
	CTC planners also exceeded state and local requirements by designing a sewer system independent from the city system in anticipation of the need to treat processed water.<BR>

<P><B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced pricing for the all-new 1997 Dodge Dakota compact pickup. <BR>
	<P>The new Dakota lineup reflects a consolidation of models that will offer significantly more standard features than the trucks they replace. Dodge has consolidated its former Work Special, Sport and Base models on its Regular and Club Cab Dakotas into one Base model for each cab configuration.<BR>
	<P>Regular Cab models now include as standard: driver- and passenger-side air bags, four-speaker AM/FM cassette stereo, larger tires, rear solar glass and cargo tie-down hooks. The Club Cab models now include all those features plus a 40/20/40 seat with center armrest storage system, driver's seat lumbar adjustment and premium cloth upholstery.<BR>
	<P>&quot;By simplifying our product line, we now offer Dakota customers an entry-level truck that is significantly richer in content than its predecessor, while staying price competitive with the other trucks in the compact market,&quot; said Dodge General Manager Martin R. Levine. <BR>
	<P>&quot;It was imperative, even though we were introducing an all-new vehicle, that we stay with our strategy of offering the most powerful, roomiest and most capable truck in the compact segment at an affordable price,&quot; Levine said. &quot;We've done that.&quot;<BR>
	<P>Base models of the Regular Cab will be offered in short wheelbase 4x2 and 4x4, and long wheelbase 4x2 configurations. Base Club Cab models include short wheelbase 4x2 and 4x4 editions. <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation's  aggressive program to attract younger first-time buyers exceeded 1993 expectations by 36 percent and topped the previous 1992 record by nearly 52 percent.<BR>
	The College Graduate Program, which offers the first-time buyers a $400 cash incentive to purchase a Chrysler product, attracted 41,191 consumers in 1993, up from the 27,122 buyers in 1992.<BR>
	Chrysler's program has developed steadily since it was introduced in 1988. Since then sales have climbed from a modest 9,188 to the 1993 record. Sales in 1989 were 15,819; 1990 sales were 19,325; and 1991 sales were 19,346.<BR>
	A. C. &quot;Bud&quot; Liebler, Chrysler's Vice President -- Marketing and Communications, said the increase in sales under the college program reflects the company's introduction of exciting new products in the last two years. <BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>- Leading a healthy lifestyle is the message of the Jeep&reg; and Eagle Collegiate Health &amp; Fitness Tour, which will visit 50 college campuses across the country over the 1994/95 school year.<BR>
	The traveling caravan includes fun activities designed to promote physical fitness in a way that is consistent with a '90s lifestyle.  Among the many activities offered, students can have themselves flung on to an inflatable velcro wall, climb a rock wall, or new for this year, compete in the bungee run.<BR>
	  &quot;As sponsor, Jeep and Eagle is promoting fun, health and fitness with responsible behavior and lifestyles,&quot; said Ed Brust, Jeep and Eagle Division General Manager.  &quot;I want the young people to come out and have a great time -- we believe having fun can be accomplished responsibly.&quot; <BR>
	 In conjunction with Jeep and Eagle, the National Health Council has identified issues important to college students and incorporated them into the<U> Guide to a Healthier You</U> for quick use and provides students with an easy-to-use health guide reference book.  <BR>
	Jeep and Eagle has also teamed-up with several impressive co-sponsors to give students a wide range of activities and information on fitness and healthy lifestyles.<BR>
(40294)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	&quot;All of the supporting co-sponsors are really backing our healthy lifestyle theme,&quot; added Brust.  &quot;It's evident in the issues they are championing which include proper diet, mental health, alcohol abuse and prevention, avoiding drugs and cancer prevention.&quot;<BR>
	In addition, Jeep and Eagle encourages the local campus medical groups to become active communicators of the healthy lifestyle message, by offering them their own tent and equipment to test the physical condition and endurance of participants.<BR>
	Jeep and Eagle also has its line-up of vehicles on display for interested students.  <BR>

	<P>U.S. sales totaled 205,393 vehicles, compared with 166,823 in October 1995 and surpassing an October record of 176,339 set in 1972. It was Chrysler's 12th consecutive month with a year-over-year sales rate increase.<BR>
	<P>&quot;It's a solid signal that buyers are just as enthusiastic about our 1997 models as they were for 1996,&quot; said James P. Holden, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing.  <BR>
	<P>&quot;We were ahead of last year across the board -- in small cars, large cars, minivans, trucks and Jeep&reg; vehicles,&quot; Holden said. &quot;It was our best October total and we set a retail record, as well.&quot;<BR>
	<P>Car sales were 61,213, compared with 53,336 a year ago -- a daily sales rate increase of 11 percent. The sales total for trucks -- including minivans and Jeep&reg; vehicles -- was 144,180 in October, compared with 113,487 a year ago.<BR>
<P> The daily sales rate for trucks increased 22 percent.<BR>
	<P>U.S. sales of Chrysler, Plymouth, Dodge, Jeep&reg; and Eagle vehicles totaled 2,091,394 for the first 10 months of 1996 for a daily sales rate 15 percent ahead of last year. Year-to-date passenger car sales through October were 7 percent higher; trucks were up 19 percent.<BR>
	<P>Also among Chrysler's October results:<BR>
	<P>-- The 35th consecutive monthly sales record for Dodge Ram Pickup and the 18th consecutive record for Dodge Truck. Ram Pickup sales were 40 percent ahead of last year's October rate.<BR>
	<P>-- Sales of Dodge Dakota Pickup, all new for 1997, surged 50 percent from the previous month and were 13 percent higher than a year ago.  <BR>
	<P>-- October records were set for Dodge Stratus and the combined sales of JA-body cars, the Stratus, Chrysler Cirrus and Plymouth Breeze.<BR>
	<P>-- Dodge Neon set a new high for October, and combined Dodge and Plymouth Neon sales also broke a monthly record. <BR>
	<P>-- Chrysler Sebring Convertible broke a monthly record set by its predecessor, the LeBaron convertible, for the third month in a row.<BR>
	<P>-- Bolstered by the fourth straight monthly record for Dodge Caravan and the 18th for Chrysler Town &amp; Country, Chrysler Corporation's minivans set a new high for October.<BR>

CHRYSLER UNVEILS 1996 NASCAR SUPERTRUCK TEAMS - <BR>
PETTY RETURNS TO DODGE</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced its primary factory-supported racing teams for the 1996 NASCAR SuperTruck series. Each of the one-truck teams will have a working relationship with the Dodge Truck platform team during the 1996 season developing the engine and aerodynamic package.<BR>
	Having our platform team directly involved with developing the Dodge Ram pickup for NASCAR SuperTruck racing gives the teams access to Chryslers advanced engineering tools and in-house expertise, said Francois Castaing, Vice President of Vehicle Engineering.  This fits in with our unique motorsports philosophy of doing the important development inside the company, instead of just buying it.<BR>
	For instance, factory-supported teams will benefit from the current aerodynamic development being conducted by the platform team at the full-size Lockheed wind tunnel in Marietta, Georgia.  The trucks are also being digitized for analysis on Chryslers Cray supercomputer, and an intensive <BR>
(37995)	(more)<BR>
	-2-<BR>
engine development program is being undertaken by the Dodge Truck <BR>
platform team.<BR>
	The teams and two of the Dodge Ram 1500 SuperTrucks were unveiled during a press conference today at Chryslers Headquarters.	<BR>
	Longtime Dodge and Plymouth racer Richard Petty has teamed with businessmen David and Bobby Gandy to bring the legendary #43 to the Dodge Truck camp.  The primary sponsor is Cummins Engine Co., Inc.  Cummins is a supplier of diesel engines for the Dodge Ram pickup.  The driver selection process is underway.<BR>
	Last year's top independent Dodge Ram SuperTruck owner Grier Lackey will again field the #30 Ram pickup.  Owner of Grandaddy Racing, Lackey has secured top short-track driver Jimmy Hensley.  Chrysler's Mopar Parts Division will be the primary sponsor.<BR>
	Two other teams will also receive secondary factory sponsorship, as well as full technical assistance.<BR>
	Walker Evans, a longtime Dodge Truck racer, is the owner of the #20 Ram truck.  One of three independents in 1995 who ran the Ram, Evans will have the support of the factory along with the sponsorship of Barbary Coast for 1996.  The driver for the Evans team has not yet been determined.<BR>
	K Automotive, which ran the #29  Dodge Ram 1500 in the 1995 season, is another factory-supported team.  Owner Ron Keselowski and <BR>
	-3-<BR>
driver Bob Keselowski are brothers who have been racing Chrysler products on the oval tracks for decades.  K Automotive was a test bed for the current <BR>
generation of racing blocks and heads in the SuperTruck series while campaigning in the ARCA series.  Keselowski will retain his Winnebago sponsorship for 1996.<BR>
	To entice other teams to run a Dodge Ram pickup, Chrysler has created the Run With The Ram program.  Aggressive, professional race teams can take advantage of factory contingency and bonus payouts, free sheet metal and engine parts upon sign-up, and a parts allowance plan.  Factory engineering and testing support will also be available to the teams.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Arch Canyon, one of the most beautiful places in all of Utah's Canyon Lands, plays host to Chrysler Corporation's seventh Arch Canyon Jeep&reg; Jamboree April 21 - 23.<BR>
	The only Jamboree to feature prehistoric mastadons, this trek through Arch Canyon is a journey back in time. Ancient petroglyphs or rock inscriptions, etched in the rocks of the canyon depict people, animals, and even mastadons--giant tusked creatures that roamed the earth over 10,000 years ago.<BR>
	&quot;This historical adventure will offer off-road enthusiasts the opportunity to experience a lost civilization,&quot; said Ed Brust, General Manager, Jeep and Eagle Division.  &quot;In Arch Canyon, our line of Jeep vehicles--Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Wrangler--become time machines transporting participants back 10,000 years.&quot;<BR>
	The trip includes visits to picturesque Arch Canyon and Hotel Rock, the ruins of the cliff-dwelling Anasazi Indians. For thousands of years they flourished throughout the four corners area. Remnants of their past can be seen in almost every canyon in southern Utah.<BR>

	- 2 -<BR>
	&quot;Winding their way down rock trails and driving among the ponderosas in beautiful Arch Canyon are just a part of this jamboree experience,&quot; said Brust.  &quot;It's a part of that Jeep mystique to be able to go to some seldom seen, hard-to-reach place.&quot;<BR>
	Jeep enthusiasts will have an opportunity to encounter a variety of <BR>
off-road driving conditions at Arch Canyon: sand, both packed and loose; creek crossings with small rock and soft sediment; sand stone, smooth and broken; and steep rock, both up and down.<BR>
	&quot;The challenges are continuous,&quot; said Mark Smith, a technical consultant for Chrysler Corporation's Jeep and Eagle Division. &quot;First timers will not believe what their Jeep vehicles are capable of -- it never ceases to amaze even the most seasoned driver.&quot;  Smith said the road is forever changing with the winters run off and the conditions just can not be predicted. Whatever the conditions, Smith adds that momentum and smooth handling are the key.<BR>
	&quot;Buckle up your seat belt and go at a steady pace,&quot; says Smith. &quot;Once committed, don't change your mind, go straight and steady -- we'll help you.&quot;<BR>
	By following the direction of the experienced guides and some practice, Smith said participants in the seventh Arch Canyon and all other Jeep Jamborees will be able to get where they want to go with ease and safety.<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>The combination of value, versatility, capability and safety make the 1997 Dodge Ram Vans and Wagons a perfect match for the demanding commercial and personal van users.<BR>
	Offered in 1500, 2500 and 3500 models, Ram Vans and Wagons feature a strong and light unibody design which provides for superior payload per pound of vehicle weight and increased towing capacity.  Properly equipped, Ram Vans can tow up to 9,000 lbs, Ram Wagons up to 8,600 lbs.<BR>
	Ram Vans offer 304.5 cubic feet of cargo room in the Maxivan model, making them top choices for conversion van specialists and commercial users.  Ram Wagons are available with five- or eight-passenger seating in the 109-inch short wheelbase model, up to twelve-passenger seating in the 127-inch long wheelbase model and up to fifteen-passenger seating in the 127-inch Maxiwagon.<BR>
	For 1997, there's a new CNG-Fueled engine on the 3500 Maxivan and Wagon, improved anti-theft ignition switches, upgraded base and cassette radios and wider opening side and rear cargo doors.<BR>
	All Ram Van and Wagon models are equipped with a standard driver-side air bag, center-high mounted stoplight and side door beams.  Four-wheel anti-lock brakes are available on all Van and Wagon models.  Handling is enhanced by a standard independent front suspension/wishbone coil spring setup; gas charged front and rear shocks; front stabilizer bar and variable-ratio standard power-assisted steering.<BR>
	Providing power to Ram Vans and Wagons is the powerful Dodge line of sequential multi-port fuel-injected Magnum engines.  The standard engine for the 1500 and 2500 models is the 175-horsepower 3.9-liter Magnum V-6.  The standard engine for the 3500 models is the 5.2-liter Magnum V-8, which generates 220 horsepower.  A 230-horsepower,  5.9-liter V-8 is available on the 2500 and 3500 models.<BR>
	All engines are mated to a three- or an electronically-controlled four-speed automatic transmission. <BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B><B> </B>Chrysler Corporation's Sales and Service organizations became fully integrated this week with the adoption of a single manager organization at each of the Company's 25 U.S. zone offices.  The change follows the appointment late last month of E. T. Tom Pappert to the position of Vice President -- Sales and Service.<BR>
	&quot;We now have one person in each zone, and one person in the Corporate offices, who is ultimately responsible and accountable for the entire ownership experience of our customers -- from the time they first step into the showroom, through all their vehicle servicing needs,&quot; Pappert said.  &quot;Gone are days when it's just someone's job to sell the car, and someone else's job to fix it after that.  We don't do business that way anymore, so why would we want to be organized that way?&quot;<BR>
	The zone office organization now includes one zone manager and two assistant managers for sales and service -- eliminating the previous arrangement of dual zone managers and their assistants reporting to separate organizations.  Twenty-one former zone managers and assistant managers were re-deployed to positions in related fields, including customer relations, marketing, sales planning, and service program development. <BR>

<P>	&quot;Except for a couple people who retired, we've capitalized on this opportunity to fold a wealth of field experience and customer knowledge back into the organization in key management roles.  In effect, we've put the people who've been closest to the problems in charge of designing the solutions,&quot; Pappert said.<BR>

DODGE IS MOST VALUED FRANCHISE,</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Dodge Division has been rated the top franchise by its dealers, according to the latest National Automobile Dealers Association (NADA) Dealer Attitude Survey.  Dodge replaced Saturn as the top franchise to own, based on a criteria of overall value, manufacturer policy and relationships with people.  Jeep/Eagle placed third in the survey, with Chrysler-Plymouth advancing to fifth place.<BR>
	Twice a year, the NADA surveys its dealers on a variety of issues related to their relationship to automotive manufacturers.  The survey results are designed to provide insight into enhancing the relationship between dealers and automakers.  In the NADA Winter 93/94 survey, according to the 590 Dodge dealers surveyed, Dodge dealers rank their relationship with Dodge Division as best among the 32 franchises polled.  <BR>
	&quot;We are absolutely ecstatic,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Chrysler Executive Vice President, Sales &amp; Marketing and General Manager - Minivan Operations.  &quot;This is further validation that all the effort we have spent building the best possible relationship with our dealers is paying off.  Not only is Dodge number one, but Jeep/Eagle and Chrysler-Plymouth are in the top five.&quot;<BR>

<P>	The NADA survey reports that &quot;franchise value assessment among Chrysler (Corporation) dealers is at an all-time high.&quot;  Dodge advanced from third to first since the Spring 1993 survey, with Chrysler-Plymouth moving from sixth to fifth place.  Jeep-Eagle moved from second to third overall, replaced by previously top-rated Saturn.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>When the Mayflower sailing ship badge first appeared on Plymouth vehicles in 1928, it was said to represent the &quot;endurance and strength, rugged honesty...and freedom from limitations.&quot;  In 1995, a post-modern version of the badge returns to signify the brand's rejuvenated image of freedom and expressiveness.<BR>
	The new badge, unveiled today at the North American International Auto Show, will begin appearing later this year on the Plymouth Neon and the new Plymouth Voyager.<BR>
		&quot;This badge represents more than just a logo change for Plymouth,&quot; said Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager Steve Torok. &quot;It serves as a symbolic confirmation of the fundamental values of the new Plymouth; to provide compelling and expressively-designed vehicles to the entry-level market.&quot;  <BR>
	The Mayflower badge, in its original form, appeared on millions of Plymouth vehicles from 1928 through the 1950's.<BR>

 CHRYSLER'S COMMITMENT TO CULTURAL CHANGE<BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Dramatically improving the showroom experience is at the forefront of Chrysler Corporation's agenda, as demonstrated in its most recent advertising campaign and the most intensive dealer training effort in company history.<BR>
	&quot;We haven't completed the cultural change, that would be overstating the case, but we are three years into the process and beginning to see results,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing and General Manager - Minivan Operations.  &quot;We've made a substantial investment since instituting our Customer One cultural change program, and while we have seen customer satisfaction scores improve, we know its a never-ending process with promise of a bigger payoff down the road.&quot;<BR>
	Now is the ideal time to talk to consumers about the company's cultural change, Cunningham said, with the successful launches of the new Neon, available from Plymouth and Dodge; Jeep Grand Cherokee and Eagle Vision; Chrysler Concorde, New Yorker and LHS, and Dodge Intrepid and Ram.  <BR>
	&quot;We're reaching new customers with these exciting, innovative products,&quot; Cunningham said.  &quot;These are people who, two years ago, would never have considered a Chrysler product.<BR>
(07294)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>

<P>	&quot;They need to know the dramatic change isn't limited to just our products.  Every facet of the Chrysler experience is being scrutinized in order to improve the customer's experience.&quot;<BR>
	The &quot;Customer One&quot; dealer training program has now entered Phase V and more than 100,000 dealership personnel have been trained since the beginning of the year.  Instructors and facilitators will have visited more than 3,800 dealerships in less than 60 days.<BR>
	Chrysler executives have added some new wrinkles to &quot;Customer One.&quot;  Every employee is now included in half-day seminars on competitive product comparisons, how to &quot;delight customers&quot; and creating a no-pressure sales experience.  Initially, only the owners of dealerships and their sales managers were trained.<BR>
	Also, dealers are encouraged to host the training exercises, rather than sending employees to a neutral site.  Lastly, Chrysler sales and service personnel are taking a more active role in the training exercises.  In the past, outside firms were used exclusively for instruction.<BR>
	  Training will be completed by the end of February, just as the &quot;Customer One&quot; advertising campaign begins.<BR>
	The spots use apples and bees -- not cars -- to convey the message.<BR>
	In a 30-second spot titled &quot;Apples&quot;, the camera zooms in on a bushel of shiny apples as a hand reaches in to remove one bad apple from the bunch.  In the spot, &quot;Honeycomb&quot;, 65,000 &quot;extras&quot; buzz around the hive to produce honey and emphasize that great results require teamwork.<BR>

<P>	A total of 14 &quot;Customer One&quot; spots will air on the Winter Olympics, beginning Feb. 13.  Bozell/North, formerly CME KHBB, Detroit, created the two TV spots and three print ads.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>-- For the first time since it re-entered the international marketplace in 1987, Chrysler broke the 100,000 yearly retail sales barrier in sales outside North America in 1993.<BR>
	Retail sales totaled 105,849 units for a 45 percent increase over calendar-year 1992.  Chrysler Corporation had total international sales of 132,123 units, including wholesale CKD shipments and sales to U.S. military personnel outside of North America, for the January through December period, a 26 percent increase over 1992.<BR>
	Chrysler's minivan, called the Chrysler Voyager in most markets outside North America, remained the single highest selling retail unit for the company internationally.  Minivan sales for 1993 were 33,895 units, compared to 26,695 units in 1992.<BR>
	The Voyager was followed by the Jeep Cherokee and Grand Cherokee, respectively.  Cherokee sales increased 41 percent to 24,837 for the year, while Grand Cherokee, in its first full year on the international market, closed the year with 11,025 units sold.<BR>

Gale, Vice President of Design and International Operations for the company.  &quot;We're seeing the vehicles that are popular in North America are also popular in markets outside this region.<BR>
	&quot;Quality, vehicle packaging and superb dynamics are all reasons to buy a product in any market worldwide,&quot; he continued.  &quot;And as we get more involved in these international markets, we find that some attributes that are prerequisites for entry in Europe, for example, can make the car better for the North American buyers as well.<BR>
	&quot;Chrysler International is fast becoming a two-way street.  The sales going out help our bottom line, and the input from our international customers is making our products better all the way around,&quot; he said.<BR>
	Europe continued as the largest retail market for Chrysler and Jeep vehicles in 1993, followed by the Asia-Pacific Region, the Latin American Region and the Middle East, respectively.  <BR>
	Retail sales in Europe increased by 35 percent for the year, despite a very sluggish market.  Germany led the region with sales of 15,528 units, a 16 percent increase over 1992.  France, Switzerland and Italy followed Germany with sales of 10,128; 5,494 and 5,240, respectively.<BR>

	In the Asia-Pacific Region, Taiwan was the volume leader, with sales of 9,123, or an eight percent increase.  Japan had an astounding 377 percent increase over 1992 to close 1993 with sales of 5,078, due primarily to the right-hand-drive Jeep Cherokee.  <BR>
	&quot;While we're proud of the work our distributor and sales people have done in Japan,&quot; Gale noted, &quot;we still need to put that growth into perspective.  Our market penetration does not indicate that we have full market access in Japan.  We believe that full access to the Japanese market is needed to ensure substantial future growth.&quot;<BR>
	Total Asia-Pacific sales were 21,599 for the year.<BR>
	Venezuela lead the Latin American Region with retail sales of 6,432 units for 1993, including the retail sales of kits assembled at Chrysler's plant in Caracas.  Other markets in Argentina, Columbia and Puerto Rico began operations later in 1993 and closed the year with combined sales of 5,022 vehicles.<BR>
	In the Middle East, Chrysler sales increase 12 percent for the year to 9,785.  Saudi Arabia lead the region with sales of 4,176 units, followed by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirate, with sales of 2,300 and 1,269, respectively.<BR>
	Wholesale shipments of Complete Knock Down (CKD) kits increased in Egypt and Venezuela, but were off significantly in China.  Total shipments for the year were  19,946, a decrease of 23 percent.  Venezuela posted a 39 percent gain to 3,816 units and Egypt closed the year with 2,592 shipments, compared to 792 in 1992.  Shipments to China decreased by 50 percent to 10,442 units, due primarily to tight monetary controls in the People's Republic and a stagnant economy.<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced that suggested retail prices of its 1997 model cars and light trucks will increase an average of 1.9 percent, or $422, over comparably equipped 1996 models.<BR>
	 <P>&quot;These prices for the new model year represent Chrysler's continuing effort to add customer-pleasing features and value to its cars, trucks, minivans and Jeep&reg; vehicles at the same time we find new efficiencies and ways to minimize cost increases,&quot; said James P. Holden, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing. <BR>
	 <P>&quot;Once again, we've held our average price increase below the rate of inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index,&quot; Holden said.<BR>
	 <P>Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Prices and destination charges for Chrysler's 1997 model cars and trucks are included below. Prices for 1997 models of the all-new Dodge Dakota Pickup, Jeep&reg; Cherokee, Chrysler Sebring,  Dodge Avenger and Dodge Viper will be announced later, at the time of their introductions.<BR>

&quot;HOME OF THE ANCIENT ONES&quot;<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Arch Canyon, one of the most beautiful places in all of Utah's Canyon Lands, plays host to the Jeep&reg; and Eagle Division's sixth Arch Canyon Jeep Jamboree April 8 - 10.<BR>
	The only Jamboree to feature prehistoric mastodons, this trek through Arch Canyon is a journey back in time. Ancient petroglyphs or rock inscriptions, etched in the rocks of the canyon depict people, animals, and even mastodons--giant tusked creatures that roamed the earth over 10,000 years ago.<BR>
	&quot;This historical adventure will offer off-road enthusiasts the opportunity to experience a lost civilization,&quot; said Bob Kirkwood, Jeep Merchandising Executive. &quot;In Arch Canyon, our line of Jeep vehicles--Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Wrangler--become time machines transporting participants back 10,000 years.&quot;<BR>
	The trip includes visits to picturesque Arch Canyon and Hotel Rock, the ruins of the cliff-dwelling Anasazi Indians. For thousands of years they flourished throughout the four corners area. Remnants of their past can be seen in almost every canyon in southern Utah.<BR>

	&quot;Winding their way down rock trails and driving among the ponderosas in beautiful Arch Canyon is just a part of this Jamboree experience,&quot; said Kirkwood. &quot;It's a part of that Jeep mystique to be able to go to some seldom seen, hard-to-reach place.&quot;<BR>
	Participants will come from 17 states for the 6th Arch Canyon Jeep Jamboree.  &quot;One of the great things about the Jamborees is the comradery that is developed between the friends that you make along the trail, from many states across the country,&quot; said Kirkwood.  &quot;It's really a remarkable thing.&quot;<BR>
	Jeep enthusiasts will have an opportunity to encounter a variety of off-road driving conditions at Arch Canyon: sand, both packed and loose; creek crossings with small rock and soft sediment; sand stone, smooth and broken; and steep rock, both up and down.<BR>
	&quot;The challenges are continuous,&quot; said Mark Smith, a technical consultant for the  Jeep and Eagle Division and Jeep Jamboree Founder.  &quot;First timers will not believe what their Jeep vehicles are capable of -- it never ceases to amaze even the most seasoned driver,&quot;  <BR>
	Smith said the road is forever changing with the winter's run-off and unpredictable weather conditions.  Whatever the conditions, Smith adds that momentum and smooth handling are the key.<BR>
	&quot;Buckle up your seat belt and go at a steady pace,&quot; says Smith. &quot;Once committed, don't change your mind, go straight and steady -- we'll help you.&quot;<BR>
	By following the direction of the experienced guides and some practice, Smith said participants in the sixth Arch Canyon and all other Jeep Jamborees will be able to get where they want to go with ease and safety.<BR>

4WHEEL &amp; OFF-ROADS 1996 &quot;4X4 OF THE YEAR&quot; AWARD<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Petersen's <U>4Wheel &amp; Off-Road</U> magazine announced today that the 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo V-8 has won its prestigious &quot;4x4 of the Year&quot; award.<BR>
	The 4Wheel &amp; Off-Road competition is open to all manufacturers of new or substantially redesigned trucks and sport-utility vehicles.  For 1996, Jeep Grand Cherokee was virtually redone within its original right-sized package.  Highlights of the more than forty major changes include an all-new interior and instrument panel with dual air bags, a host of new luxury features, substantial driveline improvements and exterior refinements.  <BR>
	This year's 4x4 of the Year competition featured the Range Rover 4.0; Nissan Pathfinder; Chevrolet Tahoe and K1500 pickup with the Easy-Access third door; Toyota Tacoma and T-100; Isuzu Rodeo; and Suzuki X-90.  The vehicles were tested over a four-week period both on-road and under tough off-highway conditions.<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	According to David Freiburger, 4Wheel &amp; Off-Road's editor, &quot;The V-8 Grand Cherokee is simply a terrific all-around performer in a great package.  On the track Grand Cherokee turned in the best acceleration times and recorded the shortest stopping distances.  Off-highway the 5.2 liter V-8 engine, revised wide-ratio 4-speed transmission and new On-Demand Quadra-Trac all-wheel drive system combined to deliver unbeatable 4x4 capability.<BR>
	&quot;Winning 4Wheel &amp; Off-Roads &quot;4x4 of the Year&quot; award underscores Grand Cherokees authentic Jeep capability and character, said Ed Brust, Jeep and Eagle Division Manager. Were thrilled to see Grand Cherokee come out on top of a very worthy group of 4x4 sport-utility and truck competitors.<BR>
	Jeep Grand Cherokee also won the 1993 4Wheel &amp; Off Road competition in its inaugural model year. <BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       New York, Ny -- </B><B>POPULAR SCIENCE</B> magazine honored the 1995 Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus as one of ten Grand Award winners in its seventh annual &quot;100 Best of What's New&quot; review in New York last week.  The magazine also selected the Patriot, Chrysler's experimental electric hybrid racing car, as one of the 100 honorees.<BR>
	The products are selected by the magazine's editors as the 100 most significant products representing the greatest achievements in 10 categories:  automotive technology, aviation, science &amp; technology, computers and electronics, cars, photography, recreation, home technology, environmental technology and audio and video.<BR>
	&quot;What really tipped the scales in Cirrus and Stratus'  favor was their interior spaciousness and ergonomics,&quot; said Richard Stepler, Editor of <B>POPULAR SCIENCE</B>.  &quot;It simply feels like a much bigger car on the inside than it does on the outside.  We felt that what you get for what you pay for is quite attractive.&quot;<BR>

<P>	&quot;Fresh thinking, aggressive styling, innovative engineering and attention to detail put these two 1995 models at the head of the pack,&quot;  added Fred Abatemarco, Editor-in-Chief, as he presented the award to Steve Torok, General Manager of the Chrysler-Plymouth Division.<BR>
	This is the second major award for the Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus. They also recently earned <B>POPULAR MECHANICS </B> &quot;Design and Engineering Award.&quot;  <BR>
	Developed to go head-to-head with the Japanese imports, the Cirrus luxury sports sedan comes well-equipped for thousands less than the competition and is powered by a 164 horsepower 2.5-liter V-6 engine mated to a four-speed fully adaptive four-speed automatic transmission. Cirrus is available today in Chrysler-Plymouth showrooms.  <BR>
	With a choice of three powertrains, a 2.0-liter engine mated to a five-speed manual transmission; a 2.4-liter engine mated to a four-speed fully-adaptive automatic; and the 2.5-liter V-6 mated to a four-speed fully adaptive four-speed automatic transmission; the Stratus will be available in Dodge showrooms in February 1995. <BR>
	The Chrysler Patriot is Chrysler's  &quot;laboratory on wheels&quot; for development of advanced hybrid electric powertrains.  Utilizing transfer technology from the defense and aerospace industries, the Patriot's powertrain could play a significant role in future automobiles.  <BR>

<P>
<P>-3-<BR>

<P>	Patriot is a 200-plus mile per hour World Sports Car class vehicle that utilizes liquefied natural gas turbines with turbo alternators and an electro-mechanical battery (flywheel) to propel the vehicle.  Patriot may find its way into racing in 1995 if Chrysler engineers meet their targets. Patriot's powertrain will be capable of delivering 500 horsepower.<BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation today announced it will sell 700 Dodge Caravan minivans to China later this model year.  The purchase was made by a government buying delegation representing the China National Vehicle Import and Export Corporation.  The announcement coincided with a visit to Detroit's automakers by Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing.<BR>
	The sale of minivans to China marks the third straight year a Chinese government buying delegation has purchased Chrysler minivans for its home market.  <BR>
	&quot;This purchase is indicative of the continued demand for minivans in China,&quot; said Denis R. Root, General Manager of Chrysler's Asia Pacific Operations.  &quot;As businesses grow in the Chinese economy, the need to move people and cargo continues to expand.&quot; <BR>
	The delivery of the short-wheel-base, four cylinder minivans is expected to be in the first quarter of 1995.  The models are equipped with automatic transmissions, air conditioning, premium stereo system, two passenger bench seats and more.<BR>

<P>	Vice Premier Li Lanqing will visit Chrysler tomorrow and will be welcomed by Chrysler Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Robert Eaton.  While at Chrysler, the Vice Premier will be given a full tour of its Technology Center and a demonstration of Chrysler's CATIA (Computer Aided Three-Dimensional Interactive Application)  vehicle engineering and design system.<BR>

DODGE AND PLYMOUTH TO OFFER<BR>
THE TWO-DOOR DOHC NEON RACE CAR FOR 1995<BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>The launch of the two-door Dodge and Plymouth Neon Sport Coupe will bring the new 2.0-liter, 150 horsepower DOHC engine into the Showroom Stock racer's arsenal.  Production of the two-door Neon ACR (American Club Racing) competition package car is scheduled for December 1994, just in time for the 1995 season.<BR>
	Because some weekend racers prefer more civilized weekdays, air conditioning and AM/FM radios are added as available options.  Racers also wanted a wider tire for the Neon, so the larger P195/60 HR14 Eagle GA tire will be included in the ACR package.<BR>
	The 1995 ACR package will carry-over the remaining features of the 1994 Neon ACR, which has already proven to be a formidable competitor in both club racing and solo events.<BR>
	More than 170 limited-edition Neon competition cars were delivered in 1994, and drivers have chalked up twenty-four 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place finishes as of mid-June in SCCA events.  Orders for both 1995 two- and four-door models can be placed through local Plymouth and Dodge dealers.  While 1994 orders were restricted in number, there will be no such restrictions in 1995.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Advertisements for the Neon Coupe, which begin airing on national television this weekend, highlight what's new in advertising for Chrysler Corporation's 1995 vehicle lines.<BR>
	Separate Plymouth and Dodge campaigns retain the Neon personality -- but now there's a 2-door that says &quot;Hi,&quot; as well.  And both campaigns will be supported by their respective dealer advertising associations, providing effective regional extensions to the national efforts.   <BR>
	The Neon Coupe adds extra spice to the attributes established by the Neon Sedan -- quality and value with safety, sporty fun-to-drive performance, comfort, convenience, styling, and environmental responsibility in an affordable package.<BR>
	Median age for buyers of 1995 Neons is expected to be 35, with a $37,000 household income.  Also, it is expected that 55 percent of those who purchase Neons will be women.<BR>

<P>(44294)	-more-<BR>

	Coupe print ads will be placed in national publications such as <I>Rolling Stone</I> magazine's year-end double issue, <I>Mademoiselle</I>, <I>Glamour</I>, <I>Details</I>, <I>Entertainment Weekly</I>, and <I>Runner's World</I>.   <BR>
	Ads will also appear on television programs such as <I>Late Show With David Letterman</I>, <I>Mad About You</I>, <I>Seinfeld</I>, and ESPN College Football.  In addition, ads will also appear on NBC's Nutcracker on Ice New Year's Eve Special, along with various VH-1 programming.<BR>
	In addition to the Neon Coupe, ads for 1995 products have already appeared for all Chrysler Corporation's vehicle lines.<BR>
	Jeep&reg; has followed up its award winning ad at Cannes earlier this year with new spots for Grand Cherokee, Cherokee and Wrangler (created by Bozell North); Chrysler has debuted fresh Concorde, LHS, New Yorker and LeBaron convertible commercials; Plymouth has introduced new spots highlighting its Voyager line; and Dodge has debuted innovative commercials featuring Intrepid, Caravan, and Ram Sport and Club Cab.<BR>
	Also, there is a new campaign called the &quot;Eagle Test Drive&quot; which features spots for the entire Eagle lineup with spokesperson Greg Kinnear (also created by Bozell North), including the all-new Talon, Vision, and Summit Sedan, Coupe and Summit Wagon.  Consumers can call 1-800-2-TEST-EAGLE for more information.<BR>

<B>Note:  Videotapes and ad slicks for all 1995 Chrysler Corporation vehicle lines are available upon request.  Also, as stated earlier, new product spots for the 1995 Chrysler Cirrus compact car are slated to break on October 30.</B><BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> If it's the first weekend in May, it must be the Kentucky Derby, and if it's the Kentucky Derby, it must be the crown jewel in horse racing's prestigious Triple Crown.<BR>
	Sponsored by Chrysler-Plymouth, a division of Chrysler Corporation, the $5 million Triple Crown Challenge kicks off today with the 120th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs racetrack, in Louisville, Ky.<BR>
	The owner of the Triple Crown Champion -- the winner of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes -- would take home $5 million in total prize money, thanks to Chrysler-Plymouth. <BR>
	So for this one day hope springs eternal for the field of horses and their teams, all intent on the same purpose: to win the Kentucky Derby and become the lone entrant with a shot at the distinguished -- and elusive -- Triple Crown.<BR>
	Despite the possible prize payout, Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager Steve Torok said, &quot;You can't win the Triple Crown without first winning at Churchill Downs.&quot;  And at Chrysler-Plymouth, we'd like to see a horse capture the Triple Crown just as much as any other race fan.  It would be great for the sport.&quot;<BR>
(15894)	-more-<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>

<P>	Not since Secretariat did it in 1978 has one horse won all three Triple Crown races.<BR>
	In addition to the Triple Crown Challenge, Chrysler-Plymouth will provide the winning jockey* at each race with a 1994 Chrysler LHS, the company's latest entry in the luxury sedan market.<BR>
	And Chrysler-Plymouth will award $300,000 to an equine-related charity.<BR>
	Chrysler-Plymouth has sponsored the Chrysler Triple Crown Challenge since 1987.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>*	In the event that the same horse wins more than one race, the trainer is then awarded the car.  If the same horse wins all three races, the owner also receives a car.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation has been selected by the American Marketing Association (AMA) as the recipient of its 1994 Grand Edison New Product Marketer of the Year award for the introduction of the Dodge and Plymouth Neon and Chrysler Cirrus.  The Neon and Cirrus were also individually recognized with two Gold Edison Best New Product awards for marketing excellence and innovation.  The awards were presented yesterday evening in New York City.<BR>
	&quot;We're proud to accept the AMA's Edison Awards because they recognize our hard work to bring the same kind of innovation and creativeness to our marketing and advertising efforts as we do in developing new cars and trucks,&quot; said Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing, Chrysler Corporation.  &quot;These awards give testament to our exceptional products, strong marketing and our outstanding team effort.&quot; <BR>
	The Edison Awards were established eight years ago by the AMA to recognize marketing excellence and innovation in the United States.  The winners are determined based on a vote from a panel of more than 500 senior marketing and advertising executives from across the nation.<BR>

<P>(19595)	- more -<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	Developed to go head-to-head with the major import competition, Cirrus offers more standard equipment at a lower cost than any vehicle in its class.  In addition to the Gold Edison, Cirrus has also received several other recent awards, including <I>Motor Trend's</I> &quot;1995 Car of the Year&quot; award, and was named as one of <I>Car and Driver</I> magazine's &quot;Ten Best&quot; automobiles.<BR>
	The fun-to-drive Neon has set new standards for small cars in performance, safety, design, environmental sensitivity and overall value, and has sold over 235,000 units since its arrival in Dodge and Chrysler-Plymouth dealerships early last year.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>READING, WRITING AND RODEO:<BR>
SIXTH-GRADER WINS DODGE RAM <BR>
AT RODEO CHAMPIONSHIPS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Twelve years-old is usually a great age if you're a bottle of scotch; it has also proven to be a great age if you want to be a rodeo champion.  Just ask 12 year-old Janae Ward, winner of the International Professional Rodeo Association's (IPRA) &quot;Rookie of The Year&quot; award and the top money winner at the IPRA International Finals Rodeo in Oklahoma City, Okla.  Among the prizes won by Ward is the use of a 1994 Dodge Ram pickup truck. <BR>
	The sixth-grader from Addington, Okla., became the youngest winner of the Rookie of The Year award in IPRA history when she captured top earnings at the International Finals Rodeo's barrel-racing competition, one of the Dodge Truck- sponsored rodeos.  In addition to the Dodge Ram, Ward took home over $10,000 in prize money, a record for an individual contestant. <BR>
	&quot;I can't believe it,&quot; Ward said.  &quot;I always wanted a new Dodge Truck, and now that I have one I just wish I was old enough to drive it.&quot;<BR>
	Ward placed second in the first round of the barrel racing competition, then came back to take first in the second round to lock up the award. The strong finish earned her almost $10,500.   As the top money winner, Ward was awarded the use of a 1994 Dodge Ram 2500 Cummins Diesel 4x4 pickup.  <BR>
(13794)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	&quot;We couldn't be happier with Janae winning the Ram, even if she isn't old enough to drive it,&quot; said Dodge Truck Merchandising Specialist Bill Kennedy.  &quot;This award is designed to highlight the money winner, regardless of age.  Of course, this really alters the median age of our truck owner.&quot;   <BR>
	While Janae is not old enough to drive it, the Ram is getting plenty of use on the family farm thanks to her father, James Ward.<BR>
	&quot;My dad has it so much, I hardly ever get to see it,&quot; she said.  &quot;I'm going to have to take a few driving lessons before he lets me try it.&quot;<BR>
	Ward's win came at a cost, though.  In order to compete in the rodeo finals, she missed her sixth-grade basketball game at Waurika Elementary School.<BR>
	&quot;You're only a sixth grader once, you can only play so many games and when your teammates do good, so do you,&quot; Ward said.  &quot;You can always barrel race, but you can never go back to sixth grade again.&quot;<BR>
	Dodge Truck has been a national rodeo sponsor for the past twelve years, including both professional and high school programs. <BR>

</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B>  <BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>In 1994, the new Dodge Ram began its life as a bold proclamation of where the future of the truck market would be heading.  Three years later, a record number of truck customers have embraced the future, making Dodge Ram a leading force in the full-size pickup market.<BR>
	In 1994, Ram won virtually every major award.  A year later, Ram CLub Cab followed up with even more accolades. In 1996, Dodge matched critical acclaim with even stronger customer acceptance.  Total 1995 calendar year sales broke a year-old record with over 271,000 units sold, including Ram's first-ever month over 30,000 sales.  Ram Regular Cab continues to dominate the 3/4-ton gas and the 3/4- and 1-ton diesel engine market segments.<BR>
	The addition of another truck plant, St. Louis North Assembly, helped match supply with increasing customer demand. Four assembly plants now serve the North American and Latin American markets with a combined capacity of more than 450,000 trucks per year.<BR>
	The 1997 model year promises to be an even stronger one for Ram, with the addition of several interior and exterior enhancements.  The new  Ram Sport Plus appearance group features 17-inch wheels, refined suspension, standard 5.9 liter V-8 engine and a sport-tuned exhaust system with chrome exhaust tips.<BR>
	Customer convenience enhancements include an optional remote keyless entry system,  combination cassette and compact disc system (optional), additional rear cup holders on the 40-20-40 seat and standard tinted, sliding rear door on Club Cab models.  <BR>
	The most prominent interior addition is the optional leather seats, woodgrain instrument panel and door trim on the Ram SLT, making a true luxury statement for the the full-size pickup owner.<BR>
	Dodge Ram is offered in Regular Cab, Club Cab and Cab/Chassis confingurations; in 1500, 2500 and 3500 models; and in two- and four-wheel drive.<BR>
	Power for Ram comes from a selection of best-in-class Magnum engines, including the 3.9 liter V-6, 5.2- and 5.9-liter V-8s, the 5.9 liter I-6 Cummins turbo-diesel and the industry's most powerful production engine, the 8.0-liter V-10.  Three automatic and three manual transmissions are also available.<BR>
	Ram's best-in-class interior features a standard driver-side air bag and center console on the 40-20-40 seat with compartments for a laptop computer, CDs or cassettes, or a celluar phone.  The Club Cab's interior accomodates six passengers with its full rear bench seat.<BR>

       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation has notified owners of 1,600 1994 model year four-wheel drive Dodge Dakota trucks that the upper suspension control arm attaching bolts may fail due to improper heat treating.  All of these vehicles will have the upper suspension control arm attaching bolts replaced by Dodge Truck dealers at no cost to the owners.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>  The top four teams in the 1995 National Student Advertising Competition -- The College World Series of Advertising -- will visit Detroit Thursday and Friday, June 8-9, to show Chrysler Marketing and Communications executives and agency personnel how they would sell the Dodge Neon to college students.  <BR>
	Fifty one students with their advisors will tour the Chrysler Technology Center in Aurburn Hills, Mich., Thursday and will attend a special &quot;town hall&quot; meeting chaired by Chrysler Vice President -- Marketing and Communications, A. C. &quot;Bud&quot; Liebler on Friday.  The competition, which was sponsored this year by Chrysler Corporation, ended last week in Tampa, Florida.  It began nationwide last fall with 132 schools and over 3,000 students.<BR>
	National champ was Loyola University of New Orleans, followed by the University of Idaho in second, University of South Carolina in third, and University of Texas at Austin in fourth.  <BR>

<P>
<P>(24795)	- more -<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	Liebler was one of a panel of judges who reviewed the work of the 15 finalist teams in Tampa.  He praised them all, saying, &quot;the judges walked into the first presentation at 8 a.m. and walked out of the last one at 7:10 p.m. and we were never once bored.  There wasn't one presentation we saw that didn't have something Chrysler could pick up and use.&quot;<BR>
	As for Friday's meeting, Liebler said, &quot;I wanted our people to see first hand some of the students' ideas and approaches to the market.  Who knows the college market better than college students?  Their energy is contagious, as is their enthusiasm for the Neon.&quot;  The students will end their visit with a luncheon and tour of one of Chrysler's local ad agencies.  <BR>
	Each 15-person team in the national competition was challenged by the American Advertising Federation and Chrysler to create an integrated multimedia campaign positioning the Dodge Neon among college students.  Each team submitted a detailed plans book outlining market and product analysis, media and creative strategies, and PR and promotional programs.  The plans book accounted for 50 percent of the final score.  The remaining 50 percent was based on a 20-minute presentation made before a panel of judges from Chrysler and the advertising industry.<BR>
	The National Student Advertising Competition began in 1973.  Students compete for trophies and recognition.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CUSTOMERS GET MORE OF WHAT THEY ASK FOR<BR>
	WITH 1995 CHRYSLER WARRANTY CHANGES</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler customers are getting more of what they most often ask for:  A totally redesigned 1995 model warranty that includes 24-hour road service, does away with exclusions and pesky transfer fees, and simplifies both the language and the process of covered repairs for three years or 36,000 miles.<BR>
	&quot;This is a total car 3/36 warranty that is fully competitive.  It's a simplified, no-nonsense approach to taking care of the customer's needs, and it represents a huge Customer One investment by Chrysler management,&quot; Thomas W. Sidlik, Vice President of Customer Satisfaction and Vehicle Quality, said.<BR>
	&quot;Designing good warranty coverage today begins with the customer and his or her real-world needs.  Gone are the days when warranty leadership might have been more a function of marketing and advertising than of customer satisfaction.  What we all strive for now is customer satisfaction leadership, and that's what our new 1995 warranty achieves,&quot; Sidlik said. &quot;Outstanding quality and outstanding protection are what makes customer satisfaction leadership possible.&quot;<BR>

<P>(19394)	- more -<BR>
	- 2 -<BR>
	&quot;Customer One Care&quot; will be available on all 1995 models, beginning this summer with the introduction of the 1995 Eagle Talon and 1995 Dodge Ram Club Cab and including the 1995 Plymouth and Dodge Neon.  Chrysler will communicate the changes to current owners of the 1995 Neon -- which was introduced in January -- and offer the improved coverage retroactively.<BR>
	The new warranty program eliminates 12/12 and 7/70 protection alternatives that were viewed as confusing and complex by dealers and customers alike, but retains seven year, 100,000 mile corrosion protection for all models.  Of the choices that were offered, more than half of Chrysler new-vehicle buyers already opt for 3/36 coverage -- up from just 30 percent two years ago.  &quot;We basically took the choice that customers already prefer and enhanced it dramatically,&quot; Sidlik said.<BR>
	The warranty repair coverage has been expanded to include adjustments, carpets, drive belts, fuses, light bulbs and seat covers.  <BR>
	The new warranty stays with the vehicle, rather than the owner.  Previously, transfer fees of $150 were collected by dealers when a vehicle changed hands from one owner to another.  The terms were not always communicated properly to second-hand owners, sometimes resulting in confusion and dissatisfaction.<BR>
	In addition, 24-hour Roadside Assistance will be offered on all 1995 Chrysler models, with a toll-free number for towing, fuel delivery, vehicle lock-out, jump-start and tire change at no charge to the customer during the warranty period.<BR>
- more - <BR>
	- 3 -<BR>
	The new warranty program is the product of a five-month study conducted by a team  including representatives of warranty administration, sales, service, and marketing, as well as dealers.   The team's proposed changes were endorsed by Chrysler's Dealer Councils.<BR>
	Chrysler continues to offer optional service contracts through its dealers on all models for customers who want extended term coverage.<BR>

WINS INAUGURAL &quot;NO FEAR AWARD&quot;</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler's `Dare to Be Different' attitude in the development of the Dodge/Plymouth Neon has earned the Chrysler Small Car Platform Team the first <U>No Fear Award</U>, presented today at the Chrysler Technology Center in Auburn Hills, Mich.   Chrysler is the first recipient of the award, designed to honor a group or individual who doesn't let their fears stand in the way of their dreams.<BR>
	Sports apparel Manufacturer No Fear, Inc., CEO Mark Simo, along with company spokesman, former boxer Evander Holyfield, presented the award to Ron Boltz, Chrysler Vice President, Product Strategy and Regulatory Affairs and General Manager - Small Car Operations and Bob Marcell, General Manager, Small Car Platform Engineering, at an assembly for the Small Car Platform Team.  <BR>
	&quot;The `dare to be different' attitude of the Neon team was what first caught our eye,&quot; said No Fear's Chief Operating Officer John Waraniak.  &quot;And when we investigated further, we found that this was an attitude that drove every member of the team, in everything they did. <BR>
	&quot;The Small Car Platform Team took on a challenge that the experts said couldn't be done.  But by challenging conventional wisdom with unconventional thinking, they delivered a winner.&quot;<BR>
(16994)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	No Fear's ability to anticipate change and identify new opportunities, combined with unconventional marketing, sales and product development has vaulted the company from a two-person organization selling t-shirts to local California beach boutiques door-to-door to a multi-million dollar manufacturer with representation in over 3,000 retail outlets nationwide in less than four years.   With this award, No Fear looks to recognize other people who share this spirit.<BR>
	&quot;An award like this recognizes the fearless, take-a-chance attitude that embodies each member of the Small Car Platform Team,&quot; said Ron Boltz.  &quot;No matter what the situation or obstacle, this team never said `I can't' or `that won't work.'  Instead, they turned challenges into opportunities and produced a car that not only met expectations, but exceeded them.&quot;<BR>

<P><B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>The Texas Automotive Writers Association (TAWA) announced today their selection of the 1997 Dodge Dakota as this year's &quot;Truck of Texas.&quot;  Dakota was chosen over a field of forty pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles from virtually every manufacturer of light trucks.<BR>
	<P>The field of vehicles was evaluated side-by-side last October at TAWA's annual truck rodeo in a series of events that reflect driving conditions experienced by demanding Texan truck owners.  According to Bruce Castleberry of the Dallas Morning News,  TAWA's president, &quot;Texas is the biggest truck market in America. Texans are serious about trucks and Dakota is a serious truck.  It looks great.  It runs great.  And it does everything you need a real truck to do.&quot;<BR>
	<P>&quot;We're elated to have Dakota win the 'Truck of Texas' award,&quot; said Bernard Robertson, Vice President and General Manager, Jeep &amp; Truck Operations,&quot;If the all-new Dakota can win in Texas, we're all that much more confident of its prospects for success across the U.S.&quot;<BR>
	<P>This is the third time in the four-year history of the TAWA competition that Dodge has won the overall &quot;Truck of Texas&quot; honors.  The Dodge Ram regular cab pickup won in 1994 and the Dodge Ram Club Cab V-10 pickup won in 1995.  Also winning awards in their classes were the Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee (mid-size sport-utility) and Jeep Wrangler (compact two-door sport-utility).<BR>

WIN PREVENTION MAGAZINE'S SAFE CAR ACHIEVEMENT AWARD</B></PRTitle><BR>

  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Detroit -- </B>Based on proven safety records in on-road performance and government crash tests, Chrysler Corporation's Dodge Caravan/Plymouth Voyager and Dodge Shadow/Plymouth Sundance have been awarded  <U>Prevention</U> Magazine's Safe Car Achievement Award for 1994.<BR>
	The Safe Car Achievement Award program was created by <U>Prevention</U> to recognize automobile manufacturers for safe car design, and to encourage safe driving habits among consumers.  Using government and private insurer statistics, <U>Prevention</U> reviews both domestic and import automobiles in four categories:  van/station wagon, large car, mid-size car and small car.  Chrysler Corporation vehicles won in two of the four categories.  <BR>
	Caravan/Voyager and Shadow/Sundance were selected based on their actual on-road records of safety performance during the years 1990-1992.  There were three criteria used to determine the winners:  the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration crash tests, the Highway Loss Data Institute (HDLI) injury claims reports and the HDLI collision loss data, which measures average loss payments per insured vehicle year.  <BR>
(41894-S)	(more)<BR>
	-2-<BR>

<P>	Each measurement was weighted to determine a final composite Safe Car Achievement score.  The winners are then reviewed by the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse to guarantee the objectivity of the selections.  <BR>
	Special engraved plaques were presented at a luncheon to Jim Julow, Chrysler's Director of Marketing Operations, by <U>Prevention'</U>s publisher, Ken Wallace. <BR>
	&quot;We wanted to recognize Chrysler for its decision to place safety high on the priority list in the design and development of their automobiles,&quot; says Wallace.  &quot;They recognize that consumer health and safety are just as important on the road as they are at home.&quot;<BR>
	Current Chrysler minivans meet all Federal Passenger Car Safety Standards (FMVSS) through 1998, including requirements for dual air bags and dynamic side impact.  They were also the first vehicles to offer an integrated child safety seat.<BR>
	&quot;In the past 10 years, safety has become a key priority among our owners and prospects,&quot; says Julow.  &quot;While no one ever actually asked us to meet passenger car safety standards, we knew if we did, our customers would be delighted and it would once again set a trend for others to follow.&quot;<BR>
	During today's luncheon, <U>Prevention</U> presented checks for $1,000 on behalf of Chrysler to MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) and SADD (Students Against Driving Drunk).<BR>

Cunningham, Executive Vice President -- Sales and Marketing, said.  <BR>
	March car sales of 82,422 were seven percent below last year, but included best-month-ever records for Dodge Intrepid, Dodge Neon, and Eagle Vision.  It was the 20th consecutive record month for Intrepid and the eighth consecutive record for Vision.  <BR>
	Best-March-ever records were set by Chrysler New Yorker and Plymouth Neon.  Total Dodge and Plymouth Neon sales of 22,816 exceeded the previous record set just last month.  <BR>

<P>(14995)	(more)<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
		Total truck sales in March of 126,948, while off 10 percent from last year's all-time record, were the highest since last June.  Dodge Ram, with best-month-ever sales of 23,243, continued its strong sales pace with a 13 percent improvement over last year, its 16th consecutive monthly record, and its best first quarter.  Total Minivan sales in March increased 32 percent from last month to 47,856 and total Jeep&reg; sales rose eight percent from last month to 35,352.<BR>
	For the quarter, car sales were 214,036, the highest in six years and included best-quarter-ever records for LH sedans and Neon.  Total truck sales for the quarter were 310,544, off 12 percent from last year.<BR>
 	Commenting on the first quarter sales results, Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton said, &quot;We increased our car sales volumes, but there's no doubt the market has gotten tougher.  We're seeing a leaner mix and providing more incentives to bring customers into our showrooms.  These higher incentives will likely continue throughout this model year,&quot; Eaton said, &quot;and while helping us to maintain a strong market share, these added costs will adversely affect our first quarter and first half earnings. <BR>

	In addition, Chrysler announced the &quot;Minivan Owner Loyalty Certificate&quot; program.  Certificates will be mailed to approximately 1.5 million current Chrysler Corporation minivan owners, and provide qualified customers an additional $500 cash allowance on any 1994 or 1995 minivan.  Customers who did not receive a certificate but currently own or lease a Chrysler Corporation minivan are also eligible for the program.<BR>
	The certificate can be used with the national consumer cash allowance, and is in effect February 22 through May 31, 1995.<BR>
	The &quot;Customer Preferred Savings Program&quot; will now offer cash allowances or low A.P.R. according to the following:<BR>

<P>
<P>(08795)	- more -<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>

--	1994 Dodge Caravan ES and LE and Plymouth Voyager LE models 	and 1994 Town &amp; Country -- $2,000 <BR>
--	1995 minivans (all models) -- $1,000 (long and short wheelbase)<BR>
	Alternative A.P.R. financing rates remain 4.9 percent for 1-24 months; 6.9 percent for 25-36 months; and 7.9 percent for 37-48 months.<BR>
	All other previously announced &quot;Customer Preferred Savings,&quot; including those on 1995 Dodge and Plymouth Neon Highline and Sport model packages and select 1995 Chrysler Concorde, Eagle Vision and Dodge Intrepid models, remain in effect through March 31, 1995.<BR>

INSTALL FUEL FILLER GROUND STRAP ON MINIVANS<BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Auburn Hills, Mich. -- Chrysler Corporation has instructed its dealers to replace fuel tank filler tubes on some of its 1996 minivans assembled earlier this year, and to install ground straps on 1996 minivans built through mid-December.<BR>
	The approximately 80,000 minivans requiring new fuel tank filler tubes are 1996 Dodge Caravan/Grand Caravan, Plymouth Voyager/Grand Voyager and Chrysler Town &amp; Country models built between January, 1995 and early-August, 1995, at its St. Louis, Mo. and Windsor, Ontario, Canada manufacturing plants. <BR>
	After receiving field reports of fuel leakage, Chrysler immediately initiated an investigation to determine the cause, scope and consequence of the condition.<BR>
	Chrysler engineers determined that when the fuel tank is filled and the vehicle is parked nose down on an incline, some fuel tank valves may allow liquid fuel to enter the vapor canister.  After a period of time, fuel may drip onto the ground from the vapor canister vent. <BR>
	All affected vehicles will have a new fuel tank filler tube installed which incorporates an additional fuel flow valve, and the associated vapor hoses will be rerouted.<BR>

<P>(44395-S)					-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>	In addition, ground straps will be installed to prevent the potential for a spark from electrostatic discharge at the fuel filler tube.<BR>
	About 265,000 1996 minivans -- produced at Chryslers minivan assembly plants -- are affected by this action.  This number includes the 80,000 vehicles requiring new filler tubes.<BR>
	Engineers in the Corporations Scientific Labs determined that under particular low temperature, low humidity and low fuel tank level conditions, a spark of static electricity can occur when a fueling nozzle comes in contact with a fuel fill tube.<BR>
	Despite the fact these are rare occurrences where a number of specific circumstances need to happen, we still believe its important to make this announcement, said Theodor R. Cunningham, Chrysler Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing, and General Manager, Minivan Operations.  Our dedication is, and will always be to identify and remedy issues as soon as possible, which is exactly what were doing.<BR>
	Parts are currently enroute to dealers, and Chrysler is beginning the owner notification process.<BR>
	Outside of two reports of minor paint damage, there have been no instances of vehicle damage or injuries.<BR>

<P><B>	A:</B>	When the fuel tank is filled and the vehicle is parked nose down on an incline, some fuel tank valves may allow liquid fuel to enter the vapor canister.  After a period of time, fuel may drip onto the ground from the vapor canister vent.<BR>

<P><B>	A:</B>	The issue surfaced through field reports.<BR>

<P><B>Q:	THE FACT YOU MADE A RUNNING CHANGE IN THE PLANTS IN EARLY AUGUST INDICATES YOU KNEW YOU HAD A PROBLEM.  WHY THEN HAS IT TAKEN YOU FOUR MONTHS TO ANNOUNCE THIS RECALL?</B><BR>

<P><B>	A:	</B>The fuel valve fix for the field is different than for production units.  A different approach was necessary for owner vehicles to expedite repair.  It took some time to determine the root cause of the problem and develop the field repair with the necessary replacement components.<BR>

<P><B>Q:	SO THE VEHICLES CAN CATCH FIRE?</B><BR>

<P><B>	A:	</B>It is possible that a spark may momentarily ignite fuel or fuel vapors at the fill tube.  However, all incidents were minor, and almost all self extinguished and resulted in no physical damage to the vehicle.  We are aware of only two instances where minimal paint damage occurred.<BR>

<P><B>Q:	WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?</B><BR>

<P><B>	</B>A:	Given those circumstances--low temperature, low humidity and low fuel level--an electrostatic charge can build up -- at the top of the fuel filler tube -- sufficient to cause a spark between the fill tube and fueling nozzle.<BR>

<P><B>	A:	</B>No.  The issue here is the particular configuration of the minivans fuel tank and fill tube creates the potential for an electrostatic spark at the fill tube.<BR>

<P><B>Q:	ARENT YOU TRYING TO CONCEAL THE FACT THAT THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE ISSUES BY ANNOUNCING THE RECALLS TOGETHER?</B><BR>

<P>A:	No.  It is very clear there are two different issues.  And we are doing what is best for customers; notifying them as soon as possible about these important issues.  In this case, we will be able to repair both during a single visit to the dealership.<BR>

<P><B>Q:	THIS MAKES THREE SAFETY RECALLS FOR CHRYSLER CORPORATIONS NEW MINIVANS.  WHATS GOING ON HERE?</B><BR>

<P><B>	A:</B>	Whats going on is that we are continually attempting to identify and remedy possible issues <U>before</U> they become problems.<BR>

<P>In addition, Chrysler Corporation was recently highlighted in <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> for having the smallest quantity of vehicles recalled of any major auto company.<BR>

<P><B>Q:	ISNT THIS YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF CHRYSLERS QUALITY PROBLEMS?</B><BR>

<P><B>A:</B>	It is another example of Chrysler continually attempting to  identify and remedy possible issues <U>before</U> they become problems.<BR>

<P>In addition, Chrysler Corporation was recently highlighted in <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> for having the smallest quantity of vehicles recalled of any major auto company.		<BR>

<P>-more-<BR>

<P>-4-<BR>

<P>
<P><B>Q:	ISNT THIS ANOTHER EXAMPLE WHY NOT TO BUY A VEHICLE IN ITS FIRST YEAR OF PRODUCTION?</B><BR>

<P><B>A:</B>	We dont think so, and media and consumers seem to agree, with sales of approximately 180,000 already.  The left-side sliding door, Easy-Out Roller Seats&reg; and other innovative features, package efficiency, aerodynamic design, new levels of ride and handling, class-leading safety features and value are all reasons why these vehicles are the benchmark for the industry to follow.<BR>

<P><B>Q:	WHY ARE YOU FIXING THE PROBLEMS IN THE PLANT FIRST, RATHER THAN GOING OUT TO OWNERS?</B><BR>

<P>	<B>A:</B>	We proceeded along both paths simultaneously.  The best thing we can do to contain the issue is reach a clean point at the plants, and minimize the number of vehicles that need attention in the field.<BR>

<P>(Note: The fuel valve fix for the field is different than for production units.) 		<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Nearly 61 percent of the respondents to a post-Super Bowl interactive survey on Chrysler Corporation's newest small car expressed interest in the Neon. <BR>
	Chrysler, in its first use of interactivity, quizzed 689 subscribers to Interactive Network (IN), Inc. about Neon advertising right after the big game.  IN is a Sunnyvale, Calif. company whose subscribers predicted play calling on the Super Bowl on a wireless laptop, handheld device equipped with a keyboard and liquid crystal display screen.<BR>
	Subscribers watched the game on regular TV and entered predictions of the plays called for each upcoming down.  They also matched their predictions with Sam Wyche, head coach of the NFL's Tampa Bay Buccaneers.  Approximately 95 percent of the people who interacted with the game chose to participate in the Neon survey.<BR>
	Chrysler's strategy to market the same car in both Dodge and Plymouth dealerships appeared to be well understood by those surveyed.  More than 78 percent correctly answered that the Neon is available in both Dodge and Plymouth dealerships.  More than 70 percent correctly identified the settings for the three new Neon commercials that aired on the Super Bowl.  The Neon was featured in some unusual surroundings -- in an airplane hangar, inside a cargo plane and in the scoop of a huge earthmover.<BR>
(04794)	(more)<BR>
- 2 -<BR>
	The respondents even picked up on minor copy points.  More than 76 percent recalled that Neon contained materials such as platinum and rhodium.<BR>
	The Neon also reached its target audience of Generation X and Boomers through the survey.  Of those surveyed, 38 percent were ages 25-34; 25 percent were ages 35-44, and 22 percent were 18-24.  <BR>
	Last year, IN conducted a similar promotion with Pepsi.<BR>

GO FOR GIN JOCKEYS FOR $5 MILLION<BR>
CHRYSLER TRIPLE CROWN CHALLENGE AT PREAKNESS<BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Baltimore, Md -- </B> Go For Gin will go for $5 million on Saturday, May 21, at the 119th running of the Preakness Stakes, held at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Md.<BR>
	Only Go For Gin can lay claim to the $5 million prize, thanks to his recent upset victory at the Kentucky Derby.  The owner of the Triple Crown Champion -- the winner of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes -- would take home $5 million in total prize money, thanks to Chrysler-Plymouth.<BR>
	&quot;We'd love to see Go For Gin win the second Triple Crown race,&quot; said Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager Steve Torok.  &quot;It's been five years (1989) since Sunday Silence won the first two legs, and the excitement and anticipation that was generated was tremendous for the sport.&quot;<BR>
	Not since Affirmed did it in 1978 has one horse won all three Triple Crown races.<BR>
	In addition to the Triple Crown Challenge, Chrysler-Plymouth will provide the winning jockey at each race with a 1994 Chrysler LHS.  For his efforts at the Derby, jockey Chris McCarron won a new 1994 Chrysler LHS, the company's latest entry in the luxury sedan market.<BR>
(17694)	-more-<BR>
	-2-<BR>

<P>	In the event that the same horse wins both the Derby and the Preakness, the trainer is then awarded the car.  If the same horse wins the Belmont, the owner receives the car.<BR>
	Viewers can see Go For Gin go for $5 million on ABC, on Saturday, at 4:30 p.m. EST. <BR>
<B>Charity Dollars Earmarked</B><BR>
	Chrysler-Plymouth, for the first time this year, has dedicated $300,000 to equine-related research.  Chrysler-Plymouth and Triple Crown Productions, Inc. has determined that $200,000 will be allocated to the Grayson-Jockey Club Research Foundation.<BR>
	The balance will be divided equally among the three racetracks -- Churchill Downs (Kentucky Derby), Pimlico Race Course (the Preakness Stakes) and Belmont Park Race Track (Belmont Stakes) -- with course officials to designate worthy recipients.<BR>

<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Detroit -- </B>The 1995 Chrysler Cirrus today  earned Ten Best honors from the editors of <U>Car and Driver</U> magazine.  <BR>
	<U>Car and Driver</U> selected its 1995 Ten Best winners from a field of 42 domestic and foreign vehicles that are new or significantly upgraded for 1995. <BR>
	Editor-in-Chief Csaba Csere presented the award to representatives of the Large Car platform team at a luncheon today  in Detroit.   He noted, &quot;The Chrysler Cirrus delivers a combination of bold styling, efficient space utilization, and value that once was a Honda  exclusive.&quot;<BR>
	&quot;This award underscores the fact that Chrysler is creating exceptional products that can compete with the best in the world,&quot; said Chrysler/Plymouth General Manager Steve Torok who accepted the award. &quot;This recognition also demonstrates that we have cracked the formula of benchmark vehicles in this segment resulting in a car that offers the features of more expensive imports for thousands less.&quot;<BR>
	This is the seventh major award for the Chrysler Cirrus since its introduction in October 1994.  The Cirrus was most recently named &quot;1995 North American Car of the Year,&quot; and  <U>Motor Trend</U> &quot;1995 Car of the Year.&quot;  It also earned a <U>Popular Mechanics</U> &quot;Design and Engineering Award,&quot; <U>Popular Science</U> &quot;Best of What's New Award,&quot; &quot;Best New Family Car&quot; from the Automotive Journalists Association of Canada, and a &quot;Best New Product of 1994&quot; honor from <U>Business Week</U>.<BR>
	The Cirrus is produced at the Sterling Heights (Mich.) Assembly Plant..  <BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER OFFERS NEW HIGH-VALUE EAGLE TALON AS A 1996 ½ MODEL</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B>  <BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation's Jeep&reg;  and Eagle Division announced today a new, high-value model of the Eagle Talon sports coupe.<BR>
	The new Talon, offered as a 1996 ½ model, will carry a manufacturer's <BR>
suggested retail price of $14,594, including a $535 destination charge. That's <BR>
about $770 less than the Talon ESi, previously the least expensive model in the <BR>
Talon range.   <BR>
	&quot;The 1996 ½ Talon is intended to appeal to value-conscious buyers who <BR>
still want exceptional styling and a spirited driving experience,&quot; said David <BR>
Rooney, Manager of Eagle Marketing. &quot;We think this new version meets their <BR>
requirements for great performance at an attractive price.&quot;<BR>
	Like the ESi, the new high-value Talon is powered by a Chrysler-designed <BR>
and built 2.0 liter, 16-valve DOHC engine generating 140 horsepower. A 5-<BR>
speed manual transaxle is standard. An AM-FM radio, standard equipment on the ESi, is offered as a free-standing option, while rear drum brakes replace the discs standard in all other Talon models. Exterior revisions include the deletion of the rear spoiler and rear wiper/washer.<BR>
(00496)<BR>
(more)<BR>
	-2-<BR>
	All Talon models, which were completely redesigned for 1995, feature dual front air bags, double wishbone fully independent suspension, and speed-sensitive steering. Every Talon also now meets the 1997 Federal dynamic side-impact standards.<BR>
	Including the new high-value model, the Eagle Talon will now be offered in four performance levels, including the ESi, TSi and TSi AWD (all-wheel-drive) <BR>
models.<BR>
	The 1996 Talon ESi has a base MSRP of $15,365 including destination, <BR>
while the turbocharged Talon TSi and TSi AWD start at $18,550 and $20,806, <BR>
respectively.<BR>
	The new high-value Talon will begin reaching Jeep-Eagle showrooms <BR>
in February. <BR>

CHRYSLER-PLYMOUTH GOLF SPONSORSHIPS RUN DEEP<BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Palm Springs, Ca -- </B>While Chrysler-Plymouth has been title sponsor of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic since 1986, the division's involvement both in the event and in the sport of golf goes much deeper.<BR>
	&quot;For more than 30 years we've been heavily involved in the Hope,&quot; said Steve Torok, Chrysler-Plymouth General Manager.  &quot;It's no secret, at least to event organizers and to Chrysler-Plymouth, that the event has and will continue to be a handsome venue in attracting upscale, influential consumers.&quot;<BR>
	In addition to title sponsorship of the nationally broadcast event (telecast on NBC on Saturday, Feb. 19, and Sunday, Feb. 20, from 1:30-3:30 p.m., PST), Chrysler-Plymouth advertises both before the event in select southern California locations and during the national broadcast.<BR>
	Vehicle displays including the Chrysler LHS and New Yorker sedans and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country luxury minivan can be seen by those on-site and watching the event on national television.<BR>
	Not to be overlooked, this year's winner of the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic will take home a check for $198,000 and a 1994 Chrysler New Yorker.  In addition, the golfer scoring the first hole-in-one during Sunday's final round will win a 1994 Chrysler Concorde.<BR>
(04994)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>

<P>
<P>	Regarding event viewers, nearly 30 percent of Chrysler LHS and New Yorker buyers and intenders either watch or attend golf events like the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic.	<BR>
	But Chrysler-Plymouth's involvement in golf extends beyond this week's event.<BR>
	In addition to the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, Chrysler is a strong supporter of some of the nation's top-rated golf events, among them the Chrysler Cup, Chrysler Senior Skins and the inaugural Chrysler-Plymouth Tournament of Champions (LPGA). <BR>
 	Viewers saw the Chrysler Senior Skins (Jan. 29 - 30, in Mauna Lani, Kohala Coast, Hawaii) match golf greats Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Lee Trevino and Ray Floyd.  Top honors went to Floyd, who won 8 of the last 10 skins for a $240,000 check.<BR>
	The division sponsors the Chrysler Cup (Feb. 25 - 27, in Sarasota, Fla.), a Senior TOUR event similar to the Ryder Cup, pitting America's best versus their European counterparts.  For 1994, golfers including Chi Chi Rodriguez, Tom Weiskopf and Dave Stockton will represent the United States in the event.<BR>
	Finally, the first Chrysler-Plymouth Tournament of Champions (Feb. 28 - March 6, in Orlando, Fla.) will be the stage for the LPGA's best and brightest.    <BR>
	&quot;Clearly our golf sponsorships blanket the golf spectrum, from men's and women's events to seniors,&quot; added Torok.  &quot;Through these events, we're able to showcase our upscale vehicles and reach important audiences effectively.&quot; <BR>

	Retiring after 32-years at General Motors Corporation, primarily in manufacturing and international operations, Henson's most recent assignment had been President and Managing Director of GM Mexico.<BR>
	&quot;Chrysler's International Operations have grown from zero in 1987 to more than 132,000 units per year,&quot; said Chrysler Chairman Robert J. Eaton.  &quot;And we expect that growth to continue at a rate of 15 to 20 percent per year through the end of the decade.  We felt it was critical that we needed to have someone with broad manufacturing and international experience focus specifically on this rapidly growing part of our business.  Gary Henson is just such a person and we are extremely pleased to have him at Chrysler.&quot;<BR>
	In his new position, which will report directly to Thomas C. Gale, Vice President - Product Design and International Operations, and indirectly to Dennis K. Pawley, Executive Vice President - Manufacturing, Henson will be responsible for all international manufacturing ventures and a new International Manufacturing organization.<BR>

<B> </B>  <BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
<B>   </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Auburn Hills, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today announced the internal consolidation of the Chrysler/Plymouth and Jeep/Eagle divisions, and named the executives who will manage the marketing activities of each of its divisions.<BR>
	<P>Martin R. Levine was named General Manager - Chrysler/Plymouth and Jeep/Eagle.  He had been General Manager - Dodge Car and Truck. <BR>
	<P>Ray M. Fisher was named General Manager - Dodge Car and Truck.  He had been General Manager - Chrysler/Plymouth.<BR>
	<P>Edwin H. Brust, former General Manager - Jeep/Eagle, is being appointed to a new General Manager position which will be announced separately.  <BR>
	<P>&quot;Combining the Chrysler/Plymouth and Jeep/Eagle divisions under one general manager continues the internal consolidation consistent with Project 2000, our long-standing program to combine Chrysler/Plymouth and Jeep/Eagle dealers.  We will continue brand-focused functions to manage advertising creative and market planning activities separately, and have created a Chrysler/Plymouth and Jeep/Eagle field marketing group to support dealer network objectives,&quot; said James P. Holden, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing.<BR>
	<P>Since 1991, dealers representing over 50 percent of the Chrysler/Plymouth, Jeep/Eagle divisions' sales volume have been combined and the consolidation continues on a market opportunity basis.  	In their new capacities, Levine and Fisher will direct the strategic planning, advertising, merchandising, product platform representation and field marketing activities for the Chrysler Corporation products within each brand--Chrysler, Plymouth, Jeep, Eagle and  Dodge.  Both will report to M. John MacDonald, Vice President - Marketing.<BR>
	<P>&quot;Marty Levine brings a breadth and depth of marketing and dealer experience from having managed both the Jeep and high-volume Dodge brands in the past.  We believe the combined Chrysler/Plymouth, Jeep/Eagle franchise has the potential to sell a million units a year and will vie with Dodge for the number three position in the industry,&quot; added Holden.  <BR>
	<P>&quot;At the same time, Ray Fisher brings his vast dealer and sales support experience and  a new  marketing perspective to the highly successful Dodge Car and Truck division,&quot; said Holden.  &quot;His background is uniquely suited to addressing the continued growth of retail volume for the Dodge dealer network.&quot;<BR>
	<P>&quot;These actions not only acknowledge the outstanding contributions these individuals have made to the organization, but they are a recognition of the key roles the marketing divisions and the dealer organizations play in the success of Chrysler Corporation,&quot; concluded Holden.	<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER OUTLINES FLEET MARKETING PROGRAM<BR>
AT CALIFORNIA CLEAN AIR WORKSHOP</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Los Angeles -- </B>Speaking at the California Air Resources Board workshop on electric vehicle fleet market development, Chrysler officials today outlined a fleet marketing program that could help develop an electric vehicle market in California.<BR>
	Howard Bruno, manager of fleet client relations, outlined the regional marketing program being used by Chrysler in Clean Air Act non-attainment areas that has led Chrysler to become the worlds leading seller of alternative fuel vehicles since 1993.<BR>
	Our regional fleet marketing efforts have delivered more than 3,500 compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles around the country since 1993, Bruno said.  The premise is simple, we make a sound business case for our established fleet customers to give alternative fuel vehicles a look, especially considering fleet mandates for alternative fuel vehicle purchases coming in the late 90s.<BR>
	Over the last two years, the program has been presented in 29 Clean Air Act non-attainment cities nationally.  Bruno explained a similar approach could be applied to the development of an electric vehicle fleet market.<BR>
	However, Bruno cautioned that development of such markets is slow, and  there are over expectations on the ability of fleet operators to make significant commitments to manufacturers for meeting the 2 percent electric vehicle mandate.  Until costs come down substantially and vehicle utility increases, fleet operators will have no compelling reason to use electric vehicles.<BR>
(34595)	-more-<BR>
	-2-<BR>
	&quot;Today's CNG vehicles have the characteristics that proponents believe EVs may some day be capable of,&quot; he explained.  That would be a vehicle with 200-plus miles of range, an additional cost of about $3,000-5,000 over a conventional vehicle.<BR>
	Even with the very low operating costs of CNG that pay the owner back over time, Chrysler still has only sold 3,500 vehicles nationally.  This was also accomplished by  leveraging very generous incentives that have made the purchase a zero-cost option, Bruno added.<BR>
	&quot;What this says is that developing a fleet market for any alternative fuel vehicle is going to take time,&quot; he continued.  &quot;It must also be recognized that the fleet mandates to purchase alternative fuel vehicles will not automatically mean sales for EVs.  In fact, EVs will find extremely tough fleet market competition with flexible fuel methanol/ethanol vehicles and CNG, which will have substantial cost and performance advantages.&quot;<BR>
	At the regional program meetings, officials detail the elements of the Energy Policy Act that will affect the fleet operators in the coming years as-well-as the federal and state clean air schedules for their market.  <BR>
	The utility companies make commitments for refueling infrastructure and detail the monetary incentives that are available.  The program then moves to a ride-and-drive where customers can sample the products.<BR>
	We believe a similar tactic with the developing electric vehicle fleet market may have merit, if the vehicle costs come down and fleet operators can justify the additional up front costs associated with EVs, Bruno said.  The low cost of electricity and the potential maintenance advantages of EVs could be a positive move forward, but we still have the issues of poor range and high battery replacement costs.  With that reality, electrics will have a very difficult time competing with other technologies in the market.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>CHRYSLER INITIATES <BR>
THREE-YEAR CAPACITY EXPANSION PROGRAM</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> Chrysler Corporation today announced expenditures to add assembly and powertrain capacity over the next three years to meet potential demand for its new products -- particularly its hot-selling Jeep&reg; and truck models.  These actions are subject to successful discussions with union representatives, local and state governmental offices, and various supplier companies.<BR>
	Today's announcement follows actions approved in September 1993 which were designed to remove production bottlenecks that stood in the way of increasing capacity, particularly in component operations. 	<BR>
	Total spending related to these two actions approaches $1.8 billion, of which $1 billion is connected to the September 1993 actions.<BR>
	When completed, the combined actions are expected to improve Chrysler's maximum worldwide production capacity by some 500,000 units to approximately <BR>
3.5 million vehicles a year by 1996, according to Robert J. Eaton, Chrysler Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.<BR>
	&quot;These actions will touch virtually all of our facilities and many of our suppliers,&quot; said Eaton, &quot;but the involvement of the unions and state and local <BR>

<P>(10294)	- more -<BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>

<P>governments will be crucial to the successful implementation of these plans.<BR>
	&quot;We realize that we have to strike while the iron is hot, and nowhere is the <BR>
demand hotter than in Jeep&reg; and Dodge Ram pickup truck sales.  If we don't move ahead now, we might miss opportunities for improved sales in North America, including exports to Mexico under NAFTA.  At the same time, we could lose the jobs that new sales could bring.&quot;<BR>
	The plan approved this week impacts:<BR>
<B>Truck Production</B><BR>
 The St. Louis North Assembly Plant (Fenton, Missouri), previously scheduled to be idled in January 1995 with the launch of the new Chrysler minivan in the nearby St. Louis South facility, will instead be reopened in the third quarter of 1995 to produce Dodge Ram regular and club cab models.  The plant will have the capacity to build 130,000 Ram trucks per year.  About 1,500 employees (including 900 new hires) will be added in the $300 million program.  Production of Ram will continue at the Warren (Michigan) Truck Assembly Complex.<BR>
 The Dodge Dakota mid-size pickup will be solely sourced to Warren Truck for the 1997 model year, making additional capacity available at the Toledo (Ohio) Assembly Complex for Jeep&reg; Cherokee and Wrangler models.  Overall plant volume at Toledo will remain essentially the same.  Dakota is currently assembled in Warren and Toledo.  <BR>

<P>- more -<BR>

<P>- 3 -<BR>

<P><B>Jeep&reg; Production</B><BR>
 A third shift will be added to the Jefferson North Assembly Plant (Detroit) in the second half of 1994, adding 66,000 Grand Cherokees per year.<BR>
Approximately 800 jobs will be added in this $120 million capital expenditure.  Concurrently, an increase in the production of 4.0-liter engines (at Kenosha, Wisconsin) and automatic transmissions will be put into place.  <BR>

<P><B>Other Actions</B><BR>
 More than $20 million will be invested in capital improvements resulting in some 14,000 units of additional capacity of Dodge and Plymouth Neons at Belvidere (Illinois) Assembly Plant. <BR>
 Capacity for the 3.3-liter minivan engine from the Trenton (Michigan) Engine Plant will be expanded by 100,000 units with an investment of $120 million.<BR>

<P> 	The first series of actions approved in September 1993 is under way and resulting in the elimination of many production bottlenecks, said Eaton.  One notable bottleneck has been powertrain availability.  Since September through a combination of actions, Chrysler has committed to increase its total engine and transmission capacity by 400,000 units per year.<BR>

<P>
<P>
<P>- more -<BR>

<P>- 4 -<BR>

<P>	Specific actions approved in the September 1993 expenditures included:<BR>

<P><B>Minivan Production</B><BR>
 Adding 90,000 units of capacity for minivan production in St. Louis and the <BR>
Windsor (Ontario) Assembly Plant, including the continuation of a third shift at Windsor which was launched in January 1994.   This $150 million expenditure added about 1,200 new jobs at the two plants.<BR>

<P><B>Car Production</B><BR>
 Increasing capacity for Chrysler's LH-series of mid-size sedans at Newark (Delaware) Assembly Plant by some 75,000 vehicles by 1996.  This $150 million program also will add Chrysler Concorde to the mix of products assembled at Newark in time for the 1995 model year (Newark currently builds Dodge Intrepid models only).  With the Dodge Spirit/Plymouth Acclaim/Chrysler LeBaron Sedan models due to be replaced later this year, overall plant volume will remain essentially the same.<BR>
 Additional capacity of 30,000 Neons per year at Belvidere due to tag relief.<BR>

<P><B>Jeep&reg; Production</B><BR>
 Additional capacity of 45,000 Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokees per year in Graz, Austria, freeing up capacity at the Jefferson North Assembly Plant for the North American market.<BR>
- more -<BR>
- 5 -<BR>
  <BR>
<B>Powertrain Production</B><BR>
 Combined powertrain actions at the Kenosha (Wisconsin), Mound Road (Detroit, Michigan) and Trenton (Michigan) engine plants will result in the addition of some 600 jobs and expenditures of $300 million.<BR>

<P>	&quot;The combination of all actions included in the $1.8 billion programs could add up to 6,000 new jobs over the next three years at Chrysler facilities in the U.S. and Canada,&quot; concluded Eaton.<BR>
	&quot;With the world focus on jobs creation at the upcoming G7 jobs summit in<BR>
Detroit,&quot; he said, &quot;this expansion program demonstrates the renewed vitality and competitiveness of the U.S. auto industry.  It's very good news for Chrysler, its employees, and the communities in which they work ... not to mention for the U.S. economy in general.&quot;<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation and the United Auto Workers (UAW) union have reached tentative agreement on adding a third production shift at the Jefferson North Assembly Plant (JNAP) in Detroit that will increase annual capacity by 45,000 units of the hot-selling Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee sport utility, and could result in up to 900 employees being added to the plant's workforce.<BR>
	Chrysler's plan to add a third shift was originally announced in March as part of a company-wide effort to increase capacity.<BR>
	&quot;This is a win/win agreement for the union, the corporation, the City of Detroit and our customers who are waiting for Grand Cherokees,&quot; said Tom Gallagher, Chrysler Vice President - Employee Relations.<BR>
	JNAP employees will vote May 22 on the terms of the agreement.  If approved, Chrysler will begin screening skilled trades and production technician candidates immediately, and third shift production will start in October.	<BR>

<P>	Due to the large number of job applications on file with Detroit-area Michigan Employment Security Commission (MESC) offices, MESC is not seeking applicants for these positions.<BR>
	The tentative agreement will enable the company to implement three-shift operations on a daily basis beginning in October, and on one Saturday out of four.  On the remaining three Saturdays in the four-week cycle, the company can schedule two-shift operations.<BR>
	Jeep/Eagle dealers have, on average, about a 25-day supply of the hot-selling Grand Cherokee.  Automakers consider a 60 to 80-day supply normal.<BR>

STUDENTS 'FEEL THE DANGER' OF DRUNK DRIVING<BR>
IN CHRYSLER-SPONSORED NATIONAL HIGH SCHOOL TOUR</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>This year 40,000 U. S. students will experience the dangers of driving drunk firsthand without ever taking a sip of alcohol when Chrysler Corporation brings its Drunk Driving Simulator to nearly 100 high schools in 31 major markets.<BR>
	The Simulator is a 1995 Plymouth/Dodge Neon equipped with an on-board computer system that replicates the slowed mental and physical reactions of a drunk driver by delaying the car's braking and steering response.  In effect, the car becomes drunk.<BR>
	With these impaired abilities, the student driver attempts to negotiate an obstacle course set up in the high school's parking lot -- without hitting the safety cones or pedestrian figures that pop up along the way.<BR>
	&quot;We have a unique opportunity with the Neon Simulator program to show students the hazards of drunk driving in a safe and controlled environment,&quot; said Arthur C. (Bud) Liebler, Chrysler Vice President of Marketing and Communications.  <BR>
<B>-more-</B><BR>
<B>(12094)</B><BR>

<P>- 2 -<BR>
	&quot;Even though it's a simulation, drivers really see and feel the danger, and that kind of sobering experience is something that gets everyone's attention -- kids and adults alike,&quot; Liebler said.<BR>
	The tour is sponsored by Chrysler Corporation and presented by Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) with the support of the U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Association of Broadcasters.  In each market, the events are sponsored by a local Dodge dealer, Plymouth dealer, and MADD chapter.<BR>
	In 1994, the Simulator tour is scheduled to visit the following markets: Little Rock; Tampa; Oklahoma City; Orlando; Tulsa; Jacksonville; Kansas City; New Orleans; Charlotte; Norfolk; Mobile; Atlanta; Washington, D.C; Philadelphia; New York; Boston; St. Louis; Miami; Champaign, Ill.; Detroit; Chicago; Milwaukee; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle; Portland; San Francisco; Los Angeles; Phoenix; Houston; and Dallas.<BR>
	The program, originally known as the Dodge Drunk Driving Simulator, began in 1988 and has made some 550 public appearances in more than 150 U.S. cities.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B> In a new ad entitled U-turns at 100 mph. And Other Unsafe Corporate Maneuvers, which first appeared yesterday in selected major daily newspapers, Chrysler lists the accomplishments of the past three years, and warns of the danger of unwarranted change.<BR>
	Citing the companys unmatched momentum in the auto industry, the ad points to numerous product awards and product improvements, record high owner loyalty rates and unprecedented financial strength.<BR>
	Over the past three years, no one in the automotive industry has been able to match the positive momentum of Chrysler Corporation, the ad reads.  But now, that momentum may be threatened.  Rest assured, were not about to let someone else decide Chryslers fate and steer it off into another direction.  Chrysler employees have accomplished too much and worked too hard to create real shareholder value to let that happen.<BR>
	The ad is signed by all 13 members of Chryslers Board of Directors.<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>EVEN WITH HEAVY SUBSIDIES,<BR>
CALIFORNIA EV CUSTOMERS HARD TO FIND</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Los Angeles, Ca -- </B>
<P> Chrysler Corporation today said its skepticism about the marketability of electric vehicles can be traced to real world experience.  <BR>
	Testifying before the California Air Resources Board today, Chrysler General Sales Manager William C. Glaub said of the 50 electric minivans it built in 1993, California customers bought only four vehicles.  This despite incentives that drove the price down heavily, and a useable driving range of 80 miles.  In 1994, California customers only purchased two more vehicles, for a total of only six in the state that created the mandate.<BR>
	&quot;In the three years that we have marketed electric vehicles, we have only sold six in California and 52 throughout the nation,&quot; Glaub said.  &quot;The California sales are important to note when you understand that heavy incentives drove the costs down to gasoline vehicle levels in some cases.  This experience has left us skeptical, to say the least.  Even at near gasoline vehicle prices, the customers were not there,&quot; Glaub said.  <BR>
	While California's Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate may force manufacturers to build vehicles, Glaub said opposition to the mandate should not be confused as opposition to EV development.<BR>
	&quot;First off, I must emphasize an often stated position of Chrysler Corporation that we support the development of electric vehicles and any other power source for private transportation vehicles,&quot; Glaub said.  &quot;Truly competitive power sources will eventually find a place in the marketplace.  <BR>
(26995)	-more-<BR>

<P>-2-<BR>
	The manufacture and sale of these products is our business and we plan to be principal players for many years to come,&quot; he continued.  &quot;We are, however, unalterably opposed to mandates of any kind.  Mandates are simply inconsistent and unacceptable in a consumer- driven, free market, economy.&quot;  <BR>
	While the development of electric vehicles is moving ahead, and despite some promising gains in technology, Glaub testified that the electric vehicle is not ready for prime time.  <BR>
	&quot;While the idea itself isn't novel, the technology is,&quot; he said.  &quot;At present, most (EV) products lack the refinement typically found in today's cars.  I am particularly concerned about the very high initial cost, unacceptably short range (even on a good day) and the need to plan for all-night charging.  While EVs may someday be ready to compete in this market, even 'novel ideas' don't last long in this business if customers can't drive the product where they want to go with complete confidence.&quot;<BR>
	In 1994, Chrysler was the leading seller of alternative fuel vehicles among original equipment manufacturers.  Glaub said Chrysler's early California experience with EVs, as well as the company's experience with other alternative fuel vehicles, shows that it will take more than government mandates and tinkering with markets to achieve success.<BR>
	Chrysler was the first company to certify vehicles at the Low Emission Vehicle (LEV), Ultra Low Emission Vehicle (ULEV) and Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) certification standards.  It has been actively selling electric vehicles since 1993, and compressed natural gas (CNG) and methanol flexible fuel vehicles since 1992.<BR>

       Highland Park, Mich. -- </B>Chrysler Corporation today reported its two-millionth vehicle sale in the U.S. for the calendar year -- nearly a month ahead of last year's milestone, which occured on December 27.<BR>
	The last time Chrysler accomplished two million U.S. sales in November was in 1988, the best sales year in the Corporation's history.<BR>
	&quot;Chrysler and its dealers are out to beat the 2,208,000 vehicle sales record set in 1988,&quot; Theodor R. Cunningham, Executive Vice President - Sales and Marketing and General Manager - Minivan Operations, said.  &quot;Although sales in some segments have softened a bit in the past two months, we still think we have a good shot at it,&quot; he said.  &quot;Especially with Dodge Truck, Jeep&reg; vehicles and our Chrysler, Dodge and Eagle LH sedans already running at a record-breaking pace, and our 'Car of the Year' Chrysler Cirrus coming on strong.&quot;<BR>
	Through October, Chrysler total vehicle sales were nine percent ahead of last year.<BR>

CHRYSLER-SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP APPROACH <BR>
CUTS COSTS, BUILDS MUTUAL TRUST AND EMPOWERS</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Detroit -- </B> Chrysler Corporation sent the old competitive-bid system to the scrap heap and did away with traditional &quot;three-percent price cut demands&quot; of its suppliers on its way to &quot;tearing up the rule book&quot; on supplier relations. <BR>
 	Thomas T. Stallkamp, Chrysler Vice President - Procurement &amp; Supply and General Manager - Large Car Operations, told the Automotive World News Congress Monday evening that &quot;today we strive to work with our suppliers to reduce costs or, to put it another way, we've tried to become lean without being mean.&quot;  <BR>
	Today, each supplier is a vital player in what Stallkamp calls Chrysler's &quot;extended enterprise.&quot;  Chyrsler views its supply base as a horizontal, value-added chain, with the chain leading though to the customers -- a key point that sets Chrysler's system apart from the others. <BR>
	Chrysler's system demands a tremendous amount of mutual trust, Stallkamp said.  With trust comes empowerment -- the authority to think and act as a full-time member of the team.  <BR>
	&quot;But trust also brings responsibility.  Which means that, in addition to producing parts and components to specifications and price, we expect ongoing research and development work from our suppliers.  We expect proprietary technical innovations.  We expect to see their profits plowed back into more research and development.  And we expect to see ongoing cost reductions.&quot;  <BR>
(01994)	(more)<BR>

<P>	In return, suppliers can expect that Chrysler will indeed work with them in a long-term relationship based on shared goals.  Once they become part of the team, the business is theirs to keep -- or to lose -- depending on how well they manage their own business.  <BR>
	&quot;We didn't reach that level of understanding overnight.  Truth to be told, we weren't a particularly friendly bunch in years past,&quot; Stallkamp said.  <BR>
	All that changed -- in part by necessity -- about four years ago.   Facing a recession, Chrysler had to cut costs and the old &quot;three percent solution&quot;  just wasn't working.   Prices got cut but somehow costs always managed to find their way back into the system -- costs that eventually got passed along to Chrysler.  <BR>
	&quot;We knew we had to find new and innovative ways to work with our suppliers,&quot; he said.  &quot;And so we decided to drop our old adversarial system and create some sense of teamwork between them and us.&quot;  <BR>
	In 1989 Chrysler launched its Supplier Cost Reduction Effort (SCORE).  Suppliers were asked how they would work together with Chrysler to cut mutual costs without reducing their profit margins.  <BR>
	Ideas from suppliers -- and the savings -- came pouring in.  By actively listening to suppliers and encouraging their constant feedback, Chrysler has received more than 5,900 SCORE ideas over the past four years.  Those ideas have generated more than $400 million in ongoing, annualized savings.   <BR>
	&quot;The results of SCORE are quantifiable and striking.  Each of our last four new vehicles -- the LH sedans, the New Yorker/LHS, the Ram pickup and the Neon -- came in hundreds of dollars below their target costs,&quot; Stallkamp said.  &quot;And that means Chrysler's new vehicles are offering more to consumers for less money.&quot;<BR>

<P><center><PRTitle><B>JOHNSON CONTROLS TO ACQUIRE TWO SEAT TRIM FACILITIES<BR>
FROM CHRYSLER'S ACUSTAR UNIT<BR>
</B></PRTitle><BR>
<B> </B> </center><BR>
  <B> </B><P align ="left"><B><BR>
       Milwaukee, Wi -- </B>Johnson Controls,  Inc.  plans to acquire two automotive soft trim facilities from the Acustar Division of Chrysler Corporation, the two companies announced jointly today. <BR>
	The Chrysler business to be acquired involves the production of fabric and leather covers for automotive seats and includes two manufacturing facilities -- Canadian Fabricated Products in Stratford, Ontario, Canada and EDIASA  in Juarez, Mexico -- as well as engineering support in the U.S.  The facilities employ approximately 2,400 people.  <BR>
	According to Johnson Controls Executive Vice President John M. Barth, the acquisition is &quot;a natural fit with our current position as Chrysler's largest supplier of complete seats.&quot;  He explained that most covers produced at the two plants are currently shipped to Johnson Controls complete seat facilities.  <BR>

<P>(more)<BR>
(17894)<BR>

<P>	The companies said the acquisition includes a long-term supply agreement between Chrysler and Johnson Controls under which Chrysler will continue to use products from the soft trim plants.  <BR>
	&quot;The agreement fits the business strategies of both organizations,&quot; said Thomas T. Stallkamp, Chrysler Vice President - Procurement &amp; Supply.  &quot;Johnson Controls has been a key supplier to Chrysler on a number of highly successful programs.  The company's worldwide experience in soft trim manufacturing will make for a smooth transition and lead to continued product improvements and advancements.&quot;  <BR>
	Johnson Controls supplies 100 percent of Chrysler's complete seat requirements for the Jeep&reg; Grand Cherokee and Jeep&reg; Wrangler, the Dodge and Plymouth Neon, the entire LH sedan line (Chrysler LHS, New Yorker and Concorde, Dodge Intrepid and Eagle Vision), and the soon-to-be-launched Chrysler Cirrus and Dodge Stratus.  <BR>
	Johnson Controls said the total annualized sales of the operations being acquired are expected to exceed $200 million, with approximately one-third of those sales to third-parties.  <BR>
	The terms of the sale, which is subject to government approval, were not disclosed.  <BR>
