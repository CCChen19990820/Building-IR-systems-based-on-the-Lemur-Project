This is a technical assessment of materials science and technology
research in Europe. More specifically it addresses four main areas:
biomedical materials, composites and advanced ceramics, fractal
fracture, and materials for transportation systems for the 21st
century. This assessment was made for the Office of Naval Research,
Europe while on sabbatical leave from the University of Florida.

</FONT></B>
<P>
This report summarizes my activities and assessments as an associate
director at ONREUR London from August 15, 1995 to August 15, 1996.
The report covers topics in materials sciences and engineering
of interest to ONR and the US defense, industrial and educational
establishments. More specifically the report covers assessments
in biomaterials, i.e., biomedical applications of materials, composites
and advanced ceramics, and brittle fracture. The views expressed
here reflect my biases as a research scientist with experience
in the fracture of brittle materials over the past 25 years. My
observations are based on numerous personal visits to leading
S &amp; T institutions in Europe and on interaction with scientists,
engineers and S &amp; T managers throughout Europe. My assessments
and recommendations are representative of my view that several
materials research subjects in Europe are some of the best, if
not the best, in the world and offer much benefit for the US military,
industrial and educational institutions<FONT SIZE=2>. </FONT>The
newsletters to which I refer in the body of the report can be

<H2><FONT SIZE=4>Key Observations</FONT><FONT SIZE=5> </FONT>
</H2>

<H3>European Union<BR>
</H3>

<P>
The establishment of the European Commission (EC) programs has
changed and will continue to beneficially change the science and
technology efforts in Europe. For the most part, we can no longer
view the science and engineering efforts of the UK, Germany, France,
etc., as individual countries because many of the large science
and technology programs are not only interdisciplinary but also
international. Even though the individuals involved in applying
for EU grants at first joined with collaborators from other countries
because they were required in order to obtain the funds, it soon
became apparent that there were many locations which could contribute
unique equipment, personnel or other resources. The successful
proposers joined forces and have formed powerful research and
development entities. I can see that in many programs the intentions
of the founders of the EC to have multinational efforts in research
is working and enhancing individual research efforts. There are
still national programs, but the EC has enabled the successful
investigators to bootstrap their efforts and make very large coordinated
programs within their individual country and throughout Europe.
This observation has made me decide to make my key observations
in programs and not by country. Although this is a departure from
normal reports, I think it offers more for the reader in terms
of understanding S &amp; T in Europe in 1996 and the future.
<H3>Biomedical Materials<BR>
</H3>

<P>
Many of the countries in Europe have an extensive effort in biomaterials.
The Interdisciplinary Research Center in Biomedical Materials
at Queen Mary and Westfield College under the expert direction
of Prof. William Bonfield is by far one of the most successful
centers in the UK and is the foundation of the success of much
of the biomaterials research in Europe. There are others for biomedical
research in Europe such as the Interdisciplinary Research Center
in the UK and the National Research Council's Research Institute
for Ceramics Technology in Faenza, Italy in addition to many individual
investigator projects at various universities and teaching hospitals
throughout Europe. However, what makes this research more effective
is that there are unified efforts throughout Europe in biomaterials.
One of these efforts is coordinated by the European Commission's
Biomet I Program on &quot;Concerted Action in Skeletal Implants&quot;
directed by Prof. Bonfield. The members of this project meet regularly
and decide among themselves what research should be performed
and which are the laboratories or centers most naturally able
to perform the work. In this way, there is not direct competition
for funds, but rather co-operation. Funding in this area is optimized
using this approach. There are centers for basic research, applied
research and teaching hospitals which interact with the research
and development centers to test out the discoveries, inventions,
etc. It is clear that Europe in general and the UK specifically
has taken a lead in understanding the importance of biomaterials
for the future of national and international health. The US has
isolated efforts, some of them large in scale, but not coordinated.
The US would do well to emulate European coordination efforts
in research for the application of materials to medical and dental
systems.<BR>

<P>
<B>Advanced Ceramics &amp;Ceramic Matrix Composites Research Programs
in Europe<BR>
</B>
<P>
There does not appear to be a unified effort for composites research
in Europe. There are several multi-national programs supported
by the European Commission, but no concerted action committee
to organize and focus the research. However, there are some very
technically sound efforts occurring in Europe. There is still
a ceramic matrix composites research effort in Europe mostly at
universities and government institutes. There are several research
efforts discussed in the body of the report which are excellent
and should be encouraged to continue. 
<P>
The market is driving research rather than research driving the
market. There are two strategies that I see taking place in the
industrial sector: (1) find structural applications for already
existing technology, e.g., SiC-SiC composites, and Lanxide's Dimox,
and (2) change the goals for materials being developed to functional
materials rather than structural. There is some new development
of ceramic matrix composites that is occurring, but to a much
smaller degree than 5 years ago. Other efforts that are new are
directed toward non-structural applications, i.e., thermal protection,
moving parts, corrosion resistance, etc.<BR>

<P>
<B>Fractal Fracture<BR>
</B>
<P>
There are several efforts to understand the application of fractal
geometry to fracture in both brittle and ductile materials in
Europe. The major effort seems to be focused in France. Very little
research is occurring in the UK in this area. I think that this
topic is the next major development in understanding the fracture
process. What is needed is a cooperative effort between the work
in Europe and the US. A workshop which joins the efforts of the
theorists and the experimentalists is necessary. There are isolated
efforts to perform both theory and experiment, but these are very
few. The reason that this is such an important area for research
is that it provides a mathematical framework for the understanding
of scaling of energy and geometry during the fracture process.
This approach also will provide the framework for correlating
the energy expenditure during fracture, as explained by fracture
mechanics, with quantum mechanics. In other words, this approach
offers the possibility of a unified ( atomic and macroscopic)
theory of fracture.<BR>

<P>
<B>Materials for Transportation in the 21st Century<BR>
</B>
<P>
Many of the industrial companies in Europe are planning their
long range goals for future systems in land, air, rail and sea
transportation. The role of materials in this planning is vital.
The role of materials in the development of future science and
technology in these transportation areas are dependent upon the
ability to design materials which are economical and environmentally
safe. The current, and what appears to be long range, guidelines
for future success in materials development is economic and environmentally
safe. Thus, research efforts should be directed and are being
directed towards this goal. There are several EC programs which
are directed toward materials for transportation although they
may not be written exactly as that. An attempt was made to hold
a Workshop on Materials in Transportation for the 21st Century
at which technologists and managers would collaborate to define
needs and desires for the future. Although the EU thought the
program was a good idea, they did not see the necessity for US
involvement. Thus, more effort is needed to coordinate the US
and European efforts in this area. It will be a major thrust in
the future in Europe.<BR>

<P>
<B>Education<BR>
</B>
<P>
The educational system throughout Europe has some enviable traits
which should be emulated, if possible. It is obvious when visiting
industrial, governmental or educational laboratories that university
professors are held in high regard. Although that leaves a nice
warm feeling for a visiting professor, it also has some practical
benefits to all concerned. Most industrial teams will include
university researchers in their material or device development
programs because the industry has learned how to balance the input
from different sources to capitalize on the expertise from each
source. I witnessed this type of cooperation several different
times. I know of commercial patents that have resulted from such
a cooperation.
<P>
The future in materials education is clearly in remote site learning.
British Steel has supported a very large effort at the University
of Wales Swansea to establish several remote site learning centers
for their employees. This approach appears to be very successful.
In this effort entire courses have been redesigned for computer
interactive learning with mobile demonstrations.
<P>
Many if not most universities have students who are either from
companies and doing their research at the university (paid by
the company) or students working at an industrial site on their
Ph.D. on a topic mutually agreeable between the university and
the industrial partner. This situation is very common. I think
I saw examples at every university I visited.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<I><B>Recommendations<BR>
</B></I>
<P>
1. I strongly recommend that a workshop on biomedical materials
be held in the United States for the purpose of organizing the
research and development efforts to optimize efficiency in research
similar to the success in Europe. The most natural sponsors for
this workshop would be the VA and NIH. This workshop would greatly
benefit the military by outlining the most direct methods for
improving lost time in service. The natural follow-up of the workshop
is a national organization for biomedical materials. <BR>

<P>
2. There obviously is a need and effort in Europe to produce economically
and environmentally safe composites and advanced materials. In
addition, there is a change towards non-structural applications
of these materials for the near future. These observations lead
to two conclusions and recommendations. Applied research is extremely
useful and in most cases is emphasized at the expense of basic
research. However, individual research efforts do not have to
be sacrificed for applied results. The solution is to emulate
several research efforts at European universities, some of which
have been reported in ONR Newsletters. These programs perform
applied research for industry and government, but recognize the
need for basic research. Thus, the university students often perform
their research at the industrial site. The first recommendation,
then, is to increase the number of US university programs which
interact with industry with strong industrial input but without
direct industrial control. The second recommendation is to incorporate
graduate students in the industrial setting as part of a cooperative
program between industry and the university. As a complement to
this program, there should also be industrial associates studying
and performing research at the university.<BR>

<P>
3. The new paradigm in fracture is the application of complexity
theory to fracture. A workshop should be sponsored by ONR to unite
the theorist and experimentalist working
<P>
in complexity, chaos and fractal areas to understand the application
of these fields to fracture. However, more than just the normal
workshop should be held. An effort to select the topics so that
there is a mixture of theory and experimental results and ample
time for discussion should be made. If the workshop is organized
properly, it should provide direction for future research such
that major changes in the approach to studying fracture will be
reported in the near future.<BR>

<P>
<B>TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT: MATERIALS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY<BR>
</B>
<P>
<B>1.Introduction<BR>
</B>
<P>
This technology assessment is grouped by technology area rather
than by country <I>per se</I>. The reason for this is that I think
the effect of the establishment of the European Commission's programs
has had far-reaching effects in terms of research such that it
is accomplishing it's goal of unifying Europe, at least in research
efforts. Despite all the seeming problems in the news about disorganization,
management problems, etc., the European Union has been successful
in joining various countries in specified research interests.
A great example of this type of cooperation is the biomedical
materials efforts in Europe. Thus, I will report on Biomedical
Materials, Composites and Advanced Materials, Fractal Fracture
and the establishment of a workshop on Materials for Transportation
Systems in the 21st Century.

<B>2.1 SUMMARY</B><P>

Many of the countries in Europe have an extensive effort in biomedical
materials. There are several centers for biomedical research in
Europe such as the Interdisciplinary Research Center in the UK
and the National Research Council's Research Institute for Ceramics
Technology in Faenza, Italy in addition to many individual investigator
projects at various universities and teaching hospitals throughout
Europe. The Interdisciplinary Research Center (IRC) in Biomedical
Materials at Queen Mary and Westfield College under the expert
direction of Prof. William Bonfield is by far one of the most
successful centers in the UK and is the foundation of the success
of much of the biomaterials research in Europe. It is clear that
Europe in general and the UK specifically has taken a lead in
understanding the importance of biomaterials for the future of
national and international health. The US has isolated efforts,
some of them large in scale, but not coordinated. The US would
do well to emulate European coordination efforts in research for
the application of materials to medical and dental systems.<BR>

<P>
<B>2.2 Biomaterials Research Programs in Europe</B>
<P>
For the purposes of this report, biomaterials will mean biomedical
materials, i.e., inorganic and organic materials used in biological
systems. These systems include dental and medical applications
such as crowns, prostheses, and membranes. 
<P>
Many of the countries in Europe have an extensive effort in biomedical
materials The governments of many of the members of the European
Union have realized the importance of materials research in the
medical, dental and biological fields. As such there is designated
funding for research in this area from the European Community
4th Framework Program. There are several centers for biomedical
research in Europe such as the Interdisciplinary Research Center
in the UK and the National Research Council's Research Institute
for Ceramics Technology in Faenza, Italy in addition to many individual
investigator projects at various universities and teaching hospitals
throughout Europe However, what makes this research more effective
is that there are unified efforts throughout Europe in biomaterials.
One of these efforts is coordinated by the European Commission's
Biomet I Program on &quot;Concerted Action in Skeletal Implants&quot;
directed by Prof. William Bonfield of Queen Mary and Westfield
College (UK). The members of this project meet regularly and decide
among themselves what research should be performed and which are
the laboratories or centers most naturally able to perform the
work. In this way, there is not direct competition for funds,
but rather co-operation. Funding in this area is optimized using
this approach. There are centers for basic research, applied research
and teaching hospitals which interact with the research and development
centers to test out the discoveries, inventions, etc. I have not
included all the countries that are involved in biomaterials research,
e.g., France and Spain are not included, but rather I included
some that I visited and others of which I heard presentations.
It is impossible in this brief report to include all of the important
work that is on-going in Europe in the area of biomaterials. I
have tried to present a few highlights to emphasize that biomaterials
research in Europe is very strong. <BR>

<P>
2.2.1 Biomedical Materials Research in the UK
<P>
The main purposes of the Interdisciplinary Research Center (IRC)
in Biomedical Materials, which was established in 1991, are to
provide a national focus for interdisciplinary research and development
in biomedical materials in the UK and to provide a distinct education
in this field. It has succeeded in the goals to an immeasurable
degree. It is by far one of the most successful centers of its
kind. It is based at Queen Mary and Westfield College under the
expert direction of Prof. William Bonfield. It is associated with
the Department of Materials as well as with laboratories at The
London Hospital medical College, Royal Free Hospital School of
Medicine and Institute of Orthopedics, and the Royal National
Orthopedic Hospital. There are four main programs at the IRC,
namely of Bone and Joint Replacement Materials, Orthopedic Systems,
Cardiovascular Devices and Dental Materials. Significant progress
has been made in transferring research to practice. For example,
a development of a bone analogue material, hydroxyapatite-reinforced
polyethylene has been introduced in the market as a major clinical
application as a middle ear bone replacement designated as HAPEX[TradeMark].
They have also developed international links with other centers,
such as the European Commission's Concerted Action in Skeletal
Implants and have signed a memorandum of agreement with the Institute
of Medical and Dental Engineering (IMBE) of the Tokyo Medical
and Dental University. IMBE is a leader in the considerable Japanese
effort in biomedical materials. The IRC has extensive state-of-the-art
and advanced equipment such as an eight station MTS hip joint
simulator, 3-D finite element analysis capability, whole body
strain measurement with holographic interferometry and creep and
biaxial fatigue assessment. The research efforts are vast and
would be impossible to list here. As an example of one of their
research programs, I list below some of the topics of the project
on bioceramics. The IRC is developing ceramics based on calcium
phosphate, especially apatites and has produced a dense carbonate
apatite which is in the patent process in the US, Japan and Europe.
Some of their projects are: preparation and sintering of carbonate
hydoxyapatite (HA), HA precipitation and characterization, HA
composites, HA reinforcement, in-vitro deposition of bioactive
films on glass surfaces, development of glass ceramics for load
bearing applications and osseointegration of porous hydroxyapatite
implants.
<P>
There are other biomaterial research activities occurring in the
UK, the most notable of which is the effort at Imperial College
of Science, Technology and Medicine. In fact, the College's name
change was made recently to emphasize the relationship between
science, medicine and technology. Although individual research
projects were normal in the past, there will be a more organized
effort with the addition of Prof. Larry Hench (from the University
of Florida) to the faculty in the Department of Materials. Prof.
Hench is the developer of Bioglass [Registered] which is being
used in inner ear prosthetics and in much research for other applications.
He will co-ordinate the efforts of the Department of Materials,
Medical School and other engineering departments for the development
of a unified program in biomedical materials research and development.
<P>
Other efforts in the UK include individual projects in various
Materials Science Departments at the University of Bath, Oxford
University, University of Sheffield, University of Birmingham,
and Cambridge University, to name a few. However, the bulk of
the research is being performed at or through the IRC.<BR>

<P>
2.2.2 Biomedical Materials Research in Italy
<P>
There are extensive biomaterials efforts in Italy. These efforts
are located throughout Italy. Probably the largest centers of
activity are at the IRTEC-CNR in Faenza with Dr Ravaglioli as
the director of the biomaterials aspects, the Institute of Advanced
Materials, Joint Research Center in Ispra, Bologna University
and the University of Naples (Dr. Ambrosio). There is also research
at the University of Padua (Prof. Natali), University of Pisa,
the Catholic University (CU) of the Sacred Heart in Rome(Dr. Pisali),
the University of Sassari, University of Parma, University of
Catania and the Politechnic Institute of Torino (PIT), the laboratory
of Bioelectronics at the University of Genoa, and ENEA. ENEA is
the Italian government agency responsible for new technology,
energy and environment (since 1991). These are not exclusive lists,
but rather the ones of which I am familiar.
<P>
Some of the research projects include bioactive coatings on alumina
and zirconia (PIT), glass-ceramic coatings on metals or ceramics
for biocompatible uses (IRTEC), and hydrogels as coatings for
Orthopedics and dental implants (U. Naples). Also there is work
on the analysis of cancellous bone properties by using an ultrasonic
technique (U. Padua), an in-vivo experimental model to study biomembranes
and osteogenesis in the presence of hydroxyapatite granules (CU),
and a study of uncoated titanium dental implant fractures after
loading (CU), The work at the University of Genoa was described
in Newsletter 1 (Dr. Grattarola).<BR>
<BR>

<P>
2.2.3 Biomedical Materials Research in Portugal<BR>

<P>
There is substantial research in biomaterials in Portugal. The
center of the activity appears to be at the University of Porto,
but there are also smaller scale efforts at the Technical Institute
in Lisbon, the University of Minho and at the University of Coimbra.
Most of the research activities have been reported in ONR Materials
Newsletter 1. Prof. Barbosa of the University of Porto is one
of the leaders in Portugal on biomaterials.<BR>

<P>
2.2.4 Biomedical Materials Research in Belgium and the Netherlands
<P>
Although there is not a focused effort in Belgium, there is biomedical
materials work performed at the Catholic University of Leuven
(Materials Newsletter 3). The effort there is led by Prof. Helsen.
It includes research on developing elastomer coatings and new
fixation systems for metallic stems in hip prostheses, Ta - Nb
alloys for dental implants directly in bone, and in-situ Bioglass[Registered]
coatings by using a plasma spray process on stainless steel and
titanium implants. There is also work at the University of Gent
by Pieters and Verbeeck on the chemistry of bone and tooth formation
by studying the presence of ion impurities. 
<P>
There is good research being performed in The Netherlands on biomedical
materials at the University of Leiden by Prof. DeGroot on new
biomimetic HA coatings, at AM International by Dr. Timmermans
on the growth of bone, repair of fractures and implants, at The
University of Amsterdam on ceramic coatings with a HA chemistry
applied on the surface of dental implants, at University Hospital
Nijmegan by Dr. Buma on bone tissue response to implants and the
work of Dr. Stevels et al., at the University of Twente on biodegradable
polymers for the controlled delivery of drugs. I am not aware
of any coordinated national effort either in Belgium or The Netherlands
except that of the European Union Programs which would involve
all member countries.<BR>

<P>
2.2.5 Biomedical Materials Research in the Scandinavian Countries
<P>
There are isolated research efforts in Finland, Denmark and Sweden,
but no organized national efforts. These include the work of Dr.
Sven Oscarsson at Uppsala University in Sweden who uses surface
plasmon resonance techniques to study protein and cell absorption
on biomedical materials, the commercial efforts of (Dr. Agneta
Oden at) Procera Sandvik in Sweden in developing improved fine-grained
alumina dental materials, the work at Chalmers University of Technology
in Sweden on biological reactions to titanium, the work at the
University of Gotenborg on soft tissue reactions around long term
clinical titanium implants, a number of investigators at the University
of Turku in Finland who study various aspects of dental biomaterials
such as bonding strengths of titania sol-gel coatings on titanium,
and the work at the University of Copenhagen on the formation
and reactions of calcium HA.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
2.2.6 Biomedical Materials Research in Germany<BR>

<P>
There is extensive biomedical materials research being performed
in Germany. These efforts are at universities, institutes and
companies. The Fraunhofer Institute in Freiburg have extensive
test simulators for hip rotations and impacts as well as many
tests for dental biomaterials. There are research efforts at GKSS
Research Center in Teltow-Seehof Germany for studying the biocompatibility
of materials. Cerasiv in Plochingen develop materials for prosthesis
and test the environmental and structural reliability of these
materials and components. Some important research at the University
of Erlangen-Nurnberg is on the effect of surface structure on
the properties of an interface reported in ONR Materials Newsletter
1 and on the improvement of stenting therapy with a silicon carbide
coated titanium stent. Research at the Hombolt-University of Berlin
includes in vitro studies of bioresorbable, heparinized polymers
for stent coatings. Work in the Dept. of Operative Dentistry in
Aachen focuses on the evaluation of biocompatibility of intermediate
hydrolysis products of resorbable membranes and on dental implant
materials. The Institute for Textile Research and Chemical Engineering
in Denkendorf studies the degradation of resorbable fibers, membranes
and films for medical applications. Dr. Kerner of the University
of Lubeck concentrates on clinical biosensors, for example to
use as a long term glucose sensor for diabetics.
<P>
<B>2.3 Assessment</B>
<P>
It is clear that because of advances in the medical and nutritional
fields that people are living longer and many of these senior
citizens will require aid in enjoying their extended years. It
is also clear that Europe in general and the UK specifically has
taken a lead in understanding the importance of biomedical materials
for the future of national and international health. The US has
isolated efforts, some of them large in scale, but not coordinated.
The US should consider the advantages of emulating the European
degree of coordination efforts in research for the application
of materials to medical and dental systems. The first step in
this procedure could be an Veterans Administration (VA) and National
Institutes of Health (NIH) co-sponsored workshop on the &quot;Integration
of Biomaterials Efforts in the US.&quot; The military would benefit
by enabling soldiers to maintain an active military career even
though injured, and the civilian sector would benefit by being
able to live a more productive, active and longer life.

</B>
<P>
There is still a ceramic matrix composites research effort in
Europe. However, for the most part, either the research is focussed
toward materials that can be used in a commercial or military
application in the near term, or the direction of the research
is to develop a composite material for other than structural applications.
There are several research efforts which are excellent and should
be encouraged to continue. The market is driving research rather
than research driving the market.<BR>

<B>3.2. Advanced Ceramics &amp; Ceramic Composites Research Programs
in Europe<BR>
</B>
<P>
There does not appear to be a unified effort for composites research
in Europe. There are several multi-national programs supported
by the European Commission, but no concerted action committee
to organize and focus the research. However, there are some very
technically sound efforts occurring in Europe. There are two strategies
that I see taking place: (1) find structural applications for
already existing technology, e.g., SiC-SiC composites, and (2)
change the goals for materials being developed to functional materials
rather than structural. There is some new development of composites
material that is occurring, but to a much smaller degree than
5 years ago. Other efforts that are new are directed toward non-structural
applications, i.e., thermal protection, moving parts, corrosion
resistance, etc.
<P>
Composites in this context is meant to include mostly ceramic
matrix composites. There will be some mention of metal matrix
composites and very little, if any, mention of polymer based composites.
Composite in the broad sense includes materials made from two
or more material components and will be used in this context here.

3.2.1 Research in the UK
<P>
There is extensive research in composites in the UK. There is
an Interdiciplinary Research Center (IRC) in Materials For High
Performance Applications centered in Birmingham University and
the University of Wales at Swansea. There are meetings which act
as a center of reference for co-ordination. Most of the researchers
know what the other researchers are doing in the UK in this field.
Whether by design, by accident or because the field is small,
the composite research effort does not seem to be directly competitive,
i.e., two labs working on the same problem. Much of the research
is redirected away from structural applications to functional
and thermal applications. In general, there is much more emphasis
of the researchers to work with industry and try to produce a
product.
<P>
3.2.1.1 University of Bath - The composites research at Bath is
good but not coordinated. The research follows the diverse interests
of each of the investigators. Prof. R. Stevens moved from the
University of Leeds to the University of Bath and continues his
work on the mechanical properties of zirconia and ferroelectrics.
His more recent work focuses on impact resistance of piezoelectrics
especially low cycle fatigue response in high stress environments
for piezoelectric actuators. His work on zirconia has resulted
in a collaboration with a company which produces zirconia parts
for chemical pumps. There is an awareness that the scientist and
engineer must keep watch on the progress of technology to implement
into industry. Prof. Robin Cooke's interest is in carbon fiber
reinforced glass and glass ceramic composites. He and his co-workers,
Harris and Habib, use acoustic emission to measure the thermomechanical
properties of ceramics. Prof. Harris is also studying neural network
analysis for the prediction of the fatigue lives of fiber reinforced
composite materials. One of the most interesting projects discussed
was the freeze gel casting of ceramics and fiber reinforced composites.
Prof. Vic Scott concentrates on characterization of materials
using electron optics and also studies the environmental performance
of metal-matrix composites. Prof. McEnaney concentrates on carbon
and graphite and has projects on the wear of C-C composites for
aircraft brakes, low density foams and mechanical properties of
graphites, carbons and their composites. In addition to these
efforts there are also research efforts in biomedical materials
(Dr. Turner, with Miles and Reiter) and wood and natural fibers
(Dr. Ansell). The biomedical applications are for acrylic bone
cement, crystals in joint fluids and coatings for prostheses.
<P>
3.2.1.2 University of Wales at Swansea - The effort at Swansea
is housed in the Department of Materials Engineering and is ably
directed by Prof. Brian Wilshire. Their activity in the IRC (about
20 persons) involves measurement of creep, fatigue and creep-fatigue
interactions as well as processing of materials. While much of
their efforts focus on metallic based materials there are also
some efforts in ceramics and polymers. They are able to study
multiaxial stress states and have an abundance of equipment. They
are probably the best equipped laboratory in the UK for measurement
of creep or fatigue. The Polymer and Composite Center specializes
in recyclable materials. They also have an Electronic Materials
Center and a Steel Products Center. The most noteworthy achievements
of this department is that they interact well with industry having
large contract grants from Rolls Royce and British Steel. The
Computer Learning center for materials is the best I have seen
in the world. There are over 60 Pentiums available for undergraduate
and graduate laboratories with interactive software programs in
materials science. Many of these programs are being developed
on site. The intention for the near future is remote site learning
/degree capability in advanced materials. The future vision is
a fully computerized materials development process.
<P>
3.2.1.3 Oxford University -There is extensive composites research
at Oxford.<B> </B>Some of the examples of their programs include
spray formed Ni superalloys and Inconels, vacuum plasma sprayed
Ti MMC rings, MCrAlY coatings, and graded and laminate coatings,
plasma sprayed TiAl and components for microwave cavities. In
addition to these efforts, of course they are involved with more
conventional processing studies such as mechanical alloying of
Ti alloys and MMCs, squeeze casting of MMC components, Al alloys,
Al-Si casting alloys, reaction sintering SiC and metal/ceramic
composites, and polymer processing routes to ceramics and polymers.
One of the most interesting composites being studied is a alumina-silicon
carbide nanocomposite. Their work was discussed in more detail
in Materials Newsletter 96-6.
<P>
3.2.1.4 Rolls Royce - There is a large effort (about 180) in advanced
materials development at the Rolls Royce labs in Derby headed
by Dr. Julia King. There are materials research and development
efforts in metals, ceramics and polymers and their composites.
The major efforts are on metallic materials for high temperature
and in structural environments. Although their organization is
divided into functional groups, there are really three main materials
groups: Discs and Lifting, Aerofoils and Structures, and Ceramics
and Composites. The first two groups concentrate on materials
which are being used in engines or are ready to be tested for
use. The third group was devoted to advanced development, but
now is concentrating mostly on the materials that can be used
in the near term. Because of this change in philosophy brought
on by economic pressures, the use of ceramic composites will be
in near term, low load applications such as ceramic exhaust nozzles
and seals. There was a major decision made to concentrate on two
materials, (SEP) silicon carbide- silicon carbide and (Lanxide)
silicon carbide- aluminum composites. Most of their work in this
area will concentrate on applications for these materials.
<P>
3.2.1.5 University of Cambridge - The materials efforts at Cambridge
are split into three departments - the Engineering Dept., the
Materials Dept. and the Cavendish Laboratory (Physics). There
are interdisciplinary research centers within the departments
so that department lines do not prevent co-operative research
programs. For example the design Center was established to approach
design of structures with an interdisciplinary approach. The by-words
are innovation, engineering and design. About one third of the
work performed in the design center is materials related. The
materials selection portion is supported by ONR. Prof. Mike Ashby
is developing materials selection software to accompany his book
to help in materials selection for design. Prof. Ashby is continuing
his work on foamed materials. There is also a Micromechanics Center
which is directed by Prof. Norm Fleck. This center focuses on
modeling the behavior of particles, nanocomposites, composites,
etc. The work performed at the Cavendish Laboratory is under the
direction of Prof. John Field. This work concentrates on dynamic
contact of materials. They have what appear to be unique facilities
in that they can monitor dynamic impacts from very low velocities
to very high velocities. Their capability includes high speed
cameras, flash x-ray spectroscopy, strain gages, rear surface
interferometer and of course velocity measurement devices. The
unique feature is that all of these can be done simultaneously.
They examine conventional composites, ceramics and metal matrix
composites, metals, inorganic glasses and semi-conductors with
and without hard coatings.
<P>
3.2.1.6 National Physical Laboratory - The NPL program in materials
is very strong in spite of rumors to the contrary. The purpose
of the NPL is to establish and maintain proper standards for measurements.
Recently (Oct. 1995) they were &quot;semi-privatized&quot;, i.e.,
a service company (SERCO) took over the management of the laboratory
similar to many national labs in the US. In my observation this
has not made a difference in the operation or morale of the labs.
In fact, the largest effect has been the necessity of obtaining
external support funds from industry and other sources. They perform
measurements services by outside contract, which is a change in
attitude from the past,
<P>
Almost all their efforts are focused towards standards and measurements
They have evaluated test methods for advanced materials, such
as hard metals and cermets, and composites; they measure the behavior
of variables during materials processing; establish and verify
techniques for lifetime predictions in metals, especially in corrosive
environments; they study the degradation of polymeric materials
and the mechanical properties of thin coatings. Dr. Gary Dean
is determining the type of data and the applicability of existing
software necessary for composite design using tools like the finite
element method (FEM). For example, they use FEM to predict the
stress distribution in adhesive joints. The current considerations
include impact behavior, obtaining viscoelastic and plastic data,
and time dependent properties. The problems with establishing
design data concerns them because many properties are processing
controlled. How does one organize a data base to reflect this?
They are very much involved with setting standards for testing
the tensile, flexural, and fatigue properties of composites and
are aware of, but not necessarily in total agreement with, the
various standards committees in Europe. 
<P>
Dr. Roger Morrell directs the ceramics testing and standards.
There are several cooperative programs for standards with which
NPL is involved, including round robin testing in Europe for toughness
measurements of advanced ceramics and cooperative works with NIST
(Dr. George Quinn) in flexural testing and fractography. Several
texts have been published by NPL (by R. Morrell): Handbook of
Properties of Technical and Engineering Ceramics- Part 1 - An
Introduction for Engineers and Designers and Part 2 - Data Reviews
(alumina) and Corrosion Resistance of Engineering Ceramics (Lay).
They have very adequate testing facilities for all the usual test
procedures and develop new tests when necessary. One of the most
interesting tests I observed which was developed at NPL was the
edge toughness test. This test involves indenting near the edge
of a sample with a sharp indenter. Two cracks run to the edge
and a fractured chip is formed. They have developed the mathematical
analysis from which to obtain the toughness of the material. This
test is especially useful for small samples and predicting failure
from impacts near edges. This could also be useful to archeologists
to study flint knapping of ancient civilizations.
<P>
3.2.1.7 Brunel University - There is a very good processing capability
at Brunel University under the direction of Prof. Evans. The most
innovative ceramic processing methods are those which utilize
polymer processing techniques as models such as injection molding
and ink jet printing. The details are described in Adjunct Scientists
Newsletter 2 ( by Prof. Akinc).
<P>
3.2.2 Composites in Italy<BR>

<P>
The composites program is centered at Ispra but there are activities
at many sites throughout Italy such as at ENEA and the University
of Napoli. ENEA was originally the Nuclear Energy center for Italy.
However, in 1986 the decision was made that there would be no
nuclear energy in Italy and the center had to find other applications
for their research. They have about 1700 at the research site
and about 4500 employees total. It is one of the largest national
laboratories. They now concentrate their efforts in (non-nuclear)
energy, the environment and new technology. Thus they concentrate
on fuel cells, biomedical applications and advanced materials
development. In the advanced materials development area they produce
2-D silicon carbide-silicon carbide composites by CVI using French
and US technology. They are trying to develop a new route by liquid
infiltration and polymer pyrolysis. Their innovation is to introduce
a filler powder and liquid polymer They are also developing silicon
nitride by combining the CVI and liquid infiltration processes.
<P>
The University of Naples has a materials effort in the Department
of Materials Production Engineering chaired by Dr. Luigi Nicolais.
Within the department there are groups which study composite materials
technology, aeronautical engineering and biomedical materials.
Of course they have interdisciplinary programs, e.g., with the
medical school on biological aspects of biomedical materials.
At the University of Naples, Dr. Luigi Ambrosio's main interests
are in the biomedical field; however, he applies the research
in composites to the biomedical field, as well. The structure
at the University of Naples is arranged so that there can be interaction
with other institutions. For example he has cooperative programs
with University of Connecticut, University of London, Kodak, U.
of Nottingham and the U. of Gent. They have research in properties
of both hard and soft tissues. Thus, there are applications of
advanced materials to hip joint prosthesis as well as the effect
of drugs on the mechanical properties of eye materials. For example,
the hip prosthesis incorporates a laminated carbon fiber epoxy
resin and Kevlar multilayer as the material for the hip stem.
This type of construction allows for better matching of stiffness
near the bone and allowing more stiffness at the joint.
<P>
One of the most interesting groups is the Technology Transfer
Center. Dr. Mario Montanino heads the effort to develop a relationship
between research and production. They concentrate on small and
medium sized companies. They are using the University of Connecticut
as a model. There is a possibility of a research park in Naples
and the neighboring regions. A consortium was formed between the
university and several banks in Naples to finance the establishment
of this tech transfer mechanism. These include several possibilities:
a liaison office, a research consortium and/or a business innovation
center (Technopolis).<BR>

3.2.3 Composites Research in Portugal<BR>

<P>
The amount of research in materials is increasing in Portugal
especially in microelectronics and biomedical materials. Much
of the composites research is focused around these two specialty
areas. Because of the European Commission as well as internal
support, Portugal has become competitive with other European countries
for research in materials. Much of the money has been used to
purchase new equipment. The Universidade Technica de Lisboa in
Lisbon is one of six universities in Portugal that have a materials
engineering effort at some level. The other five are : Universidade
Nova de Lisboa, Universidade do Porto, Universidade do Minho,
Universidade de Coimbra and Universidade de Aveiro. Prof. Almeida
is well known in the glass field for his work on sol-gel and thin
film characterization. In his laboratory he has state-of-the-art
equipment for the characterization of materials, i.e., SEM, TEM,
Auger, ESCA, etc. Of special note is the combination of the scanning
microfocus Raman spectroscopy and microfocus FTIR spectroscopy
which he uses to fully characterize thin films as well as bulk
glasses. This is an unique facility and appears to be utilized
very effectively. Prof. Vilar is interested in phase transformations
and laser surface treatments of materials, especially metals,
e.g., Ni on Al. He is also interested in laser surface treatments
on ceramics. The facility he uses is a commercial size 10.6 <FONT FACE="Symbol">m</FONT>m
CO<SUB>2</SUB> continuous wave laser. They are capable of transferring
their information to industry very easily. Prof. Fortes is the
Department Head of the Materials Engineering Department and has
research interests in porous structures. The potential for great
research in very specific material areas, e.g. thin film characterization
for microelectronics, biomaterials and laser treatment of materials,
is possible and probable for the Portuguese science and engineering
community; however, what is needed is more co-operation among
researchers on larger projects with industrial support. The details
of research in Portugal is summarized in Materials Newsletter
2 (96-02).
<P>
3.2.4 Composites in Belgium and the Netherlands<BR>

<P>
There is a relatively large research effort in Belgium at the
Katholieke Universeit (K.U.) in Leuven. They are equipped with
the usual array of testing analyses apparati including some less
familiar equipment such as a home-built fretting wear machine
(see below), a nanoindentor, a microfocus Raman spectrometer,
a lateral force microscope with electrochemical cell and a multitechnique
imaging X-ray photoelectron spectroscope/scanning Auger microscope.
The details of the research is explained in Materials Newsletter
96-3.
<P>
Research at the Institute for Advanced Materials of the Joint
Research Center (IAM-JRC) at Petten (The Netherlands) is the sister organization
of the center in Ispra, Italy. The Institute for Advanced Materials
has evolved into a first rate laboratory for the development and
characterization of metallic, ceramic, and composite structural
materials for advanced high temperature technologies, and they
have established an international reputation in materials science.
The most recent efforts are directed towards finding non-structural
applications for composites and are directed towards the energy
sector. For example materials for coal gasification such as thermal
barrier coatings, heat tubes, and no-load hot sections are being
studied as well as CMC's for gas turbines. Details of the research
efforts at Petten are described in the Materials Science and Engineering
Newsletter 96-001 (by B.A. Wilcox and J. J. Mecholsky, Jr.)<BR>

<P>
3.2.5 Composites Research in France<BR>

<P>
Although the ceramic composites research effort is active in France,
I think that it has lessened relative to previous years. Of course,
SEP still produces fibers and composites; it is concentrating
its efforts on C-C composites for applications like exhaust cones
on rockets and decreasing its efforts on SiC-SiC composites. Recall
that Rolls Royce has selected SiC-SiC composites as one of the
two candidates for insertion into engines. Some SiC-SiC composites
could be used in (French) military aircraft for parts like the
vector thrust nozzle. 
<P>
ONERA is a Ministry of Defense laboratory for the aerospace industry.
In the past there has been extensive composites research performed
here. Recent publications include &quot;Fracture of Oxide Ceramic
Matrix/Oxide Fibre Woven Frabric Composites&quot; and &quot;Raman
Studies of the Chemical and Thermal Degradation of &#133; Fibers&quot;,
&quot;Sol-Gel Route to Functional Hierarchical Ceramic Matrix
Composites&quot;, &quot;The Corrosion of Ceramic-Matrix Composites&quot;,
&quot;Process for Fabricating a Ceramic Matrix Composite Incorporating
Woven Fibers and Materials with Different Compositions and Properties
in the Same Composite&quot;, &quot;Oxide Ceramic Matrix/Oxide
Fibre Woven Fabric Composites Exhibiting Dissipative Fracture
Behavior&quot;, &quot;Microwave absorbent: preparation, mechanical
properties and r.f.-microwave conductivity of SiC (and/or mullite)
fibre reinforced Nasicon matrix composites&quot;, &quot;Gyromagnetic
microwave resonance of cobalt-aluminoborosilicate nanocomposites,
and &quot;Sol-Gel Mullite Matrix-SiC and-Mullite 2D Woven Fabric
Composites with and without Zirconia Containing Interphase: Elaboration
and Properties&quot;. However, the trend appears to be away from
studying CMC's and concentrating on Ti<SUB>3</SUB>Al materials.
Most of the research now is centered on these materials. The toughness
values can range from 10-30 MPam <SUP>0.5</SUP> depending on chemistry
and processing. This is one of the places in France where fractal
analysis of these materials is occurring. Dr. Elisabeth Bouchaud
is leading an effort to understand fracture from a fractal geometric
viewpoint. She performs most of her research on titanium aluminide
materials because of the interest for the aerospace industry.
<P>
The Centre Technique des Industris Mecanique (CETIM) is the central
testing agency for the French government. They appear to do most
of the mechanical property testing for many industries and government
agencies. They serve the mechanical industry except for aerospace,
rail and car. 7000 companies pay taxes which contribute to their
center. The Materials Department at CETIM has three functions:
they help design systems, they help with in-service problems,
and they perform materials characterization. They are especially
interested in tribological characteristics of advanced materials
and composites. Their work on alumina-zirconia focused on the
influence of the glass phase on wear mechanisms. They have also
studied the formation of wear particles in PSZ ceramics. They
found that humidity caused oxide formation during wear processes
in silicon nitride. They have characterized the behavior of graphite-silicon
carbide composites (Purebide)for wear applications. They also
are examining alumina-zirconia, aluminum nitride and silicon carbide
whisker composites as substitutes for silicon nitride and cubic
boron nitride in tool materials. They have constructed a wear
map for thin ceramic coatings from their own research results
and what they have found in the literature. The wear map variables
are wear rate, cutting tool speed and pressure. There is a need
for a standard format for the test conditions so that various
laboratories can compare their results. A VAMAS activity is the
production of a formal standard for the obtaining of wear rates.
The final standard will also be an ASTM standard. In their wear
tests they found that vibrations can strongly affect results.
A band of frequencies can be excited which affects the wear rate.
They found that titanium carbide coatings wear less than titanium
nitride, carbon or diamond-like carbon coatings on the same substrates.
<P>
St. Gobain Research facilities are part of the St. Gobain company.
However, some of the personnel are funded by CNRS (a government
scientific funding agency). The main interests at St. Gobain are
the thermomechanical behavior of glass and polymers and the adhesion
of metals on oxides. They have at their disposal an ultrahigh
vacuum AFM as well as a fast HP computer for modeling studies.
They are interested in applying fracture mechanics to the study
of delayed failure and proof tests in thermally and chemically
strengthened glass. Some of their latest developments include
a (sandwich structure) electrochromic glass for tinting windshields
in a Renault prototype and a liquid crystal sandwich structure
which can turn opaque with the application of voltage. <BR>

3.2.6 Composites Research in Germany
<P>
FAG is a bearing manufacturing company which produces bearings
for the automotive industry from tubes of bearing steel either
purchased from an approved commercial source or manufactured at
one of their other plants. They then cut, machine, heat treat,
assemble, test, etc., in a computer controlled, continuous operation.
They search the world for the best product and purchase it, if
available. When they cannot purchase it, then they seek the council
of technical personnel and develop and produce their own material.
Following this philosophy, FAG developed a new corrosion resistant
stainless steel called Cronidur. The basic alloy development was
a joint effort between VSG in Essen, a metal producer, the University
of Bochum, and FAG. For a particular bearing application, FAG
joined with Pratt &amp; Whitney and produced Cronidur 30. Cronidur
30 is a nitrogen alloyed stainless steel with superior bearing
performance and corrosion resistance. (It is not a surface nitrided
steel!) It is made using a pressurized electro-slag remelt process.
This material is superior to 440C tool steel and has two orders
of magnitude better corrosion resistance. FAG made a commitment
to market through-hardened Cronidur 30 at the same price as M50
steel, and surface hardened Cronidur 30 at the same price as M50
Nil. More information can be obtained from Materials Newsletter
7 (96-07) and (ONR) High Temperature Materials Update #3 by J.

<P>
Professor Jurgen Roedel has a very focused and excellent program
in materials research at the Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt.
One of the highlights is the production of gradient materials
by electrolytic dissociation using electrically conducting porous
preforms. Another highlight is an in-situ compact tension fixture
for studying properties of surface flaws. The unique feature of
this fixture is that it has an adjustable stiffness. Another research
area of study is the processing and mechanical properties of metal/ceramic
composites by gas pressure infiltration. Composites made in this
way exhibit strength increases much greater than that expected
from the increased toughness. Several metal-ceramic composites
are being studied: alumina-Al,alumina-Ni (sub 3)Al, and alumina-Cu.
The composites are produced by burnout of polymer fibers using
subsequent gas pressure infiltration. A key element in the understanding
is the study of metal/ceramic wetting, interface design and model
microstructures. The study of gradient materials, is part of a
national (German) program started in October 1995 which Prof.
Roedel co-ordinates for the government. His part in this program
is to produce materials with three dimensional porosity gradients.
This is accomplished by electrolytic dissociation using electrically
conducting porous preforms with a potential gradient during processing.
Another research area is based on the mechanical and electrical
reliability of actuators. The objective of this research is to
understand the factors involved in damage mechanisms in actuators.
For example, long term cyclic loading can lead to mechanical or
electrical stresses and can affect the reliability of a component.
The initiation of a crack during cyclic fatigue can drastically
reduce the performance of actuators. Companies, such as Siemens,
are interested in the reliability of steering valves in automobiles.
Further details of the work at the Technische Hochschule in Darmstadt
can be obtained from Materials Newsletter 8 (96-08).

Schott Glass is one of the world's leading producers of technical
glass products. However, they also have interests in glass composites.
The research group at Schott developed a scattering light method
for measuring in-situ residual stresses in a glass being cooled
after fabrication. They are able to examine the relaxation of
glasses at high temperature. The mechanical experimental techniques
include standard tests like three point and four point flexure
testing of bars as well as ring-on-ring and ball-on-ring testing
of glass disks. They are also comparing c-ring testing in tension
and compression with full ring testing. Most of their size comparison
data has been obtained on either carbon reinforced, or silicon
carbide fiber reinforced borosilicate glass composites. The research
facilities at Schott have the opportunity to provide a unique
set of data which can be used by many researchers in the future.
They plan to incorporate a fracture mechanics analysis of their
data and utilize fractography to identify failure origins. Further
information about Schott Glass research efforts can be obtained
from Materials Newsletter 9 (96-09).

The Max Planck Institute in Stuttgart has several outstanding
programs in advanced materials. There are programs in Physic and
Materials both of which have programs in materials. There are
about 4 directors in the Physics group and about 9 directors in
the Materials group. (Several of the directors have retired and
there are several vacancies now). The divisions are evidently
for administration purposes as there is interaction between the
groups and shared equipment use. There are some unique pieces
of equipment and some very innovative programs.

Dr. Peter Gumbsch in the Physics group is studying fiber bridging
and deformation and failure of metal matrix composites using a
specially made transparent polymer tensile specimen with embedded
fibers of different lengths. Acoustic emission and a conformal
microscope are used to monitor the deformation and failure in
this system to quantitatively correlate the acoustic emission
with the failure processes. Dr. Gumbsch joins experiments and
theory in his studies. He tries to balance these about even. His
programs are on the brittle to ductile transition in nickel aluminides,
atomistic modeling of Al-Ni cores, quasi-crystal modeling and
fracture in silicon.

Prof. Roland Canon (from Berkeley) was visiting Max Planck as
a visiting scientist in Prof. Manfre Ruhle's Materials group.
He has a student studying the effect of additives and thickness
on adhesion in metal ceramic systems. Prof. Fred Lange ( from
U. C Santa Barbara) was also at Max Planck studying GaN thin films
on sapphire substrates, silicon carbide films on silicon carbide
substrates and perovskite structures on perovskite substrates.

The unusual equipment that exists are an AFM with nanoindenter;
they will add a pico indenter. They also have an STEM with chemical

group. They are equipped with a mechanical testing device especially
made for the SEM with a piezoelectric microscrew drive for position
control.

The Fraunhofer Institute in Freiburg has extensive testing facilities
for design and testing service for industry. They have four sections:
Metals, Glass and Plastics, Surface Treatment and Surface Coatings,
and Finite Element Calculations. They have extensive x-ray equipment
for the measurement of residual stress in components. They have
several programs for the study of wear and tribology of bearings
and surfaces. They work together with other Fraunhofer Institutes
to be competitive. They have programs on testing of porous ceramic
filters for hot gas cleaning, and the machining, strength testing
and long term testing of silicon nitride valves. <BR>

There are some very strong programs in advanced materials and
composites in Europe. Most notably, the UK has several excellent
programs. The IRC at Birmingham and Swansea are exemplary and
very successful because of their interaction with industry (Joint
MSE Newsletter 96-001). The program at Oxford is very good because
of the innovative research (Materials Newsletter 6). The processing
at Brunel University in the UK is also innovative (Adjunct Scientists
Report 2). The program at Keele U. is relatively new and certainly
innovative in its approach for a university, i.e., taking one
material from the inception to the final product (Materials Newsletter
5). A relatively new program in Germany, which will definitely
grow, is the innovative research program at the Technische Hochschule
in Darmstadt (Materials Newsletter 96-08). There are smaller efforts
throughout Europe. However, the one striking difference from a
few years ago is the shift from a structural materials emphasis
to alternate applications of ceramic matrix composites. It appears
that the only applications of structural materials to be used
are those that are ready for insertion. Companies are not funding
structural material development for ceramic matrix composites.
Thus, the search for alternate applications. One of the other
important instruments of production is the use of university students
in industry and institutes throughout Europe to accomplish the
needs of the company or institute while finishing their advanced
degree. This is very cost and time effective and should be expanded
in the US.<P>

Most, if not all, of the research which concentrates on understanding
the application of fractals to fracture is in France. There are
only two locations in Europe of which I know which are engaged
in experimental determination of the fractal dimension or the
characteristics of fracture surfaces: ONERA and St. Gobain. The
other studies in France are focused on modeling and analysis.
These include the laboratory of Stephane Roux at the Laboratoire
de Physique et Mechanique at the Ecole Superieure in Paris, the
work at CNRS in Orleans of H. Van Damme and E. Lemaire and the
studies of Prof. H. J. Herrmann in CEN Saclay on deterministic
crack patterns on lattices. The important point is that there
are studies of fracture as a fractal process and that this approach
offers a method by which the fracture process can be modeled at
both the atomic and macroscopic scales using the same principles.
Thus, this leads to the methodology for designing structures at
all length scales for improved mechanical properties.<BR>

<P>
<B>4.2 Background<BR>
</B>
<P>
For the uninitiated, I provide a brief description of fractal
geometry as it applies to fracture. Fractal geometry is a non-Euclidean
geometry which describes irregular shapes and is often characterized
by self-similar or self-affine scaling, and by scale invariance.
A self-similar surface is one in which the scaling is isotropic,
i.e., one feature on the surface is similar to another feature
on the surface in any direction. A self-affine surface is one
which has the magnification factor as a vector quantity. If this
scaling characteristic holds for different magnifications, then
this trait is called scale invariance. Although there is some
controversy in the literature about the nature of fracture surfaces,<SUP>
</SUP>i.e., whether or not they are self-similar or self-affine,
I suspect that there are some fracture surfaces which are self-similar
and some which are self-affine. Fracture surfaces which are formed
in structures which are considered isotropic should be self-similar.
Self-similar fracture surfaces would be expected, and are observed,
in glasses and fine-grained polycrystalline ceramics.<SUP> </SUP>Natural
and man-made composites can be either self-similar or self-affine.
Cements , rocks such as westerly granite, and geological minerals
would be expected to be self-affine. Single crystals and glass
ceramics could be either. Self-similar surfaces are described
by their fractal dimension, D. For surfaces, the dimension will
lie between 2 and 3. A value close to two would be relatively
smooth, and a value close to three would be near volume filling
and appear very tortuous. The fractal dimension, then, can be
a numerical description of a tortuous fracture surface.
<P>
There are radially symmetric zones of progressively increasing
surface roughness away from the origin of failure in brittle materials
known as mirror, mist and hackle. It is apparent from observations
of these surfaces that the features, i.e., the mirror, mist and
hackle regions, appear self-similar and scale invariant. These
features can be related to other properties such as fracture toughness,
elastic modulus and atomic bond lengths. Fractography identifies
the useful features created during the fracture process. With
the use of fracture mechanics, quantitative fractography relates
the crack sizes and surrounding topography to the failure stress
and energy released during fracture. Fractal geometry provides
a mathematical tool by which the energy of bond breaking can be
related to the macroscopic fracture energy. The combination of
fractography, fracture mechanics and fractal geometry, then, can
be used to relate the creation of the surface during bond rupture
to the fracture energy during crack propagation. The reason this
approach is so exciting is that this is the first time that a
quantitative relation exists for the scaling of all energies and
geometries from the atomic scale to the macroscopic during fracture,
and is verifiable through experimentation.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>4.3 Fractal Fracture Research in Europe<BR>
</B>
<P>
There is much research in Europe involving the applications of
fractal geometry in physical systems. However, most, if not all,
of the research which concentrates on understanding the application
of fractals to fracture is in France. Perhaps this is inspired
by the part-time presence of Dr. Benoit Mandelbrot in Paris at
the Ecole Polytechnic.
<P>
Most of the research being performed in the analysis of fracture
by applying principles of fractal geometry is analytical or modeling.
There are only two locations in Europe of which I am aware that
are engaged in experimental determination of the fractal dimension
or the characteristics of fracture surfaces: ONERA and St. Gobain
Industries. Ms. Elisabeth Bouchaud is the organizer of the work
at ONERA and is studying intermetallic and metallic alloy materials.
The group at ONERA concludes that fracture surfaces are self-affine
and that there is a universal roughness index of about 0.8 ( which
translates to a fractal dimension of approximately 2.2.) However,
this group acknowledges that the morphology of the fracture surface
and the effective fracture toughness of materials are closely
related. Francois Creuzet and his co-workers at Saint-Gobain have
shown that the fracture surfaces of soda-lime silica glass is
self-similar at the nanometer scale in that small regions of the
hackle zone exhibit the full set of mirror, mist and hackle regions.
<P>
Most of the other studies in France are focused on modeling and
analysis. These works include the research in the laboratory of
Stephane Roux at the Laboratoire de Physique et Mechanique at
the Ecole Superieure in Paris who studies the implications of
multifractality, i.e., the existence of more than one fractal
dimension in physical processes. Other studies concentrate on
the fragmentation of colloidal media. This work is being performed
at CNRS in Orleans by H. Van Damme and E. Lemaire. Prof. H. J.
Herrmann in CEN Saclay has shown that cracks can be grown on a
lattice by deterministic rules and their patterns can be fractal
due to the interplay of anisotropy and memory.
<P>
There are several different approaches to the study of fracture
in Europe, i.e., France. However, the different approaches agree
on several aspects. Fracture is a fractal process. This further
implies that the mathematics of chaotic systems, i.e., non-linear
systems, can be applied to help understand the fracture process.

<P>
<B>4.4 Assessment<BR>
</B>
<P>
There is increasing evidence that fracture surfaces in both brittle
and ductile materials can be characterized as fractal surfaces.
The implications of this fact are that the fracture process is
fractal, that there is a quantitative method for characterizing
fracture surfaces, that bond breaking energy scales from the atomic
to the macroscopic in a relatively simple manner and that there
is hope the entire fracture process can be understood using quantum
mechanics or fracture mechanics as modified by the fractal analysis.
What is needed for progress in this field is a unified effort
which assembles experimentalists, modelers and analysts together
for cooperative research. It is an interdisciplinary effort which
is required. The payoff will be great. If the fracture and failure
of materials is understood at all scales, then the assembly of
new materials at the atomic level becomes possible.<BR>

<P>
<B>5. WORKSHOP ON: ADVANCED CERAMICS &amp;AMP; COMPOSITES FOR
THE 21ST CENTURY IN TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS<BR>
</B>
<P>
During travels to various laboratories throughout Europe, discussions
of the future of materials research led to the conclusion that
there are several key areas for future research with great potential.
One of these is materials for future transportation systems. Europe
is acutely aware of the increasing importance of environmental
and economical concerns in manufacturing technology. It is also
acutely aware that inferior technologies will not be competitive
in the near future. Although many companies would like to use
existing materials for building new systems or substituting for
existing systems, it has been recognized that new technology will
require new materials. In many cases materials development will
lead the technologies. It is with this idea that the concept for
a workshop on materials for transportation systems in the 21<SUP>st</SUP>
century was developed.<BR>

<P>
This workshop has a fourfold purpose:
<P>
(1) identify the state of the art on the use of advanced ceramics
in transportation systems;
<P>
(2) highlight scientific and technological needs in ceramic based
materials for the 21st Century;
<P>
(3) inform industry, government and the scientific/technical community
in the United States and Western Europe of the latest technological
developments in ceramic based materials research for the transportation
industry; and
<P>
(4) prepare a strategic ceramic materials document to guide and
direct future materials policy decisions for transportation systems
in Europe and the United States.<BR>

<P>
Originally, the workshop was planned for the summer of 1996. The
workshop was planned as a joint effort between the US military
research services (headed by ONR) and the European Commission
with the assistance of Prof. van der Voorde in Petten. However,
when proposed to the European Commission, Prof. van der Voorde
said that they were hesitant to include the United States in the
process. It is obvious from other indications in funding directions
and topics at professional meetings that the subject of materials
for transportation systems is very important. Perhaps another
European organization would be interested in holding this workshop.<P>

<B>6. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS<BR>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The First International Workshop on Image Databases and Multimedia
Search convened at University Amsterdam, August 22-23, 1996.  The
workshop was sponsored in part by the International Association for
Pattern Recognition (IAPR).  Approximately one hundred attendees were
present and approximately thirty papers were presented.  Papers mainly
focussed on image database indexing based on color, shape, and motion
properties.  Notably absent were papers that described results using
texture, or methods that employed combinations of image properties.
<p>
The PI attended this workshop in order to present recent results of
research in shape representation, in particular nonrigid shape
representation. The workshop atmosphere provided a useful opportunity
to get feedback at an early stage of this research project.  In
addition, the workshop provided grist for thought on related topics in
image and video database indexing in general.
<p>
The rest of this report gives technical highlights from the workshop.
Emphasis is placed on the shape indexing papers, though some other
papers in color and video are described.  Critical analysis and
assessment of scientific benefit to the ONR supported research program
are provided as appropriate.

<h2>Technical Highlights</h2>

<h3>Shape</h3>

Three sets of authors reported methods that index shape based on
bounding contour.  Mokhtarian {\em et al.} presented a paper in which
curvature scale space (CSS) methods were extended to contour-based
image database indexing.  Their method is based on matching peaks in
the curvature scale space (CSS) graph as was originally proposed by
Witkin in 1983. Del Bimbo presented a system that describes contours
with a context-sensitive grammar that is based on features derived
from CSS.  Similarity distance measures seemed difficult to formalize
within this framework.  In a related paper, Tom Huang {\em et al.} used
modified Fourier descriptors for indexing contour shapes in an image
database of museum objects.
<p>
All three of these methods require complete, closed, bounding contours
for each shape.  In addition, these methods cannot incorporate
information about features that are interior to the shape.  This is in
contrast to methods like modal matching that can incorporate
information about both exterior and interior shape features.
<p>
The PI presented a paper reporting recent results in using modal
matching to index shape categories in image databases. The
presentation was well received.  The paper has been selected for
inclusion in a post-workshop book to be edited by Smeulders and Jain,
and the author was invited to contribute to an upcoming book on shape
indexing methods by Del Bimbo.  In similar work, Dell'Acqua {et al.}
reported encouraging results in employing the modal matching technique
for shapes defined as sparse feature sets. The group plans to
formulate a new boundary element version of modal matching for
contour-based recognition and indexing problems.
<p>
All shape indexing papers presented at the workshop emphasized shape
comparison based on global properties (or overall shape).  It is well
known that while global shape descriptors are relatively robust to
noise, they have limited usefulness with respect to occlusion and/or
missing parts.  On the other hand, while methods that emphasize local
properties or features are more robust to occlusion, they are not
usually very robust to noise and deformation.  This paradox was
discussed at length with colleagues during coffee break.  It was
agreed that more research is needed to develop hybrid representations
for more robust image indexing.
<p>
Another ackowledged problem was that of relying on {\em a priori},
clean segmentation as input to shape indexing/recognition modules.  In
workshop discussion, there was a sense that research should focus more
on the applications that drive the algorithmic development. The
requirement for clean segmentation as input to shape
indexing/recognition modules is a prime example of current
short-comings, since many image database applications require
automatic indexing. Coupling shape representation and image
segmentation presents a promising direction that will be explored as
this research project continues.  In addition, shape measures should
become more robust when coupled with outher image properties.
Including grayscale, color, and motion information in the modal shape
formulation is included as part of the work planned for the PI's ONR
supported research program.
<p>
<h3>Color</h3>

Three papers on color were of interest.  Particulary novel was a paper
on painting retrieval presented by Del Bimbo.  The method employs a
spherical color space that is based on studies of human subjects
reactions to the ``mood'' of colors (Luscher, 1976).  This space
enables retrieval of paintings based on color harmony and warm/cold
contrast. This underlying perceptually-motivated spherical color space
could be utilized fruitfully in providing an alternative
parameterization for traditional color histogramming techniques.
<p>
Two other presentations described comparitive studies of color models
for indexing.  Gevers and Smeulders described color and illumination
invariant features for retrieval (results from Gevers recent
dissertation).  Kasturi described a comparative study of retrieval
accuracy of various standard color spaces crossed with various
histogram distance measures.  His experiments indicated that the
particular color space employed did not significantly improve/degrade
retrieval accuracy.  The particular histogram distance measure did
matter, with bin-to-bin distance being most accurate.  Average color,
Chi-square histogram distance, and histogram intersection were
inferior.  The methods were tested both on still images, and images
extracted from video broadcasts.  
<p>
<h3>Video</h3>

There was one thought-provoking paper in the area of video retrieval.
Li and Lam described a preliminary framework that allows both
context-sensitive and context-free retrieval of video sequences based
on metadata.  Context sensitivity provides the capability to represent
higher-level effects produced by cinematic montage, in which a video segment's
perceived meaning may vary depending on the segments that come before
and after.  The shortcoming of the framework is that it relies on
user-entered metadata.  Entering metadata for large databases can be
time-consuming and expensive.  Furthermore, the accuracy,
completeness, and consistency of human-generated metadata is difficult
to maintain in general.

<title> A Report on ICML-1996 </title>
<h1>A Report on ICML-1996</h1>

<body>
<p>
This is a report of my attendance at the Thirteenth International 
Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 1996), held in Bari, Italy, during
July 3 to July 6 of 1996. My participation in the conference had 
two roles: (1) as the presenter of my work, and (2) as a member of 
the audience. 
</p>

<p>
First, some general observations about the conference. It was 
attended by about 200 researchers around the world. There were
63 papers accepted and presented in the conference out of a total 
of 257 submissions. The accepted papers represented the whole gamut
of Machine Learning, including reinforcement learning, decision-tree
learning, speedup learning, and inductive logic programming.
</p>

<p>
The paper I presented, titled Theory-Guided Empirical Speedup Learning of
Goal 
Decomposition Rules, represents two subareas of Machine Learning. One subarea
is speedup learning which primarily studies about learning to improve
the problem-solving performance (in terms of speed and quality) of a 
planner. Our paper proposes a change in paradigm for speedup learning
to overcome the problems faced by the previous research. The other
subarea our paper deals with is inductive logic programming (ILP)
which studies about learning concepts represented in first-order
logic, using examples. Our work in ILP proposes a
new algorithm to learn first-order concepts which are in disjunctive
normal form. 
</p>

<p>
The speedup learning area was under-represented in the conference 
(only two other papers), and the experienced attendees of the Machine 
Learning conferences told me when enquired that it has been the case 
for the last few years. The reason  for this is the
diminishing returns because of the stagnated techniques. The previous
techniques generate control knowledge using which problem solvers 
often slow down instead of speeding up as desired. Our work avoids
this pitfall (1) by providing a representation for efficient
architectures, and (2) by finding a problem solver that is 
consistent with the training examples. Thus, any problem solver
generated using our technique is guaranteed to be efficient. In that 
light, our work seems to be a significant step forward. The
people familiar with speedup learning research with whom I had a
chance to discuss my work, during the conference, found the approach 
of our paper to be promising.
</p>

<p>
One of the other papers in speedup learning is on learning 
quality-improving planning control knowledge [Perez]. Learning 
quality-improving preference rules
is one of the future concerns of our research project. To this end, 
Perez's work would be worth a close examination.
The other paper in speedup learning is on learning the definitions
of the operators that may make up a plan to achieve a goal [Tae and Cook]. 
This work is not particularly useful to our research work because we
have the operator definitions already given.
</p>

<p>
The ILP area was well-represented in the conference---in terms of both
the number of papers and the number of attendees concerning ILP. 
This area of research is far more active in Europe than in North
America. Therefore, interaction with the ILP researchers is rare, 
and is bound to be useful. The reaction to my talk from these researchers
yielded useful pointers to the literature related to my work: references
to the systems that use techniques similar to the ones used in our
system, and references to the work that proves polynomial learnability
of first-order disjunctive normal form (DNF) concepts---which is what
we are interested in establishing, but under different assumptions.
</p>

<p>
One of the concerns in ILP is its scalability to real-world problems.
My discussions with the researchers revealed their attempts at applying
ILP to real-world problems. Some of them are (1) applications to 
software-engineering processes such as inductive program development, 
maintenance and testing [Bergadano]; (2) application to analyze NMR 
spectroscopic data [Dzeroski]; (3) application to finite-element mesh 
design [Wettschereck]. Their assessments of ILP's successes in these
applications is highly positive and encouraging.
</p>

<p>
Matching first-order logic (FOL) descriptions is an integral part of ILP. 
However, this is a hard problem. Zucker and Ganascia present a technique
where they reduce the hypothesis space and the examples to one of
many possible attribute-value representations, and compute matching in
attribute-value representations. Although the new hypothesis space
is a subset of the original hypothesis space, matching in the new
representation is tractable. This is related to our work in the sense
that the representation we consider is also a less complex representation
than FOL representation, but more powerful than attribute-value 
representation. 
</p>

<p>
In the other work related to ILP, Emde and Wettschereck extend instance-based
learning (or nearest-neighbor algorithms) to work in ILP setting. 
Jappy et al. prove negative results (non-learnability theorems) in
robust-learning setting---a setting which is much stricter than 
probably approximately correct (PAC) learning setting. In this setting,
they prove that a class of concepts (which cover most of the concept types
considered in ILP) are not robustly learnable. These concepts are 
more general than that considered in PAC-learning setting. Bostrom presents
a learning system for FOL concepts representing regular languages.
</p>

<p>
In the rest, I report briefly on the work that is presented relating to
the other subareas of machine learning. 
</p>

<p>
<b> Invited talks</b> <br>

First, the invited talks. Mannila discussed how the fast-emerging field
of data mining is related to machine learning, and how it is different.
Moore briefly outlined the research issues involved with integrated
learning systems. He argued how factories offer good test-beds for these
systems. He discussed some reinforcement-learning solutions to 
integrated learning systems, with his Auton project as a case study.
Vapnik's talk was on statistical theory of generalization where 
he discussed learning using support vectors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Reinforcement learning</b> <br>

There were several papers on reinforcement learning in this
conference. I briefly describe the papers I had a chance to attend.
Tadepalli and Ok describe how reinforcement learning, in the average
reward framework,  can be scaled up to large, real-world applications.
In particular, they describe techniques to approximate large
domain models effectively, and how regularities in value functions
could be exploited to compress their representation. Boyan and Moore
present an algorithm that extends the insight given by graph-shortest-path
algorithms to improve on temporal-difference algorithm of reinforcement
learning. Their extension is in making the insight work for stochastic
state spaces that require function approximation. Wiering and Schmidhuber
present a technique to deal with learning in partially observable
markov decision processes (POMDPs), where the state is not fully
observable by the learning agent. This is an important work
because most of the work in reinforcement learning concentrates 
on MDPs and ignores the reality of partial observability.
Mahadevan fuses the two different kinds of optimality that reinforcement
learning algorithms try to achieve: discounted reward and average reward.
He does so using sensitive discount optimality, a well-studied concept
in dynamic programming.
</p>

<p>
<b>Bias-variance decomposition</b> <br>

Kohavi and Wolpert describe a technique where the error rate could be 
decomposed into the error due to bias and the error due to variance. The
error due to bias measures how closely a learning algorithm performs on 
the training examples with the target concept. The error due to variance 
measures how stable the algorithm's performance is for different 
training sets. Trying to decrease one can potentially increase the other. 
This work also discusses how to deal with this trade-off.
</p>

<p>
<b>Context-sensitive learning</b> <br>

On July 3, 1996, before the main conference, there was a workshop
on learning in context-sensitive domains. Much of the time of the 
workshop was spent on agreeing what ``context'' in learning meant. Although
there was a wide disagreement on the meaning and role of context,
from the papers presented in the workshop there were some common threads:
(1) Relevance of some features in learning increases by the presence
of some other features; (2) Knowledge learned for performing one task
can be transferred to perform another context; (3) There are changes
in the world which change the concept to be learned (for e.g., prediction
in stock market is affected by time); (4) Learning of multiple
tasks in parallel works synergistically.

<p>
This is a summary of what I felt were some interesting talks
of the workshop. 
<p>
<h3>General Purpose Algorithms:</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Van Gelder and Kamiya's approach to testing satisfiability was
new to me, and I found it quite exciting.  They (apparently
quite recently) have constructed an algorithm, "Modoc", which
simultaneously attempts to satisfy and to disprove an input CNF
formula.  Van Gelder described it by saying that the algorithm
focused upon finding disproofs, but which also, almost as a
by-product of failed searches, could assemble models to stop the
search on satisfiable formulas.
<p>
The algorithm uses a method called model elimination, which is,
in a sense, a middle-ground approach between Davis-Putnam
searches for models and standard resolution searches for
refutations.  Somewhat in the fashion of Davis-Putnam, the
algorithm picks a clause <i>c</i> and then posits, one by one, each of
the literals <i>l_i</i> in <i>c</i> to be true.  But for each <i>l_i</i>
it looks at clauses containing <i>!l_i</i> one by one, attempting to find
contradictions.  Such a controlled search, if it ends at
dead-ends or loops without finding a contradiction, may yield an
autarky <i>A</i> [Monien-Speckenmeyer]: a partial assignment not
involving any variables from the remaining (unsearched) clauses.
The problem now reduces to extending <i>A</i> to a model, thus
reducing the size of the search space (in the current local
search context).  On the other hand, when a contradiction is
found, tracing through the argument for relevant resolutions
produces a lemma (again in the current local search context).
All this obviously takes substantial overhead to compute, but it
is hoped to prune the search space sufficiently, and
sufficiently often, to provide a relatively fast solver.
<p>
The authors have a fairly carefully programmed
implementation in C.  Their experimental results suggested that,
although other methods outperform Modoc on random SAT instances,
Modoc may be more efficient on problems arising in circuit fault
testing.
<p>
<li>
Two of the papers addressed improved heuristics for finding
satisfying models of 3-CNF formulas: Battiti and Protasi's
Non-Oblivious Tabu Search (this was actually for MaxSAT) and van
Maaren's heuristics for quadratic cuts in the translations to IP
(and then relaxations to LP).  Battiti, by way of contrast, also
discussed Mitchell and Selman's recent WalkSAT algorithm.
<p>
Perhaps a similar view could be taken on Boros' work on
identifying renamable Horn sub-formulas of CNF formulas (rather
analogous to his previous work with Q-Horn formulas).  He noted
that in many large problems adapted from VLSI design, the number
of non-Horn clauses can be kept quite small, which should allow
efficient problem partition.  (For efficiency's sake, he
proposes doing this analysis just once on each formula, as a
form of preprocessing.)  He noted that for each 3-CNF formula
less than half of the clauses need be removed to form a
renamable Horn.  (He also asked what fraction can be achieved
for 4-CNF.)
<p>
<li>
[Side Commentary:] Besides being interested in satisfiability
per se, I am interested in adapting techniques used in studying
satisfiability for use in studying whether logic programs have
stable models.  Gu discusses applications of satisfiability in
various control and design problems.  It is my impression that
stable models may have have even better applications.  My,
admittedly highly subjective, reason for this belief is that
normal logic programs, basically by virtue distinguishing one of
the positive literals of a clause as the head and leaving the
others as negative subgoals, creates an important distinction in
expressibility which can be used to capture various natural ways
to look at problems.  Thus I believe a study of when logic programs
have stable models, analogous to the research already going on in
satisfiability, is highly worthwhile.
</ol>
<p>
<h3>Concern with Practical Solutions:</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Jun Gu's talk might be considered the lone real representative of the
practical engineering approach: build a system implementing several
approximating algorithms and taking the best of the answers provided.
Gu also made some very general references to applications of
satisfiability.
<p>
<li>
Mitchell and Levesque's work was somewhat on the practical side.
The practical concern, they insisted, is getting relatively
quick answers to satisfiability problems, rather than perfect
answers: finding a fast algorithm that provides only correct
answers and doesn't respond "I don't know" too often was their
goal.  In the talk, Mitchell cited our extension (with
Annexstein, Franco, and Swaminathan) of work of Evan, Itai, and
Shamir as an example to be extended.
</ol>
<p>
<h3>Special Classes of Formulas:</h3>

<ol>
<li>
Peter Heusch, in his Ph.D. thesis under Ewald Speckenmeyer,
studied the class <i>PIF</i> of propositional formulas built up
from boolean variables with just the connective --> (material implication).
Heusch showed that for <i>PIF</i> formulas containing just two
occurrences of every variable except one fixed variable <i>z</i>,
testing falsifiability is NP-complete, but if <i>z</i> is restricted to
<i>k</i> occurrences, testing falsifiability can be done in time <i>O(n^k)</i>
(for <i>n</i> the length of the formula).  At the workshop, Heusch
presented joint work with Lemburg and Speckenmeyer on subclasses
of <i>PIF</i> for which they had polynomial-time or NP-completeness
results.
<p>
<li>
My talk followed immediately after Heusch's talk.  Having just
finished (in work joint with John Franco, Judy Goldsmith, Ewald
Speckenmeyer, and R.P. Swaminathan) the proof of a complexity
result improving one from Peter Heusch's dissertation, I talked
about that work.  I prefer starting by recasting Heusch's work
into the following setting:
<p>
<ul>
<dt>
For propositional formulas built up from only the connective --> and
a constant <i>F</i> for false (this is well-known to be a
complete set of propositional connectives), if each
proposition variable occurs at most twice and <i>F</i> occurs at
most <i>k</i> times, then falsifiability can both be tested in time
<i>O(n^k)</i> (n the length of the formula); it follows trivially
that satisfiability can also be tested in time <i>O(n^(k+1))</i>.
Heusch also showed that falsifiability (and hence also
satisfiability) is NP-complete when <i>k</i> is allowed to vary.
</ul>
<p>
We improved on Heusch's complexity by finding an <i>O(k^k n^2)</i>
algorithm for satisfiability (and hence, trivially, no worse
than an <i>O((k+1)^(k+1) n^2)</i> algorithm for falsifiability).  This
is particularly interesting because of Downey and Fellows' work
on fixed parameter tractability results, algorithms where there
parameter <i>k</i> of the input such that the problem is NP-complete
for varying values of <i>k</i> but polynomial <i>of fixed degree</i>
(just varying coefficient) for each fixed value of <i>k</i>.  They have
isolated this class as an important class of problems for study.
Thus our result, besides just giving a way to speed up Heusch's
in many cases, shows that testing satisfiability and
falsifiability for this class of formulas is fixed parameter
tractable.  (Of course, our result also strengthens Heusch's
result by showing that satisfiability and falsifiability are
polynomial time when we merely require, say, only that
<i>k < (log(n))/(log(log(n)))</i>.)
<p>
So far as we -- and the conference attendees -- know, this is
the first fixed parameter tractability result in satisfiability
theory.  In response to my query on this subject, two attendees
suggested other problems which might be fixed parameter
tractable, one of them quite interesting (and open).
<p>
<li>
One of Kleine B&uuml;ning and Lettmann's two papers concerned CNF
formulas in which changing the polarity of a small number of the
literals does not alter the satisfiability.  Personally, I felt
that, although their setting was quite interesting, their
results were more negative than positive, although they did show
that (1) the likelihood that a random 3-CNF formula is in this
class is high in regions significantly far away from the
approximately 4.25 threshold for satisfiability, and that (2) if
it is somehow known that any number up to 1/5 of the literals'
polarities may be so changed, then satisfiability may be tested
in polynomial time.  Van Gelder pointed out the obvious critical
question: how difficult is it to recognize membership in their
classes of formulas?
<p>
However, it seems a closely related notion is of relevance to
satisfiability applied to control theory.  In that case, we
might pick a particular satisfying assignment <i>A</i> for a
formula <i>F</i>.  If after we change the polarities of any <i>k</i>
literals in <i>F</i>, <i>A</i> is still a model of <i>F</i> --- or
perhaps if it is possible to change only a few (<i>k?</i>) truth values
in <i>A</i> to make it a model for the new <i>F</i> --- then call <i>A</i>
<i>k</i>-robust.  This might be a useful measure of
the robustness of a control algorithm.  Identification of
<i>k</i>-robust models would seem to have clear significance.
<p>
<li>
In the open question period at the end of the workshop, Tomas
Eiter also presented the following question, which can be
considered a satisfiability question: How fast an algorithm can
be constructed to satisfy the following question?  In
particular, prove either that there exists a polynomial time
algorithm or that the problem is NP-complete.
<p>
<ul>
<dt>
<b>Given:</b> <i>P</i>, a collection of <i>all positive clauses</i>
<i>{x_1,...,x_i}</i> such that the intersection of any two clauses in
<i>P</i> is nonempty.
<p>
Let <i>N = { {not x_1,..., not x_i}: {x_1,...,x_i}</i> is in <i>P}</i>.
<p>
<b>Question:</b> Is <i>P</i> U <i>N</i> satisfiable?
</ul>
<p>
The fastest known algorithm to solve this problem is <i>O(n^(log
n))</i>.  The problem is not known to be NP-complete, nor is any
polynomial-time algorithm known.  (It is also apparently not
known whether an <i>O(n^(log n))</i> algorithm is possible for any
NP-complete problem, of course assuming that P not= NP.)  If a
polynomial-time algorithm for this problem is found, or if the
problem is NP-complete, there are many known consequences.
(Eiter managed to diminish the excitement a little by listing
many "big names" who had worked unsuccessfully on the problem,
such as Yannakakis, Papadimitriou, and Johnson.)
</ol>

Eiter, Ibaraki, and Makino's work on extension problem, on whether a
partial truth assignment <i>P</i> can be extended to a total truth
assignment <i>T</i>, where <i>T</i> is defined by a formula of some
class <i>C</i>, seems an important problem.  For example, machine
learning normally limits itself to formulas in some specified class.
They studied two classes of formulas: <i>C</i> double Horn and bidual
Horn; I shall be very interested in seeing similar, nontrivial,
results for other classes <i>C</i>.
<p>
<li>
Kullman presented some complexity results relating to Tseitin's
extended resolution proofs.  Earlier results had showed that
extended resolution can significantly shorten proofs but had not
proved superpolynomial lower bounds on proof lengths.  The
particular sorts of extensions Tseitsin apparently used in his
examples are all additions of what Kullman calls blocked
clauses.  Through a careful analysis of resolution proofs on
added blocked clause, Kullman proved both a parameterized set of
exponential speedup results (depending upon the length of added
blocked clauses) and an exponential lower bound for the maximum
length of proofs; however, Kullman's results hold only for the
case where no new variables are added (apparently a significant
departure from Tsietsin's examples).  In spite of the
restriction, I find Kullman's analysis very interesting, and I
think using this or using approaches holds promise for really
significant results.
<p>
<li>
Urquhart presented a very interesting theoretical talk on
gaining short proofs by adding proof rules.  A "global symmetry
proof rule" had already been studied by Krishnamurthy; for
example, he showed that Haken's pigeon hole clauses had short
proofs in the system since the underlying (complete) graph has
many symmetries; on the other hand, this is no help in graphs
with no symmetries.  Urquhart proposed using the "global
symmetry proof rule" and also a "complementation proof rule"
and discussed how to defeat such a proof rule.  He also
mentioned a "local symmetry proof rule" whose behaviour he
said was open; his idea is that random sets of clauses should
have many small local symmetries, but few large symmetries.  But
there is a difficulty: local symmetry is hard to check for.
Purdom, however, remarked that symmetry may be one of the ways
in which real problems differ from random problems.  In any
case, the use of symmetry rules in general seems exciting.
<p>
Again, there are obvious comparisons with work in logic
programming.  Although there semantics are generally defined in
terms of propositional logic programs (via ground
instantiations), any concern for computational efficiency forces
one to deal with more general substitutions.  Such general
substitutions are just a simple way to capture a sort of local
symmetry.  I have never seen any more general analysis of such
symmetry in logic programming; it is probably worth pursuing.

<h3><b>1.</b> Introduction</h3>

This workshop is the latest example of steadily increasing work and
results in the area of propositional satisfiability over the last few
years.  The following recent events attest to this rising interest in the
subject.  There have been Satisfiability competitions in Paderborn and FAW
(Ulm), Germany; Rutgers University (DIMACS), the United States; and
Beijing, China.  There have been two DIMACS workshops on satisfiability
including one organized by Selman and Kautz and one organized this year by
Gu, Du, and Pardalos.  Last year, a Boolean symposium was organized by
Golombic as part of EURO 14 in Jerusalem, and Boolean sessions within OR
conferences such as EURO, INFORMS and the Symposium on Math Programming
have become common.  Books by Kleine B&uuml;ning, Truemper, and Hooker
either have appeared or are due to appear soon.  A comprehensive survey on
satisfiability algorithms, by Gu, Purdom, Franco, and Wah, should appear
soon.  Recently initiated major projects include a new book on
satsfiability algorithms, an IEEE tutorial on satisfiability, and a
special issue of the <i>Communications of the ACM</i> on satisfiability
algorithms.
<p>
Although quite a large body of results on the subject had been obtained
before the late 1980's, there are perhaps two main reasons for the sudden
entry into the field of extremely good talent and the subsequent explosion
of new results; one of these has to do with special applications and one
with theoretical aspects of satisfiability.
<p>
On the applied side, a growing number of companies seem convinced that a
good understanding of satisfiability algorithms will help their
competitive standing.  This may be due to the success of certain
non-resolution-based algorithms, such as the local improvement algorithms
of Gu, Selman and others, on a host of military and industrial
applications.  While not yet explainable analytically, the performance of
such algorithms on satisfiable formulas has been reported to be
surprisingly good even when such formulas have thousands of variables.
Moreover, it seems that for some NP-complete problems, such as the
Steiner Tree problem, transforming to a satisfiability problem and solving
with one of the new satisfiability algorithms can be more effective than
solving the problem in the original domain.  Finally, chip design
diasters, such as the floating point failure of Pentium processors, point
out the need for satisfiability-based tools to aid in the verification
process.  Indeed, Randy Bryant has recently shown that the floating point
problem could have been discovered if tools already developed by him had
been used by Intel.
<p>
On the theoretical side, two major questions concerning the lengths of
resolution proofs were at least partially answered in the late 1980s and
early 1990's.  One series of papers authored by Tseitin, Galil, Haken,
Urquhart, and Chvatal and Szemeredi reached a milestone with the classic
1988 result that all resolution proofs on nearly all randomly generated
unsatisfiable formulas of constant-width are of exponential length if the
ratio of clauses to variables is held constant.  Simultaneously, another
collection of papers by Chao, Franco, Chvatal, Reed, Frieze, and Suen
showed that a Davis-Putnam variant is effective on nearly all
random formulas of constant-width if the ratio of clauses to variables is
not too high.  Such results, although startling, raised more open
questions such as the following.  Why can't Davis-Putnam algorithms be
proven effective for random formulas with close to a 50 percent chance of
being satisfiable?  Can it be shown that resolution proofs must be large
for most random formulas even if the ratio of clauses to variables grows?
Is there a 0-1 (threshold) law governing the probability that a random
formula of constant-width is satisfiable?  Do random formulas of
constant-width usually belong to a special polynomially-solved subclass of
satisfiability (such as q-SAT).
<p>
Recent attacks on these and other questions have yielded a steady stream
of improvements to our understanding of resolution proof size and the
threshold phenomenon.  Recently, Beame and Pitassi developed new
techniques to show that the result of Chvatal and Szemeredi can be
extended to growing ratios of clauses to variables (up to a point).
Several recent papers involving de la Vega, Motwani, Spirakis, Kamath,
Dubois, and others introduced techniques that have reduced the known upper
limit on the satisfiability threshold to somewhere near where it is
suspected to be.  Special polynomially solvable subclasses of
satisfiability that are based on LP relaxations have recently been shown
by Schlipf, Annexstein, Franco, and Swaminathan to be subsumed by
Davis-Putnam algorithms and, in a probabilistic sense, these classes have
been shown by Franco and VanGelder to be considerably smaller than the
class of constant-width formulas solved in polynomial time by matching.
Hierarchies of fixed-parameter-tractable classes of constant-width
formulas have been defined by Gallo, Heusch, Speckenmeyer, Dalal and
others, and surprising progress on the complexities of such classes has
been made by Schlipf, Franco, Goldsmith, Swaminathan, and Speckenmeyer.
Also of interest are the series of improvements by Monien, Speckenmeyer,
Schiermeyer, and Kullmann to upper bounds on the complexity of
Davis-Putnam style algorithms given constant-width formulas (now down to
approximately <i>O(1.5^n))</i>.
<p>
On the experimental side, some old techniques are beginning to be applied
to satisfiability with promising results.  Notable among these are
the Lagrangian techniques of (independent and different) vanMaaren, Nobili,
and Wah.
<p>
With this exciting backdrop of activity, the organizers chose to have a
small workshop, lasting an entire week, of representatives of the main
areas identified above.  There were only four or five 45 minute talks a
day with plenty of time to get into details.  There was also plenty of
time for informal one-one and group discussions afterwards.  The idea was
to have all the participants know each other much better after the
workshop than before.

<h3><b>2.</b> Results</h3>

Results are presented by category, following threads of research
activity.  The <i>constant-width</i> model used below is a
parameterized probability distribution on satisfiability formulas in
Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) described as follows: a random formula
contains <i>m</i> clauses independently chosen from the set of all
<i>k</i>-literal clauses that can be composed from <i>n</i> variables
(no two literls are the same or complementary).  The
<i>random-width</i> model is described as follows: a random formula
contains <i>m</i> clauses independently constructed from a set of
<i>n</i> variables and their complements (<i>2n</i> literals) where
each literal exists in a given clause with probability <i>p</i>,
independently of the rest.  When we say Davis-Putnam style algorithms
we mean algorithms incorporating splitting and possibly other rules
for variable elimination found in [8].  Sections are ordered according
to the personal taste of the author.
<p>
<a name="1"></a>
<h3><b>2.1</b> 0-1 threshold for random constant-width formulas</h3>

Early work [4] on the probabilistic analysis of satisfiability
algorithms with respect to the constant-width model revealed the
probability that a random formula is satisfiable tends to 0 if the
ratio <i>m/n>-1/log_2(1-2^{-k})</i>.  If <i>k=3</i> this is about
<i>m/n>5.19</i>.  The result is simple to obtain and has been
rederived many times.  The idea is to find an expression for the
expected number of satisfying truth assignments for a random formula
and then find the conditions for which that expectation tends to 0.
Since the expectation is an upper bound on the probability that a
random formula is satisfiable, these conditions also apply to the
probability that a random formula is satisfiable.  Unfortunately, the
variance of the number of satisfying truth assignments is too large
for the above bound to be tight.
<p>
Later work [2,3,5] showed that Davis-Putnam like algorithms with no or
limited backtracking can find a truth assignment satisfying a random
formula with probability tending to 1 if
<p>
<i>m/n < .46((k-1)/(k-2))^{k-2}(2^k/(k+1))-1,</i> for <i>4 <= k <= 40</i>;<br>
<i>m/n < .125((k-1)/(k-3))^{k-3}((k-1)/(k-2))(2^k/k),</i> for <i>3 <=
k</i>;<br>
<i>m/n < 3.003,</i> for <i>k=3</i>.
<p>
These results plus the simple result cited above have left an
irresistable gap of roughly <i>2^k/k < m/n < 2^k</i> where it is not
known even whether the probability that a random formula is
satisfiable tends to 0 or 1, let alone whether any algorithms are
efficient in a probabilistic sense.
<p>
Recent work by several groups has attacked the gap from above for
<i>k=3</i>.  In the span of a little over a year, it has fallen from
5.19, to 5.01, to 4.75, and now to 4.64.  The techniques used to
derive the last result promise to settle the question from above, once
and for all.  The idea, shared by two groups, is to lexicographically
order satisfying truth assignments and count the subset beginning with
a particular kind of assignment.  If the subset is empty, then there
are no satisfying truth assignments for the given formula.  Since the
subset is very small and has a low variance, the expectation of its
size is a tight bound for the probability that a satisfying assignment
exists.
<p>
Representatives from both groups were invited to the workshop.  One
agreed to come but at the last minute could not obtain the funding to
do so.  Therefore, Goerdt presented these results at the workshop.
<p>
We remark that in 1991 Goerdt and Chvatal and Szemeredi showed that there
is a 0-1 threshold for <i>k=2</i> at <i>m/n=1</i>.
<p>

<h3><b>2.2</b> Lagrangian methods</h3>

Lagrangian methods have recently been applied to satisfiability.  Two
papers presented at the workshop are concerned with such relaxations.
The general goal is to introduce quadratic cuts which, in one case
(vanMaaren), leads to better approximations for the solution space of
LP formulations of satisfiability and, in the other case (Nobili), for
the maximum satisfiability problem, leads to computations of
approximations to LP optima that are faster than applying the simplex
method.
<p>
The use of Lagrangian methods is outlined as follows.  Let <i>A^F</i>
be the clause-variable incidence matrix associated with formula
<i>F</i>.  That is, element <i>A^F_{ij}</i> has value 1 if literal
<i>x_j</i> is in the <i>i</i>th clause, -1 if literal <i>!x_j</i> is
in the <i>i</i>th clause, and 0 if neither literal <i>x_j</i> nor
literal <i>!x_j</i> are in the <i>i</i>th clause. Let <i>nu(A)</i> be
the vector such that the <i>i</i>th component is the number of -1's in
the <i>i</i>th row of <i>A</i>.  Let <b><i>e_n</i></b> be the
<i>n</i>-vector of all 1's.  Then the satisfiability problem may be
formulated as
<p>
<i>Az >= <b>e_n</b> - nu(A), z in {0,1}^n,</i>
<p>
and the maximum satisfiability problem may be formulated as minimize
<i>c^Tx</i> subject to
<p>
<i>[A I]x >= <b>e_{m+n}</b> - nu([A I]), x in {0,1}^{m+n},</i>
<p>
where <i>c</i> is the vector of dimension <i>n+m</i> whose first
<i>n</i> elements are 0 and whose remaining elements are 1; <i>x</i>
is the vector of dimension <i>n+m</i> whose first <i>n</i> elements
are <i>z</i>, above, and whose remaining elements `measure' which
clauses are satisfied; and <i>I</i> is the appropriate identity
matrix.
<p>
The relaxation for maximum satisfiability considered by Nobili is
<p>

<i>max_{l}{L(l) = min_{x}{(c^T-l^T[A I])x + l^T(<b>e_{n+m}</b> - nu([A
I]))}},</i>
<p>
where <i>l</i> is an <i>m</i> dimensional vector of positive reals.
<i>L(l)</i> is an approximation for <i>c^Tx</i> that bounds it from
below.  A <i>l</i> can be built iteratively to get a good
approximation: at iteration <i>t</i>, the aim is to find the <i>l</i>
that maximizes <i>L</i> for a row-submatrix of a modified <i>A</i>
(see below) then add violated constraints and continue the process.
In general, it is not easy to extend the <i>l</i> that is optimal at
iteration <i>t</i> to a <i>l</i> that is optimal at iteration
<i>t+1</i>.  In fact, the non-zero elements of the optimal <i>l</i>
for iteration <i>t</i> may be completely different from those of the
optimal <i>lambda</i> for iteration <i>t+1</i>.  However, Nobili has
noticed some conditions under which it can be done easily (that is, a
new <i>l</i> and additional constraints can be constructed by
inspection instead of by solving a linear programming relaxation).
Such tests may be added to speed up existing simplex-based solutions
borrowed from the Set Covering problem.  We note that the constraints
added by Nobili aim toward the <I>logical completion</I> of <i>A</i>.
The logical completion includes <i>A</i> and all pairwise `resolvents'
derived from rows of <i>A</i>.  The logical completion of <i>A</i> is
usually much bigger than <i>A</i>.  Currently, not enough experiments
have been performed to ascertain the effectiveness of these results.
<p>
The relaxation for satisfiability considered by vanMaaren is more
complex.  Let <i>A</i> be defined for CNF formula <i>F</i>.  Let
<i>C_i</i> be the <i>i</i>th row of <i>A</i>.  Let <i>P_i</i> be the
set of integers representing column numbers of <i>A</i> for which 1s
exist in <i>C_i</i>.  Let <i>N_i</i> be the set of integers
representing column numbers for which -1s exist in <i>C_i</i>.  Define
<p>
<i> w_i(x) = 1 - sum_{k in P_i}x_k - sum_{j in N_i}(1-x_j),</I> for <i>-inf <
s
<= 1.</i>
<p>
Define
<p>
<i>A_e(s) = (s+sqrt{s^2+e})/(1+sqrt{1+e}),</i>
<p>
where <i>e</i> is a parameter depending only on clause length.  Define
<p>
<i>P^F(x) = (sum_{i=1}^m(1 - A_e_i(w_i(x)))^r)^{1/r}/m,</i>
<p>
where <i>r<0</i> is a parameter and <i>e_i = e_j</i> if the number of
non-zero entries in <i>C_i</i> and <i>C_j</i>, <i>i not= j</I>, is the
same.  It has been shown that there exists a threshold
<i>h_{F,e,r}</I>, depending only on countable properties of <i>F</i>
and the <i>e</i> and <i>r</i> parameters, such that <i>P^F(t) >=
h_{F,e,r}</i> if and only if <i>F</i> is satisfied at <i>t</i>.  Thus,
the inequality <i>P^F(x) >= h_{F,e,r}</i> defines a region separating
the satisfying and non-satisfying assignments of <i>F</i>.  For the
sake of computational tractability, vanMaaren replaces <i>P</i> with
its second order Taylor expansion around the center <i>c</i> of the
unit cube (<i>x_i=1/2, 1 <= i <= n</i>).  The aim is to find, for some
parameter values, a "good" pair of thresholds <i>h_n</i> and
<i>h_s</i> such that <i>p(z) < h_n</i> defines a region containing no
satisfying truth assignments and <i>p(z) > h_s</i> defines a region
containing only satisfying truth assignments, where <i>p(z) = P(c+z) -
P(c)</i> and <i>P</i> is the second order Taylor expansion of
<i>P^F</i>.
<p>
The relaxation proposed by vanMaaren can be used to determine
satisfiability for given formulas.  In this workshop vanMaaren shows
that his <i>geometric interpretation</i> can possibly be used to
develop intuition about the properties of formulas that relate to
"hardness."  For example, 3-CNF formulas with the property that the
number of occurrences of positive literals for each variable are about
equal to the number of occurrence of negative literals yield regions
that are nearly spherical and centered at the center of the unit cube:
that is, they present little discriminating information.  Such "sign
balanced" formulas are thought to be very hard.
<p>
<a name="3"></a>
<h3><b>2.3</b> Probabilistic analysis of Davis-Putnam variants</h3>

Although most current research activity on the probabilistic analysis of
satisfiability algorithms is related to the constant-width model, a string
of results spanning about 10 years, mainly due to Purdom and colleagues,
has revealed the average performance of satisfiability algorithms with
respect to the random-width model.
<p>
Early work on this model showed that most random formulas are trivial.
Thus, if <i>p > ln(m)/n</i>, a random assignment satisfies a random
instance with high probability and if <i>p < ln(m)/(2n)</i>, random
formulas have at least one null clause (and therefore are
unsatisfiable) with high probability.  In between, a Davis-Putnam
variant finds satisfying truth assignments, when at least one exists,
with high probability.
<p>
Surprizingly, finding a collection of algorithms that, when run
simultaneously have polynomial average time behavior, proved very hard.
Interest in such results is due to the fact that, in practice, one
pathological formula (requiring an extraordinary amount of time) out of a
large sample of formulas can be intolerable; a polynomial-time <i>average</i>
result suggests this won't happen.  Until recently, no such
result was known for much of the parameter space of the random-width
model.  As reported in this workshop, Purdom has found a collection of
algorithms that succeeds.
<p>
The collection consists of one previously studied algorithm and a new
one.  The new algorithm is another variant of the Davis-Putnam
procedure.  Fix any truth assignment <i>t</i> to the variables of the
formula, and recurse on the following as long as necessary: locate a
clause <i>C={l_1,l_2,...,l_x}</i> (where <i>l_i</i>, <i>1 <= i <=
x</i> are literals) that is falsified by <i>t</i>, split on
<i>l_1</i>, under <i>l_1 = false</i> split on <i>l_2</i>, under
<i>l_1=false</i> and <i>l_2=false</i> split on <i>l_3</i> and so on up
to <i>l_x</i>.  Purdom shows that the algorithm outlined above has
polynomial average-time complexity when <i>p >= ln(m)/n</i>.
Previously, it had been shown that a restricted form of resolution
provides polynomial-size proofs, on the average, when <i>p <=
ln(m)/n</i>.

<h3><b>2.4</b> Fixed-parameter-tractable hierarchies of SAT classes</h3>

Several hierarchies of successively "harder" satisfiability classes
have been proposed.  Recently, Heusch proposed such a hierarchy based
on pure implication logic.  Pure implication formulas are defined
recursively as follows:

<ol>
<li>
A variable is a pure implication formula.
<li>
If <i>F_1</i> and <i>F_2</i> are pure implication formulas then
<i>(F_1 -> F_2)</i> is a pure implication formula.
</ol>
<p>
Eliminating parentheses on right to left associativity, a pure implication
formula can be written <i>F_1 -> F_2 -> ... -> F_p -> z</i> where <i>z</i>
is a variable.  We call the <i>z</i> variable of a formula the
<i>right-end</i>
variable.
<p>
The satisfiability problem is trivial for a pure implication formula but
the problem of falsifiability is NP-complete even if all variables
except the right-end variable occur at most twice in the formula.  (note
that this is obviously equivalent to a satisfiability problem on CNF
formulas constructed in a particular way from a given pure implication
formula).  Let <i>k</i> be the number of occurrences of the right-end
variable.
Heusch [6] defined a hierarchy of satisfiability classes
based on pure implication logic, with parameter <i>k</i>, and showed that the
<i>k</i>th level of the hierarchy can be solved in time <I>O(|F|^k)</i>.
Thus, level 1 is linear-time solvable, level 2 is quadratically solvable,
and so on.  A remarkable feature of the lower levels of the hierarchy is
that they have extremely limited expressibility and yet these classes are
incomparable with repect to other polynomial-time solvable classes such as
2-SAT, q-SAT, and SLUR.  This feature might become a tool for
investigating the hardness of formulas, both for satisfiability and other
NP-complete problems.
<p>
To use this feature effectively in this regard, we must better
understand the complexities associated with each level of the
hierarchy.  In particular, there is nothing known that theoretically
prevents the complexity of level <i>k</i> formulas from being
<i>O(2^k|F|^c)</i> where <i>c</i> is a constant.  The paper presented
by John Schlipf finds that level <i>k</i> of the hierarchy can be
solved in <i>O(k^k|F|^2)</i> time.  Thus, Heusch's hierarchy is the
first satisfiability hierarchy known to us that is
<i>fixed-parameter-tractable</i>.  This result may impact known
complexities of hierarchies of problems analysed in the growing
fixed-parameter-tractable literature.  For some of these, the best
known complexities are of <i>O(n^k)</i> where <i>n</i> represents the
length of the input.  The result also provides a better understanding
of where to look for "borderline-hard" formulas.
<p>
Heusch has looked at properties of pure implication formulas that lead
to linear-time solutions.  In his talk, he showed that if all
subformulas of the type <i>(u -> (v -> w))</i> are forbidden, then the
falsifiability problem can be solved in linear time.  Other
linear-time subclasses were presented as well.

<h3><b>2.5</b> Upper bounds on the complexity of 3-satisfiability</h3>

An interesting thread of results concerns upper bounds on the
complexity of certain Davis-Putnam style algorithms for solving
3-satisfiability formulas.  Notable progress over the obvious
<i>O(2^n)</i> complexity of simple backtracking was first achieved by
Monien and Speckenmeyer [7] using the concept of autarkness.  A
partial truth assignment <i>t</i> for a given subset <i>L</i> of
complementary pairs of literals is <i>autark</i> in formula <i>F</i>
if and only if for every clause <i>C</i> in <i>F</i>, if <i>C</i>
contains at least one literal in <i>L</i>, then <i>C</i> is satisfied
by <i>t</i>.  The following two statements are obvious and lead to a
<i>O(1.61^n)</i> algorithm for 3-satisfiability.  If a truth
assignment <i>t</i> is autark, then all clauses in <i>F</i> containing
at least one literal assigned a value by <i>t</i> are satisfied by
<i>t</i>.  If <i>t</i> is not autark in <i>F</i> then, in some clause,
all literals assigned values by <i>t</i> are falsified.
<p>
This result has now been improved by Schiermeyer.  The algorithm is too
complicated to state here.  It is based on repeatedly selecting a shortest
clause and then adding a number of tests and modifications to <i>F</i>
which either add or remove clauses from <i>F</i> and remove literals from
clauses in <i>F</i>.  The reader is referred to the abstract for details.
<p>
One key notion seems to be <i>pure literal look ahead</i> which is
based on the following idea.  Let <i>C</i> be a clause containing two
literals <i>x_1</i> and <i>x_2</i> and suppose that for all clauses
<i>C'</i> other than <i>C</i>, if <i>x_2</i> in <i>C'</i> then
<I>x_1</i> in <i>C'</i>.  Then assign <i>x_2</i> the value <i>true</i>
and the result is that <i>!x_1</i> is a pure literal in <i>F</i>.  The
above ideas have been used by Schiermeyer to reduce the upper bound to
<i>O(1.57^n)</i>.  His contribution to this workshop is an improved
analysis that brings the upper bound on 3-satisfiability complexity to
<i>O(1.49^n)</i>.
<p>
Kullmann has also made an interesting contribution to this area with the
introduction of blocked clauses.  A clause <i>C</i> is <i>blocked</i> with
respect to a formula <i>F</i> if it contains a literal <i>x</i> such that
every resolvent of <i>C</i> with another clause on <i>!x</i> is in some sense
not interesting.  Using blocked clauses, Kullman has obtained an
<i>O(1.5045^n)</i> upper bound for 3-satisfiability complexity.
<p>
Perhaps the greatest value of this line of work is 1) the intuition that
is developed from the study of many different ideas for choosing
a variable to split on and the notion of blocked clauses; 2) the
generalizations devised by Kullmann.

<h3>2.6 Resolution proof length</h3>

Finding bounds on the lengths of resolution proofs has a long history
involving classic results by Tseitin, Haken, Urquhart, Chvatal, Szemeredi,
Goerdt and others.  Generally, the results are negative: families of
formulas are shown to require exponential length proofs.
<p>
Urquhart studies the effect of symmetry rules on resolution proof
length.  Let <i>sigma_pi(C*)</i> be the clauses obtained by applying a
permutation <i>pi</i> on the variables of <i>C*</i> to each of the
clauses of <i>C*</i>.  Suppose a clause <i>C</i> has been derived from
a set of clauses <i>C*</i> and <i>sigma_pi(C*) = C*</i>.  Then
<i>sigma_pi(C)</i> can be inferred as the next step in the derivation.
This is the global symmetry rule.  Suppose <i>C</i> is a clause
derived from <i>C*</i> and for every <i>C'</i> in <i>C*</i> used in
the derivation of <i>C</i>, <i>sigma_pi(C')</i> is also in <i>C*</i>.
Then <i>sigma_pi(C)</i> can be inferred on the next step.  This is the
local symmetry rule.  The symmetry rules can have a dramatic effect on
resolution proof length in a variety of instances.  For example,
proofs on pigeon-hole formulas can be reduced from exponential to
quadratic length.  Moreover, these rules can be generalized by
allowing complementation of literals as well as permutations.
Urquhart shows that this extension of the symmetry rules is as
powerful as extended resolution.  That is, resolution with the global
symmetry rule allowing complementation is p-equivalent to extended
resolution.
<p>
Van Gelder proposes a new pruning method to reduce the length of proofs.
This method is designed to prevent refutation attempts that can not possibly
succeed.  The method is based on autarkness  (see Section 2.5).
The reader is referred to the extended abstract for details.
<p>
Kleine B&uuml;ning and Lettmann consider the question whether, for an
arbitrary clause <i>C</i> in formula <i>F</i>, <i>F |= C</i> holds.
This is often hard to determine.  In their paper they investigate
whether the hardness is due to structural properties of formulas or to
the meaning of the formula: that is, whether, for a given formula
<i>F</i>, there exists an equivalent formula <i>F'</i> of restricted
length for which <i>F' |= C</i> and this can be determined quickly.
The conclusion is that for all polynomials <i>p</i> and <i>q</i>,
there exists a formula <i>F</i> such that, for every equivalent
formula <i>F'</i> with length less than <i>q(|F|)</i>, there is a
clause <i>C</i> for which the shortest resolution proof proving that
<i>C</i> is a consequence of <i>F'</i> requires more than
<i>p(|F|)</i> time.

<h3>2.7 Polynomial time solvable subclasses of satisfiability</h3>

Several polynomial-time solvable subclasses of satisfiability have
been proposed.  Among the more interesting are the Horn, extended
Horn, balanced matrix, single lookahead unit resolution, and q-Horn
formulas.  An intriguing question is whether any of these classes
comes close to what in some sense may be the largest easily definable
subclass of satisfiability that is solved in polynomial time.  For now
we will call such a class of formulas <i>p-dominant</I>.  The class of
q-Horn formulas is thought to be p-dominant because of the following
result due to Boros, Crama, Hammer, and Saks [1].  Let
<i>{v_1,v_2,...,v_m}</i> be a set of Boolean variables, and <i>P_k</i>
and <i>N_k</i>, <i>P_k intersection N_k= emptyset</i> be subsets of
<i>{1,2,...,m}</i> such that the <i>k</i>th clause in a CNF formula is
given by <i>V_{i in P_k}v_i V_{i in N_k} !v_i</i>.  Construct the
following system of inequalities:
<p>

<i>sum_{i in P_k} a_i + sum_{i in N_k}(1-a_i) <= Z, (k=1,2,...,n),</i> and
<i>0 <= a_i <= 1, (i=1,2,...,m)</i>.
<p>
where <i>Z in R+</i>.  If all these constraints are satisfied with <i>Z <=
1</i>
then the formula is q-Horn.  On the other hand, the class of formulas such
that the minimum <i>Z</i> required to satisfy these constraints is greater
than
<>1+e</i>, for any <i>e>0</i>, is NP-complete.
<p>
Franco and Van Gelder have investigated the possibility that one of
the above classes is p-dominant from a probabilistic perspective.
Under the constant-width model (<i>k</i> literals per clause), there
are several Davis-Putnam style algorithms that almost always find
satisfying truth assignments in polynomial time when <i>m/n <
c2^k/k</i>, <i>c</i> a constant.  We would hope, then, that a random
formula generated under this constraint would be, say, q-Horn with
probability tending to 1.  In fact we find that this can only happen
if <i>m/n < c/k^2</i>.  Moreover, the same can be said of the other
classes.  The reason is that, for each class, there are forbidden
structures, typically "cycles" among clauses, and, since the model is
symmetric, when cycles begin to be generated in preponderance (that
is, when <i>m/n > c/k^2</i>) so do forbidden ones.
<p>
Equally surprising is a random formula can be solved in polynomial time by
the following <i>matching</i> algorithm if <i>m/n < c</i>.  Create a bipartite
graph with vertices on one side representing clauses and on the other
variables.  Put an edge between two vertices on opposite sides if the
corresponding variable is in the corresponding clause regardless of
polarity.  Find a maximum matching for the graph.  If the matching covers
all clause-vertices then, for each clause-vertex, assign the variable
corresponding to the vertex adjacent to it in the matching the value which
satisfies the corresponding clause.
<p>
The above results show that previously studied classes are, in some
probabilistic sense, not p-dominant because a seemingly wide range of
random formulas that can be solved easily by even a simple matching
algorithm.  These results have not yet been written up.
<p>
Another interesting question concerning polynomial time solvability
is, given a CNF formula <i>F</i>, what is the largest subset of
clauses of <i>F</i> that is renamable Horn (or q-SAT, etc.).
Identifying such subsets may have an impact on the time required to
solve <i>F</i>.  Boros presented an algorithm for finding a
non-optimal renamable Horn set <i>C* subset F</i> such that
<i>|C*|</i> is no less than about 60% of the size of the optimal
subset.  Boros formulates the problem as a pseudo-Boolean function in
variables <i>s_1, ..., s_n</i> where <i>s_i</i> is 1 if the literals
of the <i>i</i>th variable are switched (or renamed) and 0 otherwise.
The maximum value of this function is the maximum size of a renamable
Horn subset of <i>F</i>.  Moreover, the value of the function given a
real valued vector <b><i>q</i></b> for the <i>s_i</i> variables is
always less than the value given a binary vector and that binary
vector can be derived from <b><i>q</i></b> by a simple linear-time
rounding procedure.  Thus, the continuous solution to the
psuedo-Boolean function is less than the optimum size of a renamable
Horn subset of clauses.  The problem can alternatively be formulated
as an Integer Programming problem on <i>s_1,...,s_n</i> such that the
optimum value of the continuous relaxation of this IP is always at
least the optimum size of a renamable Horn subset of clauses.  Hence,
one can find the optimum solution to the LP relaxation, if this is
small enough, use <i><b>q</b> = (1/2, 1/2, ..., 1/2)</i> and round to
determine an approximate subset, otherwise, use as <b><i>q</i></b> the
optimum solution to the IP relaxation and round.

<h3>2.8 Partially defined Boolean functions</h3>

Partially defined Boolean functions (pdBF) have applications in a number
of areas of computer science and operations research.  An interesting
question is whether a given pdBF can be completed to a total Boolean
function that is a polynomial-time subclass of satisfiability.  It is
known that a pdBF can be completed to a Horn formula, if possible, in
polynomial time.  Such a completion is characteristically unbalanced among
the input vectors that satisfy and those that do not.  Looking for more
balanced completions, Eiter introduces special kinds of Horn formulas,
namely <i>double Horn</i> and <i>bi-dual Horn</i> formulas.  He then
derives certains properties of these classes related to the completion
problem.  The reader is referred to the abstract for details.
<p>
<a name="9"></a>
<h3>2.9 Multispace search</h3>

Gu presented his ideas on the concept of Multispace algorithms.
The following description is taken from our joint survey paper.
<p>
The goal of traditional optimization algorithms is to find an
assignment of values to variables such that all constraints are
satisfied and performance criteria are optimized.  An optimization
algorithm changes values and tries to find the "goal values."
Traditional value search methods do not provide structural information
to the search problem.  It is difficult for them to handle difficult
problems, e.g., local minimum points, in a hard search problem.  In
multispace search, any component related to the given search problem
forms a new class of search space.  For a given search problem, we
define variable space, value space, constraint space, objective space,
parameter space, and other search spaces.  The totality of all the
search spaces constitutes a <i>multispace</i>.  During the search
process, a multispace search algorithm not only changes values in the
value space.  It also scrambles across other spaces and dynamically
<i>reconstructs</i> the problem structures that are related to the
variables, constraints, objectives, parameters, and other components
of the given search problem.  Only at the <i>last moment</i> of the
search, the <i>reconstructed</i> problem structure is replaced by the
original problem structure, and thus the final value assignment
represents the solution to the original search problem.

<h3>3. Personal Comments</h3>

The organizers believe the workshop was a success.  The total number of
attendees was 25, about 2/3 of whom came from Western Europe and the rest
from North America.  Most participants stayed for an entire week.
Speaking for myself (and certainly similar statements are true for most
attendees), I enjoyed the unhurried, lengthy, informal technical and
personal conversations with several colleagues, especially vanMaaren,
Urquhart, Goerdt, Gu, and Mitchell.
<p>
The workshop came only six weeks after a DIMACS workshop on
satisfiability.  The two complemented each other quite well: there was
only a small overlap in results presented; the pace of each was different;
and, since the composition of each was different, research thrusts were
somewhat different.
<p>
In the previous section I have reported interesting research thrusts
represented in the Siena workshop.  Some of these seem very promising.  I
most enjoyed the Lagrangian papers of Nobili and vanMaaren.  Dave
Mitchell's talk, on a topic very similar to our own SLUR paper, was
outstanding (I did not report on this above because he has not yet
finished writing up his results).  John Schlipf gave an excellent account
of our work on fixed-parameter-tractable hierarchies for satisfiability.
In fact, the spectrum of polynomial-time solvable subclass results,
including the work of Boros, Heusch, Gallo, Mitchell, and others, has
fascinated me before and during the workshop (particularly because of the
close relationship of some of this work to Linear Programming).  Work on
resolution proof length continues to confirm its limitations from a
complexity perspective.  However, the work of Urquhart, Van Gelder, Kleine
B&uuml;ning, and others suggests what needs to be added to resolution to
make it much faster in some applications.  Finally, I want to comment
that I enjoyed Eiter's talk on partially defined Boolean formulas, mainly
because it was so well presented.
<p>
Finally, through my contact with Gu, I will almost certainly be migrating
somewhat towards industrial applications of satisfiability and the study
of algorithms that are most suitable in that domain.

<h3>Thomas Eiter - Intersecting Monotone UNSAT (IMUNSAT)</h3>
</a>
The following restriction (IMUNSAT) of the classical satisfiability problem is
currently open: 
<p>
<b>INSTANCE:</b> A set <i>C</i> of clauses such that each clause is either
positive (i.e., consists entirely of positive literals) or negative
(i.e., consists entirely of negative literals) and for each positive
clause <i>C1</i> and negative clause <i>C2</i> of <i>C</i>, there exists an
atom <i>u</i> such that <i>u</i> is in <i>C1</i> and !<i>u</i> is in
<i>C2</i>.<br>
<b>QUESTION:</b> Is <i>C</i> unsatisfiable?<br>

</ol>
<p>
This problem is the (un)satisfiability variant of a number of equivalent
(under polynomial time transformation) problems in different areas of
operations research and computer science. A number of people have considered
essentially this problem in papers, including M. Fredman, T. Ibaraki, D.S.
Johnson, L. Khachiyan, R. Khardon, E. Lawler, J. Lenstra, H. Mannila,
Ch. Papadimitriou, K.-J. R&auml;ih&auml;,  A. Rinnooy Kan,  M. Yannakakis,
to mention some of them.  The problem (in equivalent formulations) is
open for more than 15 years. 
<p>
There is a yet more restricted version of IMSAT, which is as hard as the
general case.
<p>
<a name="Eiter2">
<h3>Symmetric Intersecting Monotone UNSAT (SIMUNSAT)</h3>
</a>
<p>
<b>INSTANCE:</b> Restriction of IMSAT to instances <i>C</i> where the
negative clauses are precisely all clauses <i>C</i>- such that
<i>C</i>- = { !<i>u</i> : <i>u</i> is in <i>C</i>+} for some positive
clause <i>C</i>+ in <i>C</i>. (By this restriction, nonempty positive
clauses of <i>C</i> are mutually intersecting.)<br>
<p>
<b>QUESTION:</b> Is <i>C</i> unsatisfiable?<br>
<p>
Although this problem statement seems easy, it appears to be difficult
to come up with a polynomial time algorithm. What is known to date is
that the problem is most likely not coNP-complete, due to the
recent quasi-polynomial time algorithm of Fredman and Khachiyan for the
positive dualization problem (see below). This algorithm implies that
IMUNSAT and SIMUNSAT can be solved in quasi-polynomial time, as well as all
problems mentioned below. 
<p>
There are a number of problems that are equivalent to SIMUNSAT (under
polynomial time transformation). The problems are in different areas
of logic, operations research, and computer science. We describe here
some of them. (For a more detailed account, see the quoted paper of Eiter
and Gottlob.) 
<p>
<h3>Problems Equivalent to IMUNSAT and SIMUNSAT</h3>
<p>
A <i>hypergraph</i> <i>H</i> is a pair (<i>V</i>,<i>E</i>) of a finite
set <i>V</i> and a family <i>E</i> = {<i>E</i>1, ... ,<i>Em</i>} of
finite subsets <i>Ei</i> subseteq <i>V</i> (called edges). A hypergraph
is <i>simple</i>, if it has no pair of edges <i>Ei</i>, <i>Ej</i> such
that <i>Ei</i> is properly contained in <i>Ej</i>. A simple hypergraph
is also known as a <i>Sperner family</i>. 
<p>
Say that a simple hypergraph (<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>) is <i>saturated</i> if
adding any further edge violates the property of being simple, i.e.,
(<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>} U {<i>X</i>}) where <i>X</i> subseteq <i>V</i>, is
not simple. 
<p>
The following problem is equivalent to SIMUNSAT:
<p>
<b>Simple Hypergraph Saturation (SIMPLE-H-SAT)</b>
<p>
<b>INSTANCE:</b> A simple hypergraph <i>H</i> = (<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>) on
vertices <i>V</i> = {<i>v1</i>, ... , <i>n</i>}.<br>
<p>
<b>QUESTION:</b> Is <i>H</i> saturated?
<p>
A variant of this problem is that besides being simple, the hypergraph
must be (and remain) in addition <i>intersecting</i>, i.e., each pair
of edges <i>Ei</i>, <i>Ej</i> has nonempty intersection.  This problem,
known as <b>Maximal Hypergraph Clique</b>, has been presented by
D.S. Johnson as an open problem in a lecture "Open and Closed Problems
in NP-Completeness" at the Symposium and Summer School "NP-completeness:
The First 20 Years",  Erice, Sicily, 1991. (Actually, Johnson presented
a spoiled version of the problem there (personal communication) which is
clearly solvable in polynomial time).
<p>                 
A <i>transversal</i> (or <i>hitting set</i>) of a hypergraph
<i>H</i> = (<i>V</i>, <i>E</i>) is a subset <i>T</i> subseteq <i>V</i>
such that <i>T</i> meets each edge in at least one vertex, i.e.,
|<i>T</i> intersection  <i>Ei</i>| >= 1, for all <i>Ei</i> in <i>E</i>.
The <i>transversal hypergraph</i> of <i>H</i> is the hypergraph
<i>Tr</i>(<i>H</i>) = (<i>V</i>, <i>F</i>) such that <i>F</i> is the
family of all minimal (w.r.t. inclusion) transversals of <i>H</i> (see
C. Berge's book <i>Hypergraphs</i>, North-Holland 1989, for a detailed
study of the transversal hypergraph). 
<p>
The following problem is equivalent to SIMUNSAT:
<p>        
<b>Transversal Hypergraph (TRANS-HYP)</b><br>
<p>
<b>INSTANCE:</b> Two hypergraphs <i>G</i> = (<i>V</i>, <i>E1</i>) and
<i>H</i> = (<i>V</i>, <i>E2</i>) on vertices
<i>V</i> = {<i>v</i>1, ... , <i>vn</i>}.<br>
<p>
<b>QUESTION:</b> Does <i>H</i> = <i>Tr</i>(<i>G</i>) hold?<br>
<p>
This problem has immediate applications e.g. in Boolean logic and in
the context of model based diagnosis. 
<p>
Equivalent to this problem is the positive dualization problem: 
<p>
<b>Positive Dualization (POS-DUAL)</b><br>
<p>
<b>INSTANCE:</b> Positive Boolean CNFs <i>E</i> and <i>F</i>.<br>
<p>
<b>QUESTION:</b> Does <i>F</i> represent the dual of the function
represented by <i>E</i>?<br>
<p>
A variant of this problem is the one where <i>E</i> is a positive CNF and
<i>F</i> is a positive DNF, and we ask whether <i>E</i> and <i>F</i>
represent the same Boolean function. Fredman and Khachiyan, On the
Complexity of Dualization of Monotone Disjunctive Normal Forms, Technical
Report LCS-TR-225, Dept. of Computer Science, Rutgers University, 1994,
have shown that POS-DUAL can be solved in quasi-polynomial time, i.e., in
time O(<i>m</i>^O(log <i>m</i>)) where <i>m</i> is the size of the input.
See also Bioch and Ibaraki, Complexity of dualization and identification
of positive boolean functions, Information and Computation, 123 (1995). 
<p>
Next we consider problems equivalent to SIMUNSAT from database theory. 
<p>   
<b>FD-Relation Equivalence</b><br>
<p>
<b>INSTANCE:</b> A relation instance <i>R</i> (collection of tuples) and
a set <i>F</i> of functional dependencies in BCNF, both on a set of
attributes <i>U</i>.<br>
<p>
<b>QUESTION:</b> Is <i>R</i> an Armstrong relation for <i>F</i>,
i.e., do on <i>R</i> hold exactly the dependencies represented by
<i>F</i>?<br>
<p>
A set <i>F</i> of functional dependencies on a set of attributes <i>U</i> is
in
<i>Boyce-Codd Normal Form</i> (BCNF), if in every nontrivial
functional dependency <i>X</i> -> <i>Y</i> logically implied by <i>F</i>
the left hand side <i>X</i> is a minimal key, i.e., a wrt. inclusion
minimal subset <i>X</i> of attributes that determines all other attributes
in <i>U</i>. 
<p>
Also a variant of the key problem is equivalent to SIMUNSAT: 
<p>
<b>Additional Key</b> (for relation instances)<br>
<p>
<b>INSTANCE:</b> A relation instance <i>R</i> on attributes <i>U</i>, a set
<i>K</i> of minimal keys for <i>R</i>.<br>
<p>
<b>QUESTION:</b> Is there a minimal key for <i>R</i> (i.e., the set of
functional dependencies <i>F</i> that hold on <i>R</i>) which is not
contained in <i>K</i>?<br>

Notice that the key problem for relation <i>schemes</i> (instead of
relation <i>instances</i>), where the input is a set <i>F</i> of
functional dependencies on <i>U</i>, is polynomial. 
<p>
We nect describe a problem from the area of reliability and
distributed computing which is equivalent to SIMUNSAT. 
<p>
A coterie <i>C</i> is, using hypergraph terminology, an intersecting
hypergraph.
<p>
A coterie <i>C</i>' <i>dominates</i> a coterie <i>C</i> if they are different
coteries on the same set of vertices and for every edge <i>E</i> in
<i>C</i> there is an edge <i>F</i> in <i>C</i>' such that <i>F</i> subseteq
<i>E</i>; a coterie is non-dominated (ND) if there is no coterie
<i>C</i>' that dominates <i>C</i>. Nondominated coteries have been
introduced by Garcia-Molina & Barbara, How to assign votes in a
distributed system, JACM 32 (1985); they have been studied extensively
e.g. by Ibaraki and Kameda, A theory of coteries: Mutual exclusion
in distributed systems, IEEE Trans. on Parallel and Distributed
Systems, 4 (1993).
<p>
The following problem is equivalent to SIMUNSAT: 
<p>
<b>Nondominated Coterie (ND-COTERIE)</b>
<p>
<b>INSTANCE:</b> A coterie <i>C</i>.<br>
<p>
<b>QUESTION:</b> Is <i>C</i> nondominated?<br>
<p>
It is known that nondominatedness coincides with the property that
<i>C</i> is a self-transversal hypergraph, i.e., a hypergraph
<i>H</i> is identical to its transversal hypergraph. This yields the following
problem equivalent to SIMUNSAT, which is a restriction of TRANS-HYP: 
<p>
<b>SELF-TRANSVERSALITY (SELF-TRANS)</b><br>
<p>
<b>INSTANCE:</b> A hypergraph <i>H</i>.<br>
<p>        
<b>QUESTION:</b> Is <i>H</i> self-transversal, i.e., does
<i>H</i> = <i>Tr</i>(<i>H</i>) hold ?<br>
<p>
There are other problems that are equivalent to SIMUNSAT, which have
been recently identified in the area of propositional knowledge
representation; see the papers by Khardon, Translating between Horn
Representations and their Characteristic Models, J. Artificial
Intelligence Research 3, 1995, and D. Kavvadias, Ch. Papadimitriou and
M. Sideri, On Horn Envelopes and Hypergraph Tranversals, ISAAC-93
Proceedings, LNCS 762. 
<p>
A polynomial time algorithm for any of the problems above would be
highly appreciated.

Does there exist an algorithm for verifying that a random 3-SAT formula
is unsatisfiable and that has polynomial time complexity with probability
tending to 1 when <i>m/n</i> is any constant greater than 5?  or even when
<i>m/n</i> grows but <i>lim m/n^(8/7)=0</i>? or even when
<i>\lim m/n^(2-e)=c</i> for some small <i>e > 0</i> and constant <i>c</i>?

Let <i>F</i> be a CNF formula.  Define <i>F*</i> to be an <i>extension</i>
for <i>F</i> if for all subsets <i>S</i> of clauses of <i>F</i> that are
satisfiable, <i>S U F*</i> is also satisfiable.  If <i>F</i> is not
satisfiable, define <i>Comp_E(F)</i> to be the minimum value of
<i>Comp_RES(F U F*)</i> such that <i>F*</i> is an extension for <i>F</i>;
define <i>Comp_RES(G)</i> to be the minimum <i>n</i> such that <i>G
|-n,RES 1</i>.
<p>
Is <i>Comp_E(F)</i> polynomially bounded?
<p>
Let <i>D = {F in CLS | forall(C_i,C_j in F, i != j)
C_i intersection !C_j != emptyset}</i>.
<p>
Is <i>Comp_RES(F)_(F in D)</i> polynomially bounded?

Consider any feasible notion of redundant clauses with respect to
sat-equivalence (like blocked clauses).  Which is better: adding such clauses
or deleting them?

Let <i>I(n,k)^(m)</i> be the set of all CNF formulas containing <i>n</i>
variables and <i>m</i> clauses, where each clause has exactly <i>k</i>
literals.
Let <i>f(n,m,k)</i> be the minimum number of clauses which have to be removed
from formulas in <i>I(n,k)^m</i> in order to make them satisfiable.
<p>
What is <i>f(n,m,k)</i>?
<p>
By experiment, <i>f(500, 5000, 3)</i> is approximately 162.

<h3>Alasdair Urquhart - Multilated Chessboards</h3>

Consider the following well known puzzle: given a chessboard with two
diagonally opposite squares removed, can you cover it with dominoes
each of which can cover two adjacent squares?  The answer is of course
negative because any domino must cover a black square and a white
square, and diagonally opposite squares have the same colour.

This puzzle, generalized to a <i>2n</i> by <i>2n</i> board, can be
formalized as an unsatisfiable set of clauses.  We use variables
<i>Dxy</i> to symbolize: "Square <i>x</i> and square <i>y</i> are
covered by a domino."  For each square <i>x</i>, we have a positive
disjunction saying that it must be covered by a domino that also
covers an adjacent square, and a set of negative disjunctions saying
that <i>x</i> cannot be covered by more than one domino.  This set of
clauses has size quadratic in <i>n</i>.  Problem: show that these sets
of clauses require super-polynomial size resolution refutations.<br>

</title></head>

<p>
<body><h3> IFIP WG 10.4 Workshop on Object Orientation and Dependability </h3>
<p>
Richard D. Schlichting
<dt> Department of Computer Science
<dt> University of Arizona
<dt> (ONR Grant N00014-94-1-0015)
<p>
<hr>
<p>
In January 1996, I attended the Workshop on Object Orientation and
Dependability, which was held in Les Trois Ilets, Martinique (France).
This workshop was sponsored by IFIP Working Group 10.4, an international
collection of experts in the area of dependable computing and fault
tolerance.  The meeting was attended by approximately 35 people, split
between working group members such as myself and guests who were invited
because of their expertise in the particular subject area under discussion. 
The workshop lasted 2 and a half days.
<p>
The purpose of the workshop was to investigate and discuss various
dependability issues that arise when object-oriented (OO) structuring
techniques are used to construct software.  The primary focus was on
software used in highly dependable applications such as real-time control
systems, but many of the issues raised and discussed applied to more
general applications as well. The original motivation for the workshop
came from a concern among working group members that OO software has aspects
that make it more difficult to build dependable applications, despite
the software engineering advantages of the approach.  To this end, the
talks in the workshop were organized into two groups, those that addressed
the design issues involved in using this approach for dependable applications,
and those that addressed validation aspects of OO software.  Each talk
lasted approximately 50 minutes, including ample opportunity for questions. 
There were also other blocks of time set aside for discussions.
<p>
The talks in the workshop are summarized below.  As is often the case
in these meetings, no conclusions were reached, although everyone seemed
to leave with a deeper appreciation of both the advantages and the challenges
associated with using OO techniques for constructing this type of software.
>From my perspective, the most interesting talks were related to the
use of meta-levels in OO software to implement fault tolerance, which
suggested potential implementation techniques for our ONR-sponsored
work involving micro-protocols.  Also, questions during my own talk
and subsequent discussions provided valuable feedback from this
community on our approach.
<p>
<hr>
<h4> Design Issues</h4>
<p>
"Using Meta-Object Protocols to Implement Fault Tolerance Mechanisms", by
Robert Stroud (Univ. of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK).
    Discussed how the meta-level capabilities of OO systems can be exploited
    to implement attributes such as fault tolerance and distribution
    transparency.  In essence, by altering the meta-level, the algorithms used
    by the system for invoking methods can be changed to, for example, provide
    atomicity without modifying the application.
<p>
"A Meta-Architecture for Dependability", by Gul Agha (Univ. of
Illinois).

    Discussed a scheme based on the Actors model for separating the
interaction
    policy used for communication among objects from the actual protocols.
    The goal in doing so is to allow this policy to be easily changed, which 
    can facilitate the implementation of various approaches to increasing the
    dependability of programs.
<p>
"Implementing Distributed Fault Tolerance using Object-Oriented Programming",
by Jean-Charles Fabre (LAAS, France).

    Discussed an approach to using meta-levels of an OO system to implement
    attributes such as fault tolerance, security and group communication.
    One point made was that altering successive meta-levels to implement
    this functionality rather than just using inheritance has a number of
    advantages, including the ability to do non-hierarchical schemes and
    to skip levels if that specific functionality is not needed in the system.
<p>
"A System for Constructing High-Level Protocols", by Richard Schlichting
(Univ. of Arizona).

    Discussed a new object-based approach to constructing high-level
    communication services such as atomic multicast that are important
    building blocks for dependable systems.  The approach is based on
    implementing individual semantic properties as fine-grained objects
    called micro-protocols, which simplifies the construction of services
    that have customized collections of properties.
<p>
"Group, Majority, and Strict Agreement for Replicated Objects", by
Flaviu Cristian (UCSD).

    Discussed a new underlying model for replicated objects called the
    timed asynchronous model, which is intended to be more realistic than
    the more widely used synchronous and asynchronous models.  Also
    described different types of agreement that have different execution
    costs and hence, would be appropriate for different types of
applications.
<p>
"A Node as a Real-Time Object", by Hermann Kopetz (TU-Vienna).

    Discussed a design approach in which a node in a distributed
    system is abstractly considered to be an object that has timing
    as well as functional properties.  The goal of the work is to extend
    normal OO design to make it more appropriate for hard real-time systems.
<p>
<hr>
<h4> Validation Issues </h4>
<p>
"Testability and Object Orientation", by Marie-Claude Gaudel
(Grenoble, France).

    Discussed different aspects of OO design and whether they are good, bad, 
    or neutral from the perspective of testing the resulting system.
    In general, the worst aspects were the use of inheritance and
    late binding, with the information hiding aspects causing problems
    as well.
<p>
"Object Oriented Proof Based Testing", by Didier Buchs.

    Evaluated different aspects of OO design in a manner similar to the
    previous talk, but from the perspective of proofs. Also described
    a OO specification language called CO-OPN2 that is based on the use
    of  algebraic nets.
<p>
"Testing ADTs with ASTOOT", by Phyllis Frankl (Polytechnic Univ.).
    Discussed how testing OO programs can be significantly different than
    testing traditional programs, with a focus on objects used to
    to implement Abstract Data Types (ADTs).  Also described an approach
    called ASTOOT that was inspired by the algebraic specifications often
    used for ADTs.
<p>
"Statistical Testing of Object Oriented Programs", by Pascale
Trevenod (LAAS, France).

    Discussed how to extend statistical testing--that is, the use of
    specific testing criteria to derive an input distribution for test
    cases--for OO programs.  The current focus of the work is on validating
    inheritance, with the problems of polymorphism and dynamic binding yet
    to be addressed.

<H4>Summary</H4>
Report of a Europe trip, May 29 to June 13, 1995, with the following
five stops:

<H3><A NAME="daimler">Daimler Benz Research</A></H3>
May 29, 1995, Berlin, Germany.
 <P>
Daimler Benz is a holding company of four major German corporations:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
 - Mercedes Benz, automobile manufacturing.<BR>
 - Daimler-Benz Aerospace, aerospace manufacturing.<BR>
 - AEG, electrical manufacturing, heavy industry and consumer goods.<BR>
 - Debis, information services.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
All research activities in those four corporations have been
consolidated to form the Daimler-Benz Research Institute under the
direct control of the holding company.  The research institute is funded
as follows: half of the operating expenses come directly from
Daimler-Benz, the other half from the four held corporations.  In
addition, the corporations propose specific projects to be done by
research, a competitive way to realize their R&D goals.  The
funding structure accounts for both long-term research and for
applied work.
 <P>
Overall, the research institute has four directorates.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(1) traffic research, <BR>
(2) micro electronics and materials, <BR>
(3) information technology,  <BR>
(4) technology transfer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
I visited a group within knowledge-based systems research, in
directorate (3), headed by Dr. Ruediger Klein.  Dr. Klein's group
works on the IDEA project (Intelligent Design and Engineering
Assistant) a project that is in collaboration with another Daimler
Benz group in Sindelfingen, Germany.
 <P>
The overall systems architecture is in the following layers:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
(1)  user interface layer,<BR>
(2)  knowledge-based problem solving layer,<BR>
(3)  CAD layers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The CAD layers comprise basic geometric modeling, constraint
management and features.  Dr. Klein's group is in charge of the
knowledge-based problem solving layer.  The group's background is mainly
artificial intelligence and symbolic reasoning.  Prior work includes
computer configuration management and resulted in a system used by
Mercedes and its dealers to diagnose electronic car components.
 <P>
The work on the IDEA project began in earnest this January, and their
invitation came to learn about my ONR-sponsored research on Ereps and
on constraint solving.
I gave an overview presentation of the nature and scope of that work.
Subsequent discussions with the group revolved around requirements for
constraint solvers and the persistent naming problem.
For a brief description of the issues see
<PRE>
http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cmh/distribution/N00014-90-J-1599.html
</PRE>
We also discussed their approach to the knowledge-based
problem-solving layer.  The group follows their previous approach in
knowledge-based reasoning.  Briefly, an object class hierarchy is
defined.  Objects in the various classes can be interrelated with
constraints that are defined or derived from general rules.  From the
constraints, equations and assertions are defined in turn and are
solved using inference rules and very restricted equation solvers.
 <P>

<H3>
<A NAME="cocoa">CoCoA IV Meeting on Symbolic Algebraic Computations</A>
</H3>

May 29 -- June 2, 1995, Mathematics Department, University of Genova,
Italy.
 <P>
CoCoA (Commutative Computer Algebra) is a symbolic computation program
targeted to commutative algebra and Groebner bases computations.
The system was developed by Professor A. Robbiano and his colleagues at
the University of Genova and is presently in its fourth major release.
The meeting brought together approximately 60--80 international
scientists, most of them users of CoCoA and engaged in symbolic
computation research.  In addition to the 16 invited talks, there were
demos and discussions of symbolic computation software, including
CoCoA, the POSSO (Polynomial System Solving) library, and of the
Macaulay system.  Macaulay is a computer algebra system developed by
Bayer (Columbia) and Stillman (Cornell) currently in-between major
releases.  The POSSO project is an Esprit project now in its third
year focusing on developing infrastructure and algorithms to
solve nonlinear algebraic equations with a special emphasis on
Groebner bases techniques.
 <P>
Like other computer algebra and symbolic computation meetings, most of
the talks focused on applications in pure mathematics such as the
computational analysis of polynomial ideals and related objects such
as Rees algebras or embedded joins.  However, there is also a
discernible trend to consider more distant applications related to
robotics or arising when computing with inexact arithmetic.  For
example, T. Recio (Santander, Spain) considered decomposing a
polynomial <I>f(cos(t),sin(t))</I> into a polynomial of the form
<I>g(h(cos(t),sin(t))</I> where <I>h</I> is linear.  Such decompositions play
a role in analyzing the kinematics of robotic manipulators.  B. Trager
(IBM Yorktown Heights) spoke about applying techniques from numerical
linear algebra to analyze the singularity structure of an algebraic
curve when the coefficients of the curve equation are inexact.  Note
that coefficient perturbations structurally alter the number and
topology of the singularities of a curve.

I presented an efficient algorithm for planar geometric constraint
solving.  The emphasis was on isolating the underlying algebraic
manipulations the algorithm does using a graph representation.  It
should be possible to generalize the algebraic manipulations without
sacrificing the algorithm's efficiency, and this would have a
significant practical impact in manufacturing.
 <P>
<HR>

<H3>
<A NAME="oberwolfach">Conference on Freeform Curves and Surfaces</A>
</H3>

June 4 -- 9, 1995, Oberwolfach, Germany.
 <P>
The mathematical research institute in Oberwolfach, a small town in
Southern Germany, is renowned world-wide for high-quality
international research meetings.  The meetings typically run for a
week and the participants live together on the premises in an isolated
valley in the Schwarzwald.  Traditionally, there is no fixed program,
and the next day's talks are scheduled the evening before.
 <P>
The conference brought together some 60 researchers in CAGD
(Computer-Aided Geometric Design) from around the world.  It was
organized by R. Barnhill (Arizona State University), J. Hoschek (Technical
University of Darmstadt, Germany) and W. Boehm (Technical University of
Braunschweig, Germany).  The talks presented a cross-section of major
research trends in CAGD and previewed emerging research directions.
Instead of summarizing the 42 talks given during the week, I will
characterize the major themes they articulated.  Those themes were:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

(e)<A HREF="#e">

</BLOCKQUOTE>
In addition to the research presentations, two talks commemorated the
work of the late John Gregory (Brunel University, UK).

<H4><A NAME="a">
Variational and Energy-Based Approaches to Design</A></H4>

One objective of CAGD is to design pleasing shapes.  When
approximating or interpolating scattered data, a ``fair'' curve or
surface is to be found.  What constitutes fairness is in part a
mathematical notion and in part an aesthetic concept whose particulars
would depend on the application.  For instance, in ship building,
fairness of the hull surface may depend primarily on flow
characteristics.  In automotive applications, on the other hand,
fairness of the car body would also emphasize visual and
aesthetic aspects that may relate to the way lines of light are
reflected.
 <P>
Of the many algorithms in the literature dealing with fairness of
shape, the energy-based variational approach is currently receiving
much attention.  Roughly speaking, an integral of the curve or surface
is to be minimized.  The integral might constitute an approximate
measure of the bending energy inherent in the shape.  Fairing
algorithms using this approach solve a variational mathematical
problem, for example using the finite element method.  One of the
benefits of the approach is the ability to express functional
constraints such as drag in a viscous fluid, or geometric constraints
such as conforming, at specific localities, to a given sculptured
surface.
 <P>
<H4>
<A NAME="b">Multiresolution and Wavelets</A></H4>

Wavelets have emerged as an important tool in image compression.
Conceptually, a function over a domain (e.g., the image pixel values
of the screen grid) is approximated by a hierarchy of function spaces.
Each function space successively refines the previous one, and
concurrently a refinement of discrete domains takes place.  The
refinement is subject to technical conditions.  In turn, this permits
a graded representation of an image ranging from a very coarse image
representation to a very detailed one.  Because of the refinement
notion, a transmitted image comes up fast and coarse.  As the
transmission continues, more and more detail appears until the fully
detailed image is displayed.
 <P>
Emerging applications in CAGD include radiosity computations, a very
sophisticated rendering technique, and hierarchical shape
approximation and detailing.  The second application is still not
understood very well and presents foundational mathematical problems
that remain to be worked out.  Note that this application would also
impact data reduction and conversion, a practical issue arising when
transmitting design data between CAD systems using different spline
representations of curved surfaces.

<H4>
<A NAME="c">Subdivision Algorithms</A></H4>

A polygonal curve can be made ``smoother'' by systematically cutting
all corners.  For example, subdivide the segments adjacent to a corner and
replace the corner by the segment connecting the two subdivision
points nearest to the old corner.  Iterating this process results in
the limit in a curve, and this research asks what curves are so
obtained.  Similar cutting processes can be devised for polyhedra in
space, yielding curved surfaces in the limit.
 <P>
By its nature, corner cutting is a process that could yield fractal
objects in the limit.  The main research questions, therefore,
include: Does a particular subdivision scheme yield a smooth curve or
surface?  If so, how smooth is the result (i.e., how many times is the
curve or surface continuously differentiable)?  What classes of
subdivision schemata have a desired smoothness behavior?  In current
CAGD research, corner cutting is used to fill irregular holes in
quilts of sculptured surfaces subject to continuity requirements at
the boundaries.  Other uses attempt to devise blending algorithms for
solids with sculptured surfaces.

<H4><A NAME="d">Pythagorean Hodograph Curves and Surfaces</A></H4>

A parametric curve or surface has the Pythagorean hodograph (ph)
property if its offsets are again parametric curves or surfaces.
Usually, parametric curves and surfaces do not have the ph property.
Trivial examples of ph curves and surfaces include straight lines and
planes, and circles and spheres.
 <P>
The rediscovery of several interesting, nontrivial ph curves and
surfaces has stimulated this research in recent years.  Current problems
worked
on include
devising interpolation algorithms that use only piecewise ph curves,
designing ph curves from geometric constraints, and designing with ph
curves and surfaces.  This research elegantly extends classical
geometry work on cyclographic maps and Laguerre transforms that
reformulate the problem of finding such curves and surfaces as an
equivalent, simpler problem in a higher dimensional curved space.
Research is coming close to finding practical interpolation and design
algorithms for ph curves, but the corresponding problems for surfaces are
largely open at this time.  A property of practical interest is that
the arc length of ph curves can be computed exactly, and this may
impact NC path generation.

<H4><A NAME="e">Geometric Constraints and Algebraic Methods</A></H4>

These diverse subjects are related by the fact that they employ
techniques from symbolic algebraic computation and algebraic geometry.
Geometric constraint solving is about solving systems of algebraic
equations.  By judiciously restricting the problem and exploiting the
geometric nature of the objects manipulated, very efficient algorithms
can be obtained that have a strong impact on engineering design and
analysis.
 <P>
Implicitization of parametric curves and surfaces is a test
case for symbolic algebraic computations.  Current research seeks to
generalize some techniques originally developed at the beginning of
this century.  The technology is sophisticated, but its impact on
practice appears to be limited.
 <P>
The geometry of implicit algebraic
surfaces is investigated in the hope of finding a rich class of such
surfaces that can be used in free-form design.  Currently, free-form
design is done almost exclusively with parametric curves and surfaces.
Implicit surfaces are advocated by some researcher as an alternative.

<H4><A NAME="f">Reparameterization for Approximation and
Interpolation</A></H4>

When approximating or interpolating data points with a piecewise
parametric curve or surface, the data points are assigned specific
parametric coordinates.  This is done to convert the problem from a
nonlinear problem to a linear one, and is a crucial first step to
achieve fast and practical algorithms.  However, the assignment of
parametric coordinates affects the shape of the
approximation or interpolation, and so a variety of heuristics have been
proposed in the literature to make good coordinate assignments in a
variety of situations.
 <P>
Reparameterization makes the process iterative: First, assign
parametric coordinate and compute a surface.  Then, based on the
geometry of the surface and the relative location of the data points,
assign new parametric coordinates to the points and repeat.  For
example, a natural requirement would be to have parametric coordinates
such that a data point with parametric coordinates <I>u,v</I> is on a line
perpendicular to the approximating surface <I>C</I> at the corresponding
point <I>C(u,v)</I>.  Current research explores this and other techniques
to change the parametric coordinates of data points.

<A NAME="hoschek">CAGD Research in Darmstadt, Germany</A></H3>

June 13, 1995, Technical University Darmstadt.
 <P>
I spent the morning of June 13 with Professor J. Hoschek at the
Technical University of Darmstadt.  I also gave an
overview talk of feature-based, constraint-based CAD.
 <P>
Professor Hoschek is one of the leading researchers in CAGD and a
prominent exponent of the field in Germany and abroad.  His work
maintains a fine balance between fundamental research and its
application in practical engineering problems.  By background a
kinematician, Hoschek is now well known for his extensive work on
curves and surfaces in the CAGD community.  I informed myself of some
of the work done in his research group that deals with surface
smoothing and data reduction.  The approach is
<A HREF="#a">variational</A>.
 <P>
The problem of surface smoothing arises in CAD in a variety of
contexts.  For example, suppose that CAD system A generates a
parametric surface.  Through a sequence of operations, a derived
surface is obtained that has many patches, and the problem is to
reapproximate the derived surface with fewer patches.  The research
work I saw in this problem domain approaches the problem from two
perspectives.  First, given a set of points and a tolerance, find a
smooth approximating surface that is within tolerance from the data
points.  Second, given a curve or surface, reapproximate it to within
tolerance by a smoother curve or surface.
 <P>
The notion of ``smoothness'' is explored minimizing an energy-based
functional.  Several integral formulations are considered, each
derived from the intrinsic geometry of the surface, and each having a
specific global effect.  For instance, one formulation may favor less
Gaussian curvature and so ``flatten'' the surface, while another may
minimize mean curvature and so try to reshape the surface closer to a
minimal surface.  The exploration of these different measures of
smoothness, and the techniques for combining them, are strongly guided
by application problems from the automotive sector, from turbine blade
design, and from precision optics.

<A NAME="fraunhofer">Feature Work at the Fraunhofer Institute, Darmstadt</A>
</H3>

June 13, 1995, Center for Geometric Data Processing, Darmstadt.
 <P>
I spent the afternoon of June 13 with the research group of
Dr. J. Ovtcharova at the Fraunhofer Institute located next door to the
Technical University in Darmstadt.  Fraunhofer Institutes are German
research organizations that do technology development and technology
transfer.  They have a core budget, but the institutes must finance
the bulk of their activities from research grants and contracts with
private industry.  Of the 40 or so institutes in Germany, the
institute in Darmstadt is best known for its work in graphics and
virtual environments.  The institute has a scientific relationship
with Brown University in the US.
 <P>
Dr. Ovtcharova's group is developing a feature-based CAD system in
collaboration with Professor B. Falcidieno at CNR (Consiglio Nazionale di
Ricerca) in Genova, Italy.  Dr. Ovtcharova's group wants to
conceptualize features as a parameterized form that is subject to
constraints spanning three categories: shape constraints, location
constraints, and functional constraints.  For example, a countersunk
blind hole would have shape constraints that might stipulate an
angular range for the countersink and might relate the depth to the
bore diameter.  Location constraints would require that the hole be
surrounded by material on all sides (so it cannot become a slot) and
that its opening must be accessible from the outside.  Finally,
functional constraints might require that the hole always be blind,
and that there must be a minimum clearance from the walls on all
sides.
 <P>
The project started at the beginning of this year.
Open issues include feature mappings to translate,
for instance, design features to manufacturing features, and the
specification and algorithmics of a constraint solver.  The group
demonstrated concept implementations of a user interface and a feature
builder (using ACIS) with which they plan to explore the research
issues.  In discussions, we also explored intermediate feature
representations.  They favor a graph structure where the nodes
represent boundary elements of the solid design and the edges
represent constraints and relationships between them.
 <P>
I was also given a demonstration of the virtual reality (VR) exhibit
the Institute prepared for Volkswagen for the Hannover Messe, an
annual international industry exhibit.  The demo was an interactive
walk-through of a structure consisting of ``tunnels'' shaped and
interconnected to form the company logo.  The VR computation was done
in real time on a Silicon Graphics Onyx machine.  One navigates using
hand gestures with a data glove.  Inside the tunnels are a number of
simulations that are activated pushing ``buttons'' at appropriates
locales.  The simulations included a virtual disassembly of the outer
hull of a VW car, a kinematic simulation of pistons and crankshaft in
an engine, and a digital wind tunnel showing the aerodynamics of a
car.  To visualize the flow, the glove could scatter particles (small
squares) that would stream past the car body and move along
precomputed trajectories.  The trajectories were determined from a
large CFD computation using a very fine mesh.

<B>1. Summary</B>

WCNA 96, held 10-17 July 1996 at Athens, Greece, had more than 1200 participants from over 100 countries and covered a wide range of nonlinear analysis topics in over 20 parallel sessions.  This report describes the authors paper on "Perturbation of Conic Shocks in Three-Dimensional Gasdynamics", and provides his impressions of the Congress; there was a good mix of mathematicians and engineers indicating the importance of nonlinear analytical methods to practical applications, and many more papers dealt with computational than theoretical approaches and results. <P>


<B>2.  Narrative</B><P>

The Second World Congress of Nonlinear Analysts, or WCNA 96, was held from July 10 to July 17 1996 at Athens, Greece.  More than 1200 participants from more than 100 countries and regions attended.  The total number of listed participants is 1373 but some of them did not actually show up and near the end of Congress, some more than 100 name tags were still lying on the registration desk. On the other hand, there were also a few attendees whose names are not listed in the official program. <P>

I was invited to deliver a 45-minutes talk in the session on "Nonlinear Evolution Equations and Applications". The topic of my talk was "Perturbation of conic shocks in three-dimensional gasdynamics". The talk was based upon our recent research work on the stability of shock waves generated by a supersonic flow around a conic-like solid object. In particular, the new nonlinear hodograph transformation method employed in our research is introduced in my talk.  As far as I know, the hodograph transformation has been used previously in various applications only in the linear form. The nonlinear form of the hodograph transformation has its special advantages but it has also caused the appearance of new singularities to be dealt with. The method was explained in connection with the discussion of conic-like shock problems. <P>

Almost all the topics related to the nonlinear analysis were covered in the Congress. They range from abstract topics of topological methods and microlocal wave front set analysis to numerical computations and concrete industrial applications. Because of the large number of participants to WCNA 96, there were more than 20 parallel sessions going on everyday. One has to be very selective in attending the talks. Because of my own research experience and interest, I attended mostly the sessions concerning hyperbolic conservation laws and other evolutionary equations, especially in high-dimensional spaces. <P>

From various sessions and after-session talks,  I noticed that there were quite a few engineers who also attended the Congress. They often provide very important insights to the topics discussed by mathematicians. It also shows the importance of various nonlinear analytical methods in applications. <P>

In the field of hyperbolic conservation laws in several space dimensions, Professor C. Dafermos gave an interesting talk on the entropy method and the $L^p$ stability results. The cone-dependency stability is shown to be equivalent to the commuteness of Jacobians of the flux functions. This is a very important work. The method applies to, say, the nonlinear Maxwell equations. For the Euler equations of  general 3-dimensional hydrodynamics, it remains to find the convex entropy-pair which is needed to prove the stability result. <P>

Other sessions I attended covered general nonlinear analytical methods, solutions for nonlinear differential equations, and various numerical results on the computation of discontinuous solutions for hyperbolic or parabolic conservation laws. I had been interested in a scheduled talk by Prof. Tani on the free boundary value problems for 2-D incompressible Euler equations.  Unfortunately, Professor Tani was not there and the talk was canceled. <P>

Since my work is mostly theoretical analysis and I do not have much experience in numerical computation except for occasional numerical experiments by myself and the graduate students, my attention was on developments in the theoretical analysis of problems in hydrodynamics. From the titles of scheduled talks, one can see that rigorous analytical results on discontinous solutions for hyperbolic or parabolic conservation laws in high dimensional space are relatively few. Even when the title did not mention numerical methods, the actual talk often turned out to be about computational results. This situation was fairly common at WCNA 96, not just in high-dimensional hydrodynamics. Actually, computation can often provide important insights into the problem and even help theoretical researchers to find rigorous proof. This phenomenon has been observed for a few years, but now it becomes all the more common and obvious.  <P>

Even though theoretical results on discontinuous solutions for high-dimensional hyperbolic or parabolic conservation laws were limited at WCNA 96, I do not think it a sign of lack of interest or importance. The important problems in this field have very clear physical meanings and are observed in experiments. They are well-known in the mathematical community and are of great importance in mathematical theory as well as in engineering applications. At the same time, they are also very difficult and complex analytically. This also explains why so many numerical approaches are taken to deal with them. <P>

From my after-session talks with other participants of WCNA 96, many of them showed great interest in the topic of my research.  One of the participants had worked on 2 dimensional wedge shocks around long wings and mentioned to me some literature in the topic of perturbed wedge shocks. For the case of cone-like shocks, it remains unknown how to eliminate the condition on high-order tangent on the solid cone which was assumed in our existence proof. It seems that we have to deal with a sequence of boundary value problems for second order nonlinear ordinary differential equations. This is a topic I would like to pursue in my future research.  Other mathematicians as well as engineers also provide their valuable comments, e.g., the assumption of isentropic flow after the shock front for irrotational conic flow is only approximate for weak shocks. <P>

In summary, attendance at WCNA 96 was very helpful to my research work.  It helped me to keep informed of the current research activities in the field of my interest, pointed to new trends and directions in the research, and also provided me good opportunity to communicate with fellow researchers and obtain useful peer comments and suggestions.<P>

<B>Abstract</B><BR>
Learning a task can be characterised by the emergence of new strategies and
the effects that practice has upon performance. Furthermore, prior task
knowledge can affect how quickly a task is learned. Computational modelling
architectures can help examine how such effects occur because they provide
an environment in which learning can take place and knowledge can be
independently manipulated. Several implementations of cognitive
architectures exist that enable this, each having its own advantages and
disadvantages. The aim of this trip was to examine two such architectures,
Soar and ACT-R, in relation to the computational modelling of the effects
described above. In summarising this, I provide a brief description of each
architecture, stating the commonalities and differences between them. From
observations and discussions regarding the architectures, I then cover
general modelling information which potential modellers may wish to be
aware of, such as the implications of some parts of the theories. How each
architecture enables the modelling of the effects is then detailed. In my
conclusion, I consider the credibility of each model for modelling
psychological phenomena, and detail in what ways the trip will affect my
research.<P>

<B>Introduction</B><BR>
A lot of cognitive development research has tended to concentrate on
characterising behaviour at different ages rather than examining how change
between ages occurs. Analysing how change occurs is now becoming a dominant
issue (two recent papers given to me by Robert Siegler concentrate on this
very subject; Siegler, 1995; Siegler & Shipley, 1995). My research focuses
upon this issue.<P>

I use a physical problem solving task in which to study cognitive change,
which involves the construction of a pyramid from 21 blocks. The pyramid
consists of six layers, the lower five being made up of four equal sized
blocks, and the final top layer consisting of just a single block.
Performance on this task indicates that older children can learn the task
quicker, have more initial task knowledge, and have more flexible
strategies (e.g. Murphy & Wood, 1981). Even adults show variations in time
taken and strategies used in completion.<P>

Some of the questions these findings raise are ones such as How is task
relevant knowledge acquired?, Do people learn the task quicker simply
because they have more task relevant knowledge?, and How are more
efficient strategies acquired?. The answers are equally applicable to
general research involving adult performance in problem solving tasks,
since these questions can also apply to shifts from novice-like behaviour
to that of more expert-like.<P>

I believe computational modelling can help in characterising what changes
occur in order to facilitate improved performance, because it enables
learning and knowledge to be independently and directly manipulated. Models
can therefore predict what initial knowledge is required to produce the
observed behaviour, how new strategies are acquired, and how task knowledge
is learned.<P>

Two of the main symbolic modelling tools are Soar and ACT-R, which both
allow learning and knowledge to be manipulated. The summer schools trip
allowed the chance to liaise with both the researchers who developed the
tools as well as those who produce models using them, and to complete
tutorials whilst the experts in these architectures were present.<P>

This report will summarise Soar and ACT-R in terms of their similarities
and differences. It will also detail general modelling information that any
prospective user of these architectures should be aware of. These
observations were gained from attendance at Michigan and Carnegie-Mellon,
discussions with peers, and my own thoughts. I also cover how I think the
modelling of cognitive development will be achieved using these
architectures. My summary covers the validity of each architecture in
modelling human behaviour, and details how the knowledge I have gained will
influence my future research.<P>

<B>Introducing Soar and ACT-R</B><BR>
Soar (Laird, Newell & Rosenbloom, 1987) and ACT-R (Anderson, 1993) are the
two main symbolic cognitive architectures that can model human behaviour.
Both do this by reducing much of human behaviour to problem solving. Soar
does this rather explicitly, being based upon Newells information
processing theory of problem solving (e.g. Newell, 1968), whereas ACT-R
merely implies it by being goal directed.<P>

The two architectures can be seen as similar in several ways. They are
production systems which have two kinds of memory, declarative (facts) and
procedural (rules). In both architectures these memories are conceptually
infinite, with no provision being made for the removal of any memory item
in ACT-R (the Soar architecture does perform removal of declarative memory,
which therefore can be seen as short-term). Manipulation of declarative
memory can be accomplished by adding new items or changing existing ones.
For procedural memory, rules may only be added.<P>

The course of processing involves moving from an initial state to a
specified goal state. ACT-R has only one possible goal state, whereas Soar
may have several. Movement between the initial and goal states usually
involves the creation of sub-goals in order to accomplish the various parts
leading up to the satisfaction of the goal. For both ACT-R and Soar, this
is achieved by maintaining a goal hierarchy where each subsequent sub-goal
becomes the focus of the system. In ACT-R, these must be satisfied in a
serial manner, and in the reverse of the order they appear in the
hierarchy. Soar generally proceeds in this way but is capable of removing
intermediate sub-goals should the current focus resolve a sub-goal that is
much higher in the goal hierarchy. This difference makes ACT-R potentially
less reactive.<P>

There are also fundamental differences between the two architectures.
Movement between states is done in ACT-R by firing productions, which may
change the state. Where the conditions of several productions are met, a
conflict resolution mechanism selects the production which it estimates to
have the highest gain.<P>

In Soar, the state is changed by applying an operator to it. All
productions whose conditions are met will fire, and propose operators or
add information to declarative memory (which in turn may cause more
productions to fire). When no more productions can fire, an operator is
selected. This whole process is called a decision cycle. Where an operator
cannot be selected (e.g. due to several operators conflicting each other),
a sub-goal is created with a goal to decide upon one single operator.<P>

Further differences exist when we consider how each tool models human
behaviour. These are mainly apparent in the learning and timing mechanisms
that each architecture uses. It is important to consider these since they
influence how each tool is able to model cognitive development and strategy
changes.<P>

<B>The ACT-R Architecture</B><BR>
<I>Learning</I><BR>
ACT-R learning involves both declarative and procedural memory. Much of
this learning involves activation values, which can affect the time taken
for productions to fire. Each item in declarative memory has an associated
activation that changes based upon how often it has been used, and how
strongly it is associated with other items that are being used. This means
that the more often an item is used, the higher its base level activation
will become. The more strongly associated an item is with ones that are
being used, the more chance that item has for having its activation raised.<P>

Productions have an associated strength which alters based upon how often
the production has been used. This strength influences the activation of
all the declarative memory items that are in the condition of the
production.<P>

Each production also has an expected gain value (which is used for conflict
resolution; the production with the highest expected gain is selected when
several productions are instantiated). The more often the production meets
with later success (e.g. the sub-goal ends up being solved), the higher
this value may become. New productions can be created (by using an analogy
mechanism) in the action component of a production.<P>

<I>Producing timing estimates</I><BR>
Estimates for the time taken to do a task are based upon the sum of the
time taken for each production to fire in the completion of the task. This
is mainly based on the activations of declarative memory elements. The
higher the activation of elements, the less time it takes to match them.
The total matching time for a production is the sum of the time taken to
match each element in the condition of the production. Total production
latency is the matching time plus the time taken to actually fire the
production.<P>

<B>The Soar Architecture</B><BR>
<I>Learning</I><BR>
Learning in Soar occurs only for production memory. New rules are created
by the architecture whenever a sub-goal is resolved, such that when next
encountering the same situation, the new production fires without the need
to enter a new sub-goal. This can lead to long-term declarative memory
learning, for long-term declarative information is represented solely as
the result of procedural memory.<P>

<I>Producing timing estimates</I><BR>
Time taken to do a task is based on the amount of decision cycles required
to complete the task. Soar proposes a fixed timing of fifty milliseconds
per decision cycle. One decision cycle involves the selection of an
operator; it is not based upon how many productions fire during the cycle.
In fits to data, this timing value is currently unstable.<P>

<B>General Modelling Information</B><BR>
There are various factors of these architectures which can influence how
modelling occurs, and how the model must be created in the first place.
Before I consider modelling cognitive development, I will first examine
these general points.<P>

<I>User Interface</I><BR>
Both architectures give the user a command line interface. This offers a
rather poor user interface where all commands are issued in the same
window, and all results from the commands are published in the same window.
Two immediate problems with this are that the user must remember commands,
and it is difficult to analyse results from several commands at the same
time.<P>

ACT-R alleviates these problems by supplying a control panel window from
which further windows can be created (e.g. for examining declarative
memory). These further windows are active in the sense that the information
displayed changes as the user steps through the model. Although this
environment is still in a testing stage, I was informed at the ACT-R summer
school that a full release will be announced in around a months time.<P>

The new version of Soar (Soar 7) includes Tcl/Tk, which provides a
graphical interface to the Soar environment. Whilst talking to Soar
researchers at Michigan (e.g. Doug Pearson, E-mail dpearson@umich.edu), it
seems acknowledged that the new environment enables a similar control panel
interface to be developed. However, no-one has taken the time to create
such an interface, presumably because they are all experts in the command
level interface and hence do not require it. However, this places newcomers
to the environment at an immediate disadvantage, and it seems likely that
such an interface will be developed in the near future (in fact, Gordon
Baxter and Frank Ritter have developed such an interface at Nottingham.
This is available at
<A HREF="http://www.ccc.nottingham.ac.uk/pub/soar/soar-web-page.html">http://www.ccc.nottingham.ac.uk/pub/soar/soar-web-page.html</A>).<P>

<I>Architecture Communities and Types of Task Modelled</I><BR>
Both communities were friendly and very helpful. Comparing workshop
attendance and presentations gives an impression of what kind of community
and task models each architecture has. Although I only attended the Third
Annual ACT-R Workshop, I obtained a copy of the Proceedings of the 16th
Annual Soar Workshop from Malcolm Bauer (E-mail
malcolm@centro.soar.cs.cmu.edu) at CMU, with whom I also discussed some of
the presentations relevant to my research.<P>

The ACT-R community centres around John Anderson and his researchers at
CMU. They are the people who are involved in the development of ACT-R (e.g.
Mike Matessa is developing a visual interface; Jon Fincham is developing
the user interface; Christian Lebiere is developing ACT-R itself) as well
as the main researchers who have published models.<P>

Attendance at the Third Annual ACT-R Workshop consisted of these
researchers together with, in the main, summer school and ex-summer school
participants. Three summer schools have been given in total, and there
seemed to be a decent retention rate of ex-participants (around 50% were at
the Workshop), bringing the total attendance to between 30 and 40.<P>

Every talk at the Workshop presented a model (except my own and one other;
I presented my research, and received feedback for how to model it in
ACT-R). Most models were fairly simple in nature and involved psychology
tasks where no learning occurs (e.g. individual differences in working
memory, a model of quantitative reasoning). This was to be expected since
the new analogy mechanism was only released (in beta form) a few months
prior to the workshop.<P>

Reading the Proceedings of the 1996 Soar Workshop, it was noticeable that
the community is more diverse, which is to be expected since it is now in
its 16th year. Even though a lot of attendees were from Michigan or CMU,
because there were around 70 researchers present, they did not seem to
stand out as much. Presentations mainly involved complex tasks in various
areas (especially computer science).<P>

<I>Structure of Memory</I><BR>
Both ACT-R and Soar impose a very simple structure upon their declarative
and procedural memory. Declarative memory is in the form of a slot and a
filler (or attribute-value). ACT-R chunks these up in a similar way to
frames, where one declarative memory type may have several slot/fillers.
Declarative memory can be hierarchical in Soar and in ACT-R.<P>

The format of productions is generally free. In ACT-R, a goal must be
specified as the first condition, with all other conditions beginning with
the declarative memory type. In Soar, a state to match against must be
specified as the first condition.<P>

<I>Knowledge Representation</I><BR>
In both architectures the way a task is represented or realised as a model
can greatly influence the timings for that task. However, this may be a
reasonable assumption given that different people solve tasks in different
ways (therefore different representations are likely to exist).<P>

Declarative memory in these architectures is conceptually infinite, though
ACT-R imposes decay upon memory elements such that if an item has not been
used for some time, its activation becomes very low. Supplying a retrieval
threshold for memory elements then restricts which items can be retrieved
since their activation needs to be above the threshold. In Soar everything
in declarative memory can always be retrieved.<P>

In terms of the representation of declarative memory, this is propositional
in both Soar and ACT-R; items are either present or absent (N.B. ACT-R
memory elements have activation values which mainly affect matching
latency, but can mean the item is absent if the activation is not above a
retrieval threshold). Some things, however, are easier to characterise by
what they are not. For example, when faced with the question What is
freedom? it is easier to describe what freedom is not. Both architectures
have no direct facility for representing knowledge in this way.<P>

<I>Goal Hierarchy</I><BR>
If we examine the goal driven theory used by both architectures, there is a
theoretically unending amount of sub-goals that can be defined. Although it
is likely that humans have a limited amount of sub-goals that they can
remember, there is no restriction placed on this amount by either
architecture. Ironically, once a sub-goal has been solved, the
architectures have difficulty in recalling what that sub-goal was. So after
finding that 2+3=5, there can be difficulty in answering What was the sum
we just did?. This may be easier in ACT-R because sub-goals still remain
in declarative memory, though the architecture no longer has any record of
them being part of the goal hierarchy. Also, the forgetting of goals is not
accounted for.<P>

<I>Interfacing with the External Environment</I><BR>
Soar does not actually provide a simple means by which models can interact
with an external world. Models such as TacAir, which simulates air combat,
hard-wire the model to the interface (Mike van Lent, personal
correspondence at Michigan, E-mail vanlent@eecs.umich.edu). This means that
rather than having a simulation of, for example, an eye, the interface is
just directly linked to a cockpit. The reading of a particular dial in the
cockpit is done immediately rather than the eye having to first attend to
the position of the dial. This can be seen as a limitation to such a model,
and the developers are now looking at such simulations.<P>

Other models, such as one that does a SuperMario task (Malcolm Bauer, at
CMU) simply use Soar productions to simulate the interface. Whilst this
keeps all aspects of the model within the Soar environment, it again does
not account for the functions of perceptual/motor actions which may
influence task performance.<P>

There have been attempts to provide an easy to use external interface for
Soar. Bass, Baxter and Ritter (1995), for example, present simulations of
the eye and hand, which are applied to an air traffic control task. One
possible area where a comprehensive external interface may arise is with
research work being done by Ron Chong at Michigan (E-mail
rchong@eecs.umich.edu).<P>

Ron is trying to use EPIC (Kieras & Meyer, in press), a low-level
architecture which mainly models interfacing with the external environment.
The aim is to use Soar and EPIC in conjunction with one another to utilise
the perceptual/motor mechanisms within EPIC and the learning mechanisms
that Soar possesses (see
<A HREF="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/rchong/epic-soar/epic-soar.html">http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/people/rchong/epic-soar/epic-soar.html</A>). Ron
showed me early results from performance of his EPIC-Soar model doing the
Wickens task (Martin-Emerson & Wickens, 1992) which suggest that this may
well be possible.<P>

ACT-R does provide an interface (the visual interface) which enables
limited simulation of both perceptual and motor actions. There are two
perceptual actions, finding an object on a computer screen,  and moving
attention in order to focus on the object. The motor actions also only
interface with the computer; actions can move the mouse, press the button
on the mouse, and press keys on the keyboard.<P>

Whilst this interface provides only a simplistic external simulation, it
does allow the modelling of various psychological tasks in which subjects
do the experiment via computer (such as serial recall, Anderson & Matessa,
in press).<P>

After discussions with Mike Matessa (E-mail matessa@cmu.edu), if I
represented my research task as blocks on the screen, the interface would
still require further work, since it does not allow the re-attention to
objects which have already been attended to, which is something that is
apparent in children completing the task. I would suggest that most other
tasks will also require further work on this interface.<P>

<B>Modelling Cognitive Development</B><BR>
I will now consider how Soar and ACT-R are able to model cognitive
development. This will be done by examining those processes described
earlier which seem to characterise both cognitive development and novice to
expert behaviour in adult performance.<P>

<I>Modelling Strategy Acquisition</I><BR>
There are many tasks in which new strategies can be seen to emerge, either
when the same person is doing a task (e.g. one adult solving the Tower of
Hanoi, Anzai & Simon, 1979), or when people of different ages are
performing a task (e.g. children solving the balance beam task, Siegler,
1981). These new methods of completing the task can often be described by
the use of new rules. These new rules usually mean that subsequent task
performance is more efficient.<P>

In Soar, new rules are generated by the architecture whenever a sub-goal is
solved. The rule created tells us how to proceed when we next meet the same
situation, so that we no longer require a sub-goal. New strategies are
modelled in Soar by this method, since it provides a means by which a more
efficient rule can be formed.<P>

ACT-R provides an analogy method for the acquisition of strategies, whereby
new rules are created based upon analogy to an example. The analogy
mechanism engages when the current goal matches that of the example, and
creates a new rule based upon how the example solved the goal. In order for
the analogy method to become active then, an example is required, which is
presumably supplied by a different (less efficient) strategy. This less
efficient strategy will build an example such that next time the task is
attempted, the analogy method knows of an exemplar of the task, via which a
more efficient rule can be created to solve the task.<P>

Both of these methods require the modeller to know some information about
the new strategies that the subject is learning. In Soar, this information
will be placed in the sub-goal so that it can be used when the new rule is
created. In ACT-R this information is placed in the example that the
analogy method will utilise. It would seem sensible that it is mainly the
job of the modeller to find these new strategies and the job of the
architecture to provide a means of transition between them.<P>

In the transition between strategies, it is very often the case that there
is much overlap between the discontinuation of the old strategy and the use
of the new strategy (e.g. Siegler, 1981). This can be seen as a grey area
of skill acquisition whereby the subject flips between strategies, using
the new one gradually more often until it is used solely.<P>

Soar can enable this gradual shift to be modelled by progressively building
up new rules that begin to characterise the new strategy but do not wholly
encompass it. Therefore the gradual shift involves the use of the old
strategy plus newly created rules which form part of the new strategy. Once
all of the necessary part-rules for the new strategy are in place, then
these rules will gradually be compiled into a single rule.<P>

ACT-R provides means for modelling the gradual shift by representing both
strategies, but having competition between them. The new strategy starts to
win over the old one because it is the more efficient. This can be achieved
by subjecting the expected gain value to some noise.<P>

Performance can get worse before getting better (the U-shaped learning
curve). In Soar this can arise because the rules forming part of the new
strategy interfere with the old strategy producing a decline in
performance. ACT-R may possibly model this by the initial creation of bad
examples, and using these to eventually form a much better example. I know
of no research in either architecture where U-shaped learning tasks have
been modelled.<P>

<I>Modelling Task Practice</I><BR>
The effect of practice is the reduction in time taken to perform a task,
and can be defined by the power law of practice (Newell & Rosenbloom,
1981). In its basic form, where we cannot distinguish if rule learning is
apparent, this reduction can be explained in terms of the acquisition of
more efficient rules, or by the reduction in time taken to process the same
set of rules (it can also be explained in other ways, such as changes in
the environment, or no longer reflecting on other possible ways to do the
task). In its more complex form, where rules are acquired (e.g. Nerb, Krems
& Ritter, 1993), the explanation appears to be in terms of the creation of
more efficient rules.<P>

Basic practice effects can be explained in Soar via the successive
compilation of the rules which are used to complete the task. This causes
the time for task completion to decrease. In ACT-R, basic practice effects
are explained in terms of the activation of the required declarative memory
elements becoming higher as they are used more and more often (as well as
production strength), hence reducing production latency.<P>

Complex practice effects can be explained by rule acquisition in much the
same way as for strategy acquisition. Task time will decrease because the
new rules will be more efficient. Further time reductions after acquiring
the rules are explained by either repeating the process (where further rule
acquisition is apparent), or by the same processes that explain basic
practice effects.<P>

<I>Modelling the Effect of Prior Knowledge</I><BR>
Being able to manipulate initial knowledge is one of the main attractions
of computational models. It allows us to see what effect different pieces
of knowledge can have upon task performance, what the optimum level of task
knowledge may be, and what knowledge subjects must have acquired to be at
specific levels of performance.<P>

Both architectures allow initial knowledge to be controlled for, since it
is the modeller who defines the starting knowledge in the first place.
Therefore it should be relatively straightforward to look at behaviour
based on different knowledge, or even a different representation of the
same knowledge.<P>

<B>Summary</B><BR>
The ACT-R architecture, when applied to simple psychological phenomena
(e.g. the fan effect, Anderson, 1996) seems almost unfalsifiable. This is
because its many parameters can fine tune behaviour in many ways to fit the
data. Obviously this is not ideal, and so default values for each parameter
should be adhered to as much as possible, with deviations having some form
of theoretical justification.<P>

The analogy mechanism in ACT-R has not been used extensively (the new
version is only three months old), and so there is a lack of complex ACT-R
models. Now that this is in place, researchers should look to modelling
complex behaviour in order to test the analogy process as well as the
general architecture as to how well complexity can be modelled.<P>

Soar models, on the other hand, model complex behaviour as a matter of
course. This is because the learning mechanism within the architecture has
been in place for years, and whilst being rather simple, is surprisingly
versatile in its application. In fact, it is difficult to envisage how Soar
would model simple effects such as primacy and recency, yet it seems quite
easy to think how it could solve the eight puzzle. This is primarily
because while it was proposed as a general architecture, its primary use
and growth has been as a problem solving architecture. ACT-R tries to
encompass both problem solving and general psychological phenomena (via its
various parameters).<P>

I have detailed how both architectures may model cognitive development.
Although models have been developed which account for human behaviour in
aspects of cognitive development (e.g. practice effects, Nerb, Krems &
Ritter, 1993), there is no single one that has tried to model all aspects.
Indeed, very little work has been done toward modelling any in ACT-R
(though this is probably because of the analogy mechanism being fairly
new).<P>

Through meeting various researchers and modellers who are working in
similar areas to myself, with whom I have discussed my work, I have been
able to gather various insights and help into how to proceed with my work.
For example, John Anderson suggested I begin by modelling a part of the
task that children have difficulty with (e.g. seriation, the piling of the
pyramid layers in a sequence ordered by size). David Kieras suggested that
there may be too much work involved in linking EPIC and ACT-R for my
purposes (perceptual and motor actions involved in the task). Establishing
these contacts within the Soar and ACT-R communities will mean the ability
to continue discussions regarding new modelling techniques and new research
findings.<P>

My own preferences at the moment are towards ACT-R, since the impetus in
the architecture is for it to be more psychologically plausible. Changes
from version 2.0 to version 3.0 involved removing the possibility of
negating actual declarative memory elements (you can only negate their
associated slot/fillers), and the removal of lists as fillers. Both move
toward making the theory more plausible. Since I will be expecting to work
with these architectures for the next two or more years, such visions are
beneficial.<P>

Although the learning mechanism in ACT-R is not nearly as robust and
flexible as that of Soar at present, with consistent use by researchers it
may become so. I plan to produce a model of expert behaviour on the pyramid
task using ACT-R, which may then be used as a guide for what less advanced
models (i.e. models of childrens behaviour) should become after
appropriate learning/development. I will also be able to examine behaviour
when specific knowledge is removed from the model.<P>

Soar must also be borne in mind. If models can be developed in both
architectures then I will have a better means by which to examine the
benefits of each, or better yet, allow the testing of multiple hypotheses
about the architectures, problem solving and about cognitive development.<P>

Finally, there are other architectures that exist which could also model
the pyramid task. The PDP++ software demonstrated to me by Randy OReilly
(E-mail oreilly+@cmu.edu) is highly impressive and freely available from
the web (at <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/CNBC/PDP++/PDP++.html">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Web/Groups/CNBC/PDP++/PDP++.html</A>). This
is written in C++ for Unix workstations, and represents follow on work to
the PDP software (McClelland & Rumelhart, 1988).<P>

<B>1. Summary</B><BR>
The author reports on presentations at three European symposia on semiconductor nanostructures and nanocomputing.  His own presentations were on computing with nano-electronic devices, in particular Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata (QCA).  He notes Prof Leon Chuas announcement at the 10 July symposium of the first operational Universal Cellular Neural Network (CNN)chip, and that in recognition of the potential of arrays of quantum dots Chua has changed the definition of CNN to "Cellular Nonlinear Network".  This extends the previous CNN concept of a locally-connected array to allow some long range, non-uniform and non-identical connections.  He also notes the predominance of European participants, and reduced US presence, at ICPS-23 <P>

<B>2.  Narrative</B><BR>
I was an invited panelist at the WCNA-96 Symposium on Brain-like Micro- and Nano-Computing, organized by Prof. Tamas Roska from the Technical University of Budapest, Hungary. The symposium featured two lectures by Prof. Leon Chua (U.C. Berkeley) on Cellular Neural Networks (CNN), two lectures by myself on computing with nano-electronic devices, and one lecture by Prof. Tamas Roska on CNN array computers mimicking the functionality of the brain.<P>

One highlight of Dr. Chua's talk was the announcement of the first operational Universal CNN chip, which had recently been fabricated and successfully tested. Both Chua and Roska reported that this chip had just been officially released a few days earlier at a press conference in Budapest. A sample of an actual chip was handed around in the lecture hall.<P>

Another highlight (for me especially!) was Dr. Chua's interest in and excitement about our ideas on Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata (QCA's). In his lecture, he repeatedly made reference to the promise and potential of arrays of quantum dots, coupled by their physical interactions. In fact Leon Chua even changed the definition of CNN in order to accomodate these new nano-electronic systems: CNN now stands for "Cellular Nonlinear Network." Now any locally-connected array is a CNN, but some long-range interconnections are also allowed. The nodes in the array and their connections do not have to be identical, and the array does not have to be uniform. (This is quite different from the original definition of CNN as a uniform array of identical cells and connects with a rather restricted synaptic law!) With this new definition, for example, a molecular implementation of QCA's could be considered a CNN.<P>

Unfortunately, the attendance of the symposium was rather disappointing. The WCNA organizers had scheduled it in parallel with six other sessions,including a plenary lecture with the greatest appeal to the applied mathematics conference participants. Also, the facilities were most disappointing: The window shades did not work, which made it hard to use the overhead projectors because of the bright Athens sun. In addition, the projectors were of very poor quality and the rough wall of the lecture hall had to double as the screen. The attendance in the afternoon was even lower, because the buses did not show up after lunch to bring the participants back to the rather remote conference location. The organization and administration of WCNA-96 was the worst that I had ever experienced!<P>

Even though WCNA-96 was a disappointment, the trip to Athens was significant because of the interaction with Leon Chua and Tamas Roska. In particular, I spent a lot of time with Leon Chua discussing quantum-dots and locally-interconnected device architectures.<P>

It should also be mentioned here that two weeks prior to the Athens meeting, I had been invited to attended a symposium in Seville, Spain (not using ONR funds for travel). This symposium entitled "Visions of Nonlinear Science in the 21st Century" was preceded by the 4th IEEE International Workshop on Cellular Neural Networks and their Applications (CNNA-96), and followed by the 4th International Workshop on Nonlinear Dynamics of Electronic Systems (NDES-96). As it turns out, this special symposium was in honor of Leon Chua's 60th birthday, and scheduled in between these two workshops since they represent some research activities originated by him. The opening lecture was given by Nobel Laureate I. Prigogine on "Nonlinear Science and the Laws of Nature." I gave a presentation on "Quantum-Dot Devices and Quantum Cellular Automata." Leon Chua himself gave a talk on his vision of nonlinear science in the 21st century, which I was happy to hear included quantum-dot CNN's and CNN's made of molecular structures.<P>

The Berlin meeting represented the 23rd in a series of bi-annual conferences on the physics of semiconductors, which arguably is the main conference for the semiconductor physics community. I had been invited to present a talk on "Modeling Quantum-Dot Cellular Automata Devices and Architectures." <P>

The highlights of the conference were plenary and invited lectures. The following were most memorable to me:<P>

<UL>
<LI>Dr. Klaus von Klitzing (MPI Stuttgart) spoke about "Latest developments in the quantum Hall effect," emphasizing application in metrology.
<LI>Prof. Marc Kastner (MIT) gave a talk about "Mesoscopic physics in artificial atoms," discussing the electronic structure and transport properties of quantum dots. He made a case for studying quantum dots in the technologically important silicon material system, in addition to compound semiconductors, which are usually employed in this field.
<LI>Prof. Nikolai Ledentsov (St. Petersburg and Berlin) described their method of fabricating pyramid-shaped self-assembled quantum dots. He mentioned the Notre Dame ideas of computing with coupled dots as one possible  application.
<LI>Dr. Nakamura (Anan) talked about "III-V nitride based blue LED's and LD's." In this very impressive presentation, progress in nitride technology was reviewed which makes them one of the apparent leading contenders in the
<LI>race for technologically viable blue light emitters. 
<LI>Dr. Phaedon Avouris (IBM) described "Atomic and nanometer scale modification of semiconductor surfaces." Using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM), it is possible to both image and modify (scratching, etching, oxidizing, etc.) surfaces with atomic resolution. The possibility of using these local probes for device fabrication was also discussed.
<LI>Dr. John Tucker (Beckman Institute) presented "New concepts for developing practical Si nanoelectronics." He discussed the use of atomic force microscopes (AFM) for local oxidation of Si. He also emphasized the potential of silicides for ultra-small devices. Silicon-silicide Schottky barriers can be used to control current flow, replacing the conventional MOS gate-induced barriers. Silicide devices would be compatible with current CMOS technology.
<LI>Dr. Armin Wieder (SIEMENS) discussed "Challenges of Si VLSI in the 15 years ahead." Even though there are no apparent fundamental physical limits which Si VLSI is likely to encounter in the next 15 years, it will increasingly become difficult to sustain past exponential trends (Moore's Law). The key problems are: (i) power consumption and (ii) the interconnect problem. On the device level, single-electron devices hold promise because of their low power consumption. Innovative architecture ideas are needed to circumvent the interconnect problem.</UL>

In general, the state-of-the-art in semiconductor nanostructures experimentation is extremely sophisticated. There were many most impressive papers on subtle and intricate effects. It does not appear to be that clear, however, where these nanostructures ultimately will find their application. Our work on computing with coupled quantum dots found a good deal of interest. In his conference closing statement, the ICPS-23 Program Chairman (Prof. Dieter Bimberg from the Technical University Berlin) speculated that the future would see applications of quantum dots arranged in cellular-automata architectures. On a more general note, it struck me that the number of European participants appeared to be over-proportionally large, even considering that the meeting was held in Berlin. The U.S. presence appeared to be smaller than even a few short years ago.<P>

<H3>Report on WAC'96 -- The Second World Automation Conference<p>

<A HREF="http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~dkw/">CAPT D. K. WEHE</A>, NR ONR S&amp;T 304<p>

This report  reviews WAC'96, held  in Montpellier, FR, May 27-30, 1996<p>

Overview of the Conference</H3><p>

The Second World Automation Conference was a combination of three separate conferences:  ISRAM'96 (Sixth International Symposium on Robotics and Manufacturing), ISIAS'96 (First International Symposium on Intelligent Automation and Control), and ISSCI'96 (
First Intenational Symposium on Soft Computing for Industry).  The conference is billed as a ``multi-disciplinary, multi-symposia science and technology congress bridging gaps between the global research and development efforts in Robotics, Manufacturing,  Automation, Computional Intelligence, Control, Multimedia, and Medical Imaging.'' There were nine technical tutorials and 140 technical sessions covering robotics, manufacturing, automation, fuzzy logic, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and control systems.  Ninety of these sessions were invited sessions, organized by individual technologists from 30 countries.  The three conferences ran simultaneously so it was difficult to distringuish one from the other even by subject matter.  The conference is primarily the result of Prof. Mo Jamshidi's singular energy and vigor.  Originated in 1986 as a small symposium on robotics for a few dozen researchers, the semi-annual  event has now grown to attract nearly 600 registered attendees from around the globe.  This growth is quite remarkable considering the conference is neither sponsored nor promoted by any professional society.  <p>

One might postulate that such rapid growth is due to a rapidly expanding technology base which is attracting a growing number of international top researchers needing a forum to exchange technical advances.  But with a few exceptions (such as Prof. Lofti Zadeh from Cal-Berkley), most of the noteworthy  researchers and figures in the fields were absent.  Instead, the growth is probably due to the personal energy of the local organizers who attract participants regionally, and the fact that the conference is normally situated at an attractive location.  While WAC'96 is probably not regarded as a top-ranked technical conference, the quality of the papers and presentations were significantly improved over WAC'94.  <p>

The reason for the improvement is largely due to the local organizers.  The WAC conference is assembled by volunteers (who become the session chairs) who solicit a sufficient number of papers from colleagues to form a session.  The quality of the session is thus largely dependent on the session chairs' ability to attract good papers.  In past years, the chairs' too often looked no further than their immediate neighbors, and this led to parochial sessions which were presentations of a single group's work (often to an audience not much larger than the local group).  While some of this was still present, many more sessions embodied a fuller picture of the technical work being done in various areas.  Thus, the overall quality of the conference, while still lacking sufficient depth in certain areas to attract many of the world's top researchers, is certainly vastly improved.  It is clear that the conference's technical strengths lie in  control theory, including tradiational and non-tradiational approaches such as neural networks, genetic and evolutionary algorithms, and fuzzy logic.  Serious researchers in areas such as robotics and sensing, or manufacturing may be better served at more established and focussed topical meetings (such as IEEE's Robotics and Automation Conference, IJCAI, or AAAI) which tend to highlight the work being done at premier institutions.  However, this conference is well suited for technologists who are looking to keep abreast on the overall international programs, directions and progress across a much wider horizon than is found at most specialized meetings.  Furthermore, the conference attracts a large number of smaller groups whose contributions are not recognized in these more formal conferences.  <p>

With  140 technical sessions compressed into three days, it was possible to only get a sense of interesting projects and areas which are emerging, particularly in Europe.  An  interest in intelligent mobile machines naturally led me to those sessions promising to be the most relevant.  For those readers with specific other interests, the conference proceedings is available in a 3-4 volume set or on CD from the publisher TSI Enterprises, WAC 96 Proceedings, P.O. Box 14126, Albuquerque, NM 87191-4126 USA (telephone: 505-298-5817), and selected papers will be also published by ASME Press as Volume 6 of Advances in Robotics and Manufacturing.   <p>

<B>Interesting plenary talks</B><p>

o  Plenary speaker Lofti Zadeh, the acknowledged father of fuzzy logic,  discussed the evolution of fuzzy control.  He emphasized the stregnth of fuzzy theory in minimizing specificity (e.g., Mary is young) while being able to deal with vagueness in a logical framework.  He argued that fuzzy logic would be useful in interpretting images, extracting fuzzy (i.e., general) features, and using this as an input to control processes.  This field enjoys its unique vocabulary, including fuzzifier and defuzzifier operators.  Proponents point to a number of commercial successes, including controllers for major appliances (particularly popular in the Far East).  Fuzzy control theory is not universally accepted as a serious control strategy, and there was a general attempt to have it viewed  it as a complementary approach to more traditional approaches.  <p>

o  Plenary speaker P. Coiffet of the Laboratory de Robotique de Paris noted that computers, introduced in 1945, successfully revolutionized technology.  The second technology revolution is  robotics,  generally introduced in the 1960's, but which has not been as successful yet.   The holdup is that perception is linked to the decision level, and a number of fundamental problems remain in perception.  Even a simple action such as putting a marble in a hole still offers daunting challenges.  The third major revolution is virtual reality, recently introduced in this decade, and its impact on technology remains uncertain.  <p>

o  Larry Fogel of Natural Selections (USA) gave an energetic sales pitch on evolutionary programming.  He argued that intelligence should be defined as solving new problems using new ways.  This excluded many existing techniques which use the word intelligent in them, and which generally can find a ``right''  solution to the wrong problem.  His arguments panned most rule-based systems, which included genetic algorithms.  Instead, he noted that nature scores by behavior, and he models any process that is to be controlled as a black box which translates a stimulus into a response.  This evolutionary  approach, which was not defined during his talk, is apparently described in the book ``Evolutionary Programming'' by David Fogel.  He noted that he could obtain a quick  solution to the 50-city travelling salesman problem using his approach and pointed to commercial successes with the U. S. Navy's SmartNet project, Chevron's fuel distribution problem, and work with Agron Chemical Pharmaceuticals.  <p>

<B>Interesting technical talks</B><p>

o  Zapata (France).  He attacked the problem of collision avoidance by defining deformable virtual zones using a rigorous control theory approach.  He implemented it using a PID controller on a small (~1m diameter) disk robot having Sweedish wheels (i.e., macadam wheels) for holonomic motion, and showed excellent reponse.  <p>

o  Blessing (IWB, Munich, Germany) showed how vision-based systems could be used with autonomous mobile systems in manufacturing.  They used a standard Europallet platform and manipulator.  <p>

o  (Christian Langier, INRIA Rhone-Alpes, FR) .  A whole session was dedicated to the French Praxitele project, which is a French system of electric cars which can be checked out and driven around a city to any  other  (charging) station.  The Praxitele project is sponsored by a number of industrial groups.  Intelligent controls are being studied as part of this project.  One group showed video of an electric vehicle exhibiting reflexive obstacle avoidance around people as it moved through a large, sparsely populated, square.  Other work centered on an unmanned electric vehicle which followed another vehicle through an urban environment.  Another paper and video showed autonomous  parallel parking.  Overall, there seemed to be considerable European activity and interest  in intelligent cars, ranging from assisting the driver, to road following, and leading to fully autonomous road vehicles.  <p>

o  the work reported (reported last year) from LAAS-Toulouse on multiple vehicle coordination has been successfully implemented at the Rotterdam shipping port. Intelligent mobile pallets move independently to and from storage locations.  <p>

o   the sessions on Evolutionary Algorithms in Robotics were  technically interesting.  Drs. Grefenstette and Schultz from NRL were leaders of this topic area.  Their continuing work in adaptive learning (through somewhat randomly modifying a previous rule set and accepting or rejecting the new rules depending upon their simulated effectiveness) seems to indicate steady progress and appealed to the small audience.  One of their  talks focussed on the task of staying close to another robot by applying  their SAMEUL learning module.  The resulting adaptive behavior which evolved clearly showed the power of their approach.  <p>

o  perhaps the greatest change from previous conferences was the heightened interest in robotic medical applications.  For example, ROBODOC is a robotic system for use during hip replacement surgery.  The system must be positioned near the proper location, but then automatically locates the best position and performs the necessary drilling and pin placements.  The system has been used in 150 surgeries in the US and is used routinely in Germany where over 300 replacements have been performed.  The advantage of the system is closer to ideal placement of hardware and the resulting lower bone fracture rate.  The disadvantage is the increased operating room time and the  consequences of longer patient surgeries.  In another talke, a female researcher described a European remote laproscopy system.  Other typical applications involved sensing the location of a small invasive tool.  <br><br>Besides actual hardware systems, information systems are rapidly being deployed.  Four sequential sessions entitled Intelligent Systems for Medicine were run -- the largest of any topic area.  To give an example of  such an application, consider Dr. Frolich's talk on Clincical Pharmacology databases.  He noted that President Roosevelt was actually quite ill at the Yalta conference, with a blood pressure of 240/140.  Unfortunately, there were no drugs available to treat his condition then.  But, the modern health care provider has thousands of drugs available for treatments.  However,  18-25% of hospitalizations are now estimated to be caused by drug-induced effects, such as improper dosage, reactions, interactions, or drug-related medical errors.  In addition, a major source of concern is the effect of drugs during pregnancy.  Dr. Folich recognized that many of these problems can be solved by a comprehensive data retrieval and expert system to assist hospital and community physicians, and his presentation described the details of his automated advisory system.  Despite the obvious merits of such a system, the speaker lamented that the system only averages 8 users/week even in with the multiple,  large hospital user base.  Other researchers described systems, including a fuzzy-logic based system,  to assist in checking consistency of medical knowledge sets.  This appeared to me to be the case of a tool looking for a problem.  <p>

o  Dr. P. McKerrow (Austrailia) chaired a session on understanding ultrasonic sensing for mobile robot applications.  This was an excellent session which explored the limitations of this sensing modality.  In particular, a paper by Yata (Japan) showed how discrete wavelength limits were necessary for improved accuracy and reduced noise.  And McKerrow's talk provided a comprehensive theoretical look at all the physical effects which influence signal propagation.  McKerrow clearly demonstrated why he is considered by many to be the leading expert in sonar physics for robotic applications.  <p>

o  The session on Open Architecture Controllers was particularly uninteresting.  Chaired by Ron Lumia of the University of New Mexico, the session promoted an open architecture concept supported presumably by GM, NIST, DOE, and another group which I missed.  The structure appeared so open and flexible, it seemed to lack any substance or audience.  <p>

o  Finally, the concept of cooperating agents was present as well.  Papers discussed multiple arms handling flexible objects.  Perhaps the most impressive work was shown by Pfieffer (Germany) who showed a videotape of a four-fingered hand manipulating a small sphere.  The hand used hydraulic actuators with no external feedback.  The author noted that with the new direct drive devices now available, such complex manipulations are becoming easier.  <p>

<B>Summary of the Conference</B><p>

Major technical breakthroughs are not expected at a conference of this type, and none were observed.  In robotics, there appears to be more of a shift away from industrial applications (such as manufacturing) to medical and transportation applications. There appears to be less emphasis on direct sensing (such as vision), and more emphasis on controls (e.g., fuzzy logic, neural networks, genetic algorithms, cooperating agents) and information systems.  Military applications were practically non-existent, and only a small amount of attention was given to nuclear-related applications (although French and British vendors showed radiation-hardened components).   Funding seemed strong and unchanged, although a few attendees noted that it was harder to maintain their robotic/AI/controls research programs than two years ago.  <p>

In summary, the conference showed that the European and Asian communities have maintained a strong program in intelligent machines by adapting to shifting application interests.  Some of the earlier work has been integrated into commercial products which 
has helped to sustain development in these areas and brought beneficial industrial interest.  As a conference which attracts the  full range of international attendees, it provides a valuable window on the current international efforts in intelligent machines.  <p>

<H3>Notes on ONREUR Trip<p>

<A HREF="http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~dkw/">CAPT D. K. WEHE</A>, NR ONR S&amp;T 304<p>

Tuesday, May 21, 1996</H3><p>

<B>Trip to University of Surrey,  Guildford, UK, Department of Physics</B>.    Unlike its more venerable counterparts in Oxford or Cambridge, the University of Surrey  is a relatively new school, founded in the mid-1960&otilde;s. Despite its short history, the University is proud of its status, having been nationally ranked 4A and expecting a full 5 ranking this year.  This high status is shared by only about 10 of the top 100 universities in the UK.   The visit to Surrey was hosted by Professor Walter Gilboy, director of the Radiation Physics Group.  <p>

Their web page describes their activities as:<p>

Radiation Physics investigates the applications of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation to problems in materials science, environmental physics and medical physics. There is a special emphasis on medical and industrial imaging with NMR, ultrasonics, eddy currents, photon tomography and neutron tomography. Image reconstruction and interpretation is studied with high speed computational techniques.<p>

The group's experimental facilities include several purpose built rigs for gamma-ray tomography, a scanning electron microscope, low background HpGe high resolution gamma spectrometers, TLD equipment and a high intensity Co-60 irradiator. Several high-field NMR spectrometers, an ESR system and ultrasonic equipment are used for fundamental materials research.<p>

 Medically oriented research is supported by an EMI 7020 X-ray tomographic scanner, a superconducting whole body MRI imaging system and an in-vivo neutron activation rig. The University Van der Graaf accelerator is used for nuclear reaction studies of diffusion in  polymeric materials.<p>

In practice the group is led by the personal energy and intellect of Dr. Gilboy and <p>

his two close protrising findings was the remarkable shift to an enterprise-driven research program.  The group is strongly influenced by corporate funding opportunities and actively seeks industrial collaborations.  This move appears to be out of necessity due to a steadily decreasing national investment in university research.  <p>

Dr. Gilboy&otilde;s primary research interest continues to be employing atomic and nuclear processes to ensure British food products remain uncontaminated by foreign objects.  Historically, plastic in candy was a difficult problem to diagnose prior to Dr. Gilboy&otilde;s innovative application of Rayleigh scattering of 60 keV x-rays.  The key breakthrough in his efforts was the discovery that complex sugars form a semi-crystalline state which will exhibit diffraction effects when irradiated with x-rays.  <p>

Dr. Ed Morton is a new member of Surrey&otilde;s Radiation Physics Group.  Dr. Morton has recently joined the group from the University of Michigan where he was a research scholar developing electronics to support Dr. Antonuk's amorphous silicon detector work.  Although he is continuing some of this previous work in readout devices, Dr. Morton is developing a set of excellent diagnostic experimental facilities (including fast digital scopes and signal generators).  Work is progressing in the areas of compact x-ray sources.  Of potentially more significance is the work on CZT (Cadmium Zinc Telluride).  Dr. Morton seeks to characterize the effect of contacts and surface treatments on the leakage currents.  Although CZT has long been sought as a room-temperature semiconductor, little is understood about the variability of its intrinsic properties and surface-related parameters.  Using a polarized IR probe, Dr. Morton&otilde;s group intends to sense the perturbation of the electric field induced by the flow of charge through the bulk material.  Dr. Morton reported that he has found the unperturbed localized electric field to be highly non-linear.  <p>

Dr. Nick Spirou is responsible for the medical physics research ongoing in the Physics Department.  With approximately a dozen doctoral students, Dr. Spirou&otilde;s projects span a range of interests.  One interesting project uses DRAM failure rates as a direct measure of radiation exposure.  This is a rather clever idea in which a well-studied, normally undesirable effect is used as a diagnostic tool.   The sensor may find applicability as an in-vivo surgical tool.  <p>

In summary, the Surrey group is well-known for its clever and innovative applications in radiation physics and this visit confirmed that this  tradiation continues.  There do appear to be both internal and external influences which are forcing the group to seek increased support from local industries in order to sustain their level of activity.  <p>

<H3>Thursday, 25 May 1996 <p>

Trip to Southampton University, Southampton, UK</H3>

My visit to Southampton University was hosted by Professor David Ramsden, Chairman of the Physics Department.  The department has several strengths, including the Optoelectronics and Radiation Imaging Groups.  My visit was focussed on the Radiation Imaging Group.  The visit began with the tradiational group tea, a custom which only remains in the Physics Department as it is recognized as a costly luxury.  <p>

Dr. Tony Dean has remained a strong supporter to the Integral Project -- a radiation imaging camera to be flown on a European space sattelite.  The Southampton group was primarily responsible for the project, but now plays a largely supervisory role in the project due to their historical strength in this area and the rather difficult problem of keeping  numerical parity among the European partners in the space program.  <p>

Dr. Tony Carter is a postdoctoral scholar in the radiation imaging program and is extremely strong in developing the custom microelectronics needed in high precision applications.  He graciously has provided this author with electronics which are incomparible in size and function.  The group has lost one of its star electronics engineers, and is looking to replace him.  <p>

Several members of the group presented their current work -- Ian Jupp, a doctoral student nearing completion, has developed simulation tools for coded aperture imaging.  This is a rather established asrophysics technique for imaging discrete point radiation sources in a comparible background.  The interesting question is whether the technique can be extended to other applications.  (The group has branched off to other applications besides astrophysics because Dr. Ramsden&otilde;s senior status has led him to look at problems with shorter horizons than future space missions with long lead times). For example, the group is working with BNFL to improve the BNFL commercial radiation imager by using a wine-bottle shaped collimator with a psuedo-pinhole for imaging coupled to a 3-inch Hammamatsu position-sensitive photomultiplier tube with barium fluoride crystals.  The group has developed a unique scheme (with custom-built boards to do a serial readout) to readout each wire, and then will build on work done by Aarsvold at Univ. of Chicago and similar work in Italy to extend the usefulness of the PSPMT.  <p>

The most exciting work being done is the hybrid photodiode -- the group is working with DEP and has shown a gain of 3000 using a high voltage (~15K V).  This is a single stage device in which the photocathode emits photoelectrons which are accelerated and focussed on a single photodiode.  Other geometries utilizing an array of Pds may enable position sensing.  Individual photoelectrons are easily resolved which may be useful for timing applications.  The device has the advantage of compactness, linearity, and insensitivity to magnetic fields -- distinct operational advantages over the conventional photomultiplier tube.  Hamamatsu is reportedly also developing a similar set of devices.  <p>

The group now has a web-page and brochure as it seeks to increase its commercial support base.  Additional details can be obtained from these sources or IEEE Trans. Nucl. Sci.<p>

For a joint decision from their Steering Committees, the 4th IEEE International Workshop
		on Cellular Neural Networks and Applications (CNNA-96) and the 4th international
			Workshop on Nonlinear Dynamics of Electronic Systems (NDES'96), were both held in
			Seville, Spain, on June 24-25, and June 27-27, respectively.<P>


			Although these two workshops have a different focus, and were held independently in the
			past on different dates and at different locations, there is in fact a large intersection among
			the audience of these two workshops, both were attracted to a common desire to exploit the
			applications of nonlinear science and high technology to the design of intelligent, compact,
			and real-time nonlinear systems, including secure and portable communication systems, as
			well as robots and bionic based systems, such as cellular neural networks. In order to
			enhance the cross fertilization between the audience from these two workshops, and to
			increase the participation from members of the EEE Circuits and Systems Society to these
			predominantly European activities, it was decided to strengthen this linkage by organizing a
			<B>Distinguished Plenary Lecture</B> session (during June 26, 1996) entitled <I>Visions of
			Nonlinear Science In The 21st Century</I>.<P>


			The organizers' plan was to invite a few eminent scientists, who have made major
			contributions in different areas of nonlinear science or technology, to deliver a formal
			lecture on their visions of the great challenges and possible payoffs from nonlinear science,
			mathematics and technology, for the 21st century. We believe that the thoughtful ideas and
			positions to be advocated by these distinguished lecturers will help to identify important but
			tractable research directions in nonlinear science, and to provide leaderships and
		inspirations to future generations of researchers for solving many fundamental problems
			from such multi-disciplinary areas as neural networks, artificial intelligence,
			nanotechnology, nonlinear dynamics, nonlinear mathematics, self organization,
			complexity, artificial life, etc.<P>


			A main objective was to peer into the dawn of the next century and attempt to identify in
		this workshop some of the most fundamental and significant problems from nonlinear
			science, mathematics, and high technology which are tractable, and economically feasible,
			and whose solutions are likely to have major impacts in industry, as well as economy, in
			the 21st century, and beyond. We believe that such major impacts in science could be no
			less than the discovery of the ubiquitous phenomenon of chaos, and that such major
		impacts in technology could be no less than those which resulted from the invention of the
			transistor nearly half a century ago. The visions will be aimed for the next half century for
			research areas which are likely to be revolutionary in nature, yet solvable within the next
			five decades. Blue sky ideas whose solutions are clearly unrealistic within this time span
			will not be addressed in this workshop.<P>

			Eleven lectures (see the attached program) were offered to an audience primarily formed by
			attendants of both CNNA-96 and NDES-96, plus a number of people who only
			participated in this seminar on "<I>Visions of Nonlinear Science in The 21st Century</I>". A
			summary from each presentation is included below.<P>

			The number of attendees was 246. A lunch was offered to the audience as well as two
			coffee breaks served by the staff from Hotel Al-Andalus, the place where the seminar was given.<P>

In recent years a radical change of perspectives has been witnessed in science following the
		realization that large classes of systems may exhibit abrupt transitions, a multiplicity of
		states, coherent structures or a seemingly erratic motion characterized by unpredictability
		often referred to as deterministic chaos. Classical science emphasized stability and
		equilibrium; now we see instabilities, fluctuations and evolutionary trends in a variety of
		areas ranging from atomic and molecular physics through fluid mechanics, chemistry and
		biology to large scale systems of relevance in environmental and economic sciences.
		Concepts such as "dissipative structures" and "self-organization" have become quite
		popular. Distance from equilibrium and therefore the arrow of time plays an essential role
		in these processes, somewhat like temperature in equilibrium physics.<P>
	
		When we lower the temperature we have in succession various states of matter. In non-
		equilibrium physics and chemistry, when we change the distance from equilibrium the
		observed behavior is even more varied. How can these findings be interpreted from the
		point of view of the basic laws of physics ? These questions are at the heart of our present
		description of nature.<P>

			This paper describes a procedure for stabilizing a desirable chaotic orbit embedded in a
			chaotic attractor of dissipative dynamical systems by using small feedback control. The key
			observation is that certain chaotic orbits may correspond to a desirable system performance.
			By carefully selecting such an orbit, and then applying small feedback control to stabilize a
			trajectory from a random initial condition around the target chaotic orbit, desirable system
			performance can be achieved. As applications, three examples are considered:<P>
<OL>
<LI>synchronization of chaotic systems
<LI>conversion of transient chaos into sustained chaos
<LI>controlling symbolic dynamics for communication
</OL>

			The first and third problems are potentially relevant to communications in engineering, and
	the solution of the second problem can be applied to electrical power systems to avoid
			catastrophic event such as the voltage collapse.<P>

			ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for which there now exist several software packages
			in which these techniques have been implemented. We describe computational results for
			four different problems, namely, a singular perturbation problem, a problem with
			"bursting" phenomena (Plant's model), a problem with discontinuities (Chua's circuit), and
			a problem with homoclinic bifurcations (coupled Josephson junctions). These examples are
			used to illustrate the power as well as the limitations of the numerical techniques.<P>

			We conclude by describing a selection of problems which we think merit future effort,
			since resulting algonthms and software would find many applications. Some current efforts
			in these directions are indicated.<P>

In his essay "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus" Ludwig Wittgenstein writes:<P>
<DIR>"The world is all that is the case". A physicist will easily agree but may feel unhappy about the amount of information given. But are there better solutions? Yes, there are. For instance, when a physicist at the turn of the century (1900) would have been asked, in view of the unification of mechanism and thermodynamics, the answer may have been: "The world is statistical".</DIR><P>

Ten years later, around 1910, impressed by the results of Einstein, the same physicist may have answered: "The world is relative" Twenty years later, around 1930, when looking at the achievements of quantum mechanics, the still alive physicist may have added: The world is quantal".<P>

What to add today, near the turn of the next century? Is there something left in fundamental science to be discovered besides statistics, relativity, and quantity? If not, this would be strange and even disappointing. To be sure, physics has not yet come to an end, and we
see the next fundamental step in science prospenng, that is nonlinearity. Nonlinearity is
		fundamental for all processes in nature, except perhaps quantum physics [Heisenberg,
		1967]. However, for long times it has not been recognized as a fundamental fact. Why? It
		seems to have been the general opinion that no universal laws may be found for nonlinear
		phenomena leaving them as a set of individual independent problems. Then nothing can be
		learned for a specific nonlinear problem from solving the other ones. This situation has
		changed drastically in the last decade.<P>

		Nonlinearity now is recognized as being fundamental in almost any area of physics,
		notably hydrodynamics, optics, acoustics, and extends to chemistry, biology, ecology.
		Thus, today, a physicist will add: The world is nonlinear", and put this sentence on an
		equal footing with the three previous ones.<P>

		The basic hypothesis of a physicist (not long ago called philosopher) is that the natural
		phenomena surrounding us are governed by laws and that a language can be invented to pin
		down these laws. We call that basic research, and it worked well so far for the benefit of
		mankind, although it has been a long way from ancient times to arrive at this insight. For
		instance, Descartes worked hard to give hints how to proceed in science to make progress.
		But why do we want to understand nature? One reason is our intellectual curiosity. The
		second reason is that we can make use of the laws for better mastering our life, for instance
		by building houses, beating enemies with improved arms, moving faster than with our
		legs, transmitting information, etc. This works because with every law detected we gain the
		ability to predict the behavior of the respective system.<P>

		When we collect more and more laws of nature, will we, in the end, be able to predict the
		future? The answer is no, and the reason is nonlinearity. Even simple deterministic laws
  				may have such complicated dynamics that a prediction over longer periods of time is
				impossible. Thus determinism does not imply (practical) predictability. And what do we do
				facing this insight? We now do experiments to gain insight into our limitations set by
				nonlinearity This review is an attempt to at least partially follow the ways experimentalists
				have gone and will go further to elucidate the nature of unpredictability.<P>
				<B>Nonlinear Science - The Impact of Biology</B><P>
				A. V. Holden<P>
				Nonlinear science has primarily developed from applications of mathematics to physics.
				The biological sciences are emerging as the dominant growth points of science and
				technology, and biological systems are characterized by being information dense, spatially
				extended, organized in interacting hierarchies, and rich in diversity. These characteristics,
				linked with an increase in available computing power and accessible memory, may lead to a
				nonlinear science of complicated interacting systems that will link different types of
				mathematical object within a framework of algebraic models of computing systems.
				Examples, drawn from current work on intracellular, cellular, tissue, organ, and integrative
				physiology of an individual, are outlined within the theory of synchronous concurrent algorithms. 				Possible directions in population dynamics and applications to ecosystem
				management are outlined.<P>

				In this chapter I am outlining the future development of nonlinear science in the 21st
				century. Since historians continually re-interpret and revise our view of the past, any
				predictions of the future from a current perspective of nonlinear science and its
				development must be uncertain. A common feature of nonlinear systems is that their
				behaviors can be unexpected, counterintuitive and surprising; homogeneous systems can
				self-organize; simple systems can generate complex behavior and long-term predictability
				may be impossible. What is to be expected from nonlinear science is the new and
				unexpected.<P>

				Nonlinear science is a recent and premature concept and its birth can perhaps be identified
				with the opening of the Center for Nonlinear Studies at Los Alamos, or the informal
				circulation of Nonlinear Science Abstracts by Joe Ford in 1977, or the start of publication
				of Physica-D Nonlinear phenomena in 1980. Its conception was not a single event, more a
				coming together from different roots, chaos from Poincare's celestial mechanics,
				Cartwrights studies on forced oscillators and Lorenz's three variable ordinary differential
				equation model; solutions from Scott Russel's observations by the Glasgow-Edinburgh
				canal, and Fermi, Pasta and Ulam's early computations at Los Alamos on a nonlinear
				vibrating sting. It is premature as most of nonlinear science is still mathematics, rather than
			science, and where the mathematics is applied it is usually to problems from imaginary
physics, rather than laboratory or real-world problems.<P>


The institutionalization of nonlinear science, with its workshops, initiatives, programs, journals, monographs and textbooks, has already begun. The development of a nonlinear science, as distinct from a menagerie of nonlinear novelties from different disciplines, is underway. Its future growth may be by a gradual accretion of processes and mechanisms, or by metamorphoses, barely staying afloat on a sea of shifting paradigms.<P>

		This paper presents a generalized definition of CNN with covers a much broader terrain
		outside of engineering and brain science where it was originally intended. Henceforth, the
		term CNN may be interpreted as "Cellular Neural network" if applied in the more general
		setting encompassing many disciplines, including biology, chemistry, ecology, economics,
		mathematics, physics, social sciences, etc. In particular, by simply specifying the "cells",
		almost all well-known nonlinear partial differential equations can be modeled by a CNN.
		Some of these equations are EitzHugh-Nagumo Equation, Brusselator, Oregonator,
		Meinhardt-Gierer Equation, Sine-Gordon Equation, Toda Lattice, Voltena-Lotka Equation,
		etc.<P>
		
		From the practical (e.g. image processing) applications viewpoint, more than 75% of all
		current CNN's can be explicitly and rigorously specified by a "minimal CNN truth table"
		containing only 512 binary bits (for 3x3 neighborhoods). This important class of CNN's is
		henceforth called "locally Boolean" and one fundamental result of this paper is a proof that
		any locally Boolean CNN can be realized by using only linearly-separable CNN's as
		building blocks, and can be trivially implemented in real time via the CNN universal chip.
		As a corollary, this theorem proves that the CNN is in fact a universal Turing machine
		capable of implementing any algorithm, and a universal constructor which in principle is
		capable of "self reproduction" in the von Neumann sense, and hence is capable of creating
		''artificial life".<P>

		The highlight of this paper is the presentation of a truly fundamental physical principle,
		called the "CNN Local Activity Principle", which provides a unified, precise, and easily testable mathematical criterion for the existence and explanation of many macroscopic
		phenomena and principles currently referred to in the literature under many different names,
		including dissipative structures, synergetic slaving principle, collective, cooperative,
		competitive, far-from-equilibrium, emergent phenomena, edge of chaos etc. This unifying
		theorem proves that all of the above seemingly distinct phenomena and principles are in fact
equivalent in the sense that they are manifestations of the "CNN local activity principle"
		from different perspectives.<P>

		Dynamics is a concise term referring to the study of time-evolving processes, and the
		corresponding system of equations, which describes this evolution, is called a dynamic
		system. A complete survey of results, obtained in this too wide field, is impossible, even
  
limiting the matter to systems described by ordinary differential equations (continuous dynamics) and maps (discrete dynamics), as done in this paper.<P>

Initially, the theory of Dynamic Systems builds up itself on the foundations of the Poincare (1878-1900), Liapunov (1893), Birkhoffs (1908-1944) results, and those concerning the point mappings, iterations, recurrences, obtained at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, by Koenigs, Lemeray, Lattes, Hadamard. After it has had its most spectacular and organized growth within the framework of two Soviet schools of thought (1920 till now): the Mandelstham-Andronov's school (Moseou-Gorki), and the Krylov--Bogoliubov's school (Kiev). Very strong interactions between the theoretical researches and the practical implications in the physical, or engineering systems, are the reason of the success of these two schools. They have led the Poineare-Liapunov-Birkhoffs methods to the highest development in what they called theory of nonlinear oscillations, the most important component of the theory of dynamical systems. In dynamics, these two schools occupied incontestably the first place, which was admitted by some of the most famous American mathematicians [for example, cf. J. P. Lasalle and S. Lefschetz, J. of Math Anal. and Appl., Vol. 2, 1961, pp. 467-499].<P>

From 1960, and specially since 1975 with the explosive growth of the researches in the chaotic dynamics field (irregular oscillations of deterministic origin), and with the translation of some Soviet results in the western counties, the study of dynamic systems has become a subject in vogue out of USSR, with more and more papers concerning all the scientific disciplines. Nevertheless, in spite of a practical motivation often announced by the authors, a large part of these papers concerns "abstract dynamic systems", and are devoted to nonessential generalizations without any interest for understanding a typical dynamic behavior, or for practical purposes. In opposition with the motivation of study of " concrete dynamic systems ", purpose of the Mandelstham-Andronov -Krylov--Bogoliubov's schools, from 1970 an increasing number of pure mathematicians have developed a purely "abstract approach" of dynamics without direct utility for applied fields.<P>

This paper is limited to "concrete dynamic systems", the field of which is considered as constituted by two sets of results. The first one is related to the study of problems directly suggested by practice (Physics, Engineering,...). The second set concerns the study of equations, not directly tied with practice, but having the lowest dimension, and the simplest structure, which permits to isolate in the purest form a "mathematical phenomenon", by eliminating the "parasitic effects" of a more complicated structure.<P>

Integrability and chaos are two of the main concepts associated with nonlinear physical
systems which have revolutionized our understanding of them. Highly stable exponentially
localized solutions are often associated with many of the important integrable nonlinear
systems while notions which are sensitively dependent on initial conditions are associated
with chaotic systems. Besides dramatically raising our perception of many natural
phenomena, these concepts are opening up new vistas of applications and unfolding
		technologies: Optical solution based information technology, magneto electronics,
		controlling and synchronization of chaos and secure communications, to name a few.<P>

		These developments have raised further new interesting questions and potentialities. We
		present a particular view of some of the challenging problems and payoffs ahead in the next
		few decades by tracing the early historical events, summarizing the revolutionary era of
		1950-70 when many important new ideas including solitons and chaos were realized and
		reviewing the current status. Important open problems both at the basic and applied level
		are discussed.<P>

		Nonlinear Computation will provide a framework for the computational science and
		engineering of the future. Topics such as bifurcation and chaos, and methods such as
continuation and branch switching, and features such as stability and sensitivity are basic
		ingredients in the attempt to understand our world. Nonlinear computation is indispensable
		when we try to predict and simulate the dynamics of states in the biological systems we
		consist of, in the ecological and economical systems we live in, and in the technical
		systems we make use of the team "nonlinear computation" is a short form for "computation
of something that is nonlinear." But since "nonlinear" is the normal state and linearity is
		only found in specific local situations, the team nonlinear computation in its proper sense
		may be meaningless. This title rather reflects a historical change in that the traditional
		assumption of linearity is no longer required.<P>

		This paper essentially consists of three parts. The first part (Section 1) explains what
		nonlinear computation means. The second part (Sections 2 through 5) presents a survey on
		nonlinear phenomena, and on the methods of nonlinear computation The final part

		Synergetics is an interdisciplinary field of research. It deals with open systems that are composed of many individual parts that interact with each other and that can form spatial, temporal, or functional structures by self organization. The research goal of synergetics is three-fold:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Are there general principles of self-organization?
<LI>Are there analogies in the behavior of self-organizing systems?
<LI>Can new devices be constructed because of the results 1 and 2?</OL>

From a mathematical point of view, synergetics deals with nonlinear partial stochastic differential equations and studies their solutions close to those points, where the solutions change their behavior qualitatively. As I will show in my article, synergetics in its present form is based on the concepts of stability and instability, control parameters order parameters, and the slaving principle. The slaving principle allows one to compress the information that is necessary to describe complex systems into few order parameters. This is possible if systems are close to their instability points. But it appears that the order parameter concept is also applicable to situations away from such instabilities. At the level of the order parameter equations, profound analogies between otherwise quite different systems become visible. This allows one to realize the same process (for instance dealing with information) on quite different material substrates. The order parameter concept and the slaving principle are explained and their extension to discrete noisy maps and to delay equations are mentioned.<P>

These results can be applied to pattern formation in fluids, lasers, semiconductors, plasmas, and other fields. A section is devoted to the analysis of spatio-temporal patterns in terms of order parameters and the slaving principle. It is shown how the concepts of synergetics can be utilized to devise a new type of computer for pattern recognition. In connection with preprocessing, it can recognize patterns that are shifted, scaled or rotated in space and that are deformed. It can recognize scenes and also facial expressions as well as movement patterns. The learning procedure is briefly outlined. Because of the analogy principle of synergetics this computer allows for hardware realizations by means of semiconductors and lasers. Decision making by humans or machines is interpreted by means of an analogy with pattern recognition. Further sections are devoted to recognition of dynamic processes and learning by machines. In this author's opinion synergetics will find important applications to medicine, for instance in the analysis of MEG and EEG patterns and to the development of devices with brain like functions. Future tasks of synergetics will be the application of the order parameter concept and the slaving principle to the integration of specialized computers or computer algorithms for instance for the recognition of faces, movement patterns, and so on, into a computer network for scene analysis and decision making. This will hold also for complicated production processes, and so on. Generally speaking, the potentialities of synergetics are based on its self-organization principles.<P><HR><P><A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/onrnews.htm">Return to ONREUR Newsletters</A></BODY></HTML>

<H3>Alternative Imaging and Processing Techniques for Machine Vision<P>

draft written by Ruzena Bajcsy August 1996.</H3>


During July 21-27, 1996, a workshop on Alternative Camera Technology
(ALCATECH) was held with international participation (see Appendix A)
and sponsorship from ONR/Europe and the European Commission. This
white paper has been inspired by the presentations and subsequent
discussions at the workshop. First, I will try to define the problem
that this workshop has addressed while casting it in a broad context
of non-contact image formation and processing. Then, I will review the
information presented during the workshop. Finally, I will make
proposal for a RESEARCH AGENDA in this area.<P>

<B>1.0  The Problem</B><P>

Video cameras and related technology are increasingly becoming an
essential and ubiquitous part of computer technology. Applications
such as multimedia, teleconferencing, and general video telepresence
are based on the use of video cameras. Given the physical world, the
basic question is how to design an imaging system (optics and
detectors) as well as illumination for efficient processing for
intelligent system behavior. The answer to this question depends on
the TASK. We consider two broad categories of tasks:<P>

<OL>
<LI>Machine interaction with the environment exemplified by navigation,
manipulation, inspection, metrology, etc.
<LI>Machine to human interaction including human to human communication
over the machine media. Examples include virtual reality, human
sensory augmentation, telepresence, etc.
</OL>

When designing the alternative imaging systems, the issues that one
has to consider include the spatio-temporal resolution of the
detection process; the wavelength of the source and the receiver; the
geometry of the imaging system; the issues of optical phenomena,
absorption and scatter in different media.<P>

<B>2.0  The Overview of the Workshop</B><P>

During the five days at the ALCATECH workshop, we have concentrated
only on the visual spectrum. However, we believe that many issues
discussed here are relevant to the broader spectrum. The program of
the workshop is listed in Appendix B. The topics covered included
optics (lenses), reflection (mirrors), deflection (prisms and water
acting as a prism/mirror), imaging devices with non-uniform spacial
sampling and their advantages/disadvantages with respect to different
tasks; algorithms that can be implemented on a chip level
(computational/smart sensors).<P>

<B>2.1  Mirrors and Prisms</B><P>

The imaging process is a projection of three-dimensional world onto
the two-dimensional image. For intelligent behavior in majority of
tasks one must RECONSTRUCT the 3D world from these images. There are
several ways to do this. For example in stereo principle a point in
the world must be measured by at least two independent images. In
conventional approach, two or more such images are generated by two or
more cameras in a so called stereo configuration. Alternatively, the
multiple independent images can be gathered with single camera and a
set of mirrors. With this inexpensive approach, the camera calibration
is greatly simplified, at the expense of the reduced field-of-view.<P>

<B>2.2  Lenses and Optics.</B><P>

The parameters related to lenses include field-of-view,
depth-of-field, focal length, aperture, and projective geometry. The
classical use of narrow viewing angle of a single lens is well
understood and modeled by the perspective projection geometry. When
capturing motion of close object, these lenses will produce image flow
whose magnitude exceeds the available processing power -- image point
simply moves too much to be reliably tracked between two frames. Other
problems include narrow viewing angle. The alternative to the purely
prospective lens is wide field of view lens (i.e. fish eye lens) or
other exotic projective geometries. For example, Kunyoshi showed a
custom designed lens that has prospective projection model in the
fovea, log-spherical projection around the fovea and spherical
projection in the periphery. Therefore, the fovea is imaged with high
magnification, thus providing high resolution, while the periphery
images with low resolution but wide viewing angle.<P>

<B>2.3  Imaging Sensors</B><P>

The current imaging sensor are determined by the TV industry, which
for various (some historical) reasons have adhered to a uniform
rectangular sampling of the optical signal. On the other hand,
biological systems prefer hexagonal non-uniform polar or log polar
sampling. The computer vision community has investigate the advantages
and disadvantages of various sampling grids for some time now. In this
workshop, Daniilidis made a convincing argument for the advantages of
the polar (not log polar) configuration, especially for motion
estimation and fixation.<P>

<B>2.4  Algorithm and on-chip implementations</B><P>

Recently, several research groups have been interested in algorithms
that will enable them to integrate significant level of processing
with sensors within a single VLSI chip. The advantages include: speed
of performance afforded by fine-grain massive parallelism, opportunity
for top-down sensory adaptation based on decisions made within the
chip, and opportunity for new computation based on computational
biology which "naturally" maps in the physics of electronic devices.<P>

The majority of effort in this area demonstrated implementation of
local operations such as filtering and local contrast encoding. At the
workshop, Brajovic emphasized importance of global operations for top
down sensory adaptation. He argued that it is essential to compute
some global properties of images (e.g. histogram, saliency detection)
which can be used within the chip for guiding further sensing and
processing. In addition, the global operations produce fewer
quantities for the descriptions of the environment, which can be read
out from the chip with low latency. In a sorting sensor shown by
Brajovic the chip computes a histogram of the image before the image
is ever read out of the sensor. This is a radically different approach
suggesting that a combination of sensing and processing on a single
chip provides new opportunities.<P>

<B>3.0  Conclusion and Proposal</B><P>

The computer vision research has marked some significant advances in
last several decades. The general consensus at the workshop was that
the opportunity for future advancement lies in a MULTIDISCIPLINARY
approach of teams with various skills. The disciplines that must be
engaged include optics, radiometry, signal and image processing, VLSI,
material science, applied physics, engineering and computer
science. We view the imaging as a SYSTEM that serves PURPOSE in
particular TASKS. A task will put some constraints on the required
illumination, the detector sensitivity and resolution, and the
processing and speed requirements. Therefore, the final system can be
designed to be inexpensive, light weight and low power, while still
meeting or exceeding the task requirements.<P>

In formulating the RESEARCH PROGRAM, one is seeking the largest
overlap of problems and solutions to the broadest range of
applications. We believe that the know-how is by and large out in the
communities mentioned above. Missing is the METHODOLOGY for selecting
and bringing various expertise together for satisfying the TASK
requirements. It seems that the for new advancements in machine vision
and related fields lies in vastly unexplored alternative
approaches. Once better examined and understood, the alternative
approaches in camera technology will substantially impact many
applications while requiring reasonable resources.<P><HR><P>

<B>1. Introduction</B><BR>
The International scientific conference Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos: Applications in Physics, Biology and Medicine (ICND-96) was held in the Slovakia Hotel, Saratov, Russia, during 7-14 July 1996.  The main aim of the Conference was to bring together scientists from a wide range of disciplines to discuss recent results, both theoretical and experimental, in the field of nonlinear dynamics and to consider their applications to topical problems in physics, biology and medicine.  The opening session of the Conference, attended by University and civic dignitaries, press, and Saratov TV, was bilingual (English and Russian, with translation both ways); all other scientific sessions were in English.<P>

<B>2. Participants</B><BR>

<B>4. Organisation</B><BR>
The main conference organisation was carried out by members of the Laboratory of Nonlinear Dynamics of Saratov State University under the leadership of its Supervisor, Prof. Vadim S. Anishchenko; the Conference Secretary was Miss Galina I. Strelkova.  Guidance and advice in relation to format and preparation of the scientific programme was provided by an international committee including the undersigned.  Following very careful planning and preparation, no significant organisational problems arose during the meeting and the programme ran very smoothly.  The accommodation, food, and general facilities provided in the Slovakia Hotel were of a high standard and contributed greatly to the success of
the	conference.<P>

<B>5.	Proceedings</B><BR>
The Proceedings of the Conference will be published as a special issue of the International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos.  The manuscripts are currently being refereed.  It is hoped to send the complete set to the publisher (World Scientific) not later than December 1996, once any necessary amendments have been inserted by the individual authors.<P>

<B>6. Sponsorship</B><BR>
The Conference could not have taken place without the generous sponsorship of the following organisations -<P>

     Russian Foundation of Fundamental Researches ..... $15000<BR>
     German Physical Society with WE-Heraeus Foundation ..... 8000<BR>
     ONR and US Army European Offices .... 7000<BR>
     Saratov commercial companies ..... 4000<P>

<B>7. Conclusion</B><BR>
We conclude that the aims of the conference were amply fulfilled.  The standard of the scientific presentations was high, and there was extensive and fruitful interdisciplinary discussion between scientists and engineers who would not normally have encountered each other.  Discussions continued both during and outside the formal conference sessions, aided by the very pleasant surroundings.  Many participants made new and potentially useful scientific contacts.  The Conference itself and, in due course, its Proceedings promise to be influential in the future development of the subject area.<BR>
We are particularly grateful to the US Office of Naval Research (European Office) and the US Army European Research Office for their timely support which, by helping to support the travel costs of overseas participants, was of crucial importance in ensuring that the Conference was truly international in character.<P>

<B>Organisation</B><P>
In organising this meeting greater use of the internet was made than for previous meetings which we have directed which permitted much more interaction before the meeting by e-mail, and thus helped smooth the organisation.  A web page was set up with a pointer from the Optical Society of America for advertisement and information.  The Jagellonian University organised the meeting room in the old university, which was magnificent, and also arranged the hotel accommodation.  There were 14 key speakers and 27 other participants, all of whom but one observer were allocated speaking time in the programme.  The breakdown of participants by country was as follows:<P>

Canada 1, France 1, Germany 3, Greece 2, Italy 2, Netherlands 1, Portugal 1, UK 6, USA 1 1, Russia 6, Hungary 1, Poland 1, Ukraine 1, Uzbekistan 1, Czech Republic 1, Switzerland 1, Australia 1.<P>

The support of the ONR permitted us to invite additional expert speakers; it has been acknowledged on all the documentation and was very much appreciated.<P>

All participants were housed in the same hotel (the Cracovian) which was of a good standard with helpful staff.  The local arrangements made by the university bureau were faultless.  The help of a Polish post-doct in London before the meeting and a native speaking Polish participant at the were invaluable meeting to avoid language misinterpretations.<P>

Some younger scientists were invited and the atmosphere was conducive to cementing existing links and creating many new ones, which we are sure will endure.  A complete e-mail list has been broadcast and will allow follow ups to take place very conveniently.<P>

Above all, the gratitude of the CP partner participants to be invited was evident and it was clear that this type of personal interaction with their Western colleagues was, for many of them, a high spot of their professional lives.<P>

	<B>Scientific Content.</B><P>
Since their inception more than 25 years ago, photon correlation techniques for the temporal or spectral analysis of fluctuating light fields have found an ever-widening range of applications.  These methods are non-invasive, intrinsically digital in nature and in many experimental situations offer a unique degree of accuracy and sensitivity, most particularly in using a laser probe to study light scattering from pure fluids and macro molecular suspensions, but also to study the flow and turbulence of fluids.<P>

Following the earliest developments in laser scattering by dilute macro molecular suspensions, in which particle sizing was the main aim, significant advances have been made in recent years in many other areas; these were reflected in the topics covered, which included experimental techniques, statistics and data reduction, colloids and aggregation, polymers gels liquid crystals and mixtures, protein solutions, and critical phenomena and dense media.<P>

Other notable recent developments have been in novel areas such as in basic physics experiments on phase transitions in the micro gravity environment provided by the space-shuttle missions, in quantum cryptography and in the application of the technique at x-ray wavelengths.<P>

Experimental techniques are continuously evolving, taking advantage of the miniaturisation and performance improvements provided by solid state lasers, fibre optics and avalanche photodiode detectors.  Powerful new techniques of analysis from the lively field of inverse problems are being applied to data analysis.  Much progress is being made in the study of dense media using index-matching techniques, two-colour systems and the theory of photon diffusion.  Relationships between structural relaxation and viscosity have been discovered in hard-sphere colloids and the effects of small amounts of polydispersity have been shown to have a significant influence on the dynamic structure factor.  The complex process of crystallisation of colloid solutions has been followed through the liquid-solid phase transition and different crystal structures from those which occur on earth appear in zero gravity.<P>

A new bulk relaxation, characteristic of binary polymer blends near the macrophase separation temperature has been found and layer-height fluctuations at the surface has been studied by evanescent wave dynamical light scattering.  A universal function describing the concentration and temperature dependence of the static and dynamic properties of binary separating mixtures has been obtained.<P>

The principles of x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy using synchrotron sources, and the range of its possible applications to problems in condensed matter systems, including complex fluids, glasses and metallic alloys were discussed.  Illustrations included recent studies of Brownian motion in a gold colloid.  Two contributions described micro gravity research on board the space shuttle.  Results were reported from experiments last year on colloidal crystals in which light scattering was used to probe both static structure and particle dynamics, yielding new information on growth dynamics in the absence of gravity.  The Zeno instrument, developed to measure the density fluctuation decay times of a liquid-vapor critical fluid, was also described.  This instrument has operated successfully on two shuttle flights.  Extremely fine temperature control was essential for these experiments, and in practice better than 300 microK stability was achieved over a period of several hours.<P>

NASA's micro gravity technology programs were described and the potential for international collaboration in micro gravity science and in the associated technology and its commercialisation were discussed.  This presentation was highly appropriate to the international character of this meeting.<P>

 <I>Structure and Properties of Linear Inverse Problems<BR>
John B. Abbiss<BR>
Singular Systems, 19451 Sierra Raton Road, Irvine, California 92612, USA</I><P>

We consider fundamental mathematical aspects of linear inverse problems such as those typically encountered in interpreting photon correlation experiments.  The analysis of a linear system in terms of its singular values and singular functions will be discussed, together with the matrix-algebraic dual formulation for the finite-dimensional case of discrete experimental data. Fast computational procedures for the processing of large data sets will also be described.<P>

Polymer micronetwork spheres swollen in a good solvent can be regarded as colloids which require no special stabilisation to avoid aggregation.  Their interactions can be tuned by changing. the degree of internal cross linking.  The phase behaviour and the static structure factor demonstrate that crosslink density of 1:10 (inverse number of monomer units between crosslinks) is sufficient to achieve hard sphere behaviour.  We designed a host-tracer system consisting of core-shell micronetwork spheres (core: polystyrene; shell: poly-t-butylacryate) in a host of refractive index matched poly-t-butvlacrylate micronetwork colloids.  Employing a crosslink density of 1:10 and tuning the polydispersity such that crystallisation is Just avoided we are able to monitor the self-diffusion of a system with hard sphere interactions up to volume fractions close to the colloid 21ass transition by dynamic light scattering.  In addition the long-time self-diffusion was measured with the forced Rayleigh scattering technique.<P>

We compare the measured lone-time self-diffusion coefficients with the predictions of theoretical concepts which differ in their treatment of hydrodynamic interactions.  We find that mode coupling theory, negIecting hydrodynamic interactions, is able to describe our data only very close to 0g. The theory of Medina-Noyola, where hydrodynamic interactions are assumed to directly affect only the short-time dynamics, seems to work only up to moderately high volume fractions.  In contrast, a new approach by Tokuyama and Oppenheim, where hydrodynamic interactions are explicitly treated, is fully consistent with our result7s over the full volume fraction range.<P>

It is well known that the spatial structure of the radiation field in planes orthogonal to the direction of propagation can display phenomena of spontaneous pattern formation and transformation similar to those met in hydrodynamics. or nonlinear chemical reactions.  With respect to these cases, the optical systems present the unique feature of displaying interesting quantum effects.  Even if the number of papers which study spatial aspects of quantum optical phenomena is still limited, recently, there is a growing interest in the analysis of quantum effects in nonlinear optical patterns [1] mainly under conditions of confined propagation.  A different class of transverse phenomena occurs during the free propagation through nonlinear materials. whose geometry is such that the field evolution can be reduced to a "2D" problem.  This can be realised in a waveguide geometry where the field confinement into the transverse dimension is given by the refractive index step of the waveguide.<P>

Under this hypothesis of propagation it is possible to study transverse quantum phenomena in a waveguide made with a third-order or quadratic nonlinear material.  When the propagation in a third-order nonlinear waveguide is studied [2 ], quantum effects in the space domain put into evidence the presence of quantum noise. spatial squeezing and bunching.  In particular it is possible to establish that each of these effects shows a maximum at some frequency in space, each of them related to different propagation regimes. such as diffraction-free propagation or modulational instability.  Similar behaviour has been found in propagation in a quadratic nonlinear waveguide [3] when a second harmonic generation process occurs.  In this case an interesting condition of interaction can be realized between pump and second harmonic: the so-called "cascading" effect.  "Cascading" effect means that the fields during the propagation undergo an intensity-dependent self-phase modulation such as the one occurring in a third-order nonlinear material.  This effect depends on the phase mismatch and on the input intensity values;  this can be realized when there is a low conversion regime.  The problem is the detection of these quantum effects in space.  The spatial squeezing properties can be made evident from an experimental point of view by spatial cross-correlation measurements.  Since the field is squeezed just along some directions (i.e., suitable spatial frequencies) a cross-correlation between two detectors as a function of angular frequencies is able to reveal the phenomenon.<P>

A discussion about the cross-correlation scheme will be presented in detail. and the propagation conditions necessary to obtain transverse quantum phenomena in the space domain be discussed.<P>

This problem can be solved by analysis of correlations between channels, distinguished by energy or type of emission.

We have been using a multi-angle laser light smattering apparatus from Brookhaven Instruments to study the structure of polysaccharide (dextrin) gel fragments.  The macroscopic eel is disrupted going through several cycles in a French press.  Microscopic particles are obtained.  In the end a filtration step removes the largest particles.  Such microscopic fragments are mixed with phospholipids (with or without sterols).  The idea of the manufacturer (Biovector Therapeutics, S.A., France) is to use such polysaccharide/phospholipid systems as Drug Delivery, Systems or vaccine formulations.  However, both goals are greatly dependent on the organisation of the polymers and lipid molecules.  A polysaccharide core surrounded by phospholipid bilayers would be ideal to mimic Low Density Lipoproteins, one of the organisms own natural carriers.  It would also be ideal to incorporate antigenic proteins and create virossomes.<P>

The objective of our work was to determine the size, shape and structure of the gel fragments, with and without added phospholipids.  The influence of charged on the polysaccharide was also addressed.<P>

Distribution analysis using Provencher's CONTIN reveals a monomodal size distribution, moderately polydispersed.  Comparing the static structure factor of the gel fragments to the theoretical expectation for each model geometry, a nearly spherical geometry is concluded.  However, the Rg/Rh ratio does not always agree with the value expected for the rigid sphere.  In fact, under some conditions the experimental Rg/Rh ratio is lower than this value.  A density gradient from the inner core of the fragments to its surface would explain this result.  The particles having these characteristics are refer-red to as micro-eels.  The spherical geometry was further confirmed by scanning electron microscopy.<P>

Charged groups on the polymer structure are essential to keep them from aggregating Scanning electron microscopy images of neural biovectors show large scale aggregation as if the macroscopic gel is being reconstituted by the association of the micro-gels.<P>

The presence of the phospholipid has a major effect on A2, the second viral coefficient, decreasing it.  The molecular organisation of the phospholipids, however, is not accessed by light scattering techniques.  Transmission electron microscopy clearly reveals that the phospholipids are organised in concentric bilayers surrounding a core.  Whether this core is the pure polysaccharide microgel or a mixture of polysaccharide and phospholipid not organised in bilayers is unknown.<P>

We report some of the results of our CDOT (Colloidal Disorder-Order Transition) experiments on the space shuttle Columbia, STS-73.  The samples (0.518m PMMA spheres suspended in an index matching mixture of decalin and tetralin) ranged in concentration from 0.49 to 0.62 volume fraction.  Light scattering was used to probe the static structure and the particle dynamics.  Digital and 35=mm photos provided information on the morphology of the crystals.  The surprises that were encountered in micro-g include the preponderance of RHCP (Random Hexagonal Close Packed) structures and the complete absence of Face Centered Cubic (FCC) structure (until the samples returned to one g),  existence of large dendritic crystals floating in the samples where liquid and solid phases coexist and the rapid crystallization of samples which exist only in glass phase under the influence of one g. We discuss the possible growth dynamics with and without gravity.<P>

Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) has been used in order to investigate the dynamics near the maximum of the static structure factor in diblock copolymers.  Semidilute solutions in good solvent (toluene) of very high molecular weight diblock copolymers poly(styrene-isoprene) were utilized in order to approach this wavector regime with light scattering.  As we increase the concentration, the proximity to the disorder-to-order transition, ODT, influences both the intensity and the dynamics of the internal mode which is the dominant relaxation process.  By increasing the concentration above the critical concentration, fe , for entanglements an extra relaxation process is observed, faster than the internal one but with similar characteristics which can be attributed to the curvilinear Rouse motion of the blocks between entanglements in the reptation tube.<P>

Dynamic depolarized light scattering (DDLS) measurements are performed on aqueous suspensions of monodisperse spherical particles which possess an intrinsic optical anisotropy and are index-matched with the solvent.  The particles are polytetrafluoroethylene polymer colloids with an internal crystalline structure [1].  The correlation function of the depolarized scattered intensity contains information on both the translational and rotational self-diffusion coefficients Ds and Dr. The DDLS measurements are performed in a wide range of volume fractions F, going- from the dilute suspension to the hard-sphere colloidal crystal (0.01 < F < 0.5) [2].  The experimental data show for the first time the effect of hydrodynamic interactions on Dr in a concentrated suspension.  I will also discuss measurements performed in the forward scattering configuration by heterodyninq the depolarized scattered beam with the transmitted beam.  Since the forward scattered field is phase-shifted by 90 degrees with respect to the unscattered beam, in order to do heterodyning one has to insert a quarter-wave plate before the analyzer.<P>

The displacement of the spinodal and cloud-point curve due to the application of a shear flow is discussed.  It is shown that the displacement of the spinodal is related to the distortion of the short-ranged part of the pair-correlation function by the shear flow.  The off-critical part of the spinodal is displaced linearly with the shear rate g, while the critical point is shifted as ge (1/g) where g = 1.23) is the critical exponent for the inverse equilibrium osmotic compressibility.  It is argued that the displacement of the cloud-point curve is related to the distortion of the long-ranged part of the pair-correlation function, and is therefore a much more sensitive function of the shear rate than the location of the spinodal.  The cloud-point curve is displaced far into the unstable region in the phase diagram.  This renders light scattering not suitable to determine the shift of the spinodal. what is measured in a light-scattering experiment is the location of the cloud-point curve, not the spinodal.  A sheared system becomes unstable without being very turbid.<P>

Systems consisting of binary fluid mixtures imbibed in dilute silica gels allow investigation o@ the effect of quenched disorder on critical phenomena.  Small-angIe light scattering studies of these samples reveal evidence of domain growth as shallow quenches are made into what would be the two-phase region of the pure system.  This behaviour is remarkably consistent with that seen in the pure mixture.  However, the sample will eventually clear with no discernible meniscus, this and other evidence indicates that phase separation has not occurred.<P>

Two applications of dynamic Iight scattering from binary polymer blends near to the critical point and end-adsorbed polymers will be presented.  Near the macrophase separation temperature, binary polymer blends exhibit dynamic depolarized light scattering attributed to the formation of transient 3D anisotropic patterns of the Critical order parameter fluctuations.  This new relaxation, which is shown to be a universal characteristic of polymer blends, is accounted for by fluctuation-induced second order scattering.  Polymer chains attached by one end to impenetrable surface at high coverage exemplify a tethered layer of mesoscopic dimensions.  The probing of the layer height fluctuations by evanescence wave dynamic light scattering is reported.  Using a set of terminally attached polystyrene layers it is found that there is a preferred wavelength O(L) for the surface perturbations with a concurrent--slowing down of its thermal decay rate.<P>

The Zeno instrument was designed and developed for flight on the U.S. Space Shuttle to measure the density fluctuation decay times of a liquid-vapor critical fluid using photon correlation spectroscopy.  The instrument was flown and operated successfully on two flights: March 4, 1994 on STS-62 as part of the USNT-2 payload and Feb. 22, 1996 on SiS-75 as part of the USNP-3 payload.  This paper will give an over-view of the experiment principles, discuss the major design challenges, and show some performance data.  Of particular note was the temperature control of better than 3 microK (rms) for hours, which was essential for the effort to make measurements closer than 1 mK to Tc.  Both flights taught us lessons about the difficulty of controlling the local density (at the laser focus) in microgravity.  Correlograms were recorded with a custom interfaced ALV 5000 Correlator.  The fitted decay rates generally gave the desired 1% precision.  We hope to have a preliminary analysis of the data in terms of a reduced variable, the product of the wave vector and the correlation range. In this analysis we are trying to eliminate the uncertainties associated with local density by means of the Orstein-Zemike intensity ratio.<P>

Turbulence can be generated by oscillating a grid in a volume of water.  The turbulent flow thus created has minimal mean shear and mean flow.  We have studied the motion of small floating particles on the surface of such a turbulent fluid, as well as the velocity fluctuation in the volume of the fluid.  For the surface motion, the standard deviation of the velocity difference of a pair of particles separated by a distance R can be fitted by log(R/Ro).  That is in contrast to the volume measurements where the data are fitted by a power law.  Nevertheless, our result is not explainable by present theories.<P>

Several APD photon-counting systems have been studied for linearity of response as a function of light intensity by comparison with a standard photomultiplier photon counter, using a controlled LED light source.  The effectiveness of the APD as a photon detector at high count rates is limited by a non-linear response at mean rates greater than about 100 kcounts/sec.  When subjected to fluxes of photons at these rates, although the output pulse gets back to the baseline pulse very quickly, the APD needs more time to recharge to the same voltage above breakdown, and thus the photon-detection efficiency decreases for this length of time after each detection event.  We will describe measurements of this time-dependent detection efficiency and attempt to quantify the useable range of these devices.<P>

Recently, much attention has been devoted to the problem of quantum states of light.  In this talk first we shall shortly discuss the nonclassical states of an electromagnetic field mode.  Parametric processes can result in squeezed or correlated field modes.<P>

A molecule considering as a vibrating system has lots of similarity to single or multimode light fields.  We will show that different types of nonclassical vibrational states emerge during, laser pulse excited Franck-Condon transitions in molecules.  In the simplest case there-is only one vibrational mode under consideration.  Without vibrational frequency change extremely short pulses result in the usual coherent states for the vibrational wave function, while in the opposite long pulse limit the emerging, vibrational state is the n-phonon number state.  Between these limiting. cases it is close to a squeezed minimal uncertainty state.  In the more general case with frequency change during the electronic transition there is a competition between two effects leading to squeezing, namely the dynamical squeezing and the squeezing- occurring- due to the frequency change.  The vibrational squeezing has been experimentally found recently.<P>

A polyatomic molecule offers a new feature, namely the presence of many vibrational modes establishes the possibility of preparing vibrational correlated states.  A finite exciting pulse results in a phonon anticorrelated vibrational state.  It is shown that in the case of a very short excitation, the change of the geometrical configuration of the vibronic potential surface may also lead to entanglement, in this case to phonon correlation.<P>

Finally we mention an application which may have either theoretical or practical importance.  Using double or appropriately chirped pulses superposition states, which are the vibrational analog of the well known optical Schroedinger cat states, can be created.  Applying. another pulse, from the vibrational Schroedinger cat state one can obtain a superposition of a molecule in different chemical substances.  This chemical cat state can lead us very near to the original paradox of Schroedinger.<P>

Presently, the light scattering (light-beating or photon correlation) spectroscopy is being used to an increasing extent because quasielastic Iight scattering spectroscope, (LSS) is a highly informative technique and noninvasive and nondestructive probe of diffusion in complex fluids.  LSS has been used successfully, to study solutions of different nature, including molecular mixtures of organic liquids and solutions of macromolecules. proteins. polysaccharides, synthetic polymers, colloidal particles and aggregates, micelles, and microemulsions.  Specific interest has been aroused by investigations of bulk or surface static and dynamic scattering 'm the neighbourhood of the consolute critical point (CCP) as well as by, a study of common dependences of transport and equilibrium thermodynamic properties in the region of phase transition.<P>

This report is concerned with two basic directions of recent investigations in the phase-separating, systems by means of LSS:<BR>
(i)	The gain of virtual information provided by simultaneous LSS measurements both of bulk and surface scattering at the same experimental conditions with subsequent properties derivation and by coincidence in the same experimental setup both spectral analyzer and photon correlator (as the speed of a computer is increased);<BR>
(ii)	The development of generalized approach to the description of immiscibility processes and transport and thermodynamic properties in the systems of different physicochemical nature; the data of both static and dynamic scattering- cannot be adequately, interpreted without this knowledge.<P>

A new. quasichemical approach to the symmetrization of the binary coexistence curves (CC) of liquid-liquid equilibria which has been previously developed [1] by us is spread on the systems exhibiting the phenomenon of reentrant phase transition and the phase diagrams with complex topology: a closed loop phase diagram with Upper (TU) and Lower (TL) consolute critical points and two isolated immiscibility gaps when TU < TL.  The thermodynamic theory of the symmetric regular mixing with corrections adequately describing- nonclassical features of fluid mixtures close to critical conditions is applied for the quantitative representation of the solubility. phase diagrams with complex topology.  It is shown that for any number of CCP a temperature dependence of molar excess Gibbs energy are universally, expressed via a suitable distance from the critical point and that the shape variations of CC and simultaneous transitions over a double critical point (DCP) or a critical double point (CDP) are controlled by the only, parameter.  In the frame of the thermodynamic theory, the proper choice of field variable is justified.  A scaling theory of the systems with several CCP is formulated.  Hereby,, universal critical exponents. as a DCP or CDP is approached. coincide with their 3-D Ising values near single critical point.  The results are illustrated by. the literary liquid-liquid equilibria data.<P>

On the basis of the presented results and our earlier findings [2] an universal general-purpose function describing the temperature and concentration dependence of the dynamic and static properties of binary, phase-separating mixtures is obtained.  It is shown that data on the mutual diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity interfacial tension. and susceptibility of different origin binary systems, even with complex topology. of phase diagrams. can be described in a simple and generally-applicable manner.<P>

The experimental data on the diffusion coefficient are determined from the beat spectra of the bulk scattering radiation using, heterodyne detection.  Information on susceptibility is obtained from the measurements of the relative scattering intensity [2d].  For the determination of the liquid-liquid interfacial tension and shear viscosity,, the technique of surface fluctuating spectroscopy, is applied.  The spectral composition of light scattered by surface waves is investigated using an optical heterodyne spectrometer with diffraction grid [2c].  In the report a scheme of the light-scattering spectrometer for simultaneous (or, at least. at the same experimental conditions) measurements of bulk and surface scattering is discussed in detail.  Some aspects of the optimal parameters choice are considered for the light-scattering spectrometer with high beating efficiency.  The measurements of diffusion coefficients, susceptibility, surface tension and viscosity are performed in the single-phase region in the range 0.0001<(Tc-T)/Tc<0.2 and 0.0001<(x-xc)/xc<0.25 along lines of constant concentrations. and in the two-phase region along CC.<P>

By means of obtained expressions for the universal scaling functions the dynamic and static properties of binary, phase-separating systems are presented in 3D-space: temperature-composition-property.  Critical exponents and amplitudes of the properties are studied.  An universality of critical amplitudes relations is shown.  A dissymmetry of properties in the coexistence phases is discussed.  The component mobility is derived from the data.<P>

The determination of critical concentration, at which liquid local structure formation occurs. is an experimental proof of dynamically stable and energetically preferred molecular aggregates existence.  Our further investigation is an experimental study of a spatial and temporal supramolecular self-assembly, in the area of phase transformations and near transition from a molecular solution to a solution of aggregates.  In both cases the application of LSS is Justified.<P>

The relaxation of density fluctuations in charge-stabilized colloidal suspensions is characterized by the dynamic structure factor S(k,t), which can be measured by dynamic light scattering.  In concentrated suspensions S(k-,t) decays non-exponentially, due to memory effects.  A suitable measure of the overall decay of S(k,t) is the reduced memory function ((k), which can be determined experimentally from the time-integral of S(k,t) and the first cumulant.  Formally exact results for ((k) can be obtained from the many-body Smoluchowski equation, but for its evaluation one has to introduce approximations.  Earlier calculations of ((k), based on a particular form of the mode-coupling approximation, were found to be in disagreement with experimental results.  In particular, it was predicted for monodisperse suspensions that ((k(O)=0, whereas experimental data extrapolate to finite values of ((0).  By extending the previous theory to polydisperse suspensions it will be shown that small amounts of polydispersity give rise to finite values of the non-exponentiality factor (M(O), of the measured dynamic structure factor SM(k,t).  These effects arise from incoherent one-particle contributions to SM(k,t) in the polydisperse case, which dominate SM(k,t) for strongly correlated suspensions in the lone-wavelength limit.<P>

A number of problems contained in physics of dispersed systems can be successfully resolved with the help of light scattering experiments.  The investigation of the Rayleigh spectral component structure of light scattering permits a study of structural transformations occurring in various colloidal systems. It should be noted that the appearance and development of the dynamic light scattering method has advanced essentially, experimental researches in physics of dispersed systems providing answers to many problems concerning the building-up processes. long-duration storage and change of the colloidal dispersion under the action of various factors.<P>

Of great interest is the problem of stability of hydrophobic dispersed systems placed in varying external conditions.  The large interface of these systems leads to the creation of significant free energy- that is. in turn. the reason of their instability,.  A tendency. to reduce a value of free energy causes reduction of a separateness degree of these systems. In practice. however. many hydrophobic colloids conserve their stability- for a long time.  It occurs, with the only exception of hydrophobic interactions. due to forces preventing the process of phase division.  These forces are determined by the Coulomb interactions and sometimes they appear to be of nonelectrostatic nature.  For hydrophobic colloids with a surface-bound charge the stability is explained by the DLVO theory,  The theory, takes into account counteracting forces connected with the availability of double electrical layers, on one hand. and the Van der Waals attractive forces of similar bodies. on the other.<P>

The colloidal hydrophobic dispersions can be retain in a steady state for a long time or convert to a biphase state within a few minutes.  A measure of stability, of such systems is the speed of coagulation which varies in a wide range.  Therefore, a comprehensive discussion of stability of dispersions should be paralleled by considerations on the kinetics of coagulation process.  The course of coagulation in time depends on two factors.. thermal diffusion of colloidal particles and their interactions on collision.  If there is a strong power repulsive barrier between particles, they, will move apart every time after collision.  If no repulsive barrier exists and only attractive forces operate. every collision of colloidal particles result in their tight coupling.  In this case the speed of the coagulation will be determined only by the Brownian movement of particles.  M. Smoluchovsky termed such type of coagulation as "fast coagulation" and formulated many of its laws.<P>

The process of fast coagulation is important as an appendix of the Brownian movement.  However, a process of slow coagulation is more informative.  As differentiated from fast coagulation. in the slow process colloidal particles conserve a repulsive barrier and its value exceeds but insignificantly the energy of particle thermal movement.  It means that not every collision of particles result in their coagulation.  To describe a difference between slow and fast coagulation M.Smoluchovsky introduced the factor of slowing down the process, the course of slow coagulation being similar to that of the fast one.  Unfortunately a theory connecting a factor of slowing down with real physical values (size of aggregates. potential of a double layer, concentration of electrolyte, etc.) still remains to be elaborated.<P>

In the light of this problem the experimental studies have been undertaken to check the theoretical conclusions and to improve some laws of the process.  For investigating the coagulation of dispersed system optical methods based on measurements or transmitted light were used for a long time.  The measurement of colloid turbidity enabled one to obtain ,.various characteristics of coagulation process.  None the less it resulted in improper interpretation of the dynamics of colloidal coagulation.  Thus, the analysis of turbidity. changes in polymer latexes under the coagulation by electrolyte solutions led to the conclusion about existence of an induction period when the process of aggregation stops and then starts again.  Such conclusion is explained by the fact that turbidity changes failed to describe accurately, changes in the structure of coagulable latexes. since the turbidity was found to depend on the size of scatterers in a very, complicated manner, particularly. for polydispersed samples.<P>

The given problem is attacked by using a method which is capable of providing direct information on the size changes of aggregates in the course of the process.  The dynamic light scattering method is most suitable for this purpose.  The method shows high accuracy, and sensitivity, to scatterers of large sizes.  Therefore, it may be used for investigating the dynamics of colloidal aggregation.  In this work the coagulation processes of polymer colloids consisting of charged particles were investigated by the dynamic light scattering method.  Colloidal stability, under changes of the charge and characteristics of the environment was studied.  The correlator "Coulter N4" (Coultronics) was used.  Of particular importance is the stage of processing of values measured when the dynamic light scattering method is applied and there is a necessity to solve an inverse problem leading to the solution of the Fredholm equation.  The complexity of the resolution is that one is not able to obtain a steady solution of a similar problem.  To provide the reliable information the algorithm of processing of experimental data was developed.<P>

The current study of latex coagulation made it possible to determine the dependence of the process speed on electrolyte concentration. to calculate the values of threshold electrolyte concentration and to establish the coagulation limiting speed.  Relations between the coagulation process and the size and concentration of interacting latex particles were established.  We carried out all the necessary machine accounts which enabled us to obtain a reasonable description of the processes and to establish relationships between aggregate sizes and the initial size and concentration of latex particles.<P>

The interpretation of the dynamics of polymer colloid coagulation has changed because of the results obtained.  Even recently the first stage of coagulation was believed to proceed rather intensively.  The process however stops as time passes.  This stop is followed by an induction period when aggregates in the system are not formed.  Our investigation performed with the use of the turbidity and dynamic light scattering methods shows clearly that the process of latex electrolyte coagulation lacks induction period.  This period was a consequence of incorrect processing of the experimental data.<P>

The Smolouchovsky theory suggests that the threshold concentration of electrolyte does not depend on the concentration of interacting particles and the coagulation speed should be dependent on this value.  This dependence is true for the low particle concentration and it is broken at high concentrations.  The research made enables us to speculate about the dependence of the threshold concentration on the number of particles in a unit of volume of the testing sample.  At a high concentration of particles the process is described by the avalanche type coagulation.<P>

We studied the process of the latex electrolyte coagulation under the gradual decrease of a latex particle charge.  The surface-bound charge of latex particles was changed upon addition of complexing salts.  The results of computer simulations together with the experimental data obtained enable us to conclude that the interaction polystyrene latex particles occurs through a complex mechanism.  At the beginning of the process the charge of latex particles is decreased as the result of neutralization of the charge.  However, the final aggregation of particles occurs with the aid of a routine concentration mechanism.  The kind of interactions of latex particles depends on the structure of their surface.  Finally, the results obtained suggest that a particle of the polystyrene latex is a formation similar to a sea-urchin with quills of varying length.<P>

The traditional use of the photon correlation technique deals with measurements of the temporal autocorrelation function of scattered light in conditions of single scattering, when a scattering medium remains transparent for light and its optical thickness is far less than unity.  In the opposite limit of high optical thickness values two limit cases can be considered: 1) very high absorption (oil) and 2) very low absorption (milk).  The second case of a turbid medium with high optical thickness and low absorption corresponds to high multiplicity of scattering.  It is the subject matter of this report.  This field of research is well known now as "diffusing-wave spectroscopy" thanks to the papers of the group of American authors (Professors D.J. Pine and D.A. Weltz are the leaders).  Here we are going to review mainly the investigations of our group of researchers from St.-Petersburg. We are developing, a partly different approach to the problem.  Our papers are not represented in recent reviews but they may be interesting to those specialists who deal with the photon correlation technique.  Of course, in our attempt to draw a complete picture, we cannot avoid a brief talk about publications of other authors.<P>

Crystallization of suspensions of near micrometer sized hard (polymer) particles is sufficiently slow that light scattering studies can be made of the particle dynamics of the metastable fluid.  In addition, crystallization can be studied by following the growth of one (or more) Bragg reflections.  Here we attempt to relate measurements of nucleation and growth of colloidal crystals to the motion of single particles in the metastable fluid, obtained from measurement of the incoherent intermediate scattering functions.<P>

 	
<I>Laser Light Scattering  Instrumentation for Space Flight Hardware and its
Evolution into a New and Simple Single Color Cross-Correlation Technique for
Suppressing Multiple Scattering<BR>

Light scattering is a common laboratory tool used to measure particle diffusion coefficients, crystal structure, etc.  Our Advanced Technology Development (ATD) program in laser light scattering at NASA has miniaturized and successfully flown such an instrument as a space shuttle glovebox experiment and later extended the abilities of these optical modules by adapting, them for use over a much wider range of concentrations.<P>

The first portion of this presentation will discuss the miniaturization of laser light scattering instrumentation for use in a space shuttle glovebox experiment.  This glovebox instrument uses semiconductor lasers, self-aligning, fiber optics, a new Generation of avalanche photodiodes. compact correlator cards, and more.  An experiment (CDOT) using this hardware was successfully flown in October-November 1995 aboard the space shuttle STS-73 (USML-2), and it returned a number of pleasant scientific surprises which will be discussed in another presentation by Chaikin and Zhu.<P>

Combining the above optical building blocks with a goniometer in a novel way leads to the second portion of this presentation which will outline a new solution to the old problem of multiple scattering.  We have recently designed and tested a simple and novel single color cross-correlation technique which addresses these concerns.  By cross-correlating two adjacent viewing positions placed perpendicular to the scattering plane, we have been able to distinguish singly and multiply scattered light.  Singly scattered light comes from a well focused and defined laser beam (even in multiply scattering, solutions) and because of this strictly scattered light has a tall speckle which cross-correlates (while multiple scattered light does not exhibit such speckle).  Work in our laboratory and subsequent work in Ackerson's laboratory (using, a clever enhancement of the original technique) has shown this new method to be effective in extracting particle size information (using singly scattered light) using dynamic light scattering on both dilute and concentrated solutions<P>

The precision static light scattering study of pretransitional phenomena in the isotropic phase of many thermotropic liquid crystals was carried out.  It was studied a few gomological series of liquid crystals and their mixtures with variable nematic range as well as a sample with direct isotropic-smectic transition.  Experimental results are in satisfactory quantitative consent with theoretical model that describes singularities of pretransitional isotropic-nematic behaviour due to the interaction between nematic and smectic ordering.<P>

The height and temperature dependences of the total scattered light intensity and Rayleigh line width for a binary mixture of iso-oil acid and heavy water were studied near the critical consolution point by means of static and dynamic light scattering.  The temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient along the critical isohore and coexisting curve and the field dependence of the diffusion coefficient as a function of height were studied.  The correlation length temperature dependence along the critical isohore, the coexisting curve, and the field dependence along the critical isotherm were analyzed using Ferrel's formula derived in the framework of the Kawasaki coupling, mode theory.<P>

 <I>New Ideas in Data Inversion<BR>
E R Pike<BR>
King's College, Strand, London WC2R 2LS, UK</I><P>

The data inversion problem in photon correlation spectroscopy, and in particular the calculation of the particle-size distribution for a dilute solution of polydisperse scatterers, is well known to be difficult due to its ill-conditioned nature.  This is compounded by the fact that the second-order correlation function (of intensity fluctuations) is measured while the inversion needs to be carried out on the first-order correlations (of scattered-field amplitude).  Stimulated by some recent work of Dhadwal and Ross, we have revisited the problem yet again and present some new reduction procedures which bear further detailed investigation.<P>

By direct imaging of scattered light, we observe shear-induced gelation in extremely dilute solutions of wormlike micelles.  This gelation is followed by a fracture of the gel which produces extremely elastic gel bands with recoverable strains of up to 5000%. The gelation and fracture account for the unusual shear-thickening-, and elastic properties of these solutions.<P>

Recent studies by dynamic light scattering of suspensions of hard-sphere colloids at high concentrations will be described.

<I>Photon Correlation of Correlated Photons: Experimental Aspects of Quantum
Cryptography Computation<BR>
J. G. Rarity<BR>
Defence Research Agency, St. Andrew's Road, Malvern, Worcs WR14 3PS, UK</I><P>

We review the experiments on correlation and coincidence detection of entangled photon pairs produced in parametric downconversion.  Such experiments have led us to propose novel secure key sharing schemes using single 'photons' and interference effects to encode information.  Progress towards practical schemes for quantum cryptography will be discussed.  Eventually we would like to perform arbitrary computations exploiting the wave-particle duality inherent in quantum mechanics.  The experimental nightmares involved in realising this theorist's dream will be illustrated by recent experiments showing interference effects between initially separate single photons.<P>
 
<I>From Speckles to Modes: Principles and Applications of Fiber Optic Dynamic Light
Scattering<BR>
J. Ricka<BR>
Institute of Applied Physics, University of Bern
Sidlerstrasse 5, Bern CH-3012, Switzerland</I><P>

The instrumentation of Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) is undergoing a small revolution: the classical pair of pinholes, whose role is to select a single speckle, is being replaced by single-mode fibers that select a single mode.  This improves the performance of the apparatus substantially, but the improvement is also accompanied by a sad loss: the visible (and beautiful) boiling speckle pattern is replaced by the seemingly abstract notion of receiver mode.  In my lecture I will introduce the principles of mode-selective optical receivers, discuss the relation of modes with speckles and show that it is worthwhile to accept this slight change of the point of view.  The gain is a considerable simplification of the instrumentation as well as of the theoretical reasoning . This enables the researcher to tackle more easily difficult experimental problems such as the in vivo DLS in human eye vitreous or the motion of colloidal particles in opaque porous media.<P>

Our group is mainly involved in research studies based upon the relation between macromolecular features and functional properties of starch or starchy products.  Starch is a mixture of two polysaccharides: amylose, the essentially linear component, and amylopectin, the other more branched component.  Light scattering techniques have been used to find these macromolecular features.  In particular, static and dynamic light scattering techniques and coupling between size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle-laser-light-scattering (SEC-MALLS) have been applied.<P>

A review of the results obtained by these techniques will be presented:<P>

<LI>the hydrodynamic behaviour in different aqueous solvents of amylose;
<LI>the molecular weight distribution of amylose;
<LI>the possibility to characterize the degree of branching by SEC-MALLS.

Kinetics and interaction of anisotropy fluctuations with adiabatic fluctuations of density are investigated using light scattering spectroscopy methods in liquids with strongly anisotropic molecules.  It is shown for nematics and supercooled salol that physical background of interaction of sound with anisotropy fluctuations is in agreement with conclusions of the coupled modes theory.  Besides non-elastic scattering on anisotropy fluctuations is investigated in blue phases of cholesteric liquid crystal.<P>

 <I>Applying Photon Correlation Spectroscopy in Space<BR>
Anthony E. Smart<BR>
2857 Europa Drive, Costa Mesa, California 92626, USA</I><P>

Recent opportunities to explore condensed matter physics by performing light scattering experiments in the microgravity environment of low earth orbit demand new instrumentation.  To provide sufficient compactness, reliability and generality to obtain useful scientific information from an instrument packaged for operation in space, even in the space shuttle or the proposed space station, consideration must be devoted to areas less critical when systems are attended in the laboratory.  To generate enough enthusiasm to be flown, the system must have a target performance at least as good or better than that possible on Earth.  Mandatory additional properties are robustness, small physical size, low weight and power consumption, with retention of alignments and provision of a well controlled environment for the experiment itself Some assurances are obtained by careful design and extensive testing.  It is some of the necessary design and testing criteria that are the subject of this talk.  Three specific areas are introduced.  The first addresses optical design to provide the versatility for several experiments without unacceptable compromise.  The second addresses the establishment of performance limits for the instrument so that unexpected observations attributable to new physics and requiring new insights may be discriminated from artifacts of the instrumentation or measurement process which may be readily dismissed.  The third discusses the risk analysis that permits finite resources to be applied most effectively to give 'graceful degradation' so that potential defects do not compromise the entire mission.<P>
 
<I>Dynamic Light Scattering from Block Copolymer Liquids<BR>

Dynamic properties of solutions and melts of diblock copolymers were investigated using dynamic light scattering.  In all the cases, the measured correlation functions exhibited several relaxation processes which could be, in the majority of cases, separated and isolated using a nonlinear Lapace transformation.  For solutions, up to four dynamic processes were detected, depending on the molecular weight and concentration of the polymer.  Besides the expected internal mode and cooperation diffusion mode two other processes were identified, one corresponding, to diffusion of large clusters, of which the origin is not yet well established, and the other one corresponding to the newly predicted heterogeneity diffusion, related to self diffusion of individual block copolymer chains.  In the case of block copolymer melts up to four modes were also found.  The fastest. and slowest processes correspond again to internal relaxation of the chains and to cluster diffusion.  Of the two intermediate modes the slower one has been shown to correspond to the heterogeneity mode, by comparison with forced Rayleigh scattering experiments which detect only self-diffusion.  The origin of the faster intermediate mode is still debated at the present time.<P>
 
<I>Angular Dependence in Dynamic and Static Light Scattering for Branched
Polymers<BR>

The mechanism of random branching is connected with the development of extremely broad size distributions.  This polydispersity has a strong influence on the angular dependence of both the static and dynamic structure factors.  It is therefore useful to study the dynamic behaviour in close connection with the static properties.  The static structure factor shows fractal behaviour which, in agreement with predictions, is highly influenced by the large polydispersity.  In dynamic light-scattering the first cumulant G exhibits asymptotically a power law G~qe2.8 instead of F~qe3.  Furthermore, lower absolute values for Gho /qe3 kBT are observed than theoretically predicted.  The question is discussed whether polydispersity or loss of internal mobility is the reason for this observation.<P>

In semidilute solution a slow motion appears, which gains influence as the concentration is increased.  Analysis of the slow motion in terms of diffusion coefficients indicates a critical slowing, down.  The simultaneously appearing low angle excess scattering gave evidence for cluster formation.  The large size of the clusters allows studying the hydrodynamics with these clusters.<P>

Internal modes of motions in macromolecules can be observed by dynamic light scattering when the region of qRg is at least larger than 1, and asymptotic behaviour is expected for qRg > 4. This condition implies objects with Rg > 150 nm when visible light is applied.<P>

Measurements with linear and high molecular weight PS and PI at infinite dilution confirm essentially the theoretical predictions by de Gennes and Dubois-Violette for chains with hydrodynamic interactions.  In particular a qe3-dependence of Gho /kT is found with a prefactor G* = 0.05-0.06 and 0.045 for good and Q-solvents respectively.  For branched and micellar materials considerably lower G* are found which tentatively are interpreted as a loss of internal mobility.<P>

In semidilute solutions this G* value exhibits a further decrease with concentration which, however, depends on the segment concentration and not on the extent of coil interpenetration.  The effect can be interpreted as either a further inhibition of mobility or by a screening of hydrodynamic interaction.  The latter is supported by the observation with an amylopectin (branched polysaccharide) where a change in the Akcasu shape function from Zimm to Rouse behaviour occurred as the concentration was increased.  Hydrodynamic screening was first observed with linear PDMS in the concentrated solution region by spin-echo neutron scattering.  The question arises whether the determined screening length xscr is identical to the hydrodynamical length xh..<P>
 
<I>Measurement of Viscoelasticity of Complex Fluids with Diffusing-Wave Spectroscopy<BR>

Dynamic light scattering can be used to measure the viscosity of a fluid by determining the diffusion coefficient of a particle of a known diameter.  In addition, it has been used to measure the fluctuations of a gel network, which can provide some information about the elastic modulus of the gel.  Here, we extend these applications to measure the full frequency dependent viscoelastic moduli of several different complex fluids.  The samples all scatter light very strongly, making it imperative to use diffusing-wave spectroscopy.  This also allows materials with a much higher elastic contribution to be studied.  This talk will review the general method, and will include a more detailed discussion of the application of this method to the study of the viscoelasticity of hard spheres near the colloidal glass transition.<P>

 <I>Photon Correlation Spectroscopy of Opaque Fluids<BR>
I.K.Yudin and G.L.Nikolaenko</I><P>

Nowadays the Photon Correlation Spectroscopy (PCS) is a routine experimental method to study various light transparent disperse systems.  Nevertheless, for a number of PCS applications there is a problem of a correct result interpretation arising, because of the following reasons, namely: interaction of polydisperse particles, crossover of a chaotic Brownian motion and macroscopic flow, multiple scattering, complex refractive index of the particles and/or the solvent, etc.  Moreover, some objects may require a novel experimental approach.  In particular, it is necessary to solve both technique and
interpretation problems for opaque liquid systems.  The disperse analysis of such systems
is necessary in various fields: oil recovery and refining, used motor oil testing,, dye and paint production, quality control of wines and beverages, and so on.  The following experimental approaches for investigation of opaque systems had been mostly taken, namely: optical schemes with light fibers, special thin sample cells and back-scattering geometry(180 degree).  We tested these methods and found them to be quite complex in application and requiring some essential modifications of the setup.  We proposed a simple suitable geometry that does not require a setup modification and utilises a standard rectangular sample cell [1].  It is placed at the angIe of 45 with respect to the incident laser beam.  The optical axis of the photodetecting system is normal to the front plane of the sample cell.  The scattered light is collected from the region of the laser beam entry to the sample.  The X-Y positioner allows one to change the position of the scattering volume in accordance with the opacity of the sample and other experimental conditions.  The laser beam was attenuated by optical neutral class to avoid the thermal lens effect.  A number of testing measurements using the model opaque liquid systems verified an adequacy of this experimental approach.  Dispersions of light absorbing particles (aniline dye) in transparent liquid as well as non absorbing particles of polystyrene latex in absorbing solvent (water-based ink) have been tested.<P>
 
<I>Light Scattering in Strong Opalescence Systems<BR>
L.A.Zubkov and V.P.Romanov</I><P>

The critical opalescence phenomenon in the vicinity of the liquid-liquid critical point has been studied.  The information on the critical parameters is contained in single-scattered light in most simple form.  However, in the immediate vicinity of the critical point a noticeable role comes to be played by multiple scattering, which is impossible to be excluded completely from the total light scattering intensity.  That is why certain techniques have been devised.  It allows separation of the scattering of different multiples to obtain the pure single-scattered light.  It appears that certain additional measurements are necessary in a specific geometry of the experiment.<P><HR><P>

Organisers Summary, December 1996.</H3>

A workshop on Alternative Camera Technology (ALCATECH) was held at
Sjaellands Odde in Denmark during July 20-27, 1996, sponsored by ONR/ONREUR
and Danish Research Council, and most generously hosted by Ruzena Bajcsy
and Sherman Frankel at their farm at Sjaellands Odde.<P>

The aim was to gather 20-30 experts within vision research in order to
discuss alternatives of image capturing electronic and optic devices, and
how specific tasks within applied informatics might benefit from such
devices in terms of augmented or enhanced 3D scene analysis capabilities,
or in terms of lower cost or less computational power requiring equipment. <P>

<B>1    Motivation for the workshop.</B><P>

Within information technology vision has been studied for decades, perhaps
without the feedback to industrial applications as originally expected nor
with a full insight into the capabilities of visual exploration of a scene.
Common to most efforts has been the study and use of ordinary cameras, as
found commercially available, and within scientific analysis and paradigm
building in computational vision the pinhole model has predominantly been
used, very much in the same spirit as the Camera Obscura. <P>

This workshop ALCATECH, whose acronym stands for Alternative Camera
Technology, is aimed at discussing a series of alternatives to the cameras
used hitherto. Inspiration will be taken not only in breaking existing
technical dogmas, but also from animal life, where so many special purpose
eyes (cameras), retinas (sensor chips) and visual tools (optic accessories)
are found.  Alternative camera design should also be discussed, lending
inspiration from the somewhat forgotten techniques of integral photography,
invented around the turn of century. We believe these techniques could be
combined with modern sensor technology and eventually supplemented with non
traditional optic accessories, purposively tailored to a range of visual
tasks in order to accelerate a breakthrough in automatic visual inspection
and in digital camera technology.<P>

Until now the major push to the development of visual sensors has come,
apart from niche markets, from the consumer market of portable video
recorders (the handy-cam). The huge number of products sold, as well as the
explosion of new market segments, based on the same technological
requirements (such as the multimedia application area), already established
the world leaders as well as the trends for future developments. Among
them: increased spatial resolution, better colour reproduction, faster
electronic shutter, built in stabilisation criteria to remove shaking.
Recently low-cost cameras equipped with pan-tilt devices became available
for video conferencing and personal communication.<P>

The research in this area has proceeded along mostly independent directions
to the development of new technology. Lenses with standard mounts, chips
with uniform (often standardised) sampling structures, camera with standard
video outputs, processing devices based on rectangular images are just
examples of the major trends in this development. These standardised
devices, although fundamentally important in the field of  image
transmission and processing, do in fact limit the variety of feasible
engineering solutions to solve specific tasks. A key objective of ALCATECH
is to study innovative solutions investigating all different technologies
involved in the design of visual devices. <P>

There are no standardised eyes in the animal world. On the contrary,
different species have surprisingly different vision and stage an
astonishingly wide variety of eye constructions. Underlying all this
variation, is the fact that eyes - in a hand-in-glove fashion - are
extremely well adapted to the common tasks a biological creature is
involved in, as well as to its environment. Cameras, or more generally
optomechanic systems, must also be tailored to fit the task, as well as its
operational environment. Nature needs many kind of eyes, and analogously,
there is a need for many kinds of cameras. For a given application or
problem domain, a specially tailored optic system, photo sensor design or
electronic hardware may convert a hard visual task to an easy, or at least,
tractable, problem.<P>

An existing example of this approach is linear cameras, which, far from
being useful for image transmission in a telematics sense, are, on the
other hand very nice engineering solutions for a wide range of visual
inspection applications. Another existing example are the various proposals
for mirror optical arrangements, which provide for single camera stereo
solutions. We believe the full virtues of such techniques has not yet been
fully utilised and important possibilities for calculation advantages have
been overlooked in purposively tailored visual inspection applications. A
final example is the very recent, yet sparse and premature interest, coming
from pattern recognition communities in carrying lenticular sheet
techniques to the domain of digital cameras, again for the purpose of
visual inspection.<P>

A much wider set of  existing devices where the purposive balance of
optical, retina and processors design have produced a wide range of
efficient engineering solutions is found in biological 'visual devices'.
For example, the efficient control of flight performed by bees is achieved
not only by the 'visual algorithm' alone (i.e. the equivalent of
computational programs of artificial visual systems) but by the efficient
match of optics, photoreceptors and neurons. In some sense the entire
visual device is a sort of virtual processor where even the laws of light
propagation are exploited, implicitly, by the optical media which
constitutes each single ommatidia of the compound eye.  Even a very rough
and qualitative evaluation of the functionalities of the visual system of
the bee is sufficient to understand what can be obtained with this
'integrated' approach. A bee is a flying device which lands on surfaces,
navigates in an unconstrained, cluttered environment, it can fly kilometres
from the hive and still come back, its colour perception is more
sophisticated than that of humans. It is outside the scope of this document
to expand more on this topic (even if we restrict our attention to the
optical parts, the variety and efficiency of biological solutions is too
wide to be included here) but it is worth stressing the fact that the
technology used by nature is, at the least in principle, not far from what
is currently available. What has been lacking is an integrated purposive
exploitation of available technology.<P>

The goal of ALCATECH is to use available technological processes (mainly
optics, solid state technology and algorithmic processing) to design and
implement engineering solutions to specific (yet relevant) visual-based
tasks.<P>

Whereas the application areas, listed above are goals of ALCATECH in an
industrial sense, the fundamental scientific approach may be seen as a
prolongation of studies of ecological optics, taking inspiration both from
human and animal vision and from integral photography,  not necessarily
mimicking any such system in detail, but always extending beyond the pin
hole based and standard video camera based approach, predominantly studied
over the last decades without the ultimate success for neither scientific
insight into visual processes nor industrial applications of computational
vision as strived for. Our general objectives are to abandon a strive for a
general vision system, capable of handling any visual measurement task, and
instead provide purposively tailored cameras, based on the needs of the
task at hand and on the psychophysics and information technological
insights into the problem at hand - for the benefit of both sciences,
industry and consumers, let it be within health care,  defence,
communication, public service or private household with each their
purposively designed system for a specific task at hand.<P>


<B>2    Objectives and expectations.</B><P>

We intend to analyse and experimentally validate how specific visual tasks
may benefit from purposively chosen cameras. This may also lay down the
foundation of a new industry for special-purpose digital camera technology
and for new paradigms within computational vision. In particular, we will
investigate the advantages obtainable by blending the different
technologies: optics, optical accessories, solid-state sensors,
opto-mechanics and algorithms, to implement special-purpose cameras
addressing useful visual tasks. An important example of such blending is
the implementation of smart compound eye  cameras, a topic we will focus
our discussion around.<P>

Compound eyes in nature have excellent performance in terms of yielding
shape- motion and depth- information, for a variety of quite complicated
tasks. By 'compound eyes' we refer to cameras consisting of multiple ocular
systems, be it of multiple cameras or of miniature lenses (insect-like
compound eyes), or, multiple-stage compound eyes as used in the nowadays
almost forgotten branch of 'Integral Photography Technology', abbreviated
IPT in what follows, or compound eyes, composed of non traditional optics
and accessories, blending properties of fovea based vision with peripheral
based vision or blending single lens eyes with multiple lens eye systems.
All compound eyes (with the above definition) are a priori judged to have
the property of one-eye stereo vision capabilities and high modularity, and
some have excellent peripheral vision. Furthermore they may very well prove
to be easy to calibrate, compared to a traditional stereo camera set up,
and also less expensive. <P>

The a priori expected strategic importance of ALCATECH, as seen from a
European point of view, comes from the observation that, even in the case
of standard imaging devices, major industrial companies are already
established (most of them unfortunately outside Europe). The market of
specialised visual devices and of digital camera technology outside the
consumer video market is just starting to  develop. The competition is
going to be, of course, very strong. However, due to significant
investments that the EU has devoted in the past to 'Computer Vision' (for
example the ESPRIT INSIGHT, the ESPRIT VAP and the ESPRIT VIVA projects,
previously granted) Europe has built up substantial human capital in the
form of leading-edge knowledge in the field. Also in the fabrication of
special purpose cameras Europe can claim some interesting recent results.
For example the IMPUTER technology, developed in the UK and the
space-variant CCD sensor and the  CMOS cameras developed at IMEC in Belgium
testify that the technology is indeed available. Often it is said, that
these technological processes are of lower quality than Japanese
technologies. This may be true if we evaluate performance in terms of
'consumer products' (such as the handycam industry) where Japan has
invested a lot in the past. On the other hand, the field that we intend to
explore will rely more on the blend between different technologies than on
the performance of a single one and, as such, we believe, that technology
available in Europe now is largely sufficient to prove the feasibility of
our approach and to stimulate the development of the new technologies in
fields which are still open to industrial applications.<P>

<B>3    Scientific Background.</B><P>

As mentioned we are interested in compound eye cameras because they in
addition to excellent peripheral vision, which is of utmost importance for
mobile systems, also support built-in stereo vision and high modularity.
The latter property implies that we can aim beyond the present state of art
in flat and uniform CCD based sensors. We should like to stress, that even
if some components used in the cameras are not entirely new, it is quite
possible, that purposively chosen combinations of such components
constitute a compound eye camera with unusual properties, that have not
been exploited for a specific  application.<P>

A compound eye may consist of a large number of very simple integrated
cameras (a silicon compound eye). The main issues involved are
technological (is it technologically feasible?) as well as algorithmic (is
it useful?). The ALCATECH project will undertake simulations of sensors in
the computation of dynamic visual measures (optical flow, normal flow, sign
of flow in certain directions, motion detection, see [1] - [5] for
definitions). Each micro camera may be supposed to be composed of just a
few photosites, processing a very limited field of view, 1 or 2 degrees, or
they may be coarser placed with a larger number of photosites and a larger
field of view. The parameters that will be studied within a given task will
be:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the optimum number of photosites
<LI>connections between photosites (simulated by local processing)
<LI>overlapping between neighbouring visual fields (for stereo capabilities)
<LI>connections between neighbouring micro cameras.
</UL>

In ALCATECH the arrangement of sensors, as already discussed in some detail
in [1] is revisited, not only for central vision, but also for peripheral
vision. Recently the study of the human peripheral visual field has taken a
more systematic form, and unexpected results have been noted in combining
central vision with peripheral vision during [6]. Since peripheral vision
is part of our engineering effort, we should like to take support in some
psychophysic facts and basic experiments here, for the sake of shedding
light on ecological optics and for the sake of a solid foundation of good
reverse engineering of alternative compound eye cameras. One such example
is [3], pointing out, how motion fields at the visual horizon play a
simple, yet predictive powerful role in motion and scene determination.
Within navigation applications it has become obvious that it is extremely
difficult to perform reliable control unless a wide field of view is
available for the processing or an internal model is generated to
compensate for this. At the same time it has become apparent that many
phenomena such as collision, qualitative distance and axis of rotation may
be computed directly provided high resolution information is available. In
this effort it will be investigated how algorithms may be simplified
through purposive design of sensors, that provide both a wide field of view
and a high resolution at specific regions in the field of view. The main
objective here is to provide a sensory system, that enables direct
computations rather than internal storage for generation of extensive
internal environmental models.<P>
  
The history of camera technology is fascinating, see [7] for a novices
introduction. One interesting part is called integral photography. In 1903
H. E. Ives suggested the 'parallax barrier' and in 1928 the 'lenticular
sheets' for capturing spatial information of a scene onto an image plane by
means of normal light, see [8] for historical and technical details. M. G.
Lippmann and A. P. Solokov generalised the scheme into 'fly eyes lens
sheets' in 1908 and in 1911. Such techniques have been known as parallax
panoramagrams or integral photographic techniques. Applications for
optically reconstructing the scenes have emerged over the decades, yet
sparsely, see [8] for an overview. A recent application is provided by
Adelson [9], who suggest the technique applied for solving the depth from
stereo problem within computational vision. As pointed out unanimously by
Ives, Lippmann, Sokolov and Adelson, these techniques possess considerable
power in capturing the 3D structure of a spatial scene, compared with
traditional camera techniques, but also force some tradeoffs between
luminance, resolution, optic quality and production ease.<P>

We intend to revisit these integral photographic techniques (IPT) and
purposively combine them with the traditional CCD sensor, in the sense that
traditional high resolution sensor fields take care of the central visual
field, while IPT sensors are used towards the peripheral visual field. Such
sensors may be seen as further developments of the log-polar sensors, who
have already proved their value for navigation purposes and central view
applications, see [4]. With such compound arrangements we hope to overcome
classic ambiguity problems in various structure from motion paradigms. The
IPT at the outer part give just like the log-polar sensors (and human
vision) less resolution, but may due to their 3D imaging capabilities (see
[8] and [9]) allow a processor (algorithm or hardware) to determine
egomotion through the scene (perhaps in some analogy with human vision,
where peripheral cues are believed to be important for motion analysis).
Detailed issues of a geometric nature may then be addressed in the central
visual field, where CCD images allow higher resolution data and
reconstruction processors (algorithms) are relieved from some ambiguity
problems. Egomotion is known from the peripheral vision, and 3D absolute
structure calculation of static scenes is then possible in a single camera
setup. This benefit should not be underestimated.<P>

In general we believe such compound IPT-CCD sensors are an open window for
overcoming several limitations due to the CCD sensors and the pin hole
camera models used hitherto. Available optics have not been fully utilised
in applied information technology. Our IPT-CCD based sensors allow for a
breakthrough, we honestly believe.<P>

A special kind of compound eyes could involve stereo pairs of cameras of
shift optics type with lenticular sheets in left and right cameras in front
of noncentral parts of left and right CCD arrays (i.e. combined IPT-CCD).
Here optomechanics in the sense of non-rigid cameras with shiftable lenses
for focus of attention purposes may be combined with irregular sensor
layout, where the physical behaviour of light is exploited for attaining
extra one-eye stereo capabilities, independently of epipolar lines, as well
as instantaneous data smoothing in the periphery. In [10] micro movements
of sensors have been suggested, and in the ALCATECH project various
possibilities of optomechanics  in a compound eye camera will be addressed.<P>

<B>4    Major Workshop Events.</B><P>

The scientific part of the workshop contained ten sessions, seven of which
were scheduled  and three left for improvisations. In addition to this was
several free time slots and cultural occasions for further discussions.
Finally the attendants were housed in groups in summer huts, surrounding
the workshop site, which proved to be both an economic and very stimulating
disposal for inter session discussions. Whenever the wording 'the workshop
suggests' or similar  is used below, it  reflects suggestions motivated by
session discussions. Whenever the wording 'will work on this' is used, it
indicates an actual outcome of new cooperation contacts established during
the workshop. Major themes discussed on the workshop are cited very shortly
below in order of workshop chronology. For further insight into the issues,
consult the home pages of the researchers involved, and also the two
adjacent workshop summaries.<P>

<B>Chip design and algorithms </B><BR>
Design criteria, as induced by todays television industry, and
alternatively as induced by biology was addressed. Vladimir Brajovic,
Michiel de Bakker and Peter Jurgensen addressed electronic sensor design in
the former sense, pointing out numerous alternatives. One very interesting
possibility is read out of histograms in the grey level domain. This is
both easy to implement in hardware and algorithmic interesting per se,
since the workshop suggest histograms may very well be used for classic
tasks in existing motion detection schemes as determination of optic flow,
time to contact etc. CMU and DIKU will work on this possibility. Gerald
Sommer, Kostas Daniilidis and Jens von Berg presented biological inspired
sensor design and processing paradigms. Not least the log polar chip design
possibilities has been and will be coworked upon by Kiel, AUC, DIKU (and
DIST, represented by Giulio Sandini in absentia).<P>

<B>Integral Photography.</B><BR>
As advocated in former sections the somewhat forgotten technique of
integral photography seems to possess 3D measuring capabilities, not
present in any image sensor design today, nor present in the chip design
working groups mentioned above. Fredrik Bergholm and Jens Arnspang
revisited integral photography, invented as a pure photographic technique
around the turn of the century and suggested its incorporation in
computational vision schemes. Especially a composite sensor with the outer
parts being of an integral photography sensor type and the central fovea
part of a flat sensor type, let it be traditional or log polar based, seems
attractive for modelling the human retinal capabilities, where early motion
detection is performed by peripheral vision, and shape and fine details are
then analysed in the central vision part. Such a sensor is a priori judged
by the workshop to have descaling properties, in the sense that depth is
inherently measured in direct ways on the sensor and hence decoupled from
the optic flow patterns, leaving these for pure motion analysis tasks. DIKU
and KTH is actively coworking on these issues.<P>

<B>Mirror Cameras.</B><BR>
Alternatives to traditional stereo camera set ups were presented in terms
of mirrors and reflecting water arrangements by Henning Nielsen, John
Immerkar, Knud Henriksen and Jens Arnspang. A central theme is, that
mirrors may replace additional cameras in the sense, that several images
may be obtained by mirror reflections from virtually different, yet very
well defined viewpoints. Three properties are inherent to such techniques:
First, while stereo cameras need both internal and external calibration,
mirror cameras only need internal calibration of one set of parameters.
Secondly, since several reflections may be obtained of the object in
question, classic scene reconstruction tasks are often overdetermined, and
as for the integral photography technique, motion and depth determination
is likely to be descaled. Thirdly, the outer parts of the viewfield are
more densely covered with 3D determination possibilities (due to denser
spacing of multiple reflection zones) than the central zone. In this sense
integral photography and mirror cameras seem to possess similar properties,
yet mirror cameras are deemed by the workshop to be much easier and cheeper
to build. DIKU, AUC and OU are active in this research.<P>

<B>Wide Angle Opticsand Zoom Optics.</B><BR>
In high cost photographic very wide angle lenses, considered to be of prime
quality, the imaging capabilities are often deliberately engineered as a
modification of a true perspectively imaging lens. Although lens and camera
may in any view direction be locally modelled as a pin hole camera, this
may globally over the entire viewfield not be an adequate model for these
wide angle lenses in question. However, mainstreams of research in computer
and robot vision use the simpler pin hole camera model in both theoretic
discussions and in image data experimentation with any angle optics.
Margaret Fleck most convincingly advocated the nature of wide angle imaging
properties and clearly demonstrated the need for further modelling of non
pin hole imaging models. Likewise, zoom optics call for more elaborate
models than pin hole cameras, and calibration of such lenses are both
difficult and cumbersome. Reyes Enciso clearly demonstrated the complex
nature of zoom lenses and the need for modelling it carefully. The workshop
agreed that both wide angles and zoom optics, as available in todays
industry are often needed in a computational vision applications, but
apparently not sufficiently understood in its 3D imaging properties. Non
pin hole models should be studied. IOWA, UPENN and DIKU are active in this
research.<P>

<B>Special Composite Optics.</B><BR>
Pure perspective lenses posses undesired imaging capabilities towards the
'horizon of the viewfield', as argued above for wide angle lenses, and for
this reason they are deliberately redesigned, yet without loosing the
photographic impression of 'ordinary perspective'. Once embarking on the
realm of this freedom of non perspective lens design, optic systems may
very well be designed, that posses both peripheral and central view (as
biological eyes and mirror cameras), have limited optic flow vectors in any
part of the viewfield (which is not the case for ordinary fish eye lenses)
and have a continous mapping of the 3D world (without abrupt changes as
found in multi zone lenses). Yasuo Kunioshi challenged and persuaded the
workshop in profound ways with his demos, lectures and points of view,
concerning design of special optic systems. <P>

<B>Vision Projects.</B><BR>
Laboratory reports were delivered from Hlavac Vaclav, Thomas Pajdla, Gerald
Sommer and Erik Granum and indirectly from Yiannis Aloimonos and Stelios
Orphanoudakis in absentia. Among topics not already mentioned above, the
concept of virtual photography was illuminated by Vaclav and Pajdla. It
seems an increasingly studied task how to create images from viewpoints,
where a camera was never placed or with a different illumination on objects
than was ever used. Such techniques tend to provide images as the end
product rather than 3D measures or actions from images, as found in most
other computational vision paradigms. The workshop recognises this virtual
camera technique as a new challenge for vision research.<P>

<B>5    Conclusions.</B><P>

The workshop both strengthened some a priori expectations among the
attendants and shed considerable new light onto several aspects of their
research. After an intensive week of productive discussions the workshop
conclusions may in short be phrased as follows:<P>

<UL>
<LI>The perspective pin hole camera model is adequate for many applications, yet neither sufficient for modelling biological vision systems nor  desirable as a stand alone tool in computational vision. Several alternative camera models are needed.
<LI>Several new suggestions on special optics, mirror arrangements and sensor arrangements have been proposed and seem a priori worthwhile pursuing further, both from a pure scientific point of view and an application oriented assessment. Alternative Camera Technology is needed.
<LI>Neither research nor industry should strive for producing 'general vision systems', but in stead focus their efforts on purposively designed camera systems for the task at hand. Several existing paradigms may be rephrased into simpler ones and hitherto unsolved problems may become feasible to handle.
<LI>This workshop should be followed by others. Stelios Orphanoudakis has offered to coorganize a second meeting on Crete. Stelios Orphanoudakis and Jens Arnspang will be in touch, concerning timing and program.
<LI>Proposals for Alternative Camera Technology projects should be submitted to financial sources in Europe, USA and Japan, preferably in parallel and mutually referring to the intercontinental interest in Alternative Camera Technology. Ruzena Bajcsy has the US initiative,  Yasuo Kunioshi has the Japanese initiative and Jens Arnspang has the European initiative.

The First ALCATECH Workshop on Alternative Camera Technology was
unanimously deemed a success among the attendants and the official
reviewer.<P>

<B>6    Acknowledgements.</B><P>

The workshop was sponsored by Danish Council of Research within Science of
Nature, SNF, and by US Office of Naval Research, ONR/ONREUR. We have been
so fortunate to have had officer Bruce Barnes from ONR among us at the
workshop, not only as an official reviewer, but indeed also as a highly
estimated commentator and sincerely interested colleague. Our site host was
professor Ruzena Bajcsy, GRASP laboratory at UPENN, and Professor Sherman
Frankel, who most generously offered their farm at Sjaellands Odde as
location for the event. We owe Ruzena a debt of gratitude for this, for
providing atmosphere to the event and  not least for lending positive
energy and deep insight to the discussion of matters. Ruzena never failed
to keep us to the cutting edge of the issues in competent and kind ways. I
do not hesitate to thank Henrik Christensen, AUC/KTH and Knud Henriksen,
DIKU who skillfully assisted me in setting up the event. Neither do
I hesitate to highlight the effort made by Niels Olsen, Jeanette
Kvaerndrup, Dagny Arnspang, Anders and Sebastian, concerning logistic
issues before, during and after the workshop.<P>

The meeting was in my humble opinion a success, not least due to the good
people, attending it. Beyond doubt nor evaluation everyone was actively
contributing with sincere interest and open minded discussion,
characterised by total absence of 'Elbows and Ego Domain Defence (EEDD)',
as very often found at major conferences, and instead characterised by 
presence of 'Common Curiosity of Root Revisiting (CCRR)'. Allow me as
organiser and participant to feel lucky about this attitude on the event,
which is an encouragement for pursuing the goals of ALCATECH further, for
the sake of both science and industry.<P>

<P>
Julie A. Christodoulou is serving as an Associate Director for Materials Science and 
Technology at the Office of Naval Research Europe, London, England, conducting a 
part-time effort focused on high temperature structural metallics.  Microstructural 
characterization, understanding of the mechanisms of mechanical behavior and the 
correlation of microstructure with material properties are among her research 
interests for metallic materials including Ni-based superalloys, other high 
temperature-capable metal alloys, intermetallics and composites of these.<P>

Ms. Christodoulou received a Bachelor of Science with Honors in Metallurgical 
Engineering from the University of Texas at El Paso in 1988, completing a thesis 
evaluating the thermodynamics of occluded cell corrosion of aluminum. While 
pursuing part-time studies toward her M.S., Ms Christodoulou worked first with 
Martin Marietta Laboratories in Baltimore, Maryland (1988-1992) as a materials 
engineer investigating microstructure and property relationships in the development 
of discontinuously reinforced metal- and intermetallic-matrix-composites. In 1992 
Ms. Christodoulou joined the Failure Analysis and Environmental Effects Section 
within the Materials Division of the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, in Washington, 
D.C.  During her three year tenure, she conducted failure analyses and provided 
technical support to the Naval Systems Commands, primarily to the Naval Air 
Systems Command.  She received her Master of Science in Materials Science and 
Engineering from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland in 1995;  her 
research involved characterization of passive film formation on iron-chromium alloys 
using scanning tunneling microscopy. <P> 

In June 1995, Ms. Christodoulou began full-time studies toward a doctorate degree in 
Materials Science at Imperial College of  Science, Technology and Medicine, London.  
Her current research focuses on understanding the mechanism of complex boride 
formation and the influence of  the borides on microstructure development, and 
hence on mechanical properties, in intermetallic matrix composites based on 
titanium aluminides alloyed with transition metal elements.<P>

In London, she is accompanied by her husband, Dr. Leo Christodoulou.  Dr. 
Christodoulou is a co-inventor and the developer of the XD Process for forming in-
situ reinforced metal matrix composites and optimizing their properties.  He is 
currently a Lecturer in the Department of Materials at Imperial College.<HR><BR>

S&T news from Bonn<P>

8-Sep-95</H3>			

<B>Content:</B>

<OL>
<LI>High-speed science network approved
<LI>Three new Max Planck Institutes in Potsdam
<LI>New MPIs in Eastern Germany approved
</OL>

<B>Abstract</B><P>

The following are short articles related to physics and electronics which 
appeared in German news media last month (Aug 1995). It focuses on R&D 
infrastructure within the Federal Republic of Germany.<P>

<B>1. High-speed science network approved</B><P>

Chancellor Helmut Kohl's newly created technology council recommends building a 155 megabit/sec high-speed multimedia network, linking universities and research institutes in Germany.  The Ministries for Education, Science, Research and Technology (BMBF) and Post and Telecommunication (BMPT) support this initiative which aims at catching up with U.S. Communication Systems.<P>

The current German 2 megabit/sec science network, operated by Deutsches Forschungsnetz (DFN), is too slow for multimedia applications and is approaching its capacity limits.  BMPT will grant DFN a license to operate its own network, and BMBF will provide dm 80 million (usd 55 million) for a three-year start-up phase.  It is expected that dfn will purchase rights to use high-speed links outside of monopolist deutsche telekom's realm. Ongoing liberalization in the German telecommunication market is making better and cheaper networks available on a case-by-case basis.  In 1998, when Deutsche Telekom's telecommunication monopoly ends, operators will be in a position to use lines from different providers, including glass fibre links of the electric utilities, Deutsche Bahn or Telekom.<P>

In a first step, a wide-band 34 megabit/sec network will be operational early in 1996.<P>

<B>2. Three new Max Planck Institutes in Potsdam</B><P>

Three new Max-Planck-Institutes (MPI) for basic research opened in Potsdam near Berlin in recent months.  The scientific staff is now scattered over several locations in the greater Berlin area, but in 1998 all three institutes will move into new quarters on the campus of Potsdam University.<P>

The MPI for colloid and interface research will focus on nanometer and micrometer-size colloid particles, which have unique properties due to their high surface/volume ratio.  Researchers will use experiments, computer simulation and theory to better understand and design colloid systems.  The institute currently employs a staff of 147, including 51 scientists.  Many of the scientists came from three institutes of the former East German Academy of Sciences.

The MPI for molecular plant physiology wants to close a gap in Germany's basic research:  while genetic research is well advanced, plant physiology and biochemistry have significant deficits.  Molecular-level plant physiology is seen as a new approach to solve plant physiology problems.  The institute currently employs a staff of 40, including 6 scientists.<P>

The MPI for gravitation physics will focus on:
<UL>
<LI>observation-oriented gravitation theory; in cooperation with the garching MPI for quantum optics, which is building a gravitation wave antenna in lower saxony
<LI>quantum theory and gravitation; a division which will focus on a unified theory combining both basic theories.
</UL>

The Institute is still in a pioneer stage and expects to employ 18 staff scientists.<P>

<B>3. New MPIs in Eastern Germany approved</B><P>

The senate, the main body of the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (MPG) for basic research, has approved two new institutes to be founded in Eastern Germany.<P>

A MPI for mathematics will be founded in Leipzig, the second MPI in this saxon city.<P>

A MPI for chemical physics of solid materials will be founded in Dresden, complementing the strong materials science community there.  Initial focus will be on the synthesis and analysis of intermetallic phases consisting of transition metals, rare earth metals and elements of the third or fourth group of the periodic system.<P>

The MPG is spending dm 217 million (usd 150 million) on its existing nine institutes in the new laender in 1995, dm 54 million (usd 37 million) more than 1994.  Its total 1995 budget is about dm 1,700 million (usd 1,172 million).<P>

and dates may change.  FURTHER INFORMATION ON A PARTICULAR
MEETING MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE CONTACT PERSON NAMED BELOW.
E-mail addresses have been supplied where known.<P>

     Participation or tuition fees are not required from
participants; some participants from NATO countries or
Cooperation Partner countries (the Commonwealth of Independent
States and countries of Central and Eastern Europe) may obtain
grants from the contact directors to assist with travel and
living expenses.<P>

     ADVANCED STUDY INSTITUTES (ASIs) are high-level tutorial
courses of two weeks' duration where a subject is treated in
depth by lecturers of international standing.  Presentations
are made to about 100 scientists or research students already
specialised in the field, or who have an advanced general
scientific background.  Attendance at ASIs is open to all
suitably-qualified applicants irrespective of nationality,
UPON APPLICATION TO THE CONTACT PERSON LISTED.<P>

     ADVANCED RESEARCH WORKSHOPS (ARWs) are working meetings
of about four days' duration, where scientists and engineers
researching at the frontiers of a subject are able to engage
in an intense but informal exchange of views, aiming at a
critical assessment of existing knowledge and identification
of directions for future action.  Attendance at ARWs is mainly
by invitation, but a few places are available for particularly
well-qualified scientists of all nationalities UPON
APPLICATION TO THE CONTACT PERSON LISTED.<P>

<B>2.  ESPRIT funded revolutionary new storage media</B><P>

The contents of a hard disk drive in your pocket?  That's the promise of a
new storage method that is set to revolutionize the way people think about
data storage and transfer.  The Multimedia Cartridge Drive (MCD), set to go
into production this month, combines the high speed access and storage
capacity of the familiar hard disk drive with the portability of floppy
disks.  The MCD system will allow the user to carry around up to 680 MBytes
of data on a single 3.5" diskette.<P>

Dr. Nigel Mackintosh is a disk drive consultant coordinating the ESPRIT
funded MagDrive consortium developing the technology:  "The drive was
developed with multimedia applications in mind.  Full motion video and
digital sound take up huge amounts of memory and even 1 GB can be filled up
very quickly.  Existing methods were not providing the performance that
multimedia developers needed.  Floppy disks don't have the storage capacity
and magneto-optical drives are too slow."<P>

Mackintosh was approached by French company Nomai, a manufacturer of 
magnetic
cartridges, to find partners and obtain funding for the research.  Two UK
companies were brought into the consortium, Myrica, a disk drive 
manufacturer
and Acorn Computer Ltd.  Acorn, which developed a multimedia application to
demonstrate the drive, has extensive experience of European funded research
projects.<P>

Two versions of the drive have been developed.  To enable the drive to go
into production as soon as possible, the first version, with a capacity of
540 MB, is based on a development of the inductive thin-film recording heads 
found in standard hard drives.  The later 680 MB capacity drive will use a
more advanced recording technology known as Magneto-Resistive (MR) heads.
The MCD is also one of the first applications of a technology known as
Partial Response Maximum Likelihood (PRML) data channels, a digitally based
data reading technique that greatly increases the data storage density.<P>

The research program involved finding solutions to several problems posed by 
the combination of a removable cartridge and a technology intended to read
and write to a fixed disk.  These included the possibility of misalignment
between written and read back data when the cartridge is moved from one 
drive to another, the increased risk of exposure of the sensitive heads and disks
to contaminants such as dust, and the difficulty of lifting recording heads
onto and away from the disk without damaging the highly sensitive read/write 
elements.<P>

     "The high storage capacity of the cartridge will make it the only 
system capable of copying a complete CD-ROM, allowing the user to run the wealth of CD-ROM 
software at hard disk drive speeds," Mackintosh explained.<P>

     "Users will be able to copy their entire collection of software and 
data files from their computer's hard disk and take it with them.  When they sit down at a 
new computer somewhere else and load the diskette it will be like using their own  system".<P>

The consortium will sell the MCD drives, which are being produced by Xyratex,
through retailers as add-on devices, and estimates first year sales at 100,000
 drives and 300,000 cartridges.<P>

The drives are expected to sell for $350-$399, with cartridge prices  expected
to be $59.<P>

     "The add-on market for removable storage media devices is US$1.7 
billion. We are sure that the MCD will capture a significant part of that."<P>

<B>2. Final report</B><P>

I am in the process of completing a final report entitled "ASSESSMENT OF 
EUROPEAN ELECTRONICS".  It is a distillation of my many reports, assessments 
of the European Electronics S&T environment by country, some useful 
information on the EU S&T programs, contacts, etc.  If you wish to have a 
copy of this report, please request it through Mr. Fred Johnson whose 
address is given above. The report will be available by mail or e-mail in 
any format you desire.<P>

<B>3. Some parting thoughts</B><P>

I have several points that I would like to summarize in this last 
newsletter.<P>

A main objective in my coming to ONREUR London was to assess emerging 
science and technology (S&T) in electronics, and to serve as a bridge 
between leading European scientists and the Navy' s and DoD's scientific 
staff concerned with electronics; the results of my many visits to European 
laboratories in this regard are summarized in respective newsletters and 
reports.  It should be stressed, however, that the viewpoints expressed in 
these assessments do reflect the biases of my own background in electronics, 
and represent the view of a specialist toward a broad field.<P>

During my three years in London, I concentrated on analysis, comparative 
studies, and assessments of various electronics and electro-optic projects 
in Europe, directing special attention to the emerging S&T of 
nanoelectronics, solid state microelectronics, microwave integrated 
circuits, new analytical tools for measuring fast electronic components, 
novel electronic materials, and "bedrock" systems (such as information 
technology and communications).  My aim was to acquaint myself with a broad 
sample of the "European S&T scene", as well as to acquire in-depth knowledge 
about S&T issues in countries (such as Germany) offeirng a wealth of new 
ideas and approaches that could be useful in planning our own DoD's 
electronics S&T.  I am happy to say that some of my "alerts" have been taken 
to heart and resulted in new S&T initiatives in our own laboratories - for 
example:<P>

<UL>
<LI>The use of proximal probes, e.g., the near-field scanning tunneling 
microscope and scanning force microscope to test high frequency monolithic 
microwave and millimeter wave integrated circuits (MMICs) (developed at the 
University of Duisburg, Germany); and,
<LI>Using computer aided design tools to help develop our own high 
frequency co-planar MMICs (developed at the Fraunhofer Institute, Germany)
</UL>

Utilizing the ONREUR Visiting Scientist Program and ONREUR-supported special 
workshops, I was able to establish an ongoing rapport with scientists and 
researchers in the European community that has, in turn, spawned other 
trans-Atlantic cooperative programs and personnel exchanges.<P>

During my tenure, I had the opportunity to visit the Former Soviet Union 
(FSU) and many of the former Warsaw Pact countries. These visits offered the 
chance to make numerous useful contacts in Russia and Ukraine and to 
establish formal cooperative programs in various electronic R&D areas of 
strategic importance to the DoD. Among these:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Technology transfer,  bulk crystal growth skills/expertise of various semiconductor materials, e.g., cubic SiC and GaN;
<LI>Funding of a Russian-US S&T cooperative program to develop a novel vacuum microwave amplifier with extremely high self-protection (for use in radar and communication systems);
<LI>Procurement of special electronic material such as InSb, GaSb, SiC, nano-scale diamond, etc., for assessment and evaluation;
<LI>Opportunities for cooperation in developing specially-designed vacuum microwave hardware (such as klystrons) possessing high dynamic range, low voltage, and high power attributes; and,
<LI>Facilitating  a US-Russian cooperative program in diamond doping.
</UL>

Many of these initiatives have involved not only the Navy, but  Army and Air Force S&T communities as well.<P>

<B>4. Recommendations</B><P>

I feel that we need to go out of our way to promote interactions with our 
European colleagues in the field of electronics.  There are many talented 
scientists and engineers in Europe doing R&D in unique ways.  They generate 
a host of new ideas that could benefit our own S&T community.  The central 
challenge is to identify these "golden nuggets" and to take timely action. 
 To achieve this,  we need to have knowledgeable people close to the source. 
Though this is not always possible, especially with shrinking R&D budgets in 
the US, the recent trend to staff ONREUR with scientists and technologists 
from organizations such as NSF, ARPA, and industry is a step in the right 
direction.  However, much still needs to be done:<P>

<UL>
<LI>We  need to pay much more attention to S&T developments in France.  The French have unique and elegant ways of solving S&T problems; they like to create and follow their own path. Unlike most Western countries, they are not hampered by budgetary cuts;
<LI>In spite of the social and economic burden of unification, Germany is and will continue to be a major contributor to European S&T.  They are well organized, creative, and well-respected within the world's R&D community.  They are leaders in developing "environmentally conscious" technologies 
that not only have positive impact on the environment, but also create new 
outlets for German high technology products;

<LI>The FSU still offers a "window of opportunity" for technology transfer; but, we have to be much more organized in dealing with their S&T community.  We must also become more selective and demanding in the S&T programs that we do fund, entailing a better and more accurate assessment of their S&T capabilities;
<LI>The European Commission offers a wealth of information on EC funded S&T programs in Europe.  These programs are well-structured and  -coordinated, do promote close collaboration among the various laboratories within Europe, and - of particular note - serve as a vehicle to insert new technologies into the market arena.  The EC plays a major role in promoting information and communication related R&D; it considers information technology and communication as a key economic driver in the 21th century.</UL>

<B>5. Acknowledgment</B><P>

<H3>NSF/Europe Report No. 83 - - July 1996<P>

Science in Estonia<P></H3>

This report is based on a visit to Estonia from 12 to 16 June 1996 by Dr. Norbert M. Bikales, Head of the Europe Office of the National Science Foundation. This visit was one of several to the Baltic States. The reader is also referred to NSF/Europe Report No. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/nsf82.htm">82</A> dealing with a general description of science in the three Baltic States, and Reports Nos. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/nsf84.htm">84</A> and <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/nsf85.htm">85</A> which describe more specifically science in Latvia and Lithuania, respectively. For further information or comments, please contact the NSF/Europe Office at the above address or at <A HREF="mailto:nbikales@nsf.gov">nbikales@nsf.gov</A> by e-mail.<P>

<B>General Background</B><P>

Estonia, with a land area slightly larger than Denmark's, is situated on the Baltic Sea a mere 80 km from Finland. Its population of ca. 1.5 million has a strong Russian minority (ca. 30%). The Estonian language is not of Indo-European origin, but is close to Finnish. Sweden, Germany, and Russia have also influenced the country's history. The two cities contributing the most to the country's scientific and intellectual life are Tallinn, the capital, and Tartu.<P>

Estonia achieved a measure of autonomy from the Soviet Union in November 1988 and was granted full independence on 19 August 1991. Vast economic changes then swept the country, including privatization of businesses accompanied by the closing of factories, high inflation, and even bank failures. The gross domestic product (GDP) fell sharply for several years, but it has recently stabilized and even begun to climb slowly as the country is adjusting to its new circumstances. In June 1992, the <I>Estonian kroon</I> (pegged at exactly 8.00 EEK to the German mark, or ca. 12.3 to the U.S. dollar) became the national currency.<P>

Estonian science has undergone profound changes as a result of independence, the principal one being the wresting of control of the research institutes from the Academy of Sciences. These institutes now operate independently under the general oversight of the Ministry of Education. Another change has been a lessening of the sharp boundaries between the research institutes and the institutions of higher learning. A still further innovation has been the institution of a system of peer-reviewed grants administered by the Estonian Science Foundation.<P>

Since 1993, the main decision-making body for R&D policy has been the Estonian Research and Development Council, chaired by the Prime Minister. Its members include six ministers, the rectors of the universities, the President of the Estonian Academy of Sciences, the Chairmen of the Estonian Science Foundation and the Innovation Fund, and some representatives from the private sector. An indication of the importance attached to science in Estonia is the fact that the Prime Minister regularly attends the monthly meetings of the Council.<P>

<B>Education in Estonia</B><P>

The Ministry of Education has 6 universities as well as 22 of the 50 Estonian research institutes directly under its supervision. In addition, it provides accreditation to 13 private institutions of higher education. The Ministry also has responsibility for 9 years of compul-sory primary education, 3 years of secondary education, and 3-4 years of vocational edu-cation, which includes the payment of teachers' salaries from its budget. The Minister of Education, Pro Jaak Aaviksoo who is a 42-year-old physicist, was previously the Prorector of the University of Tartu.<P>

<B>Science Budget</B><P>

Estonia is estimated to have about a thousand scientists, the vast majority of whom are paid through the national budget. In 1995, Estonia spent 166.9 million EEK [ca. $13.6 million] on research, which was 1.90% of the national budget but only 0.37% of the GDP. Although spending was 35.8% higher than in 1994, the increase is largely compensated by inflation (which was about 27% during the period May 1995-May 1996). The national goal is to increase the percentage of the GDP devoted to R & D to 1% by the end of this decade. Of ie 220 million EEK (200 million from the science budget and 20 million from other sources) available for science in 1996, about 22% is destined for support of the infrastructure and flows directly from the Ministry of Education to the various (former Academy) institutes; so-called "goal financing'' receives 48%, which by law the Estonian Science Foundation (ESF) has the responsibility to distribute; 27% is for grants and 3% for other scientific activities. Goal financing is primarily for basic research (60%), but applied research and development receive 30% and 10%, respectively. The former Academy institutes spent 121.7 million EEK in 1995, of which 34.4 million EEK came from grants and contracts.<P>

Salaries of researchers are somewhat higher in Estonia than in the other Baltic States, namely about $400-500 per month for a professor and ca. $300 for a PhD-level researcher. Retired scientists receive a pension of about half their previous salary.<P>

<B>Estonian Science Foundation</B><P>

The Estonian Science Foundation (ESF) was established to be the main mechanism for funding scientific research. Its small staff recently moved into part of the building belonging to the Estonian Academy of Sciences. The ESF, directed by Dr. Helle Martinson, is under the general supervision of its Council which consists of representatives of universities, the Ministry of Education, and the heads of ESF commissions. One of ESF's key people, Dr. Toivo Raim, was an intern at NSF in 1994 to learn about American practices.<P>

In 1996, the ESF received 1341 (695) proposals, made 850 (477) grants amounting to 58.3 (18.0) million EEK (the numbers in parentheses refer to the corresponding data in 1993). A significant shift in operations is occurring this year: although previously the ESF made primarily one-year grants because of the various uncertainties, 68% of the grants awarded this year will be for multiple (up to 4) years.

The ESF grants were distributed as follows in 1995: natural sciences, 36% (exact sciences, 14.3%; chemistry and molecular biology, 10.3%; geo- and biosciences, 11.4%); engineering, 16.7%; medical sciences, 16.5%; agricultural sciences, 11.4%; social sciences, 9.8%; and humanities, 9.6%.<P>

The ESF uses 8 disciplinary commissions, each consisting of 10-15 persons, to carry out the review of proposals. Commission members are working scientists, not administrators, who are designated to represent institutes. The head of each commission is elected for a three-year period by its members and confirmed by the Chairman of the ESF Council. Beginning this year, all proposals have to be in Estonian and English so that foreign reviewers can be used; in fact, some proposals that cannot be reviewed in Estonia are sent to Scandinavian research councils who carry out the review by their own procedures. Once proposals are selected by the commissions for funding, the ESF Council must ratify the decision.<P>

<B>Innovation Fund.</B> The Innovation Fund was created to promote industrial innovation by making loans. Its budget in 1995 was about 12 million EEK, of which 7.7 million EEK came from the Ministry of Economics and the remainder represented repaid loans. There exists also an Informatics Fund, under the State Chancery, to develop suitable national policies and to support research in this critical area.<P>

<B>Estonian Academy of Sciences</B><P>

The Estonian Academy of Sciences consists of some 60 members. Its President, Prof. Juri Engelbrecht, is a 57-year-old specialist in mechanics and cybernetics. The Academy receives from the government about 7 million EEK for its operation. Two Americans were elected last year as foreign members: Profs. Jaan Laane of Texas A&M University and Endrik Nozes of Washington University.<P>

Since 1995, the Act on Science Organization specifies that the Estonian Academy of Sciences be transformed into an honorary body charged with providing advice on initiation, organization, and coordination of scientific research. Thus, it no longer controls research institutes, which were transferred as of January 1996 to the Ministry of Education - with the exception of the Estonian Marine Institute which is now dependent on the Ministry of the Environment. Most research scientists in Estonia, about 730, work in the institutes formerly directed by the Academy of Sciences.<P>

The position of the Ministry of Education, like that of the Swedish experts who have examined this question, is that most of the former Academy institutes, which are now autonomous, should be associated with universities. This is not likely to happen in the near future because of opposition to this plan from several quarters, one reason being that the institutes are too large to be absorbed. However, there seems to be agreement that at least some of the former Academy institutes should be returned to Academy control. These include those addressing uniquely national concerns, such as the Institute of Estonian Language and the Estonian Literature Museum, among others. The fate of institutes dealing with natural sciences and engineering is much more controversial and, although no final decision has been made, it seems unlikely that the Academy will again occupy the central role it occupied in the Soviet era. Neither Estonia, nor the other Baltic States, can afford a dual system of basic scientific research.<P>

<B>Evaluation of Research</B><P>

In 1991-1992, shortly after independence, Estonian science underwent a thorough evaluation by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Swedish Natural Science Research Council, which convened panels in six fields. It was agreed that the review should not take account of past and present difficulties, but present an assessment of the true strengths and weaknesses of each research group, i.e., Swedish criteria of excellence should be used in the evaluation. The very detailed report makes a number of important recommendations including gradual integration of Academy institutes into universities, greater efforts to reduce the high average age of researchers, simplification of research structures, and "a strong push for instant internationalization of the research - using international cooperative projects as
the main motor."<P>

In 1994-1995, the Estonian Research and Development Council carried out a further, internal, evaluation of research institutions, a process that will now recur on a regular seven-year cycle. Universities and other educational institutions of higher learning are also being evaluated periodically.<P>

Another measure of quality is the fate of proposals submitted to the International Science Foundation. Estonia prides itself on having the highest per-capita success rate for this highly competitive, Soros-funded activity: 39.4 per million of population, vs. 19.6 for the next most successful nation, Russia. [Latvia and Lithuania had 11.9 and 11.1, respectively.]<P>

<B>Role of the European Commission</B><P>

Since Estonia is now an associate member of the European Union, it is eligible to participate in European Commission (EC) programs. Several scientists have joined groups working on Framework and other Community programs, which have the clear advantages of providing stable, long-term funding (as stated above, ESF funding was until recently only on an annual basis) and permitting integration into the European R&D scene. Altogether, the former Academy institutes received 26 grants from the EC, including 9 from PHARE and 6 from COPERNICUS programs. The special grants described below are especially noteworthy.<P>

<B>Educational Reform - Materials Sciences and Gene Technologies.</B> Beginning in October 1995, the EC has provided 500,000 ECU [1 ECU = ca. $1.25] for a special initiative in Higher Education and Science Reform (HESR) under the PHARE program. The pilot projects are designed to facilitate reforms aimed at fully integrating research at the two universities - Tartu University and Tallinn Technical University - with corresponding institutes formerly run by the Academy of Sciences. This type of integration was a key recommendation in the Swedish report. Estonia will establish Centres of Strategic Competence in two areas, namely materials sciences and gene technologies, which will be coordinated activities in these subjects among Estonian universities and institutes, and centers located in other countries such as Finland, Sweden, Germany, and Spain. Some of the funds will be used to upgrade laboratory instrumentation.<P>

<B>Baltic Innovation Relay Center.</B> With major financial support from the European Commission (EC), a Baltic Innovation Relay Center is being set up this year to act as a depository and distribution center for research technology, and development information, and to provide access to European computer data banks. The Center, funded for a two-year period, will have two components, the Estonian Educational and Research Network funded at a level of 212,000 ECU, and the Latvian Research Network - LATNET, which is to receive 148,000 ECU. The Center will also provide information and advice on EC activities, assistance on technology transfer, and training on technology marketing. Its director is Professor Richard Villems. who heads the Estonian Biocentre in Tartu.<P>

<B>Some Major Research Centers</B><P>

Estonia is a country with a relatively high level of scientific activity, and several scientists are prominent in its political life. Among its principal areas of scientific strength are molecular biology and genetic science (synthesis, sequencing, neuron networks, vector researcher etc.), materials research (zeolites, superconductors, ceramics, glasses, and cellulose derivatives), lasers (dye and excimer lasers, development of lasers with strong short pulses in the ultraviolet, and high-power lasers for fusion research), environmental science (air and soil pollution, technology for remediation), information technology (technology, networks, encryption), space science (surveillance of earth resources), astronomy (dark matter, galactic structure, in collaboration with U.S.), and marine science (marine physics, marine biology, hydrodynamics, ecosystem modeling - all focused on the Baltic Sea).<P>

Because of time constraints, only a few of Estonia's major research centers were visited. Included were some institutes formerly run by the Estonian Academy of Sciences and the two major institutions of higher learning, the University of Tartu and the Tallinn Technical University.<P>

<B>Institute of Physics.</B> The Institute of Physics, which until the summer of 1995 belonged to the Estonian Academy of Sciences, is Estonia's largest in this field. Located in Tartu and staffed by about 160 persons, including 70 researchers with a doctoral or higher degree, it is directed by Kristjan Haller assisted by a Scientific Council and a Directorial Board. The Research Director is Dr. Henn Kaambre. In 1995, the Institute's funding amounted to 8.4 million EEK, received mostly from the Ministry of Education and the Estonian Science Foundation. About one-third of the funds are now obtained through grants, from which 20% is kept for overhead. A quarter of the researchers, nominally members of the Institute, are actually working in a foreign country, especially Sweden and the USA. There are plans in an advanced stage for consolidation of the Institute of Physics with the University of Tartu; several joint research projects are already under way in which students are working at the Institute but taking their degree courses at the University. In 1995, 1 PhD and 4 MS degrees resulted from this collaboration. The planned merger has met with limited enthusiasm on the part of Institute members but, if it were to proceed, it would provide a center of excellence for the country.<P>

The Institute of Physics received favorable ratings in the Swedish evaluation of Estonian research (see above), and now obtains significant funding from Swedish and other international sources. The Institute concentrates primarily on lasers and spectroscopy, for which it seems to be reasonably well equipped. Its laboratories deal with laser spectroscopy, techniques, and optics; low-temperature physics; physics of ionic crystals and solid-state theory; nuclear and x-ray spectroscopy and spectroscopy of crystals; spectrochronography; thin-film technology; and theoretical physics. These activities are grouped into programs in materials science, optics, environmental research, biophysics, and theoretical physics.<P>

Among the Institute's achievements one should list especially spectral hole burning, which is being actively investigated for optical information-storage devices as well as in its fundamental aspects. Other advances include high-resolution spectroscopy of solids at high (up to 15 kbar) pressures; laser spectroscopy at ultralow (as low as 40 mK ) temperatures for which it developed a cryostat and uses synchrotron facilities in Lund, Sweden; the measurement of optical spectra of single-molecule impurities in organic solids; time-and-space-domain (4D) holography; theory of phase transitions in ferroelectrics; and the theory of secondary emission of condensed matter in a strong light field.<P>

<B>Estonian Biocentre. </B>The Estonian Biocentre, located in Tartu, was until June 1995 under the aegis of the Academy of Sciences. It and the associated Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology of the University of Tartu are housed together in a modern building near the University. The thirty-person staff of the Biocentre, directed by Prof. Richard Villems, is complemented by staff from the Institute which numbers about 95, including graduate students. Together, they form a strong program that has the potential to make its mark on the scientific scene. Consolidation of the Estonian Biocentre into the University of Tartu is well along, and is apparently meeting less resistance than in other such cases - perhaps because the Biocentre had only 12 PhD-level scientists at the end of 1995.<P>

<B>The Institute is divided into four departments:</B> Molecular Biology, Genetics, Biochemistry, and Microbiology. About 30 undergraduate, 38 master-level, and 36 doctoral students work at the combined center, which also has programs for high-school teachers. One serious problem is that Estonian industry cannot at this time absorb all the Institute's graduates, for example in gene technology. Many are postdoctoral fellows in the United States and in Europe.<P>

Research in the Biocentre and the Institute is partly funded by the Estonian Science Foundation, but about three-quarters of the funds are said to originate from extemal sources, including grants from the Intemational Science Foundation, the European Commission (see above), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, the NIH Fogarty Intemational Center, and others. This is a tribute to the standing that the Biocentre and Institute enjoy at the international level. The wide-ranging research includes such areas as biosynthesis; ribosome structure, function, and mechanisms; molecular virology; molecular evolution, a new activity; microbiological methods of environmental clean-up; and biomedical projects, such as gene therapy vectors and detection of genetic diseases.<P>

<B>Institute of Chemical Physics and Biophysics.</B> This well-equipped institute, located in Tallinn, covers broad areas of science. Independent from the Academy since June 1995, it is directed by Prof. Endel Lippmaa, a well-connected scientist who is also Minister for European Affairs in the Estonian Government, and by Dr. Tiit Saluvere. About a dozen of its 160-person staff (70 are at the PhD level or above) work at the Estonian Biocentre in Tartu, with which it has close links. In 1995, the Institute's budget was 12.7 million EEK.<P>

Research at the Institute is concerned with a large array of important areas: molecular genetics, directed by Dr. Merike Kelve; bioenergetics, directed by Prof. V. A. Saks; bioorganic chemistry, directed by Dr. J. Siigur; and physics, directed by Prof. E. Lippmaa. The Department of Molecular Biology, with a staff of some sixty persons including the group in Tartu, deals with the unusual combination of molecular neurobiology and plant molecular biology andvirology (the latter, a specialty of this Institute). The Department of Biotechnology concentrates on the optimization and control of growth in cultures of microorganisms and eukaryotic cells. Its A-stat (accelerostat) computer program, which deals with complex metabolic pathways in quantitative predictive terms, is offered for sale through Applikon (Netherlands). The Institute is equipped with a modern Perkin-Elmer genetic analyzer that it uses for DNA analyses, including for forensic work which is becoming an evermore time-consuming activity. The physics laboratory is has the tools to handle a number of advanced instrumental techniques. These include Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry, developed in collaboration with the NSF-funded magnet laboratory at Florida State University, in which masses of up to 100,000 are measured from the observed frequency; laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry that can be used in both linear and reflection modes and is being applied to mass determinations of biological molecules; low-temperature particle detectors, for weakly interacting massive particles (to be used in physics experiments at Gran Sasso, Italy); improvements in high-energy-physics detectors to prevent diamond formation which interferes with performance (work done with CERN); and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR). In regard to the latter, the Institute is very well equipped, e.g., with a 600-MHz Bruker, and has acquired a noteworthy reputation for the award-winning invention of the double rotor, now operating at speeds up to 1800 Hz. This technique permits much-improved analyses of solids, such as zeolites that are slightly enriched with 017 or with aluminum substitution, or high-TC superconductors. Some of this work too, is being done in collaboration with the Florida magnet laboratory. NMR techniques are also being applied to the study of cellular bioenergetics in the hearts of rats.<P>

The Institute is also active in a number of other areas, including organic chemistry and biochemistry, environmental problems, study of Estonian shale (which is an abundant source of energy), biomedical problems (antioxidants in the treatment of heart diseases, radiation dosimetry on teeth using ESR measurements), etc. A curious finding is that an estimated half-ton of fluorochlorocarbons of the Freon type is emitted annually in Estonia from deep-well gases. The occurrence of these chemicals from natural sources was first reported by V. A. Isidorov, from St. Petersburg University, and is said to have been confirmed at the Institute of Chemical Physics and Biophysics.<P>

<B>University of Tartu.</B> The University of Tartu, Estonia's only university in the classical sense, dates back to 1632 and has a distinguished history, which includes a period as the only German-language university in Tsarist Russia. It has a faculty of some 900 serving 8000 students, of whom about 370 are studying for a doctoral degree. Although 90% of the student body is Estonian, some courses - notably in medicine - are given in Russian for the benefit of this minority. Approximately 350 undergraduates and 110 graduate students study physics and chemistry, about 600 (including about 110 graduate students) are enrolled in biology and geography, and about 460 in mathematics. An unusual feature is that the research staff, which numbers about 200, is elected!<P>

The University is now autonomous from the government and, from September 1996, will be open without examination to all high-school students who can pay the tuition. Students will then be able either to take courses for a degree or only those courses they select. The total number of degree students is decided by field of study (biosciences, chemistry, medicine,- etc.) in negotiations with the Ministry of Education. The University is also increasing its admission of foreign students, especially in medicine.<P>

Among the prominent disciplines at the University are molecular biology and biotechnology (see Estonian Biocentre, above); materials science, which will be greatly strengthened if the consolidation with the Tnstitute of Physics takes place; cultural studies, especially semiotics (theory of signs and symbols); and psychology.<P>

The University has reorganized its structure and the degrees it offers (BS or BA after about 4 years of study, MS or MA after an additional 2 years, and PhD after a further 4 years of research) to conform to the Anglo-American model, as required by the 1995 Law of the Universities. Salaries for professors are 5,000 EEK per month, but can be as high as 11,000 EEK in special cases, e.g., for law professors.<P>

<B>Tallinn Technical University.</B> The Tallinn Technical University was founded in 1918 and acquired university status in 1936. It specializes in engineering and the sciences, but also has a large program in economics and business administration. Its student body numbers about 5700, of whom somewhat less than 10% are graduate students - mainly for the master's degree. The academic staff numbers about 630, including 130 who are research staff members. Applications by students are heaviest in business administration, where there are about 5-6 eager applicants for each open slot, but only about a third of the available places are filled in power engineering. <P>

The Technical University's rector, Prof. Olav Aarma who is a specialist in control engineering, welcomes the talked-about consolidation of former Academy institutes into universities because he believes that the goal has to be to integrate teaching and research. The model that seems to be gaining favor at the Technical University is to allow the institutes to retain a measure of autonomy within the university, whereas direct integration into university departments seems to be preferred in Tartu.<P>

<B>Cooperation with NSF</B><P>

International cooperation is increasingly important to Estonian scientists. In 1995, the institutes forrnerly directed by the Estonian Academy of Sciences participated in 178 joint projects, of which 35% were with the Nordic countries and 40% with the USA, Germany, Great Britain, France, and the CIS. Other projects were carried out jointly with Israel, Japan, Greece, and Brazil.<P>

Direct participation in NSF-funded projects has not yet been initiated. There are several reasons for this, including the lack of information about NSF's international activities and its procedures. My visit should have helped in this regard. However, as noted above, there are some existing collaborations, for example with the NSF-funded National High Magnetic Field Research Laboratory at Florida State University. Based on my observations, science in Estonia presents several other attractive opportunities for fruitful collaboration, perhaps most notably in the biological sciences and in physics.<P>

<B>1.  Introduction</B><BR>
A survey of deployable medical systems used by the military forces of the United Kingdom (UK) was carried out under the sponsorship of the Office of Naval Research during a two-week (AUDURA) period. The goal of the survey was to give an overview of the systems used by the Royal Navy/Royal Marines, British Army, and Royal Air Force to provide medical care to front-line troops. Additionally, it was of interest to assess the potential for interoperability of these systems with those of U.S. forces, namely the Deployable Medical Systems, or DEPMEDS, that are currently in use by the U.S. Navy, Army, and Air Force.<P>

<B>2.  General</B><BR>
The United States, as a global superpower, has had to be able to project force to any area of the world where U.S. interests might be threatened. Concomitant with the projection of force is the need to treat Casualties that result from such actions. In a Department of Defense analysis of the potential areas of operation and predicted levels of injury resulting from a large-scale conflict in areas of the world far from the continental U.S., it was noted that U.S. forces would need medical assets that were mobile, flexible and functional in all climates. It was realized, after studying the patterns of injury and modes of medical treatment in the war in Vietnam, that field medical systems that were standardized across all military services would offer a great logistical advantage over service-specific medical gear. Thus, the DEPMEDS program was instituted. The result of this program is a set of standardized medical equipment in use by Navy, Army, and Air Force.<P>

The geopolitical conditions facing the UK during the Cold War era were considerably different from those facing the U.S. With the loss of Empire, the political focus, and consequently the military focus, shifted from far-flung colonies to Europe. Participation in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance became a dominant responsibility of the UK forces. The medical equipment developed for those forces during that time, and presently in use, is not deployable and interoperable among those forces in the same sense that we presently use that term. Neither is it completely standardized across their individual services. This stems, in large part, from the military tasks that the UK was asked to carry out under the NATO agreements put in place during the Cold War era. British forces were assigned the task of waging war in a specific geographical area of Europe. To that end, they identified "brick and mortar" medical treatment facilities on the Continent and made plans to use these facilities in the event of a war. Medical supplies were propositioned, communication lines were established, and fallback facilities were identified. Rather than having the need for deployable medical equipment to use in a power projection scheme, the British needed to mainly concern themselves with resupply in their sector of operation.<P>

The Persian Gulf War (or Operation Granby as the British called it) showed the limitations of the British field medical system, as developed for a NATO war scenario, when applied to a more free-form battle that covered huge amounts of territory with no established infrastructure. Following that conflict, the Ministry of Defense (MOD) began a reexamination of the entire medical supply structure. Out of that examination came the concept of treatment modules (i.e., a collection of individual items, sets, and kits which are necessary for a specific purpose). The Defense Medical Supply Agency (Ludgershall, UK) is responsible for assembling and staging medical equipment and medical supply modules for the field medical facilities. Their goal is to prepare modules that can be used by all branches of the British military. Every module is designed around a specific medical capability (e.g., Primary Care Module, Surgical Team Module, Anaesthetics Module, Resuscitation Module, etc.), as determined by task analysis carried out in the MOD Directorate of Operations and Plans. Once the tasks are defined, a scaling factor is applied to determine the number of individual modules that must be built. Modules that allow medical service units to be constructed incrementally in 25-bed segments are available.<P>

Medical modules are centrally stocked at Ludgershall. Modules are loaned to units for training exercises Units train with the equipment they will take into battle. During training exercises, consumable supplies are used and equipment is operated by medical personnel. This provides high fidelity training. Upon completion of a training exercise, all modules are returned to Ludgershall for rebuilding and restocking.<P>

Concerning the interchangeability of medical equipment among NATO units of various countries, the British MOD believes that this will not be achievable. Nationalistic economic interests are working to prevent such standardization in the European Community, with each country using locally manufactured equipment to stock their versions of field hospitals. Concerning interoperability of medical equipment, entire modules might be swapped between NATO units with the caution that many components will not be interchangeable.<P>

The MOD medical concept of operations (or CONOPS) is similar in concept to the U.S. echelons of care system. For the British, Role 1 is that of the field medic who provides immediate life-saving care on the battlefield or onboard a ship. Role 2 is the first point where the patient sees a physician. A surgical team, roughly capable of tending to 25 surgical beds, may be at a Role 2 location. Role 2 is similar in concept to the U.S. battalion aid station. Role 2 also includes, for the British Army, units known as Field Ambulances. A field ambulance is a front-line medical treatment facility with organic medical evacuation (medevac) assets. These medevac assets provide transport to Role 3 facilities. Role 3 is the field hospital/hospital ship and roughly corresponds to the U.S. fleet hospital/hospital ship/general hospital concept. Role 4 is fulfilled by the British National Health Service, and is similar in concept to U.S. CONUS or OUTCONUS fixed medical treatment facilities.<P>

<B>3.  Tactical Doctrine</B><P>

Equipment provided to a medical unit is separated into a "Peace Entitlement" (PE) and a "War Entitlement" (WE). Both entitlements include Medical Material Short Life (MMSL) (i.e., perishable) items. In peacetime, regular units and Territorial Army units hold their PE. The PE provides material for individual and unit training, training support, operations as authorized. Certain units are maintained in a high state of readiness. These units receive their PE, WE, and MMSL allotments. A reserve of WE allotments is maintained by the Medical Supplies Agency (MSA). These allotments include, at a minimum, one full Medical Supply Squadron and 5 Field Hospitals. The shortfall in WE allotments (for the Territorial Army, for example) will be purchased by MSA as the transition from peace to war occurs.<P>

Theater stocks of medical supplies are based on battle casualty estimates, and treatment policy. It is planned that there will be a 30-day supply of equipment in theater for normal casualty rates, or a 10-day supply at high usage rates in theater supply depots. Supplies for disease and non-battle injuries are issued in 100 patient modules and are ordered as a matter of routine resupply.<P>

Five days supply of battle casualty treatment items, for high casualty rates, are held by all field hospitals - two days supply in each department, and three days supply at the hospitals medical supply department.<P>

Medical resupply is accomplished through the casualty evacuation system, but running in reverse. As patients are evacuated and ambulances and aircraft are emptied, supplies are ferried back to the battle area. In times of intense activity, supplies are transported by auxiliary vehicles. Flexibility is called for in arranging transport and for deciding which supply items are critical and must be moved from depots.<P>

Supplies are ordered by module (i.e., a collection of individual items, sets, and kits which are necessary for a specific purpose). it is not currently possible to order individual line items. Anecdotally, the British experience with this system has not been good. Entire modules must be ordered to obtain individual items, resulting in much material being wasted.<P>

<B>4.  Royal Navy</B><P>

The Royal Navy (RN) provides Role 2 medical support through carriers (2 CVS) and auxiliary ships (2 AOR). Each ship has one surgical team. The CVS have 1 1 beds available, and the AORs have 12 beds each.<P>

The RN provides Role 3 medical support in the form of hospital ships and Primary Casualty Receiving Ships (PCRS). Neither of these functions can, at present, be considered as a standardized system. However, in the near future, as MOD plans are implemented, the modules will be standardized. Presently, they are one-of-a-kind systems developed in response to specific needs. The RN has no hospital ships in service at this time. During the Falkland Islands conflict, the RN used what they call a STUFT (ship taken up from trade) to create the hospital ship Uganda. During the Persian Gulf conflict, the RN elected, for tactical reasons, not to use a hospital ship. Rather, they converted one hanger of the aviation support ship RFA ARGUS to serve as a modular 100-bed hospital facility housing 4 surgical teams. Another 100 beds can be accommodated in the hospital module under austere" conditions (i.e., on litters). Conversion was achieved using open-plan prefabricated modular office building construction units, assembled in two stories, and affixed in the ship's forward hanger. The hospital unit is self-contained, including its own CBR air filtration system. RFA ARGUS has a large, flat deck that can accommodate large medevac helicopters. Theoretically, it is possible to restore the hanger to aircraft storage by removing the hospital module.<P>

Present plans call for one additional 100-bed hospital module with 4 surgical teams to be kept ready for use in a PCRS STUFT in the event of a conflict.<P>

The full medical equipment set for RFA ARGUS is presented in RN MECCA form I 1 248-83 (Medical Equipment Set, RFA ARGUS in a PCRS Role).  Much of the equipment and medicines are similar to those used in U.S. DEPMEDS. However, much of the equipment, such as transfusion sets, surgical instruments, dental tools, etc. is standard to the UK.  For example, transfusion sets have connectors different from those used in the U.S., and are not interchangeable with U.S. equipment of identical function. Some surgical tools are commonly used in the UK as a result of procedures taught in UK medical schools; these tools may be unfamiliar to U.S.-trained physicians.

<B>5.  British Army/Territorial Army</B><P>

British Army (BA) Role 2 assets include 9 Field Ambulance units, with the Territorial Army (TA) providing 7 Field Ambulance units.<P>

The BA currently has 3 field hospitals of a maximum size of 200 beds each. Each hospital has 8 surgical teams. In addition, there are 11 reserve field hospitals of 200 bed capacity staffed by the TA. The TA field hospitals have only 4 surgical teams each. <P>

Equipment Table 7716/5 of July, 1995 lists the equipment allowance for a Royal Army field hospital.<P>

Of note is the British effort to include collective protection shelters with their deployable field hospitals. These NATO-standard shelters provide a working area that is provided with filtered air under positive pressure to allow medical procedures to be carried out in a chemically, biologically, or radiologically contaminated area without having medical personnel in MOPP gear.<P>

<B>6.  Royal Air Force</B><P>

The Royal Air Force (RAF) does not have a Role 3 mission at the present time. As might be expected, it specializes in aeromedical evacuation missions. Role 1 medical efforts are accomplished at 6 Forward Operating Base Medical Centers (FOBMC). Role 2 is fulfilled by 4 Casualty treatment units (CTU), 4 ATSST units, and one Casualty Evacuation Squadron. Role 4 is mainly medevac by air assets of the RAF and Royal Auxiliary Air Force.<P>

<B>7.  UK National Military Blood Program</B><P>

An integral part of any field medical system is the means to supply whole blood under combat conditions. In the UK, blood for the military is collected by the National Blood Service. It is tested, processed, and prepared for distribution at the Defense Blood Supply Depot. The 84th Field Medical Equipment Depot deploys to the battlefield to receive blood shipments from the UK. This unit then ships blood to field units. Blood shipment in the field is carried out in a manner identical to that used by the U.S., with blood being packed on ice in Styrofoam containers, giving it a 48-hour holding time. A standard NATO mix of Types A, B. and O is shipped to the field.<P>

One major difference between the U.S. blood supply system and that of the UK is that the UK does not use frozen blood at all. Frozen blood, preserved in glycerin, is the mainstay of the U.S. military blood program. This frozen blood, although it must be washed free of glycerin in the field before it can be used, is stable for years. The British were not willing to invest in the equipment necessary to allow each Role 3 field medical facility to have the capability of processing frozen blood. As mentioned previously, the former NATO role of the British military, combined with relatively short supply lines, made frozen blood an unnecessary luxury.<P>

With the realization that the NATO mission has changed, and the knowledge that British military forces might need to deploy anywhere in the world, a frozen blood program is currently being studied. Rather than use an intracellular preserving agent like glycerin, which must be washed out before transfusion, the British are investigating the use of an extracellular preserving agent - hydroxyethyl starch. Using this reagent, packed red cells can be frozen until use, albeit at liquid nitrogen temperature. When needed, the blood is thawed and transfused without washing. Although this system does not need elaborate washing equipment, it does require storage at -150C, somewhat difficult to achieve under field shipping and storage conditions. The glycerin method requires freezing at much higher temperatures, easily achievable with standard field-deployable refrigeration equipment. As the British frozen blood program progresses, its military utility will be evaluated and compared with the U.S. system.<P>

<B>8.  Summary</B><P>

This project provided a brief look at British field-deployable medical systems, with an overview of tactical doctrine and the twin concepts of interchangeability and interoperability of British and U.S. field medical systems. The outlook for interchangeability of these systems is not particularly bright, for economic and nationalistic reasons. The outlook for interoperability of U.S. and British field medical systems is substantially more positive. The success of interoperability schemes will depend greatly on joint training and familiarization exercises. These should be routinely planned and carried out to assure that the increasingly common trend towards multinational force projection can be carried out with the assurance that not only can our troops fight together, we can care for each other's wounded in a mutually cooperative manner.<P>

<H3>NSF/Europe Report No. 85 - - July 1996<P>

Science in Lithuania<P></H3>

This report is based on a visit to Lithuania from 11 to 15 May 1996 by Dr. Norbert M. Bikales, Head, National Science Foundation Europe Office. This visit was one of several to the Baltic States. The reader is also referred to NSF/Europe Report No. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/nsf82.htm">82</A> which deals with a general description of science in the three Baltic States, and Reports Nos. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/nsf83.htm">83</A> and <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/nsf84.htm">84</A> which describe more specifically science in Estonia and Latvia, respectively. For further information or comments, please contact the NSF Europe Office at the above address or at <A HREF="mailto:nbikales@nsf.gov">nbikales@nsf.gov</A> by e-mail.<P>

<B>General Background</B><P>

Lithuania, the southernmost Baltic State with a population of about 3.7 million, has a long national history dating back to the 13th century. After a period of great territorial expansion, which reached for a time all the way to the Black Sea, and episodes of union with Poland, Lithuania was absorbed by the Russian Empire from 1795 until the end of the First World War. Like the other Baltic States, it then gained independence only to lose it again as a result of the Second World War. In 1991, after brief but bloody clashes with the Soviet Army, Lithuania once again achieved its independence, with Vilnius as its capital. [Kaunas had served as the capital in the period between the two world wars, because Vilnius was then part of Poland.]<P>

Separation from the Soviet Union brought with it dramatic changes. Governmental institutions of every type were created from scratch and lodged in Vilnius. A new national currency, the litas, pegged at 4 Lts to the U.S. dollar, was introduced in 1993 to replace the ruble. Indivi-dual enterprise started up again, as did some privatization of the economy. But most traumatic has been the effect on industry. Severe disruptions occurred because Lithuania is wholly dependent on outside sources for energy (which it previously obtained from the Soviet Union), and which now have to be purchased at world market prices. Furthermore, many of the existing factories, notably the very large electronics industry, had been built to serve primarily the Soviet Union's military and other needs; since these factories are now without their principal market and are not technologically competitive with Western or Asian producers, they stand essentially idle and have ceased to provide much-needed employment. Such wrenching changes brought about a precipitous drop in the GDP, high inflation (29% last year), and even bank failures. Lithuania is still adjusting to this new reality, and hoping to stabilize its economy and provide for a better future. The economic dislocations also brought electoral success to the former Communists who now control the government again, but new elections to be held in October 1996 are widely expected to bring their opponents to power.<P>

There are more than 15,000 researchers and higher-education teachers in Lithuania, of whom nearly a third have a doctoral degree and about five percent have a Dr. habil. degree. About two-thirds work in institutions of higher education; most of the remainder are employed by the research institutes that flourished during the Soviet era. As in the case of the other Baltic States, these institutes have been taken from the control of the Academy of Sciences, where they resided in Soviet times; thus, 29 institutes are now under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education and Science. But unlike Estonia and Latvia, Lithuania has not switched a large portion of its science funding to a competitive, peer-reviewed grant system. Instead, it is still largely relying on central funding of institutes.<P>

<B>Norwegian Evaluation of Research</B><P>

In 1995, the Research Council of Norway conducted a thorough, impartial evaluation of Lithuanian research. Like similar evaluations carried out by other Nordic countries in Estonia and Latvia in 1992, its purpose was to help Lithuanian authorities plan the future development of research. The study covered, in considerable detail, research groups both in institutes and universities. The findings and recommendations, contained in a two-volume report, were issued just prior to my visit. They are especially valuable because they describe Lithuanian science as it is today, i.e., several years after the initial cataclysmic dislocations that followed national independence.<P>

The evaluators found areas of high competence on an international level in several cases, but also pointed out shortcomings. Among their many thoughtful recommendations, the following are especially noteworiy: 1) to establish a research council to distribute a sizable fraction of the research funds according to merit; 2) to merge university faculties and institutes except where institutes respond to important social or economic national goals; 3) to give university teachers more time and resources for research; 4) to broaden the research interests of individuals to make them more adaptable; 5) to increase international contacts and cooperation by greater use of English, publication in international journals, increased travel, and use of foreign experts in peer review; 6) to upgrade scientific equipment, libraries, and computer facilities; and 7) to give universities and institutes a high degree of freedom. In my view, all of these are worthy goals that should be endorsed.<P>

<B>Funding of Science</B><P>

In 1995, higher education and research were allocated 6.96 % of the State budget of Lithuania, or 1. 18% of the GDP, of which higher education received the bulk (75%). Research institutes were granted only 60 million Lts (ca. 15 million dollars), or 0.21% of the GDP. These subsidies provided by the government barely cover salaries and some maintenance. An important consideration is the high cost of energy which places a great burden on institutes, for example for the operation of instruments and for heating the notoriously energy-inefficient buildings dating to the Soviet era. Industry, being itself in dire straits, is unable to support much research either in its own quarters or in institutes.<P>

Because of these financial constraints, and to assure their survival, institutes now engage m various activities to make money, regardless of whether they are science-related (e.g., manufacture and sale of equipment, contract research, rental of space to start-up companies, or even making men's socks as is done, reportedly, by automation engineers in one institute.) This has led some conservatives to voice the belief that the institutes are now "too free" and that some control must again be exercised by the Academy or some other organ. It is unlikely that this issue will be resolved while the current hardships prevail, and probably must await a return to more normal circumstances.<P>

Institutes are beginning to redirect their research to contribute to the solution of national problems and to help in the recovery of Lithuania's economy. A very positive aspect is that some institutes have developed strong international collaborations which are important not only to maintain scientific excellence, but also to provide much-needed financial assistance.<P>

<B>Science Institutions</B><P>

The Lithuanian government supports 15 institutions of higher education - including Vilnius University, Vilnius Technical University, Kaunas University of Technology, and 3 other universities - as well as 29 research institutes and various other entities, such as the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, the Science Council, and the Science and Studies Foundation. These institutions are administered under laws passed by the Seimas (Parliament) after independence.<BR>
The Ministry of Education and Science was created one year ago; previously, its function was carried out by the Ministry of Higher Education and Culture. The Ministry, under the direction of Prof. Vladislavas Domarkas who had been the Rector of the Kaunas University of Technology before assuring his present position, has responsibility for all educational and scientific activities in the country. The Ministry's Department of Science and Higher Education directed by the Deputy Minister, Dr. Jonas Puodzius, provides funds to both universities and research institutes and supervises the training of scientists.<P>

The Ministry is taking seriously the recommendations of the Research Council of Norway. It is seeking to integrate former Academy institutes into universities (provided the quality is comparable in both places), to consolidate activities (an example cited was that 6 universities and 2 institutes have departments of mathematics), and to expand greatly international collaboration through partnerships both to benefit science and to raise enough funds to cover about 50% of the minimum expenses for institutes. Implementation of these steps has not yet gotten very far. A new concept being discussed is a national program to associate various institutions to work on common projects; such an idea is also now being developed in Italy (see NSF/Europe Report No. 80).<P>

The Science Council of Lithuania was constituted four years ago to give expert advice to the government on the organization, directions, and funding of science programs and to review scientific institutions. It carries out studies and analyses, and orients the science system toward national goals. The Council also establishes standards for scientists and evaluates diplomas. In this connection, it conducted the recertification process known as "nostri-fication" (see <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/nsf82.htm">NSF/Europe Report No.82</A>) of the 8000 degrees granted prior to independence and confirmed all but 40. Of the Council's membership of 36, the Seimas names 12, and 24 are elected for terms of six years by scientists in the following eight branches: linguistics and history, humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, medical sciences, exact sciences, and technical sciences. The chairman, currently Prof. Leonas Kadziulis who is a specialist in agri-cultural sciences, and the other officers are then elected by the Council. Heads of institutions are not eligible for election.<P>

The Science Council has set up 8 panels to study the recent Norwegian recommendations. It is currently examining the policies for funding university studies and may recommend the imposition of tuition.<P>

Closely allied with the Science Council is the Science and Studies Foundation chaired by Prof. Laimutis Telksnys, a specialist in informatics and communications, who is also Vice- Chairman of the Council. The Foundation is Lithuania's closest equivalent to the NSF. Its modest 1996 budget of 6 million Lts (1.5 million dollars) represents only 10% of the research budget for the institutes. The Foundation receives more than 300 proposals a year and funds about a quarter of these after peer review. Administrative expenses are kept to a minimum: the three-person staff works under the supervision of an unpaid 15-member board. Peer review is carried out by two Lithuanian experts per proposal according to a format in which various criteria are weighted for importance. One quarter of the funds are given as one-year grants (typically 20,000 Lts) to enable the Foundation to make a greater number of awards, 4 especially for young scientists. Recommendations by the staff are subject to approval by the board of the Foundation. Last year, the Foundation initiated grants on practical subjects that are cofunded by industry.<P>

Multi-institutional grants are now being emphasized. Half of the Foundation's budget goes to 8 national programs, examples of which are a study of the Stone Age in Lithuania (Institute of Geology), a database of genetic information on plants in Lithuania (Institute of Agriculture), and meteorology (Kaunas University of Technology). The Foundation also provides some funds for Lithuania's share of EUREKA, COPERNICUS, and TEMPUS European Com-mission projects.<P>

The Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, whose President is Prof. Benediktas Juotka, is now solely an honorary body consisting of 50 full and 60 corresponding members who are elected for life, and 50 expert members who serve for five years. The Academy's main function is to give advice on scientific matters and to promote the health of science in Lithuania through various activities, including international cooperation. Its four divisions are Mathematical, Physical and Chemical Sciences; Biological and Medical Sciences; Social Sciences and Humanities; and Agricultural Sciences.<P>

The Lithuanian Scientific Society was established in the heady days leading to and following independence to be a voice for the scientific community that is not controlled by the official bodies. Currently directed by Drs. Stepas Janusonis, Vincas Buda of the Institute of Ecology, and Vygintas Gontis of the International Executive Service Corps (who was an intern at NSF in 1994), it sees its main goal as ensuring that the reforms of Lithuanian science render it both strong and democratic. The Society publishes a semimonthly periodical, Mokslo Lietuva (Scientific Lithuanian), which provides independent assessments of issues affecting scientists and acts as an unofficial conduit for information. A recent issue, published as a result of my visit, deals with possible collaboration with American scientists through the NSF programs. The Society also sponsors a LSS Science Foundation which makes small grants to scientists from funds it has collected.<P>

The Lithuanian Scientific Society would like to expand its home page on the Internet, <A HREF="http://uj.pfi.lt/lms/lmshp.htm">http://uj.pfi.lt/lms/lmshp.htm</A>, to provide better information on international grant opportu-nities, procedures, and deadlines, as well as meetings of special interest. Because this infor-mation would be presented in English, it could serve the other Baltic countries as well. From my observation, this would be a useful contribution to help Baltic scientists overcome their still-continuing isolation. Funds are being sought for this project.<P>

<B>Technology Transfer.</B> The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is active m settmg up a framework for the marketing of Lithuania's most promising technological developments. With the aid of American consultants, the Danish Cooperation Center, and others, it is conducting demonstration projects and supporting technology transfer. The UNDP, together with the Ministry of Education and Science and the Lithuanian Joint-Stock Innovation Bank, has founded a nonprofit Lithuanian Innovation Centre which is to provide services for technology transfer, stimulate the development of new technologies, support the incubation of high-technology enterprises, and provide information on technological developments. In this connection, it should be pointed out that the NSF helped to set up LITNET, which joined the Internet in 1994. The USAID, with a budget in Lithuania of 7 million dollars in 1996, also works on some technologically related issues, such as the environment and energy.<P>

<B>Some Major Research Centers</B><P>

Time limitations permitted visits to only a few research centers in Vilnius. Several other centers in Vilnius and other parts of Lithuania would also have merited a visit.<P>

<B>Institute of Biotechnology. </B>This major institute was founded in 1975 as the All-Union Institute of Enzymology by the USSR Ministry of Medical and Biological Industry, and housed in a new building on the outskirts of Vilnius. It employed 850 persons in 1990 when it assumed its present name. Reduced in size to 450 employees, it underwent a dramatic transformation in 1994: about 100 persons joined the new company Fermentas which produces and sells enzymes, and another 125 left to form Biofa which produces such biopharmaceuticals as human growth hormone. These companies, with sales of 2 million dollars and largely owned by their employees, occupy nicely refurbished quarters in the Institute's buildings and utilize the Institute's research capabilities. At the present time the staff of the Institute, directed by Prof. Arvydas Janulaitis, consists of 125 persons of whom 70 are scientists, including 32 who hold doctoral degrees.<P>

The Institute obtains its funds from a variety of sources. Of the 2.3 million Lts (0.58 million dollars) received in 1995,42.3% came from State funds and another 2.4% from the Science and Studies Foundation. Contracts provided 36.9%, the International Science Foundation 7.9/0, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute 6.1%, and the European Commission 4.4%. Thus, over 18% of the Institute's budget originates from internationally peer-reviewed sources.<P>

The Institute is divided into six laboratories and one group dealing with research on protein-nucleic acid interactions, protein structure and interactions, prokaryote and eukaryote gene engineering, DNA replication and modification, immunology, and isotopic handling. The principal directions of its work are the investigation of highly purified proteins and other natural compounds for the development of processes that lead to products in medicine, agriculture, and research; research in genetic engineering and the development of producers of biologically active substances; and molecular genetic investigations of restriction and restriction modification enzymes. The Institute manages to combine good basic science with applied objectives that are already helping the Lithuanian economy.<P>

The Institute has made an effort to foster international cooperation. Staff members are encouraged to spend time in Western laboratories of high caliber (in the U.S., at Cold Spring Harbor and New England Biolabs with R. Roberts, at Cornell University with M. O'Donnell; in France, at the lNRA-CNRS Centre de Biotechnology and the 1NSERM Blood Transfusion Institute; in Germany, at the Institute of Biochemistr,v in Martinsried with R. Huber). An impressive number of active research collaborations exist, including with the Department of Molecular Microbiology at Washington University (D. Berg), the ETH Institute of Molecular Biology and Biophysics in Switzerland, the Institute of Virology of Humboldt University in Germany (jointly with Prof. E. Grens of Riga), etc. The Norwegian experts gave this Institute very high marks, which conforms to my own favorable impression.<P>

Quantum Electronics and Laser Research Center at the University of Vilnius. This center of about thirty persons with doctoral or higher degrees is located on a modern campus on the outskirts of Vilnius. It is part of the University' s Faculty of Physics. Directed by Prof. Algis Piskarskas, a well-known specialist in lasers who won the Lithuanian National Prize in Science two years ago, it has as its goal the development of femtosecond optical parametric generators that are broadly tunable. It does research on new highly nonlinear optical materials, and has published twenty papers on parametric oscillation over the past two years. Applications of laser physics include ultrafast processes in the life sciences and the environment, nonlinear optics, relaxation dynamics in organic and biological substances, and laser photosensitization in cancer therapy.<BR>
Prof. Piskarskas is a strong believer in the value of international cooperation, which he maintains with a large number of specialists and institutions in other countries: Profs. Robert Byer of Stanford University with whom he is writing a book, Jean-Claude Diels of the University of New Mexico, Orazio Svelto of the Politecnico di Milano in Italy, and labo-ratories in Lund, Bayreuth, Florence, and other places.<BR>
The Center is surviving the current financial crunch with grants obtained from various sources, most notably from the International Science Foundation - whose help came at a crucial time, contracts such as one from Rockwell International to study laser excitation of sodium vapor in the mesosphere (90 km altitude), and by the construction and sale of lasers and scientific instrumentation. This strong laboratory seems to have the ability and confidence to face the future with equanimity.<P>

<B>Institute of Physics.</B> This large, former Academy institute is located in the heart of Vilnius near several other such institutes. It is directed by Prof. Leonas Valkunas who also heads the Institute's Molecular Compounds Physics Laboratory. The Institute's staff, now about half of what it had been in Soviet times, still numbers 176, of whom 61 have a doctoral degree. Its principal specialty is "light harvesting," or the application of optical and spectroscopic methods to a variety of problems, for which it is quite well equipped both intellectually and with lasers and a variety of instruments.<P>

In 1995, the Institute of Physics reorganized its structure and concentrated its activities. The new research directions are environmental physics and chemistry (processes in the atmosphere and hydrosphere, atmospheric pollution, and radiological monitoring); molecular biophysics and chemical physics (dynamic processes of excitons and electrons in proteins, polymers, and organized molecular structures); nuclear and optical spectroscopy, including methods development; and nonlinear and adaptive optics, laser construction, and stellar systems physics. The Institute sees its new role as contributing to the solution of major national issues, such as ecological and nuclear-energy problems. Its staff teaches at Vilnius University and conducts a joint theoretical physics program with Vytautas Magnus University in Kaunas. It also maintains a student-training laboratory for teaching environmental physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear optics, and spectroscopy.<P>

The Institute has diversified its source of funding so that, of the 45 projects currently under way, 20 are supported by international funds. It lists collaborations with universities or institutes in Belarus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine, and the United States (Argonne National Laboratory, Arizona State University, Colorado State University, EPA, New York University).<P>

<B>Semiconductor Physics Institute.</B> This former Academy institute, founded in 1967 and located in a large building in Vilnius adjacent to the Institute of Physics, was closely linked to the then-substantial electronics industry in Lithuania. Even as recently as 1990, it employed over 600 persons including 123 with doctoral or higher degrees! With the virtual disap-pearance of that industry, the Institute now stands as a reminder of its past role but without a clear link to the present or the future. The total staff is down to about half, but the doctoral-level staff is still at about 100. Its 1995 budget came largely from direct subsidies by the Ministry of Education and Science (76%). Local industry contributed only 7.7% of the budget and competitive grants from the Lithuanian Research and Higher Education Fund amounted to only 2.1%. The European Community and Western industry provided the remainder.<P>

The Institute, directed by Prof. Steponas Asmontas, is organized into 14 laboratories, each consisting of about 9-12 persons. The research topics cover a broad spectrum: epitaxial technology (MBE and MOCVD techniques, quantum wells, superlattices), high-TC super-conductors (films, laser ablation, strip manufacturing, high-speed switching), semiconductor analysis (x-rays, microscopy, SIMS, AEM, depth profiling), optoelectronics (ultrafast techniques, picosecond switches, etc.), semiconductor optics (ellipsometry and modulation spectroscopy), inhomogeneous semiconductor structures (InP and GaAs), microwaves (diag-nostics, devices for high pulses, etc.), plasma phenomena (interactions with phonons, elec-trons, and excitons; gratings, nonlinearities, stimulated emission of photons by phonons), fluctuation phenomena (hot-electron and high-frequency noise), theoretical solid-state physics (electron dynamics in quantum 2d structures, simulation of devices, nonlinear dynamics and chaos), functional electronics (devices for medicine and ecology), sensors and devices (gas and chemical sensors, transducers, etc.), and microelectronics.<P>

The Semiconductor Physics Institute has an experienced professional staff and extensive facilities, including a Class C clean-room; cutting, polishing, and silicon-wafer production equipment; x-ray and photolithography facilities; high-vacuum chambers, etc. However, most of this equipment dates from the Soviet era and is in limited use both because of the bankruptcy of the Latvian electronics industry and the high cost of its operation.<P>

The Institute is trying to adjust to the new, reduced circumstances. It has closed its pilot plant, and made a smaller version of it into a design and technology department. To obtain income from its now-excessively-large building which requires much maintenance, it rents space to a Science and Technology Park for small start-up companies. It has developed an affiliation with Vilnius Technical University covering the areas of semiconductor engineering and experimental and applied physics, and accepts about a dozen students a year. Its staff is reaching out for greater contacts outside of the Baltics, for example through European Community programs and with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory and the Space Power Institute at Auburn University. The number of its publications in Western journals has increased sharply, from 19 in 1990 to 134 in 1995. Last year, it organized an international symposium on ultrafast phenomena in semiconductors which was attended by scientists from 19 countries. The Institute's capabilities combined with a low salary scale (a maximum of $250 per month for a top-level scientist, $150 for a researcher with a doctorate, and $100 for technical staff) could make it an attractive place for contract research for Western companies.<P>

<B>Outlook</B><P>

Science in Lithuania has managed to survive the first great crisis brought about by the country's break from the Soviet Union. This was done by maintaining more or less the status quo, the principal change being the transfer of the large institutes from the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences to the Ministry of Education and Science. Neither the nature of the institutes nor their method of financing has changed in a fundamental sense: the institutes remain largely as they were before, albeit reduced in size and with diminished funding. Much time is spent on seeking funds, especially in the West, to preserve the existing institutions. A competitive grant system exists in theory, but it provides only a modest proportion of the funds for research. The redirection has, therefore, been less profound than in the other Baltic States. In addition, applied research has suffered severely, because it lacks connection to a thriving local industry.<P>

Lithuanian science must now come to grips with an excruciatingly difficult task: to reorganize its institutions to meet the country's future needs. This, by necessity, requires a vision of the future and science's role in it. It then demands the will and the means to make the necessary changes. To an outside observer, it does not appear that this process has gotten very far. To cite one case, is it plausible that physics research be carried out, aside from the universities, in three large, separate, independent institutes in Vilnius alone? The Institute of Physics, the Institute of Semiconductor Physics, and the Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astronomy presumably were each needed when the Soviet military made great demands and provided substantial means. But would a country of less than 4 million people not be better served by a single, university-integrated institute that preserved and nurtured the best of that science to make it a force on the national and even international scene? Another example is the way science is managed. Should the top-down system of financing of institutes inherited from the Soviet era not be replaced to a much greater extent by a Western-style merit-driven grant system?<P>

Sooner or later Lithuania will have to deal decisively, and wisely, with such issues. The expected change in the national government may well bring this about. In any case, it is to be hoped that the scientific community will have an input into the process and participate in the decisions that will need to be made. Lithuanian science, for example in the biological sciences and physics, has clear points of excellence that can help the country's economic revival and make its mark on the international scene. These areas are also good candidates for collaborative research through the National Science Foundation.<P>

<H3>NSF/Europe Report No. 84 - - July 1996<P>

Science in Latvia<P></H3>

This report is based on a visit to Latvia from 15 to 18 May 1996 by Dr. Norbert M. Bikales, Head of the Europe Office of the National Science Foundation. This visit was one of several to the Baltic States. The reader is also referred to NSF/Europe Report No. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/nsf82.htm">82</A> which deals with a general description of science in the three Baltic States, and Reports Nos. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/nsf83.htm">83</A> and <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/nsf85.htm">85</A> which describe more specifically science in Estonia and Lithuania, respectively. For further information or comments, please contact the NSF/Europe Office at the above address or at <A HREF="mailto:nbikales@nsf.gov">nbikales@nsf.gov</A> by e-mail.<P>

<B>General Background</B><P>

Latvia is situated on the Baltic Sea between Estonia to the North and Lithuania to the South. Its population of ca. 2.5 million has a strong Russian minority. Unlike Estonian, the Latvian language is of Indo-European origin, with some similarity to Lithuanian. Although Latvia was under Russian domination for centuries, German influence has also been considerable. The capital, Riga, is Latvia's major scientific, political, and cultural center. The country's two major institutions of higher learning, the University of Latvia and the Riga Technical University, are both in Riga.<P>

Latvia achieved its independence from Russia after the First World War, but then lost it again during the Second World War. Its present form of government resulted from the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Renewed independence also brought an array of extremely difficult economic problems, resulting from the virtual collapse of Latvia's industry - which had been geared to serve the needs of the Soviet Union - and the loss of its former markets. High inflation (currently about 20% per year) coupled with a calamitous series of bank failures also added to the country's woes. The decline of the economy now seems to have been arrested, and the country appears to have begun a slow recovery. Latvia is in the midst of a profound reorganization of its national life to achieve its major political goal, close integration with the West. The new national currency, the lats (plural latis) is convertible at a rate of about 0.56 to the U.S. dollar.<P>

<B>New Science Policy</B><P>

Latvia has about 5,000 scientists, not all of whom are active full-time at the present. Most researchers worked in institutes of the Academy of Sciences during the Soviet era. Beginning in 1990, the Latvian government promulgated a series of laws to bring its scientific activity out of the Soviet mold. Of greatest significance has been the transformation of the Latvian Academy of Sciences from a virtual ministry of science into a high-level honorary and advisory body. The research institutes, formerly governed by the Academy, were made autonomous, first under the aegis of the Latvian Council of Science, and now under the Ministry of Education and Science. About 2100 persons are employed by these institutes, including about 1700 with a doctoral degree. Another major change has been a radical shift to a merit-based, competitive grant system, in lieu of the Soviet-style, top-down allocation of research funds to institutes.<P>

A principal concern has been the necessity to shrink the excessively large science and engineering structure to something more closely fitting today's needs. [Reportedly, there were some 35,000 persons employed in scientific and engineering activities in 1989, including 17,000 researchers; Academy institutes still had about 4600 employees in 1991.] Although the science institutions are contracting, a conflicting requirement is to encourage young people to go into science and to find attractive jobs to keep them working in Latvia. This has not been easy. Because of the general economic problems and the resulting low payment for pensions, older scientists tend to stay in institutes and universities longer than they would under more normal circumstances; for example, of the 111 faculty members at Riga Technical University, 25 are older than 65. As a result, the current average age of Latvian scientists with doctoral degrees is an astonishing 54! The Latvian Council of Science has instituted some countermeasures, notably enhanced support for the 100 best doctoral students in universities and institutes (by raising the stipend from about $34 to about $160 per month). Additional measures are being taken to reduce or even reverse the brain drain to the West, by creating some professorships for especially talented young scientists working in areas of high national priority, and opening positions for younger persons by making retirement financially somewhat more appealing. Latvian science also tries to maintain links with its more prominent emigres, e.g., by election to the Academy of Sciences as foreign members (there are currently 65 foreign members compared to 74 full members).<P>

Latvian science policy will now be oriented toward two main objectives. The first will bring fundamental changes: it is the integration of research carried out by both the former Academy institutes and the institutions of higher education, so as to produce a unified national science structure. A system of laws and regulations is being promulgated to this effect. Already, three former Academy institutes have been transferred to the University of Latvia. The second goal will be to redirect research so as to help the country in its economic, cultural, and social evolution toward a Western model. Among the areas scheduled to receive emphasis will be energy, the environment, and transportation.<P>

<B>Latvian Council of Science</B><P>

The Latvian Council of Science now has the major responsibility for the direction and funding of Latvian scientists and their institutions. The Council consists of 20 members, 14 of whom are elected for three years as heads of disciplinary commissions, the remainder being representatives of the parliament, the cabinet, the Latvian Academy of Sciences, the Board of Rectors of Universities, the Association of Latvian Scientists, and the Latvian Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences. The disciplinary commissions provide the all-important focal point for review of grant proposals for merit; they consist of 172 experts including 78 from universities, 77 from institutes formerly directed by the Latvian Academy of Sciences, and 17 from other institutes. Whether election is the best way to select persons to carry out peer review is now being discussed, and at least a partial broadening to include additional experts is likely. An unusual feature in peer review is that commissions assign percentages of their budget to each successful proposal, because the actual amount of money to be made available by the Government may not be known until late in the year.<P>

The Latvian Council of Science controls 5.8 million lati in 1995, which is ca. 80% of the country's science budget. About 55% of the budget is disbursed for the support of grants. The Council has a powerful role in deciding the distribution of funds within the various disciplines. It also provides matching funds for international projects. The Council's current Chairman is Prof. Ivars Knets, the Vice-Rector of Riga Technical University, who is a specialist in biomechanics. The Vice-Chairman is Dr. Aivars Tabuns, who was an intern at NSF in 1994 to learn American practices.<P>

<B>Ministry of Education and Science</B><P>

The Ministry of Education was broadened in 1992 to include not only education at all levels but also science through its Department of Higher Education and Science, staffed at present with seven persons. Renamed as the Ministry of Education and Science, it currently has the responsibility of drafting the national budget for science and to propose changes in the law. The Ministry controls about 10% of the science budget, mainly for market-oriented activities and infrastructure. It also administers the ca. 10% of the science budget that is provided by other ministries. Since July 1994, the Ministry has supervisory responsibility for the institutes formerly belonging to the Latvian Academy of Sciences (25 currently: 6 in biology, 6 in physics, 6 in the humanities, 3 in chemistry, and 4 others), but most of the institutes funding is obtained through the Latvian Council of Science. In 1995, the Saiema (Parlia-ment) established the additional position of State Minister of Higher Education and Science, presently occupied by Dr. Peteris Cimdins, a well-known ecologist who is also chairman of the biology-ecology commission of the Latvian Council of Science. This has led to specu-lation that the Ministry will seek to increase its role in science funding - a function now largely reserved to the Latvian Council of Science.<P>

<B>Funding of Science</B><P>

The funding of science in Latvia is in a period of great difficulty, reflecting the general economic plight of the country. In 1997, science is expected to receive about one percent of the government budget, or 7.3 million lati. The source of some of the R&D funds has changed since independence, in so far as industry, being itself in dire straits, has become only an insignificant factor in science funding. Thus, essentially all funding originates from the Government, supplemented by foreign contributions. As a function of the GDP, science receives only 0.38% now, whereas the corresponding figure was about 1.6% in 1990. Furthermore, the GDP is itself much lower than before independence, about one half, owing to the economic difficulties already described. It has been estimated that each researcher in Latvia receives only about $4,000 in funding which includes salary, compared to about $190,000 in France or even $27,000 in Hungary. Relatively little funding is directed to market-oriented research (8% of the science budget), which probably reflects the weak state of the market economy up to now.<P>

Beginning in 1989, Latvian funding of science was converted from the support of entire institutes to one based largely on competition for individual grants through peer-reviewed proposals. The funding for science through the Latvian Council of Science (some 80% of the total provided by the Government) supported 779 projects active in 1995, or some 70-80% of the projects that were proposed. Because of this emphasis on research by indi-viduals, the institutes now have to obtain their funds for operations by different mechanisms, primarily through overhead charges on grants; support for institutional infrastructure accounts for only about 3% of the research funding.<P>

The unfettered grant system, attractive as it may be for encouraging quality and initiative, also has the disadvantage of spreading resources in an uncoordinated way - something that a small country like Latvia can ill afford. A significant change will, therefore, be instituted beginning in 1997: the proportion of the funding distributed to individuals through grants will fall sharply (from 55% of the science budget to 30%) so that 25% of the budget can be directed to coordinated national programs and certain priority areas. Proposals for funding by either mechanism will still be subject to competitive peer review. This new approach is likely to build on the priorities existing since 1995, namely national resources and environment; public health; Latvian language, history, culture, etc. ("Letonica"); social development; and last, but not least, competitiveness of Latvian science and industry.<BR>
Salaries in Latvia are low: only about 120 lati per month for a professor, 100 for a doctoral--level researcher, and 50-65 for an assistant.<P>

<B>Evaluation of Research</B><P>

In 1992, the Danish Research Councils conducted a thorough evaluation of Latvian research, down to the level of individual groups. This exhaustive survey, by 19 expert panels, was an invaluable service to Latvian science. Its friendly but objective and impartial tone helped Latvia define the changes that needed to be made. The report commends Latvian science for some really excellent activities, but also points to deficiencies in a number of groups as well as failings inherent in the then-existing system. The more general conclusions and recommendations are of special interest. They include: the integration of research and teaching, as is practiced in the West; the relocation, if possible, of geographically isolated institutes to universities; the shrinking of research institutes to fit currents needs and finan-cial capabilities; the selection of a proper balance between basic and applied research; special measures to enable the best, internationally recognized teams to survive this period of crisis; an emphasis on international collaborations and contacts, including the use of English and greater reliance on the Internet; the abandonment of a tradition of life-long engagement in a single topic of research; and the creation of special institutes, on the Danish model, to transfer knowledge from research laboratories to users. Latvia has begun to put several of these recommendations into practice, notably the greater integration of research and teaching.<P>

The Ministry of Education and Science has just completed an internal evaluation of its research institutions. As a result, a small number will be named Centers of Excellence. These Centers will conduct science at an internationally recognized level in an area of high national priority, have integrated research and university-level teaching, and develop solid international cooperations.<P>

<B>Some Latvian Research Centers</B><P> 

Latvian science has many noteworthy activities, especially in molecular biology and bio-technology, materials science (including polymer mechanics) and solid-state physics, organic and medicinal chemistry, and informatics. Funding for applied research is now double that for basic research, but the reduced number of individual grants beginning in 1997 will be facllRed more on basic problems.<P>

Time limitations permitted only relatively brief visits to a few research centers, which included several institutes formerly run by the Latvian Academy of Sciences as well as universities. Additional written information was also provided by my hosts on these and some other centers.<P>

<B>Biomedical Research and Study Centre.</B>  The BMC, under the dynamic leadership of Professor Elmars Grens, is one of the leading laboratories in Latvia. It was founded in 1993 by merging various activities as part of a reorganization to enhance Latvian biological research. Although the previous components were under the direction of the Latvian Academy of Sciences, the Centre is now an autonomous part of the University of Latvia. Its relatively young staff of 35 scientists, 24 assistants and graduate students, and a dozen undergraduates moved in 1994 to a modern building in a Riga suburb. The building also houses Grendex-Diagnostica, a small biomedical start-up venture of Grendex - a Latvian pharmaceutical company - with the Biomedical Research and Study Centre. The BMC takes pride in being the only institute in Latvia that has an international advisory board, which was established to help end the isolation from Western science. The BMC has several areas of emphasis in its research: structure of viruses and protein antigenic determinants; genome structure and organization, and molecular mechanisms of gene activity; biotechnology of biologically active proteins; construction of new antigens and diagnostic tools, based on gene and protein engineering; and biomedical approaches and techniques.<P>

The Biomedical Research and Study Centre's budget was some 260,000 lati in 1994, about half of which came through a dozen international grants from the EC, the Karolinska International Research and Training Program and others, as well as contracts with biotechnology companies.<P>

<B>Institute of Microbiology and Biotechnology.</B> This institute, likewise, was created from former Academy institutes and is now affiliated with Riga Technical University. Its 70 researchers are concerned more with applied subjects: the biosynthesis of organic substances including polymers, food technology, biodegradation of toxic organic substances, etc.<P>

<B>Institute of Polymer Mechanics.</B> Polymer mechanics was one of the strengths of Soviet science and the Institute of Polymer Mechanics in Riga was one its pillars. Formerly run by the Academy of Sciences, its current staff numbers about 140, including 40 with doctoral degrees - compared to about 300 employees before independence. Of its budget of 250,000 lati, half is received from the Latvian Council of Science, the remainder coming from European Commission grants, commercial contracts, and rentals of space. The Institute, under the direction of Dr. Juris Jansons and Prof. Vitauts Tamuzs, has programs in deforma-tion and failure, composite structures and filled materials, environmental degradation, and nondestructive testing. Recently, Prof. Yuri Tarnopol'skii reported modeling the design of thick-walled composite rods to be used in torsion, e.g., for aerospace and automotive applications. In an attempt to compensate for the disappearance of a large polymer industry from Latvia, the Institute is broadening its activities to structures built of other materials, notably concrete. One aim is to be certified as a qualified testing laboratory by the European Commission. The Institute may change its name in the near future to something like the Institute for Mechanics of Materials, or simply Institute of Materials.<P>

<B>Institute of Polymer Materials.</B> This institute, founded in 1994 by Prof. Martigs KalniVs, is part of the Faculty of Chemical Engineering of Riga Technical University. Its staff of 26 persons, most holding doctoral degrees, is housed in a rather modern building. The Institute accepts about 7-10 students every third year and graduates mostly bachelors and masters. The main emphasis of its research is on control and optimization of surface and boundary phenomena, such as adhesion, with special emphasis on composites. Additional themes are biodegradable polymers and recycling. The Institute has collaborative work with several foreign institutions, including the 3M Company in the United States, and has received about $150,000 per year from the EC TEMPUS program which has been used to buy a variety of much-needed instrumentation, which is beginning to replace the older Soviet equipment still in evidence.<P>

<B>Latvian State Institute of Wood Chemistry.</B> This former Academy institute is closely tied to a vital national activity, since about 44% of Latvia is covered by forests. Located in Riga, it has about 110 employees (down from 344 in 1991), including 37 with doctoral degrees (formerly 84). Somewhat over half of its funding is through grants from the Latvian Council of Sciences. The Institute has a fairly traditional program in wood as a material, pulp and paper processes (including enzymatic bleaching, Prof. Arnis Treimanis), lignin, cellulose, polysaccharides, tall oil, biomass and fermentation (Prof. Uldis Viesturs), and remediation of pollution. It also sells some products and instruments it developed. Perhaps most notable is the recent qualification of the Institute to carry out certain tests on wood products according to Western (i.e., DIN) specifications, examples being for insect or fungus attack and formaldehyde emission. This new activity may earn the Institute some funds needed to upgrade its programs, equipment, and facilities.<P>

<B>Ventspils International Radioastronomy Centre.</B> A visible reminder of the Soviet occupation of Latvia, the giant antennas from the former military space communication center at Ventspils are now abandoned. The site was examined by American specialists who found that the antennas themselves, their mechanical components, and the associated power facility are in relatively good condition, but that some electrical equipment had been removed. The Latvian Academy of Sciences is seeking to place the 32-rneter fully steerable parabolic centimeter-wave-range antenna and its 16-meter millimeter-wave-range companion into use as an international center for radioastronomy under the direction of Prof. E. Bervalds. The cost of restoring the site was not made available to us - there is need for computers and detectors - but there clearly is much interest on the Academy's part in developing international collaborations to make this center viable.<P>

<B>International Help and Cooperation</B><P>

Latvian scientists receive considerable benefit from the country's associate membership in the European Union. At last count, the European Commission (EC) provided funds through the PECO program (7 projects), the COPERNICUS program (24 projects), the EUREKA program (3 projects), and the TEMPUS educational activities. A Baltic Innovation Relay Centre to be funded by the EC is being set up; it will include the Latvian Research Network - LATNET, whose share will be 148,000 ECU over two years (see NSF/Europe Report No. 83). The Nordic countries have been especially helpful to Latvian science in a variety of ways, as has the Soros-funded International Science Foundation which until 1995 provided life-saving injections of funds. The VoLkswagenstiftung, the Howard Hughes Medical Insti-tute, the NATO science programs, the U.S. National Research Council, and others have also provided assistance. It has been estimated that foreign help adds another fifth to the science funding provided by the Latvian Government.<P>

Although there are many opportunities for collaboration with American scientists, and an intern from Latvia was in the NSF offices to encourage that outcome, no applications have yet been received for grants under the auspices of the NSF Division of International Programs. A principal handicap has clearly been a lack of information. From what I have seen, the biological sciences and polymeric materials are two areas that should be worthy candidates for collaborative research, but undoubtedly there are others.<P>

<B>Outlook</B><P>

Latvia has undergone wrenching changes since its independence. Among the many problems that are facing scientists today are low salaries, old equipment, neglected and energy -inefficient buildings, lack of money for international travel and for subscriptions to journals, difficulties in transferring former Academy institutes to universities, inadequate libraries, lack of information on science-related activities (which the Riga office of USIS is trying to remedy), and little experience with knowledge transfer to industry. Peer review has created problems of its own, and the proper balance between individual and coordinated research and between basic and applied research still has to be found.<P>

From what I have been able to observe, Latvian science has taken very seriously its goal of transforming itself into a Western-style system, and notable changes have been effected in this direction. A competitive grant system with peer review has been established, significant steps have been taken toward the integration of research and teaching by affiliating former Academy institutes with universities, and attention is being given to the obvious necessity of encouraging and retaining young scientists. Publication of research results in international journals has been a priority, as have international collaborations. Many key documents, including those originating from quasi-governmental bodies like the Latvian Council of Science and ie Latvian Academy of Sciences, are now published in English. There is also recognition that the limited means available dictate the need to provide focus and coordination to ie nation's science and technology effort. The new Centers of Excellence will provide a new mechanism to encourage science that is both of high quality and of national importance.<P>

With enough determination, Latvian science will continue to make good strides.<P>

<H3>21st International Colloqium on Automata, Languages and <BR>
Programming (ICALP 94) report<BR><P>
Roberto Segala
</H3>
During the period 10-15 July, 1994 I participated in the twenty-first<BR> 
International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP). <BR>
It is the main conference of the European Association for Theoretical Computer<BR> 
Science (EATCS),and it covers essentially all the subareas of theoretical<BR> 
computer science.The work that I have presented consists of a model for<BR> 
real-time distributed systems that can handle safety as well as liveness<BR>
properties. The model was built by starting from a real application and<BR> 
constitutes an evidence of the fact that it is possible to build verification<BR>
 tools with a strong mathematical foundation; thus, ICALP was the best place<BR>
 for its presentation. The feedback for the paper was satisfactory; some<BR> 
researchers are going to try the model and keep me updated on the results.<BR><P>

Limor Fix presented a work that is closely related to the work I have presented.<BR> 
Both the works distinguish between a system and its environment; however, in our<BR> 
work the environment represents a potential external system, while in Fix's work<BR> 
the environment describes the computational model in which a system works. The two<BR> 
approaches appear to be orthogonal, but more investigation is necessary.<BR><P>

I found the invited presentation by Hennessy very useful since it gave a different<BR> 
view of the testing scenario that he developed with De Nicola. Such a view gave me<BR> 
some new insight on the model for randomized computation that I am developing with<BR>
Nancy Lynch.<BR><P>

The presentation of Ugo Vaccaro was also very interesting, although not directly<BR> 
related to my work. In this work it is shown how to use Information Theory to reason<BR> 
about the amount of randomness that is needed for an algorithm to be correct. I found<BR> 
such a result useful to understand better the role of randomness in an algorithm.<BR><P>

Before the conference there were a series of tutorial lectures on Cryptography,<BR> 
Software Verification, Self Stabilization, and Approximability. The last lecture was<BR> 
the most interesting for me since I am not familiar with the subject. From the tutorial<BR> 
on Self Stabilization I have discovered a self stabilizing algorithm for minimum weight<BR> 
spanning trees that has the same time complexity as the algorithm presented by Aggarwal<BR> 
in his Master's thesis, and a better space complexity. The authors of the algorithm do<BR> 
not have a written report yet; however, they seem to be aware of the problems that<BR> 
Aggarwal encountered in his thesis.  During our discussion we addressed the technicalities<BR>
 of the new algorithm, but some more analysis is necessary. I should receive more<BR> 
information as soon as the report is available.<P><HR><P>

<H4>Biographical Resume</H4><BR>
Ben A. Wilcox is the Associate Director, Materials Science, of the Office of Naval Research Europe (ONR Europe) in London, England.  In this position he reports on selected areas of Materials Science, both in structural materials (composites, metals, ceramics, and polymers) and functional materials (electronic, magnetic, and adaptive).<P>

Dr. Wilcox is a graduate of Washington State University in Physical Metallurgy,  He received a Masters Degree in Metallurgical Engineering and a Ph.D. in Materials Science from Stanford University in 1962.  He then spent one year as an NSF Post Doctoral Fellow in the Metallurgy Department, Cambridge University, England.<P>

Before joining ONR Europe, Dr. Wilcox headed the Materials Sciences Division of the Defense Sciences Office, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Arlington, VA. In addition to his technical and management responsibilities, he represented DARPA on the DOD Defense Committee on Research, which coordinates DOD (ARO, ONR, AFOSR, DARPA, BMDO) supported basic research at universities, and which funds academic research via the University Research Initiative.  DARPAs Materials Sciences Division presently supports about $200 million annually of basic and applied research.  During his tenure at DARPA, research was completed in rapid solidification processing of alloys, armor/anti-armor materials, laser-hardened materials, carbon-carbon composite coatings, structural and conducting polymers, and intermetallic compounds.  Current research efforts include:  structural materials (especially affordable composites and smart materials); high temperature superconductivity; high temperature/high power semiconductors; insertion of ceramic components into fielded military systems for performance improvement; solid freeform fabrication of ceramic prototype components; intelligent (sensor-based, feedback controlled) processing of photovoltaics, protective turbine coatings and diamond films for thermal management in electronic packaging.  New programs beginning in FY96 and later are:  giant magnetoresistive materials for non-volatile memories; modeling and simulation of materials processing, ultra lightweight metals, thermoelectric materials, and nanostructure materials.<P>

Earlier in his career, Dr. Wilcox served as a Project Officer (1st Lt.) at the Air Force Materials Laboratory, WPAFB, OH.  Later he was employed by Battelle Memorial Institute, Columbus, Ohio, where he served first as a Research Scientist and later as Manager of the Materials Science Department.  He conducted research in the areas of:  deformation and fracture of metals, ceramics, and oxide dispersion strengthened superalloys; laser-induced shock hardening of metals; ands high temperature corrosion of superalloys. In 1973 he had a six-month sabbatical at Imperial College of Science and Technology and The National Physical Laboratory, England, where he performed research on in-situ oxidation of superalloys in the high voltage electron microscope, and creep of dispersion strengthened alloys.  He joined the National Science Foundation in 1974 where he initiated and managed the Ceramics Program.  This program provided U.S. Ceramic scientists and engineers their first major opportunity to conduct basic research with Federal support.  He later became head of the Metallurgy, Ceramics and Polymers Section in NSFs Division of Materials Research.<P>

Dr. Wilcox has authored or co-authored approximately 75 publications in journals and conference proceedings.  He was elected a Fellow of the American Ceramic Society and the American Society for Metals.  He chaired a Gordon Conference on Solid State Studies in Ceramics, and has been active in metallurgical and ceramic technical societies.<P>

In London he is accompanied by his wife Jacquelin, a former long term member of the U.S. Senate staff.  Their three children are Linda, Grand Blanc, MI; Laura, Washington, DC; and Richard, Falls Church, VA.

<H3>ONR Trip Report<BR>
<P>
Sixth ECMWF Workshop on Parallel Processing <BR>
in Meteorology<BR>
<P>
Matthew T. O'Keefe</H3>
I attended the Sixth ECMWF Workshop on Use of Parallel Processors<BR>
in Meteorology held at the European Centre for Medium-Range <BR>
Weather Forecasting in Reading, England from November 21-25, 1994.<BR>
At the conference I presented a paper entitled "The Design,<BR>
Implementation, and Performance of a Parallel Ocean Circulation <BR>
Model" which I co-authored with Dr. Rainer Bleck (U. of Miami)<BR>
and my student Aaron Sawdey. This paper describes our recent<BR>
0.08 degree North Atlantic ocean circulation calculation performed<BR>
on 256 processors of the Cray T3D at the Pittsburgh Supercomputer Center.<BR>
<P>
I also co-authored another paper presented at this conference on the<BR>
performance of the ECMWF's IFS (Integrated Forecast System) operational<BR>
weather code. My contribution here was to understand why the Cray<BR>
T3D single node performance was relatively poor. The two primary reasons<BR>
were poor cache performance due to DEC Alpha's small cache sizes and<BR>
long-latency divides.<BR> 
<P>
This ECMWF workshop has been held every two years since 1984 and<BR>
hence represents an excellent snapshot of this evolving field. <BR>
complex models with large memory-hungry grids and the weather <BR>
prediction operational imperative means that these models must<BR>
run fast. Compared to the last ECMWF workshop I attended in 1992,<BR>
the following trends are evident:<BR>
<P>

<OL>
<LI>massively parallel processors (MPPs) have arrived and are about to<BR>
  be deployed in operations (1995), however

<LI>given the software development hurdles to exploit MPPs they will<BR>
  initially be used operationally by a limited number of groups which<BR>
  means that

<LI>parallel vector processors will continue to play an important but<BR>
  diminishing role in atmospheric modeling.</OL>
<P>

A key difference with the 1992 conference is that many papers described<BR>
successful efforts to port whole models, not just kernels. This included<BR>
several ocean circulation models including Oberhuber's isopycnic model and<BR>
the Cartesian coordinate model developed originally at GFDL.  In addition,<BR>
for the first time a large-scale operational weather forecast model (IFS)<BR>
was reported to have run faster on an MPP (1024-processor Cray T3D) than on a<BR>
parallel vector processor (16-processor Cray C90). Modelers are clearly<BR>
learning to adapt to this new technology, but significant numbers of users<BR>
still are having difficulty with parallel machines. I expect that<BR>
there will be a continuing and widening performance gap between successful<BR>
parallel model developers and those that have not made the transition. <BR>
<P>
The final conference session was a round-table discussion on issues raised<BR>
throughout the workshop. There was general agreement on the following points:<BR>

<P>
1) Within limits it is possible to pick the algorithm to use without<BR>
detailed consideration of the parallel architecture;<BR>
(For example, the ECMWF's weather code employs spectral techniques that<BR>
require global communication which can be slow on MPPs. However, this <BR>
code computes only locally in the physics and this generally hides the <BR>
overhead required in the spectral portions of the code.)<BR>
<P>

2) Code portability is critical to making parallel software practical:<BR>
it must still be possible to run the parallel model on different<BR>
parallel and serial machines;<BR>
<P>
3) Parallel vector processors such as the Cray C90 will remain important<BR> 
to groups who do not or cannot parallelize their software for MPPs;<BR>
<P>
4) Cache-based microprocessors will be the processors found in MPPs due<BR>
to the economies of scale in high-volume PC and workstation markets:<BR>
modelers must adapt to caches even though they require more programming<BR>
effort than vector processors to achieve peak speed;<BR>
<P>
5) Though much interesting language work is being performed, Fortran 77<BR>
will remain the language of choice for the foreseeable future;<BR>
<P>
6) For highly parallel models, massively parallel machines are just now<BR>
becoming faster than equivalent (in terms of price) parallel vector<BR>
processors.<P><HR><P>

<H4>Biographical Resume</H4><BR>
<P>
Bruce H. Barnes is serving as the Associate Director for Computer Science on the staff of the 
Office of Naval Research, Europe, London England.  In this position he will be conducting The 
Joint ONR/NSF Assessment of European Computer and Software Technology.  This is a 
cooperative effort between the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Office of Naval 
Research (ONR) to provide NSF, ONR and the broader Computer and Information Science and 
Engineering  communities with assessments of the current state of the art and practice of 
computer and software technology in Europe, with special attention to Eastern Europe.  The 
focus is on software engineering and software systems, especially those areas that are closely 
related to parallel and distributed computing, network security, and human computer 
interfaces.<P>

Dr. Barnes received his bachelors degree from Michigan State University with a major in 
Mathematics.  After serving in the Air Force as the Armament Systems Officer for the 74th 
Bomber Squadron in Sculthorpe, England,  he returned to Michigan State University where he 
earned the M.S. and Ph.D. Degrees in Mathematics. The title of his Ph.D. thesis was "The 
Structure of Automata."<P>

Dr. Barnes joined the Mathematics faculty of The Pennsylvania State University in 1961.   He 
was a  founding member of the Computer Science Department in 1965.  He was the architect 
of the highly successful baccalaureate program. <P> 

While on a leave of absence from Penn State in 1974, Dr. Barnes served as the Program 
Director for Theoretical Computer Science with the National Science Foundation.  In 1976 the 
NSF started a new program in Software Engineering, and he was appointed as its first Program 
Director.   Aside from a two-year appointment with the Software Productivity Consortium, he 
has been with the Foundation ever since.  He has served  in several  capacities including 
Program Director for the Intelligent Systems and Interactive Systems programs, Deputy 
Division Director for the Division of Information Robotics and Intelligent Systems, and Acting 
Director for the Division of Computer and Computation Research.  His current position is 
Deputy Division Director for that division. <P>

Software reuse is Dr. Barnes' area of specialty within software engineering, and he has 
published several articles in this area.  He is also very active in Computer Science and 
Engineering education. He is a member of the American  Mathematics Society, Sigma XI, the 
Association for Computing Machinery, and is a senior member of the Institute for Electrical 
and Electronic Engineers.<P>

While in London, he is accompanied by his wife, Irene, a retired learning disabilities teacher.  
They have a son, David, who is married and is a science teacher in Richmond, Virginia.  They 
have two daughters; Karen, who is married and is with the Head State Program in Chapel Hill, 
North Carolina; and Sandra, who is married and is a landscape architect and land planner in 
Austin, Texas.<HR><BR>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
Among items of interest at the conference were a way to compile Ada 95 programs as Java bytecodes, a description of experiences from a large Ada development, a practical architecture based method for developing software, emerging commercial Ada tools and compilers,. And the closing of the Ada Joint Program Office in June 1997.<P>

<B>2.  Discussion</B><BR>
This document is a trip report for travel by Dr. Neel Madhav, Stanford University, to Ada-Europe 1996, held June 10-14 in Montreux, Switzerland.  The primary purpose of the trip was to present a paper titled  "Testing Ada Programs for Conformance to Rapide Architectures".<P>

Dr. Madhav met a number of attendees at the conference including the Program Chair Dr. Alfred Strohmeier from the University of Lausanne, Tutorial Chair Dr. Stephane Barbey, Director of AJPO Dr. Charles Engle, William Colket from the US Navy, Dr. Theodore P. Baker from Florida State University, Dr. A. S. M. Sajeev from Monash University, Australia and a number of other researchers, Ada industry people and professors from various parts of the world.<P>

There were 3 major interesting aspects of Ada-Europe 1996 --- a. the invited papers, b. research papers with technical content and c. information about Ada activities in industry and the Ada Joint Program Office. These are discussed below:<P>

a.  Invited Papers.  The most interesting invited paper was by S. Tucker Taft of Intermetrics Inc on "Programming the Internet in Ada 95". The paper describes a tool and a strategy to compile Ada 95 programs to Java bytecodes. The paper was interesting since Ada programmers may now develop applets (Java bytecodes are meant to be transferred over the net and displayed) in Ada. Other invited papers on Modeling of Safety Critical Software and Fault-Tolerance by replication were also interesting, since safety and fault-tolerance are significant software engineering issues.<P>

b.  Research Papers.  The research papers of interest to Dr. Madhav were on Software Architecture and applying software architecture methods to Ada 95. Included among these papers was Dr. Madhav's paper on "Testing Ada Programs for Conformance to Rapide Architectures" which shows how Ada 95 programs may be tested for conformance against reference architectures in Rapide. Other papers of interest were "Iterative Software Development for Large Ada Programs" by P. Krutchen et. al. and "Applying a Practical Architecture Method" by D. Emery et. al. The first paper describes the experience from a large Ada development project --- the Hughes Air Traffic System. The paper describes an iterative software development process. The second paper describes a practical software architecture based method for developing software. The requirements on a system are expressed through multiple views as components, connections and constraints.<P>

c.  Industry activities.  Sessions on "The Business Case for Ada" with four participants from European industry and on "Transitioning the AJPO" with Dr. Charles Engle were very instructive. The session on the business case for Ada discussed industry use and applications of Ada and how to make Ada more mainstream. The primary consensus was that proper Ada marketing, good and inexpensive compilers and some "flagship" interesting projects were needed to increase industrial use of Ada. Dr. Engle discussed the closing of AJPO (tentatively June 1997) since AJPO had fulfilled all its original objectives. Responsibilities of AJPO would be shifted to other agencies like NIST.<P>

There are a number of compilers and Ada tools that are becoming available. Orbix is coming out with a CORBA implementation that allows Ada, C++ and Java clients and servers. Rational and Green Hills Inc. are coming out with industrial quality compilers for Ada 95. As mentioned earlier Intermetrics has developed a system called AdaMagic that compiles Ada programs into Java bytecodes.<P>

Overall, Ada-Europe 1996 was an interesting and instructive experience.<P>

<H2>Annex  I:     Translation of the resolution of the 2nd Congress of the Association of Scientific Societies of Russia </H2>

<H3>Letter submitted to the Duma on the significance of international and foreign foundations for Russian science</H3>

The Association of Scientific Societies of Russia, on behalf of
47 public unions of scientists, comprised of tens of thousands of
highly qualified scientists in the country, takes note of the
outstanding role played by the international scientific
organizations created by George Soros to preserve the scientific
potential in Russia in these years of difficulty for the country
and for its science.<P>

Through the foundations of George Soros, only scientists carrying
out fundamental research are supported; the results of this
research cannot be considered the property of individual
institutions or countries, but belong to all humanity.<P>

The work of the Soros Foundations is exceptional in its extreme
effectiveness and precise channeling of help, in the openness and
clarity of its goals and results of work, and in the preservation
for the Russian side all intellectual property rights for
scientific and other results achieved through the Foundations'
grants.  Many other widely known scientific foundations, such as
the Ford Foundation and the MacArthur Foundation, also work on
the same principles in Russia.  <P>

The Congress takes note that the attempt to limit or close down
the activities of such scientific funds could cause a serious
financial blow during this critical period in the existence of
Russian science; it could make international contacts more
difficult for Russian scientists and could harm the prestige of
the country.<P>

The Congress asks the State Duma of the Federal Assembly to take
into account this unanimous collective opinion of the Russian
scientific community during the discussion of the question of the
activities of the Soros Foundation on the territory of Russia. 
The Congress considers that the experience of the activities of
national and international foundations clearly indicates the
necessity of rapid revision and enactment of laws regarding
charitable and non-commercial organizations, to create a legal
basis for the activities of such foundations in Russia. <P> 

The Congress calls on the President, the Government, the Federal
Counterintelligence Service, the Council of Federation (Senate)
of the Federal Assembly and the Parliament with the request to
express publicly their opinions on the material entitled "FSK
Concerned about the Activities of American Researchers in Russia
(from a report of the Federal Counterintelligence Service)",
published on January 10, 1995 in the newspaper "Nezavisimaya
Gazeta (Independent  Newspaper) under the heading "Document".<P><HR><P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
Representatives of ARPAs MOB Program visited Heremac Derrick Barge 102, one of the worlds largest semi-submersibles.  Built to serve the North Sea oil industry, it is used for heavy (two 6500 short ton cranes) lift and emplacing seabed well head structures.  DP and ballasting systems maintain 1M positioning and 1 degree verticality (exceeding requirements for ARPAs MOB Program), for design seas. MARIN does the design and test for Herema Derrick Barges.  Each new type of operation is first modeled in both computer and basin, and then data from at-sea ops are fed back to improve later predictions.  The German ship model basin also has several projects of interest to the MOB Program<P>

<B>2.  Heremac Derrick Barge 102</B><BR>
A small group of people involved in the ARPA MOB Program visited one of the two largest semi-submersible platforms in the world that were designed and built specifically to serve the oil industry.  We visited the jointly owned (Dutch Hererema/U.S. McDermott) Heremac Derrick Barge 102 while at its moor near the entrance to Rotterdam Harbor (Rozenberg, Netherlands. The visit was part of the ARPA contract with McDermott which has been funded to do a more detailed design of a semi-submersible concept MOB.<P>

   The initial impression of the DB 102 was that it is the tallest thing on the landscape. The barge structure extends approximately 80 meters above the bottom of the floaters (the submersible pontoon like floating devices), with the two 6500 short ton capacity cranes extending above the main deck to a height of 170+ meters. The main deck is 50 meters above the floaters which were at a draft of 16.5 meters while in port. Operational draft is 30 to 35 meters.<P>

   The DB 102 is used for heavy lifting, and for placement of submerged well head structures on the bottom of the North Sea. Little was described about those tasks, but the placement of large assemblies on the tower above the well heads was described in great detail. When in full production, there are power plants, pump rooms, and extensive living quarters placed on the towers above the water line.  The cost multiplier from building these at sea vice on shore is five. So these are built in port, welded to a barge, taken to the site, and then the derrick barge lifts them off the barge and places them on the tower. The largest lift ever made by DB 102 was 11,000 short tons.  This was equivalent to a 6 story hotel which was the living quarters for the crews that man the oil pumping operation--typically into a pipeline laid on the bottom of the sea (down to around 200 meters in depth).<P>

   To perform this operation requires a dynamic positioning system capable of holding position to within one meter, along with a ballasting system capable of maintaining verticality to within 1 degree. DB 102 has six 4000 HP thrusters and a twelve anchor dynamic mooring system (three anchors on each comer, with 7.5 cm diameter anchor "wires", each with a separately controlled winch). The dynamic positioning system constantly compares 4 measures of position: GPS, radar, underwater acoustic arrays, and a tension wire to a weight placed on the bottom. It was beneficial to see that these systems already have been developed. The 1 degree verticality requirement exceeds that expected for MOB operations.<P>

   DB 102 can make about 4 to 5 knots transit speed on six thrusters in conditions of low currents and winds. Fuel consumption is about 100 tons per day. However, DB 102 always deploys with a minimum of two ocean going tugs in order to make decent speed and escape bad weather. Cost of a one week lift in the North Sea is 6,500,000 guilders. Her normal compliment is 200 persons on board for all activities.<P>

    It was especially useful to talk to the Captain and Mates about typical and unusual operations. It gave the visitors with MOB interests a good feel for some of the MOB evolutions including coupling two modules together while at sea. They emphasized a "sea story" where last year they went out for a "one week lift" that because of weather caused them to take up their 12 anchors 16 times during a 6 week time span, and finally getting the lift completed while a large storm was quickly approaching. Without explanation, they also emphasized that they would not be able to work in the Gulf of Mexico. (There is more on this later).<P>

   Many details of the structure, bracing between floaters, extensive features for damage control, rescue, and safety were noted.  The whole group of MOB folks stayed on board for 4 days. While they headed for home, I spent an extra two days looking for more information regarding MOB technology. This turned out to be quite beneficial.<P>

<B>3.  German and Dutch Model Basins</B><BR>
   In Hamburg, Germany, I visited Dr. Gerhard Jensen, Director of the German Ship Model Basin, along with Dr. Joachim Schwarz. A tour of their facilities was provided, with special attention to the many features and wave makers designed Dr. Karl Remmers and built by Kemp and Remmers, GMBH.  Dr Karl Remmers worked at the Hamburg Ship Model Basin before he formed his own company many years ago. Regarding MOB critical technologies, Dr. Schwarz informed me of a large project in ice breaking they had several years ago that involved connecting two large floating bodies (oil tankers, apparently) with a cable system. They addressed the forces in the cables due to ice breaking, however, a Dr, Alexander Metzlaff, of University of Hamburg (Hanover) studied the forces due to wave loads. This contact can be useful to our MOB Program.<P>

   There was time to visit Dr. Bernd Remmers, son of Dr. Karl Remmers who is retired, current director of Kemp & Remmers, GMBH of Hamburg.  K&R are still considered to be the world's best designers of water tunnels for hydrodynamic experiments. A critical part of the test section of CD/NSWC's Large Cavitation Channel in Memphis, TN was designed by K&R. The visit was with Bernd and his wife Aneta who helps him run K&R.  They described the many projects they have contributed to. Their reputation is for very high quality engineering and hydrodynamic testing components.<P>

   The last stop was at MARIN in Wageningen, Netherlands which is the Dutch Ship Model Basin. Met with Dr. Ligtelijn, Director, Dr. Bert Koops, Senior Project Engineer, and Dr. Henk van den Boom, Head of Software Engineering Department. (This visit was arranged by the special help of Dr. Peter Majumdar, ONR London). When they found out of my visit to DB 102 they showed me their model of all of the Herema Derrick Barges including the DB 102, as well as their special basin which models North Sea characteristics. They were directly involved with the design and development of DB 102 in that they did all the hydrodynamic predictions, verified them by model tests, and further verified their predictions and simulations with measurements of DB 102 during its operations. As a matter of fact, every new type of lift or operation is first computer modeled, then physically scale modeled in their basin before the new operation is actually performed at sea. Then their predictions are reviewed and improved with the full scale measurements.<P>

   When asked about the North Sea wind and wave environment inputs to the development of the hydrodynamic characteristics of DB 102, the MARIN people asked me if I knew that it had an 18 to 20 second roll period. Since the North Sea is almost always very stormy, this roll period was chosen during design to allow DB 102 to operate over a larger time period. But it had the drawback of not performing well in good weather where the excitation at the 18 to 20 second roll period becomes a problem. The reason Heremac took 6 weeks to do a one week lift last year is because they had a very unusual 6 week period of good weather causing the roll angle to exceed 2 degrees. It wasn't until a storm came up and caused the seas to become sufficiently rough, that the lift could be accomplished (with roll angle within 1 degree). This is the reason DB 102 could not be used very successfully in the Gulf of Mexico. Apparently, the specific ocean environment where MOB operations are to be conducted is important to consider.<P>

   In summary, the MARIN group has a well developed capability to predict the hydrodynamic motions of semi-submersibles of the type in the ARPA McDermott contract. When asked, they would be willing and to participate in that aspect of U.S. MOB development efforts if needed. The cost would be for the professional time involved.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
The European Cetacean Society (ECS) and The European Association for Aquatic Mammals (EAAM) both held their annual conferences in Portugal in March.  ECS focuses on observational field studies, EAAM emphasizes experimental work.  Overall the Europeans lag a bit behind the US in the use of acoustic survey techniques, but have done some excellent work in biosonar and echolocation signal processing.  They study comparative natural behaviors of a variety of species, in comparison to US emphasis on quantitative assessment of bottlenose dolphin performance under controlled conditions.<P>

<B>2. Purpose of Travel</B><BR>
To attend two international meetings on marine mammal science for the purpose of <BR>
a) reviewing the status of marine mammal science in Europe, especially acoustics research, and <BR>
b) presenting the results of my ROPO research.<P>

<B>3.  European Cetacean Society</B><BR>
The first meeting, the Tenth Annual Conference of the European Cetacean Society (ECS), was held on 10-14 March at the Museo Calouste Gulbenkian in Lisbon Portugal. It was a small meeting with some 300 attendees. My primary purpose in attending the meeting was to ascertain the extent of use of acoustic techniques for monitoring and tracking whales and dolphins. The meeting was preceded by an informative workshop providing an overview of survey techniques, including acoustic methods. The Europeans lag a little behind the United States in the adoption of acoustic techniques, and the level of sophistication is also a little behind the U.S., but the interest of upcoming researchers was clear and we should expect an expansion in the number of projects using acoustics and the sophistication of their approach. I anticipate that the growth in acoustics studies will be comparable to what we are seeing in the U.S., although the tremendous acoustic oceanography community within the U.S. provides a pool of sophisticated researchers unrivaled in the European community. A collaboration between the Italian Navy and a consortium of universities in Italy was the highlight of the meeting for me. It was an excellent model for a proactive approach to building support from the environmental community while developing Navy ocean acoustic abilities. I presented the results of my ROPO research on using acoustics, including SOSUS, to track the migration of humpback whales.<P>

<B>4.  European Association for Aquatic Mammals.</B><BR>
The second meeting, the 24th Annual Symposium of the European Association for Aquatic Mammals (EAAM), was held on 15-18 March at Hotel Montechorro in Albufeira , Portugal. This society is even smaller than the ECS, with attendance of 150-200 people. This society places a greater emphasis on experimental work, versus the more observational, field studies approach of ECS. There were severa1 excellent presentations on biosonar with some very exciting new approaches to echolocation signal processing. Leaders in this area are Cees Kamminga of the Netherlands and his students at the University of Delft within the signal processing group ; and Hans-Uli Schnitzler of Germany and his student, who derive many of their study approaches from Schnitzler's work with bats. The Europeans tend to emphasize comparative studies using species other than bottlenose dolphins, more so than in the U.S. The Europeans also try to replicate and record entire click trains from searching performances that are more like natural behaviors, whereas U.S. research has emphasized rigorous quantitative assessment of performance abilities in more tightly controlled circumstances, with an emphasis on single clicks. I presented the results of my ROPO research, emphasizing the methodology of using multiple survey techniques to calibrate each of the techniques and thus achieve tighter confidence limits for population estimates prepared from calibrated surveys.<P>

ICFA Beam Dynamics Panel Workshop: 4th Generation Light Sources</H3> 

Travel Period: 10-26 January 1996<P>

<I>Keywords:  FEL; Light Sources; MFEL Program</I><P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
The main objective of this international workshop was to prepare the scientific case and requirements for 4th generation light sources [average spectral brilliance ~1018-20 Photons sec-1mm-2mrad-2(0.1% Bandwidth)-1], and to discuss approaches for developing them.  The author presents his opinions on the Duke/OX-4 XUV FEL (supported by the MFEL Program) relative to 4th generation requirements, and describes improvements to the Duke system from discussions at the L.U.R.E. laboratory in Orsay, France.<P>

<B>2.  Narrative</B><BR>
The main reason for this trip was to participate in the ICFA Beam Dynamics WORKSHOP ON 4th GENERATION LIGHT SOURCES. The organizing committee was very selective, limiting the number of participants to 90. Finally, the workshop had 95 participants from 42 institutes in 12 countries.<P>

The main goal of the workshop was to extend the resounding success of the 3rd generation light sources to the 4th generation by preparing the scientific case and requirements for the new generation.  The workshop had few plenary sessions; most of the work was done in seven Working Groups:<BR>
Group 1: Scientific opportunities for 4th Generation light sources - VUV/soft X-rays;<BR> 
Group 2: Scientific opportunities for 4th Generation light sources - hard X-rays <BR>
Group 3: Lattice and stability aspects (storage rings) <BR>
Group 4: Current, lifetime and time structure (storage rings) <BR>
Group 5: Linac sources <BR>
Group 6: Storage ring FELs <BR>
Group 7: Insertion devices<P>

I participated in the work of Group 6 (70%), Group 2 (10%), Group 4 (10%), and the joint session of Groups 5 & 6 (10%). I presented three talks on the Duke/OK-4 XUV FEL, Coherent X-Ray harmonics generation, and Xray storage ring FELs (new concepts). These presentations have been published in the Proceedings of the Workshop.  The main goal of my presentations was to emphasize that the Duke/OK-4 XUV FEL system, funded by the MFEL program, is already a 4th generation light source and is a very attractive alternative to linac based SASE FELs proposed by Stanford and DESY (Germany).<P>

Light source generations are separated by their average spectral brightness: number of photons per second per unit area per unit solid angle per unit bandwidth. Units are: for area 1 mm2, for solid angle 1 mrad2, for bandwidth 0.1%  [i.e., Photons sec-1mm-2mrad-2(0.1% Bandwidth)-1].  It is customary to distinguish a new generation if its brightness is 3-4 orders of magnitude higher then that of the previous generation. The 1st generation has brightness ~1012; thus the second generation operates at ~1015 and the fourth generation at a level of ~1018-20. It is very appealing that MFEL's Duke/OK-4 XUV FEL's brightness is ~1026, and therefore could be called a 4th or even 5th generation light source.<P>

The workshop was set up to promote linac SASE FEL (not officially of course). It took a lot of my effort to convey this message on the very last plenary session. As result, the chairman of the Workshop, Prof. J-L. Laclare, said in this closing speech, that "..while we were discussing 4th generation light sources, we have overlook that they exist, like one at Duke University..".  After all, they included in the general conclusion the figure I provided.<P>

This is the summary of most important facts that emerged from the workshop:
O.  There is an excellent scientific case for 4th generation light source.<BR>
1.  According to the response from "users" groups 1&2, the most important figure of merit for applications is the well established one of average spectral brightness. Peak brightness and photon flux have very limited requests from the user community. In addition, coherence of the source is a very attractive feature for the most applications. <BR>
2.  It is feasible (Group 2&4) to design a 4th generation storage ring with emittance of 0.2-0.4 nm. Therefore, it is feasible to extend storage ring FEL oscillators into the X-ray region. <BR>
3.  4th generation storage ring synchrotron light sources will have at least the same level of brightness as linac driven SASE FEL. Only storage ring FELs incorporating high harmonics generation could bring 3-4 orders high brightness. <BR>
4.  The VUV range will be dominated by storage ring FELs with brightness ~1026 . Extension to the soft-X-ray region seems feasible in the near future. 
5.  Linac drive FELs with 1 ps - 100 fs pulses are suited mostly for a limited number of ultra-fast processes. <BR>
6.  The suggested linac driven SASE FEL divided the opinions of the audience: advocates of these systems (from Stanford and DESY) are very enthusiastic about their prospects, while opponents see many obstacles on the way from 8 mm SASE FEL (the only ones operational) to 0.5 angstrom SASE FEL. Successful demonstration or failure of intermediate wavelength operation (in VUV?) could resolve this division. By Laclare's opinion, linac driven FELs could succeed storage ring sources at best in 15-20 years. <BR>
7.   Meanwhile, the synchrotron radiation community is  expecting results from XUV storage ring FELs, i.e. from Duke and Delta. You have first hand information from Duke where OK-4 project has no priority and proceeds in slow fashion. The Delta project is in a very advanced stage, even though they were far behind Duke two years ago. They have all the chances to beat us if we can not find means to facilitate OK-4 project.<P>

Overall, the meeting was extremely fruitful and informative. The Duke FEL lab and the MFEL program could achieve a historical bench mark with very decent effort. The MFEL program choice to support the first 4th generation light source, namely Duke/OK4 XUV FEL, is and will be within the main-stream of cutting-edge technology in light source applications.<P>

On my way to Grenoble, I stopped in Paris to visit the L.U.R.E. laboratory (Orsay) and to discuss 1) mirror degradation issues at the Super-ACO FEL; and 2) stabilization of the time jitter of the FEL micro pulse.<P>

These issues are relevant to the Duke storage ring OK-4 XUV FEL for MFEL research. Stability of the mirror reflectivity is critical for continuous runs and high efficiency of the MFEL applications. Time jitter is crucial for MFEL pump-probe experiments where sub-picosecond stability is required. The following results emerged from this visit: <BR>
1) Initial mirror degradation could be prevented by gradual increase of the exposure to severe soft-X-Ray radiation from the FEL wigglers. In practical terms, this can be accomplished by the gradual increase of the operating current or by manipulation with the X-ray beam shutter. Vacuum pressure near the mirror surface must be maintained below 10-9 Torr to prevent initial degradation. This information is not published by the Super-ACO group . As a result, we have modified the design of the OK-4 mirror system to include additional vacuum gauges and monitors. The X-ray shutter was included in the original (Novosibirsk) design of the OK-4 optical resonator. <BR>
2) Time jitter of FEL micro pulses was suppressed at Super-ACO FEL to picosecond level using the dissector (produced by Novosibirsk BINP) in "time slit" mode. The dissector continuously monitors photon density at a particular RF phase and this signal is used for the feedback of its phase. Super-ACO group uses one dissector for feed-back and a second for observation. Most interesting was the specifics of the implementation of it for FEL control and its effect on the FEL stability. So far, Super-ACO FEL could operate stable with this feed-back, and its radiation is used for material science. Here at Duke, we have three dissectors and one spare dissector tube, but lack some support instrumentation (synthesizers, amplifiers, scopes). Therefore. implementation of a similar technique is very straight forward. It would be useful if Duke XUV FEL will operate in near UV range (-350 nm), which is not a priority for the MFEL program. Overall, my visit to Orsay, the only operating storage ring FEL in the western hemisphere, was very fruitful.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
Representatives from ONR, NMRI and USUHS visited a number of Indian institutions to explore opportunities for joint research.  Of particular interest are India's Drugs from the Sea Program, a partnership between the National Institute of Oceanography in Goa and the Central Drug Research Institute in Lucknow.  USUHS researchers are collaborating with this program to evaluate promising compounds for protection from hypoxic injury.  Indian facilities for non-human primate research, shipboard toxicology, and tropical medicine also warrant follow-up.  Protection of intellectual property rights will be an issue in all collaborative projects.<P>

<B>2. Purpose of Visit</B><BR>

(3) Discussions with representatives for Chandrigarh centered around their clinical interests and facilities in Chandrigarh.<P>

<B>5. Brief Account of Significant Data Acquired</B><BR>
The purpose of the trip was to explore the potential for collaboration and utilization of unique resources available in India that could be leveraged by the Navy's Biomedical program.<BR>
a.  New Delhi<BR>
Most of the discussion in Delhi centered on the resources available in India and protection of intellectual property as a result of any collaboration with the Navy. There was willingness for a free and open collaboration with the Navy expressed by everyone we visited. Part of this is undoubtedly motivated by the fact that the India Rupee fund is in its last years, and a significant source of research funds will no longer be available. The major concern expressed by the Indians was that Indian intellectual property laws were at present inadequate to completely protect Indian investigators. However Dr. Mashlekar, Director General of CSIR, stated that he felt that this problem could be overcome by negotiating intellectual property agreement: on an individual basis and not relying solely on current Indian laws. Of equal concern to both the India and U.S. sides was that everyone involved in any collaboration benefit; that the collaboration could not be a one way street and that information, resources and any eventual products be made available to all involved parties.<BR>
The U.S. Embassy expressed the same optimism that there were scientific resources in India that could be capitalized on. However, they also felt that it was extremely important that any project done in collaboration with an Indian research institution be closely monitored with clearly stated goals and expectations and a minimum of two site visits per year to insure that the project was proceeding as planned. The embassy is willing to help in the monitoring effort and has done so for other projects funded by the U.S. in India.<BR>
b.  Goa<BR>
The National Institute of Oceanography in collaboration with the Central Drug Research Institute in Lucknow directs a program on Drugs from the Sea. This program seeks to exploit marine biota from Indian waters for bioactive substances. The oceans controlled by India have a greater biodiversity than any other region, but they are closed to outside countries. In order to gain access to any drugs it is essential to collaborate with NIO. Several promising drugs have been identified. In the past year the Biological Oceanography Department has collected twenty eight marine species from intertidal areas along the central west, northwest, and northeast coasts of India, and 46 species from subtidal regions from the Lakshadweep, central west, and southeast coasts of India. To date a total of 123 marine species have been authenticated and confirmed as having bioactive potential. The Chemical Oceanography Department in collaboration with CDRI has screened extracts from these samples and is carrying out chemical studies to isolate and characterize the active principles of the organisms having significant bioactivity. Several novel alkaloids with antibiotic properties have been extracted from the sponge Haliclona sp. Several amino acids with hypoglycemic activity have been identified from the sponge Tedania anhelans. A compound active against Leishmania has been characterized and purified from the mangrove. Additionally, many more partially characterized compounds could prove useful in treating combat casualties. A collaboration between NIO, CDRI and Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences is being established to test some of these compounds for their ability to protect cells from the effects of hypoxia.<BR>
c.  Lucknow<BR>
Most of the discussions in Lucknow were with members of the Central Drug Research Institute. CDRI screens 800 newly synthesized compounds and extracts of 100 plants and 150 marine flora/fauna annually through about 170 in vitro/in vivo tests. Synthetic compounds and natural products showing promising activity are then selected for development as new drugs. CDRI has the capability of taking a promising drug through preclinical pharmacology, toxicology, development of dosage forms, quality control and bulk production procedures. They have excellent ties with pharmaceutical firms both within and outside India. A collaborative effort between Dr. Rahda Maheshwari, Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, and CDRI is already in place. With support from ONR, Dr. Maheshwari is beginning to characterize promising compounds from CDRI for their ability to protect from hypoxic injury.<BR>
One of the major resources at CDRI is their animal facilities. They have extensive animal quarters housing approximately 6500 animals ranging from small rodents to non-human primates. The ability to test new drugs in non-human primates in the United States has become difficult both because of cost and availability of animals. It is my understanding that the animal facilities have been accredited by NIH and that accreditation under DOD guidelines should not be difficult. CDRI represents a resource that should be capitalized on in DOD's drug development efforts. Pre-clinical studies in non-human Primates could be done more readily and at a significant cost savings.<BR>
The Industrial Toxicology Research Centre is responsible for the majority of the environmental monitoring and research that occurs in India. Their major laboratory is outside of Lucknow and we did not have an opportunity to visit it. However, they are in the process on installing inhalation chambers as part of an inhalation toxicology program. Once this facility is operational, there may be opportunities for NMRI's Toxicology Detachment to collaborate with ITRC on shipboard toxicology issues.
Although the Institute at Chandigarh does extensive research, their 1500 bed hospital largely devoted to tropical diseases was of most interest, especially to NMRI. The possibility of a follow-up visit to Chandigarh for members of the Infectious Disease Program at NMRI is being explored. Also it may be possible to send medical students from USUHS for a rotational assignment in Tropical Medicine to Chandigarh. USUHS did send students to another Indian hospital in Pilani last year for the first time.<P>

<B>6. Unusual Observations and Happenings</B><BR>
In addition to our visits to government agencies and research institutions in India, we participated in CDRI's Annual Day. The highlight of the day was the Mellanby Memorial Oration. Sir Edward Mellanby, an eminent British medical scientist, was the first Director of CDRI. It was Dr. Mellanby who set the tone, temper and direction of the scientific work at CDRI. This year the Mellanby Memorial Oration, "New Paradigms for Partnership - A case of the Indian Pharmaceutical Industry", was delivered by Dr. Parvinder Singh. Dr. Sing is Chairman and Managing Director of Ranbaxy Laboratories Limited, New Delhi. The theme of his talk was that the emerging economic climate in India calls for changes in the research and development culture, greater industry and academic interaction and the protection of intellectual property rights in the country. The capabilities in basic science and technology in India need to be developed in a cohesive manner. The key to the future lies in the mission of collective strengths, be they national or international. Following Dr. Singh's presentation I gave a few brief remarks. In the afternoon, the 1995-1996 annual report was presented and the progress of CDRI over the last year was reviewed.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
	The Conference on Mechanics and Physics of Layered Materials in Davos, Switzerland, August 1995, brought together materials scientists and specialists in mechanics to discuss the processing, properties and applications of layered materials.  The author describes notable papers, and notes that there were fewer on functionally graded materials, intermetallics and nanophase materials than anticipated due to the large number on mechanics considerations in conventional particle or fiber-reinforced composites <P>

The conference was attended by about eighty-five scientists and engineers, most from the United States and Western Europe.  However, Prof Ichiro Shiota, a major figure in this field, presented an invited paper.<P>

The conference was noteworthy for bringing together materials scientists and specialists in mechanics to discuss the processing, properties and applications of layered materials.   While I had anticipated that much of the conference would be devoted to functionally gradient materials (FGM), in fact a large number of papers were devoted to behavior of conventional composite materials.<P>

Among notable papers on FGM were overviews by Ilschner of EPFL, Switzerland and Shiota of Kogakuin Univ., Japan. Both of these researchers had been involved in organizing conferences on FGM, and so were able to give a good overall perspective of the status of the field.  Particularly relevant to my own research on powder processing of intermetallic compounds was a session devoted to Processing and Characterization.  FGM and nanolayer composite preparation were discussed by Mortenson of MIT and Nastasi et al of Los Alamos, respectively.  Several other papers also were presented on nanocyrstalline microstructures, indicative of increasing interest in this class of materials. These papers were relevant to our own planned entry into the field of nanocrystalline intermetallics.     <P>                                                                                                                                                                                                     A paper by Lavernia et al on use of spray atomization to prepare layered composites was of interest because of our previous work on layered alumina/silicide composites by plasma spraying.<P>

Apart from research on nanocrystals, I was particularly interested in the fatigue results of Rao and Ritchie of Berkeley on Mechanisms of Fatigue Crack Extension in TiAl/TiNb Layered Composites and a related paper on Ductile Phase Toughening of Intermetallic Laminates by Ghosh and Pickard of Univ. of Michigan. Our own work on intermetallic matrix composites has largely been concerned with developing increased toughness relative to the brittle aluminide or silicide matrices that we are studying. The metallurgical factors affecting toughness were described in both of these papers.<P>

Other notable papers presented by European and Japanese researchers are as follows:<P>

Yan and Harris of University of Nottingham presented one of the few papers dealing with nanophase materials. They reported on nano-laminated zinc alloys produced by electrodeposition. Transmission electron microscopy was used to reveal the microstructure in Zn-ZnO laminates. L. Coast-Smith of University of Surrey reported on the microstructures of titanium-base nanolaminates produced by physical vapor deposition. Layer thicknesses of 10-1000nm were produced, with overall laminate thicknesses of up to 2mm. The mode of growth of the layers changed from epitaxial at low temperature, of the order of 150C to non-epitaxial at 350C.  Neubrand and Rodel of Technische Hochschule Darmstadt also reported on an electrochemical technique, in their case to prepare metal-ceramic FGMs. Preforms were produced by anodic oxidation of carbon in a graded electric potential, followed by infiltration with ceramic slurries and carbon burnout. They also presented a model of the electrode kinetics that control the gradient in microstructures.<P>

Microwave sintering of layered materials including alumina-steel, zirconia steel and zirconia with copper or nickel oxides was described by Willert-Porada et al of Universtat Dortmund, Germany.  Microwaves were used to accomplish pressureless sintering by generating a sharp temperature gradient due to selective heating of the different phases. Thermal cycling and mechanical loss measurements were used to characterize interfacial bonds.<P>

T. Kajikawa of Shonan Inst. of Technology in Japan reported on FGM materials for thermoelectric, thermionic and photovoltaic energy conversion methods in Japan.  FGM materials were shown to enhance the performance of thermoelectrics over large temperature ranges.<P>

Several papers were concerned with fracture behavior in graded materials. A. Horsewell et al of RISO in Denmark reported on the micromechanisms of fracture in multilayered materials with weak, ductile or porous interfaces.  In situ observations of crack propagation were made in an environmental Scanning Electron Microscope, using a specially designed bend apparatus.  Double cantilever beam specimens were developed to permit observation of long, stable cracks in brittle ceramics.  Other papers dealing with fracture phenomena in layered structures were presented in two sessions on fracture and fatigue.  Shaw et al of Cambridge University reported on the fracture behavior of ceramic-metal multilayers.  High resolution moire' interferometry was used to measure elastic and plastic strain distributions around cracks in laminates consisting of ductile and brittle layers.  Fracture mode diagrams were developed from these data; this is the latest example of deformation or fracture maps from the Cambridge group, led by M. F. Ashby.  Lesuer et al of Lawrence Livermore, Alcoa and Case Western Univ. presented results of studies of fracture toughness and impact properties of laminated metal composites, especially those based on aluminum.  Important variables included volume fraction of phases, layer thicknesses and interfacial properties.   The effects of processing methods on properties was discussed.  Interfacial structure and properties also were the subjects of papers by Carpenter et al of Arizona State Univ. and Howard et al of Cambridge University.  Carpenter et al reported on high resolution electron microscopic techniques to study the structure and chemistry of composite interfaces.  Howard et al reported on delamination cracking in ceramic composites.  The role of residual stresses produced on cooling from processing temperatures was emphasized.  An analytical model of the delamination resulting from these stresses was presented.<P>

Overall, I was disappointed that more work on intermetallics and nanophase materials was not reported. The extension of subject matter to mechanics considerations in conventional particle or fiber-reinforced composites diluted the impact of the conference.  However, speakers on the latter subjects were exposed to microstructural considerations, and vice-versa, in a setting where there were no parallel sessions to distract.  In my own work at Rensselaer I am increasingly interacting with engineers and mathematicians to model my experimental results, and this Conference helped to foster these collaborations.  However future meetings on layered materials would benefit from more consideration of potential and actual application of layered materials. Except for the talk by Shiota, there was little mention of applications at the meeting, although two sessions devoted to fatigue and fracture are relevant to industrial usage of these materials.<P>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
The Conference on Hyperbolic Conservation Laws was held at the Oberwolfach Mathematics Research Institute, Germant, 28 April - 3 May 1996. The Conference covered recent theoretical and computational advances in solving hyperbolic systems of conservation laws, and the application of the new ideas to solving problems in fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, phase transitions, and two phase fluid flows.  Proponents of different numerical schemes presented the advantage of their methods for multi-dimensional problems; the theoretical advances presented were limited to problems with special geometry.  The author describes many of the theoretical contributions.<P>

<B>2.  Narrative</B><BR>
The Conference was devoted to discussions of recent theoretical and computational advances in solving hyperbolic systems of conservation laws and the application of the new ideas to solving problems in fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, phase transitions, and two phase fluid flows.<P>

The workshop began on Monday April 28 with a discussion of numerical methods for multi-dimensional fluid flows. This topic was continued throughout the week, with proponents of multi-dimensional Godunov like schemes, advection like schemes, relaxation schemes, multi-grid and Lax-Richtmyer like schemes each presenting the advantages of their methods for multi-dimensional problems ( The speakers in this group were M. FEY , ETH ZURICH; C.W. SHU, BROWN; D. SILIDIKOVER, ICASE; B. COCKBURN, MINNESOTA; S. SZEPPESY, STOCKHOLM; E. TADMOR, UCLA; S.JIN, GATECH; S. KARNI, COURANT; B. PERTHAME, PARIS; B. ENGQUIST, UCLA).<P>

On the theoretical side multi-dimensional results were limited to problems with special geometry.  This once again points out the gap between rigorous theory and computation at the level of multi-dimensional problems.  The special geometry of spherical symmetry was exploited by G-Q CHEN, NORTHWESTERN, who used the method of compensated compactness to prove existence for isentropic fluid flow for an exterior initial value problems.  On the other hand for a problem that will not exhibit shock waves, D. SERRE, ENS-LYON, showed for special multi-dimensional flows with outgoing
flow as initial data the hyperbolic conservation laws of the compressible Euler equation have global in time continuous solutions.  SERRE's results seem impressive and may lead to other results of this kind in other applications.<P>
	
The other  theoretical talks during the week dealt with one dimensional space dimension problems. The major result on uniqueness of solutions with shocks was given by its discoverer A. BRESSAN, SISSA-TRIESTE.  BRESSAN'S result gives a class of systems of hyperbolic conservation laws that possess unique weak solutions. It seems likely that BRESSAN's papers will be for the 1990's what DI PERNA and TARTAR's revolutionary papers were for the 1980's.<P>

Other theoretical results were presented by SLEMROD, WISCONSIN, on understanding the physical basis of modeling metastable states in hyperbolic conservation laws based on models arising in kinetic modeling;  P. LE FLOCHE, PARIS, who spoke on diffusion and dispersion effects in hyperbolic conservation laws; and P. SOUGANDIS, WISCONSIN, who presented results of research existence and stability for isentropic gas dynamics.  This work extended earlier results of DI PERNA and CHEN to a larger range of equations of state.  H. FREISTULLER, AACHEN, gave results on stability of viscous shock profiles.  J. GREENBERG, CMU, generalized a model of SLEMROD and placed it in a relaxation kinetic like format.  M. SHEARER, NC STATE, presented work with D SCHAEFFER on slow flow of granular materials.  T. RUGGIERI, BOLOGNA, and I. MULLER, BERLIN, both discussed MULLER's well known theory of extended thermodynamics.  RUGGIERI showed when subsystems of the equations of extended thermodynamics are well behaved, i.e. can be written in symmetric hyperbolic form and possess a convex "entropy" in the sense of Lax.  MULLER's talk applied the extended thermodynamics to a rarefied gas to obtain an associated dispersion relationship.  The result is particularly interesting in that it points out the failure of the classical viscous-Fourier heat conduction theory to provide results consistent with experiment for rarefied gases.  A. TZAVARAS, WISCONSIN, described his results on resolving the Riemann problem for systems of N- hyperbolic conservation laws where N is arbitrary via the method of self-similar viscous limits.  Y. ZHENG ,SUNY-SB, gave her theory of nonlinear thermo-viscoelasticity and the roles of viscosity and heat conduction in damping waves. Finally Z. XIN , COURANT, provided results on existence of solutions to boundary value problems for hyperbolic systems of conservation laws. This provided for a lively discussion of this interesting area and its role in the study of boundary layers.<P>

15th International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering (OMAE96)</H3>

Travel Period:  16-21 June 1996<P>

<I>Keywords:  active vibration control; offshore platforms; tuned absorbers</I><P>

<B>1.  Summary  </B><BR>
Tuned vibration absorbers have been used in machinery and land structures for decades.  OMAE96 presented an opportunity to discuss research supported by the URI on stochastic mechanics, relative to use of tuned vibration isolators in ocean engineering.  Semiactive vibration control, implemented by varying structural parameters, appears feasible, promising, and underutilized in ships and offshore platforms.<P>

<B>2.  Discussion</B><BR>
During the period 16-21 June 1996 I took part in the OMAE'96 Conference, as a PI and a representative of the WPI group of the ONR-URI Grant recipients (SMARG, or Stochastic Mechanics and Analysis Research Group). The purpose of the travel was twofold (which is probably the case with any scientific conference):
<OL>
<LI>To present our own research results and get some feedback from the community of ocean engineers.
<LI>To see what other people are doing, so as to get some inspiration for future studies (in terms of directions of research, methods, etc.).
</OL>
	For the case reported here, due to a specific nature of our presentation, as described briefly in the following, the first goal was regarded as being more important. The presentation, "Tuned Vibration Absorbers for Floating Bodies", involved a proposal to use tuned absorbers for passive vibration control of offshore platforms, ships, etc., together with a theoretical analysis of their efficiency. This analysis indicated feasibility of the approach to vibration control and provided guidelines for the absorber design. <BR>
	Actually, tuned absorbers have been used for at least 60 years in rotating machinery, and for at least 20 years in civil engineering (say, for tall buildings and chimneys, excited by wind). Therefore we certainly expected that our idea to use them in ocean engineering was not new, although we could not find any relevant publications (neither could the reviewers of the "Journal of Vibration and Control", where our paper is accepted). Thus, we expected some information of the available experience in the field.<BR> 
	The other kind of expected feedback was as outlined in the final statement of my presentation (on the July 19th). "Thus, the results of theoretical analysis demonstrate feasibility of the approach, so that (at least) model water tank tests seem worthwhile, and we would appreciate any support for designing,   building and testing an appropriate model".<BR>
	The presentation generated interest, and there was a rather lengthy discussion. Two points of the discussion may be mentioned here.<BR>
<DIR>     i) Two attendants from Norway referred to a known case of using "flaps" as vibration absorbers for a certain specific floating system ("Kystfangst"). They told me, that the project was abandoned eventually, but could not tell,  whether  it was because the whole idea didn't work, or because the engineers involved did not know how to implement it. Anyway, a telephone number was given of the organization involved (Harintek), and we certainly shall contact them.</DIR>
<DIR>	ii) An attendant from the USA offered the water tank facility at his institution for model tests.  Regretfully, he is from Texas, which is too far from Massachusetts. But this kind of moral support is still encouraging, although we would prefer to cooperate with one of the neighboring institutions, such as University of Rhode Island.</DIR>
	As for the second goal of participation in the Conference, it provided a lot of opportunities to become acquainted with various new trends in the ocean industry as a whole (Plenary Morning Session on the 17 June) and with specific research results in various aspects of Offshore Mechanics (see enclosed copy of the Conference program). Personally I was interested mostly in nonlinear vibration of moored structures, as excited by ocean waves, and choose to attend those presentations accordingly. <BR>
	This interaction with the community of ocean engineers proved to be very inspiring indeed for further research studies, in particular, for development of the semiactive vibration control for offshore platforms. The name implies active control (thus requiring response sensors and force actuators), however, without necessity of a large power supply to counteract huge fluid forces; the control is implemented just by varying structural parameters. Specific ideas of implementing such a control would be outlined in a Grant proposal, which our SMARG group intends to submit to ONR in the near future.<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>Sponsored visit programs send a foreign scientist
to visit a DoD facility, conference or Federal Government organization,
such as NOAA or NASA.  Usually the traveler gives a seminar on
his/her research at the destination and, often during these visits,
plans for future collaboration are made.  The traveler receives
a stipend or honorarium that covers round-trip airfare and per
diem expenses (by sponsoring organization):<BR>

<B>1.  Summary</B><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/jjnews1a.htm#soc">SOC</A> is UKs new $72 million ocean research center built from the ground up by combining related NERC laboratories and University of Southampton departments into single national research facility.  Operating on a $38 million dollar per annum budget, it has almost 1000 researchers, teaching staff and students.  The integrated facility encourages development of projects that may not otherwise form due to the proximity of researchers and the merger appears to be producing some high quality results.  SOC is home to the UK National Oceanographic Library and the Operations Office for NERC Research Vessels Services.   A major contributor to European ocean sciences, SOC has developed some unique large infrastructure facilities such as <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/jjnews1a.htm#tobi">TOBI</A> and <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/jjnews1a.htm#gloria">GLORIA</A> which can be used cheaply by members of the EU.  Other unique ocean technologies developed on site (e.g. SeaSoar and AUTOSUB-1) are indicative of the high quality work continuing there.  With strong connections to national and European ocean research groups and historical long term relations to the US, SOC has great potential as an entry point for joint US/European collaborative research ventures.    <P>

<A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/jjnews1a.htm#soc">Southampton Oceanography Centre</A> (SOC) is a new $72 million purpose-built development recently opened in April 1996.  It is located along Empress Dock on the southern side of historic Southampton, just over an hours train ride from London and is easily accessible by rail, air, auto and ship.  SOC has an excellent World Wide Web page located at http://www.soc.soton.ac.uk which gives a description of its facilities and research programs.  Operating on a $38 million per annum budget, it has nearly 1000 researchers, teaching staff and students.  For general inquiries to the center, phone 44-1703-596666.  This newsletter contains general information and impressions derived from the authors visit to SOC on 13-14 June with the Technical Director of ONR Europe, Dr Craig Dorman.<P>

The UK government has been pushing since the 70s and 80s to operate more efficiently to reduce cost and eliminate duplication of effort - in essence, make government supported facilities self reliant and accountable.  For research laboratories, this meant establishing a close association with industry or academia.  SOC owes it origins to this concept and is a joint venture of the Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) and the University of Southampton.  In the 80s, the House of Lords conceived the idea of combining the oceanographic research efforts of the Institute of Oceanographic Services (IOS), the University of Southampton, the Institute of  Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR) and other ocean research facilities into a single center.  Southampton was chosen based on several factors including its proximity to London and military facilities, available cheap land, top notch university departments (particularly in oceanography) and excellent dock facilities.  The port of  Southampton at the time was in a period of decline and disuse, but has since been making a remarkable economic recovery.  Today, it is perhaps healthier than in its historic heyday when it was port to the famous Cunard Lines "Queen" ships.<P>

<B>3.  Facilities</B><BR>
The architects charged with designing SOC were on board from the start.  The 125-year land lease (with an option for another 125 years) influenced the design of the building to be one that should be in use for at least 125 years.  Expected users were contacted, environmental factors taken into account and the building was designed from the ground up.  The building is integrated rather than having separate buildings allowing those with interest in the same project from different disciplines to interact, which leads to good cross fertilization of ideas.  Labs are grouped by subject area (biology, chemistry, geology, etc) reducing duplication.  Researchers from university and NERC backgrounds work side by side.  There are only three workspace floors which reduces the sense of separation within the building.  False floors, one for each workspace level, were incorporated in the design to carry the horizontal distribution of electrical and mechanical services.  This allows much of the maintenance to be done without shutting down labs for any significant time.  At the corners of the building are "nodes" which allow for vertical distribution of services.  The use of nodes basically allows any type labs to be put on any floor in the building since they can be easily vented.<P>

There are only a few notable shortfalls in the design.  Making minor changes (such as moving power outlets) seem to cost an inordinate amount of money.  Also, essentially all money went into the building design and not into buying new equipment.  The equipment came from the old facilities.  There was insufficient money to have everything in the design built at once.  As a result, the construction of a bridge which will give public access to the facility is still to be built, however the building was designed with viewing by the public in mind with a large cafeteria and scenic views of the dock, etc, already in place.  <P>

Port facilities are excellent.  The SOC building sits adjacent to a wide loading area at the dock.  The block covered loading area is holding up well despite cranes and other heavy equipment regularly crossing over it.  Empress Dock is well protected and has easy access to the main shipping channel.  Ship services lead from the building to the edge of the dock and are out of the way and well protected while cargo is hauled around.  The "boneyard" is well organized, however it will have to be carefully controlled as years of use could lead to congestion in what seems to be a fairly small area.  Most of the oceanographic gear used at sea is designed to be self supporting and easily containerized so it can be used on a variety of platforms.  This important feature allows equipment such as the <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/jjnews1a.htm#tobi">TOBI</A> and <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/jjnews1a.htm#gloria">GLORIA</A> sea floor survey systems to be readily and cheaply available to EU countries as "large infrastructure facilities." <P>

NERCs Research Vessel Services (RVS) has its operations office located at SOC.  The three vessels, <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/jjnews1a.htm#rvs">RRS Discovery</A>, RRS Charles Darwin and RRS Challenger, are highly capable for oceanographic work and are available for commercial charter for long and short term voyages.  Discussions with RVS superintendent, Dr Charles Fay, indicate the sharing algorithm is an interesting points based system.  Unfortunately for us,  all three ships were underway during our visit so we were unable to get a first hand look.  <P>

SOC is also home to the UK National Oceanographic Library, one of the largest sources of oceanographic references in the world.  The library is skillfully managed and is in the process of converting many of its resources to electronic format for easy accessibility over Internet.<P>
 
<B>4.  Specific Interest Items.</B><BR>
We were given tours and briefs of most major divisions over the two day visit.  In such a short time at such a large facility, you can only get a flavor of  the work going on.  One very positive result precipitating from the merger of NERC and university resources into a single facility is the integrated research. Though links have always existed among researchers at various facilities, the close proximity encourages greater interaction and collaboration.  Combined processes crossing several disciplines are studied simultaneously from a single project.  Using a myriad of  sensors on specially designed platforms, many of which have been developed on site, brings a broader perspective into a finding relationships and developing new hypotheses.  Here is a sampling of what was demonstrated.<P>

<DIR>a.  The results of  hydrographic and <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/jjnews1a.htm#bioac">bioacoustic</A> surveys using equipment like <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil/jjnews1a.htm#seasoar">SeaSoar</A> and Simrad EK500 3-frequency scientific sounder system (both developed at IOS Deacon Lab, now part of SOC) along with Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCPs) and other measurements showed some interesting high resolution structures in the top 500 meters of the water which may have been previously undetected.   The interdependency in biological, chemical and physical properties measured simultaneously are spawning new concepts while eliminating some old ideas derived from less integrated measurements.</DIR><P>
 
<DIR>b.   AUTOSUB-1, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) being developed at SOC, was started as a NERC Community Research Project in 1988.  At the time of our visit,  the AUTOSUB had just completed testing using just a simple umbilical cord and performed extremely well.  Its development is on schedule and is now essentially ready for its first autonomous operation.  There is a wide variety of users that have already been identified such as the Defence Research Agency,  Ministry of Defence and offshore industry.  Some of the initial tasking to prove its reliability are to measure fluxes across the continental shelf edge; measure mesoscale parameters in surface, intermediate and deep water masses; operate under sea-ice and shelf ice; and conduct long oceanic sections on the order of 100 to 2000 km in length.  It will have links with ongoing and planned programs at the national and international levels such as WOCE, GOOS, CLIVAR, GLOBEC, JGOFS.  In view of the highly productive collaborations between UK and US involving ONR, Dr Gwyn Griffiths (Head of the Ocean Technology Division) is keen to explore the possibilities arising out of the AUTOSUB program.</DIR><P>

<DIR>c.  SOC houses the WOCE International Project Office (IPO).  The World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) is a component of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) established by WMO and ICSU. The WOCE field phase continues through 1997, an extension to the 1990-1996 period needed due to delays in satellite launches and building  and refitting ships.  In April 1995, WOCE was extended to 2002 in a phase of Analysis, Interpretation, Modeling and Synthesis (AIMS) where the data will be put to use.  WOCE also looks to CLIVAR (WCRP program on climate variability and predictability) to carry forward several key observations started by WOCE and ultimately allow the WOCE data set to be assessed in relation to decadal and longer term ocean variability.  The WOCE IPO produces annual summaries of the WOCE field program, highlighting achievements and shortfalls.  This office can be reached via e-mail at woceipo@soc.soton.ac.uk.</DIR><P>

These are a mere sampling of the type of work going on at SOC.  In this new facility where the concept of operations is not yet "cast in stone", they are finding the areas where projects can naturally evolve.  A good example is studying the mid-ocean ridge where two areas of expertise for this facility, geology and oceanography, are naturally joined.  By having SOC, multidisciplinary projects have greater impetus to actually form and develop where they may not have otherwise.  <P>

<B>5.   Comments</B><BR>
The visit to SOC proved to be both very impressive and worthwhile.  The new facility is a fascinating structure and the high quality science and technology going on is evident.  The staff provided insight to the challenges and changes being faced by UK oceanographic researchers today and how they are facing them.  One notable impression was the shift in focus in UK oceanographic research to a more "eurocentric" outlook with perhaps less US involvement.  It is a natural evolution with the developing EU to look more towards their "own backyard" with money pooled from European sources (both EU and industry), sharing of European resources and lower travel costs, but it is likely to come at the expense of less "extra-European" involvement in their research effort.  SOC staff, however, still seem to have a strong interest in maintaining and building collaborative UK-US research efforts.  Though the shift in focus towards European partnerships is an economic reality and could lead to missed opportunities for joint US research that have historically developed, it may open new avenues as well.  I suspect it  may become more difficult to get a foot in the door in some areas, but US support and involvement in European partnerships can still benefit all players through sharing of some very unique equipment, databases and approaches to  research.<P>     

SOC is emerging as UKs parallel to the large US ocean research institutes like Woods Hole and Scripps.  It is a superb research facility though it is still determining its direction as a result of merging NERC and the university.  It has strong connections to DRA, Ministry of Defence and European large infrastructure facilities.  Though still in its infant stages, it appears to have had a very successfully start and the outlook is bright.  In terms of cooperative opportunities, SOC may be one of the best entry points for joint US/European efforts.<P>

<H1>UNITED STATES ARMY RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND STANDARDIZATION GROUP (UNITED KINGDOM)</H1>

<H1><I>"SEARCH FOR TOMORROW"</I></H1><P><HR><P>

<H2>LETTER FROM THE COMMANDER</H2><P>

	The information on this home page contains an overview of the US Army's Research, Development and Standardization Group - United Kingdom (USARDSG-UK), a subordinate Command of Headquarters, US Army Materiel Command (HQ AMC).<P>

	We can see from the world's changing economic environment defense cooperation is considerably more than just armaments cooperation and security assistance (Foreign Military Sales).  Today it includes coalition warfare, cooperative logistics, industrial cooperation and joint testing.  The recent change in US political attitude reflected in the expansion of "economic borders" created by the North American Free Trade Treaty will make defense cooperation a larger and more necessary part of the defense industrial complex of the future.  The mission of our USARDSGs worldwide, as fostering international cooperative programs, will grow and adapt as the world order, policy and changes continue.<P>

	The establishment of international programs is more important now than ever before.  The best of these programs begins with idea exchange and lasts through the complete equipment life cycle gaining support from, and providing program benefit to, each member nation.  Successful international programs are tailored to respective national needs and expertise and make sense politically, economically and militarily.  Multinational programs provide a peacetime workload that is supportable in war and consistently demonstrates fewer cost increases.  From such programs the ideal of Standardization of equipment and procedures becomes an automatic and most important benefit.<P>

	In the future, US military research, development and acquisition (RD&A) expenditures will be emphasized over operations and maintenance (O&M) funds allowing more potential for cooperation.  This is a strong, continued investment in our technological future that may be maximized by cooperative programs.<P>

	In addition to the generally stated mission and function of the USARDSG as the "frontline" representatives of the Army Materiel Command, our officers are committed to paving the way for cooperation.  Some of the ways we see forward are: consideration of cooperative programs early, avoiding duplication of R&D effort, and supporting early harmonization of military requirements.<P>

	The United Kingdom (UK) is serious about competition, resulting in 75% of its acquisitions made through competition.  The UK has demonstrated an equal commitment to international cooperation.  The UK continues to be an involved member of many international fora to foster such cooperation and are committed  to standardization and interoperability issues.  Our collective experience in coalition warfare has made it abundantly clear that the special relationship between the US and the UK is still an important one and US/UK continued cooperation is the way ahead.<P>

HENRY J. ATWOOD, JR.<BR>
Colonel, Aviation<BR>
Commanding<P><HR><P>
<H2>WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE DO</H2><P>

	The US Army Research, Development and Standardization Group - United Kingdom (USARDSG-UK) represents the United States Army in the United Kingdom and selected European countries	in all matters concerning Rationalization, Standardization and Interoperability (RSI).  We are also a field office of our major Command, the US  Army Materiel Command (HQ, ACM) and its subordinate commands, and Army laboratories in scientific and technical matters in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Southwest Asia and the Former Soviet Union (FSU).  Our unique mission, relationships and abilities make us the international "common thread" for the US Army.  Our primary mission is based on two elements:<P>

a.	Rationalization, Standardization and Interoperability:<P>
	<UL><LI>	Improve bilateral relationships by effecting liaison with the UK Government agencies and industry in the futherance of American, British, Canadian and Australian (ABCA) materiel standardization and interoperability objectives.<P>
	<LI>	Enhance materiel standardization programs by responding to initiatives and developments from NATO countries.<P>
	<LI>	Foster international cooperation by participating in NATO panels, working groups and international conferences.<P>
	<LI>	Process requests for US and UK agencies for reciprocal use of equipment for test and evaluation.<P>
	<LI>	Assist Attachs and US Offices for Defense Cooperation and request assistance in return to foster goals of RSI.</UL><P>

b.	Research and Development:<P>

	<UL><LI>	Foster and administer the research program of the US Army in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Former Soviet Union (FSU) and Southwest Asia by coordinating research activities involving scientists and engineers, universities, research laboratories and both military and civilian professional societies.  Additionally, we encourage collaborative effort by financial support of European research efforts relevant to US Army's goals for the future and attendance at meetings, conferences, seminars and symposia.<P>
	<LI>	Maintain cognizance of scientific and technological developments in both military and foreign industrial research and development.  This is accomplished by continual technical liaison between US Army Standardization Officers and scientists with their numerous foreign counterparts.  This effort is further possible through strong liaison activities between US agencies (both in the US and Europe) and their European counterparts, often arranged and coordinated through this Command.  Through this activity, US and European counterparts optimize R&D dollars by working together.</UL><P>

	The resulting collaboration and cooperation fostered by our support and continued presence is constantly tailored to support our customers vital interests, facilitate standardization and technology transfer, improve bilateral relationships, support US  industry and the interests of our closest allies.  On the front line of cooperative activities we have few people and many diverse activities to support our customers in the achievement of these goals.  As US Army eyes and hands in Europe we: Assist, Accompany, Represent, Research, Facilitate, Report and Act.<P>

	As a result of the opening of the Iron Curtain countries and the FSU to the West, changes are taking place faster then policy can be generated to cover the opportunities.  In this area USARDSG-UK has been in the forefront of the process to establish meaningful long term goals in these areas.  Through the applications of the US Army Science and Technology Master Plan, USARDSG-UK has been at the cutting edge of strategy for present and future activities in these areas.  Our officers and scientists have found excellence in science and engineering, high standards of basic education, strength in theoretical analysis and modeling, hard workers and problem solvers with a keen interest in collaboration with the US.  This work has been accomplished economically through exploitation of common interests of sister service R&D organizations, the Defence Attaches and Foreign Science and Technology teams.<P>

	In tandem with new opportunities and more diverse and greater mission requirements has come the reality of a new leaner "do more with less" Army.  In doing our part, USARDSG-UK has a current manning of 5 military and 12 civilian which is below the manning force of three years ago as we have had to pay our share of the reduction of Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE).<P>

	I would be remiss if I failed to recognize the contributions of dedicated people at USARDSG-UK who, through fat times and lean, remain committed to the strategic vision of Army leadership to provide our soldiers with the winning technological edge.<P><HR><P>
<H2>OUR HISTORY....</H2><P>

	Our organization is descended from two groups which developed during and immediately following World War II to enhance technical coordination with European institutions and continue to foster the close cooperation that developed during the dark days of WWII.<P>

	The US Army Standardization Group, located in London, UK, grew out of the American, British, Canadian Australian (ABCA) wartime alliance in 1948 with a formal charter for the Group established by Lieutenant James Gain in 1955.  The group was concerned then, as now, with the rationalization, standardization and interoperability (RSI) of equipment, weapon systems and procedures used in the four armies comprising the association.  <P>

	In 1956 the European Research Office was established in Frankfurt, Germany, to provide technical liaison with European research efforts which have potential US Army interest.  Originally ERO was only concerned with European activities, but its working area was expanded in later years to include Africa, the Middle East, Southwest Asia and now the Former Soviet Union .  ERO relocated to London and merged with the Standardization Group to form the current organization in 1975.<P>

	In the early days, the Standardization Group was primarily concerned with the relationship between the US and British armies.  In 1970, the US sister service, research and development functions, joined the Standardization Group in Edison House forming a tri-service R&D establishment.<P>  

	In 1986, during the AMC reorganization, the USARDSG-UK was placed under the US Army Security Assistance Affairs Command (USASAAC).  Under a later reorganization it was restored to its present position as subordinate command to HQ AMC, under the Deputy Commanding General for International Cooperative Programs/Deputy Commanding General for Research, Development and Acquisition.  USARDSG-UK, as in past years, still emphasizes interaction with the British Army but, with moves toward a "Purple suit" acquisition process in the British defense forces and UK formations of industrial and defense alliances all over Europe, we have stepped up our awareness and interaction with Europe as a whole.  Another area of expansion for USARDSG-UK has been an increased awareness and working together with sister services to eliminate duplication of effort and maximize potential technology gains across the services as mandated by "Project Alliance".<P><HR><P>
 <H2>OUR SCOPE OF WORK.....</H2><P>

	The resulting collaboration and cooperation must be tailored to support both vital US Army interests and the interests of the appropriate national army or institution to be successful.  Many of USARDSG-UK's activities contribute to this overall goal.  Some of the many functions we perform are:<P>

<UL><LI>	Maintain close coordination with US/UK Army to identify research, development, testing and evaluation opportunities.<P>

	<LI>	Identify standardization and interoperability opportunities at  schools, laboratories and defence establishments at home and abroad and attempt  to link them.<P>

	<LI>	Advise, assist & influence Program Executive Officers, Program/Project Managers, and technical experts in laboratories and Army engineering and development centers of collaborative opportunities.  Then foster those opportunities through to fruition.<P>

	<LI>	Participate in multinational fora events in the United Kingdom
seeking research and development opportunities.<P>

	<LI>	Obtain and transmit US/UK combat developments data to foster improved interchange and eliminate duplication of effort.<P>

	<LI>	Identify and recommend non-developmental items, foreign
comparative test projects from host nation that meet a current US Army requirement.<P>

	<LI>	Recommend and coordinate PEO/PM and Technical Director visits to UK research and development establishments and combat development centers to foster joint programs.<P>

	<LI>Focus on critical technology developments in the UK and other selected European nations.<P>

	<LI>	Identify opportunities for Scientist and Engineer Exchange Program.<P>

	<LI>Assist and accompany selected visitors to UK defence  establish-ments and industry activities.<P>

	<LI>Coordinate equipment loans and maintain accountability for
loaned equipment to and from the US Army.<P>

	<LI>Coordinate and assist with establishment of international
agreements necessary to formalize international information interchange, and international programs/projects.<P>

	<LI>	Provide in-country support to the UK Ministry of Defence during contingency operations.</UL><P><HR><P>

<H2>STANDARDIZATION DIVISION</H2><P>

	The Standardization Division is principally concerned with achieving the maximum degree of Rationalization, Standardization and Interoperability (RSI) between the US Army and its European allies.  The Division is an active participant in the ABCA forum as delineated in the Basic Standardization Agreement, 1984, and the Quadripartite Standing Operating Procedures (QSOP), January 1985.  The Commanding Officer, USARDSG-UK, is the US Army Senior Standardization Representative in the United Kingdom and carries out liaison with the UK Ministry of Defence.  In this role, the Division officers strive to rationalize concepts, doctrines and Army organizational structures; standardize on materiel equipment when possible; and achieve the maximum degree of interoperability.  Tools used to achieve this end are to foster data exchanges under the ABCA agreement, to develop scientific data exchange agreements when warranted, and to encourage combined research and development to achieve the greatest possible economy of effort.  As part of its ABCA function, the Division circulates requirement documents for information and comment and arranges for the reciprocal use of equipment.  These same functions are performed with designated European countries though in a less structured way.<P>

	The Standardization Division has functional experts responsible for monitoring one or more of these mission areas: Armor; Infantry; Aviation; Air Defense; Combat Support; Engineering and Mine Warfare; Combat Service Support; Fire Support; Battlefield Nuclear Warfare; Nuclear, Biological; Chemical; Command and Control; Communications; and Intelligence and Electronic Warfare.<P>

	More Information on how the RSI functions are performed is contained in the ABCA Handbook and the ABCA QSOP.<P><HR><P>
 <H2>RESEARCH DIVISION</H2><P>

	Known as the European Research Office (ERO), this Division represents the Army laboratory community on scientific and technological matters in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Southwest Asia.  ERO fosters international dialogue and collaboration by support of workshops, conferences, liaison visits and R&D contracts.  Of interest are virtually all scientific and engineering disciplines where significant technological advances can be expected.  Proposals for R&D efforts are reviewed by Army laboratories and outside referees.  A primary goal of support is the development of collaboration with Army scientists.  All funded efforts are suitable for publication in open literature and presentation at open forums.<P>

	The Research Division has functional responsibility for the following disciplines: Mechanical Engineering, Materials, Electronics, Computer Science, Chemistry,  Physics, Environmental Science and Behavioral Science.<P>

	(A map showing the geographical locations of the US Army laboratories is attached.)<P>

<FONT SIZE=2>The Army, Navy and Air Force operate international
science and technology offices in London.  Co-located in one building,
they are the US Army Research, Development and Standardization
Group (USARDSG), the Office of Naval Research - Europe (ONREUR),
and the USAF European Office of Aerospace Research and Development
(EOARD).  This is the newsletter of the Tri-Service Working Group
for the <I>F</I>ormer <I>S</I>oviet <I>U</I>nion and <I>C</I>entral

<FONT SIZE=2>Sponsored visit programs send a foreign scientist
to visit a DoD facility, conference or Federal Government organization,
such as NOAA or NASA.  Usually the traveler gives a seminar on
his/her research at the destination and, often during these visits,
plans for future collaboration are made.  The traveler receives
a stipend or honorarium that covers round-trip airfare and per
diem expenses (by sponsoring organization):<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Sponsored visit programs send a foreign scientist
to visit a DoD facility, conference or Federal Government organization,
such as NOAA or NASA.  Usually the traveler gives a seminar on
his/her research at the destination and, often during these visits,
plans for future collaboration are made.  The traveler receives
a stipend or honorarium that covers round-trip airfare and per
diem expenses (by sponsoring organization):<BR>

<H3>Discrete element modelling<BR>
D. R J. Owen, A. Munjiza and N. Bicanic</H3>
<B>1. Introduction</B><P>
Finite element methods are well established in many branches of engineering and are now routinely used in the solution of large scale industrial problems. This situation has been brought about by the increased maturity of numerical analysis methods, particularly for non-linear problems, and dramatic developments in computer performances. The performance/cost ratio of computers continues to increase and this situation is set to continue - and even accelerate - with the emergence of workstation based parallel processing hardware.<P>
For some physical situations a finite element description is not, however, the most appropriate and a discontinuous approach is better suited to model the phenomenon concerned. Examples of such problems include the behaviour of jointed rock and granular material flow in silos. The treatment of these classes of problem is more naturally related to discrete element concepts, in which individual material elements are considered to be separate and are ( possibly ) connected only along their boundaries by frictional contact. Earlier work on these concepts was based on the assumption that each element was rigid, but later extension to include local deformation has permitted a more rigorous treatment of both the contact conditions and energy preservation requirements.<P>
The incorporation of deformation kinematics into the discrete element formulation has also lead naturally to a combined finite/ discrete element approach in which the problem is analysed by a combination of the two methods. This solution method is particularly suited to problems in which progressive fracturing takes place as is the case in rock blasting operations and missile impact simulations.<P>
The origins of the discrete element method can be traced to the late sixties. A model by Goodman, Taylor and Brekke [1], for example, was aimed at the simulation of jointed rock and was accomplished by introducing discontinuities into an existing continuum. In the early seventies, models based on the <I>a priori</I> assumption of discontinuous behaviour were introduced, with continuum behaviour being treated as a special case [2]. The methodology was initially applied to jointed rock systems, with later application being made to industrial processes such as granular media [3,4] and shear flow [5]. The set of methods developed was generally termed <I>the distinct element method</I>.<P>
Further development took place in the eighties with the incorporation of deformable behaviour for the more precise modelling of individual elements and the term <I>discrete element methods</I> became widely accepted. The continuum representation of individual elements was dealt with through polynomial approximation of the strain field [6,7] or by incorporation of central difference procedures [8]. Fracture models were either based on rigid fracture energy release rate concepts or on the breakage of cohesive links between discrete elements.<P>
Recent developments [9,10] have centred on improved physical models and associated computational algorithrns. Notable advances include improved contact detection and interaction algorithms and the introduction of advanced computational concepts ( parallel and distributed computing, object oriented programming and in core data bases ). 
 The following sections discuss the issues involved in the development of combined finite/discrete element methods; both from a theoretical viewpoint and some related algorithmic considerations essential for the efficient numerical solution of large scale industrial problems. Starting from a continuum representation by finite elements of the solid region in question, progressive fracturing is allowed to take place according to some fracturing criterion, thereby forming discrete elements which may be composed of one or more deformable finite elements. Subsequent motion of these discrete elements and further fracturing of both the remaining continuum and previously created discrete elements is then modelled. This evolution process is continued until either the system comes to rest or up to the time of interest. In essence, the main issues which require consideration are:
<UL>
<LI>Appropriate finite element modelling with a view to subsequent fracturing of the original continuum.
<LI>Development of fracture models.
<LI>Development of remeshing algorthms to convert fractured zones into a discrete element representation.
<LI>Contact detection procedures for discrete element regions.
<LI>Representation of frictional contact conditions for contacting elements.
<LI>For rock blast modelling, consideration of the interaction between the gas pressure and continuum/discontinuum deformation.
</UL>

In view of the complex geometrical changes which take place during an evolving finite/discrete element analysis, the use of graphical facilities for interpreting the results is mandatory; as are checking procedures for ensuring energy preservation and contact penetration conditions.<P>
<B>2. Contact Detection for Discrete Elements</B><P>
The boundary of each discrete element is represented by a finite number of predefined segments. A layer of material at the boundary is made distinct from the discrete element proper and assigned physical properties to facilitate the treatment of contact detection and inter-element contact forces. In particular, assuming that the element boundary is of finite (albeit small) thickness both simplifies contact detection and permits a better physical interpretation of the forces that develop as a result of contact.<P>
Problems of interest encompass both quasi-static and transient dynamic situations. Explicit time integration is employed for fully transient responses while dynamic relaxation techniques are utilised for quasi-static problems. For both cases, a penalty approach is used to impose the contact constraints, with the penalty terms being defined through the physical properties of the discrete element contact layer.<P>
The effective solution of large scale discrete element problems crucially relies upon robust and computationally effficient contact detection algorithms. A significant percentage of the total computational effort of a discrete element solution is associated with this task and consequently considerable research has been focused in this direction [11,12]. The standard procedures employed in conventional finite element codes for monitoring contact between specified surfaces are not suitable for the present application, since generally a large number (1000-10000) of contacting bodies may be involved.<P>
A suitable approach to contact detection for discrete elements is offered by the so-called BSD algorithm, in which B stands for binary tree, S denotes space decomposition and D relates to direct evidence search. As the name implies, the method is based on a combination of a binary tree structured space cell decomposition and a direct evidence search procedure. In this way, an effficient and flexible algorithm can be developed which is capable of monitoring contact between discrete elements of general shape and relative size for both loose and dense packing. The essential components of the algorithm are summarised below.<P>
The problem of contact detection is schematically illustrated in <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil:80/fig123.htm">Fig. 1</A>. In essence, it is necessary to determine for a given discrete element (the target body) which other elements (contactor objects) make contact. To achieve searching effficiency, a series of buffer zones are defined surrounding the target body as shown. For a small number (less than 100) of bodies a <I>direct evidence</I> approach, in which the location of each contactor element in relation to the target body is recorded for each target body in turn, is an efficient method of contact detection. For larger numbers of elements, however, such an approach becomes increasingly inefficient and more sophisticated methods based on tree structures must be employed. Therefore, for optimal effficiency a combined approach is adopted in which a binary tree searching procedure is used at selected intervals to determine which contactor points lie within the buffer zones of the target body followed by a direct evidence detection procedure for intermediate time steps.<P>
The <I>binary tree</I> searching procedure involves <I>space cell decomposition</I> which implies the systematic division of the region of interest into successive sub regions for the purpose of detecting which discrete elements occupy each sub region, followed by the recording of this information in a tree data structure. This procedure is illustrated in <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil:80/fig123.htm">Fig. 2</A>, in which the systematic subdivision of the searching space is shown, and in <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil:80/fig123.htm">Fig. 3</A>, which indicates the corresponding binary tree structure.<P>
The importance of an efficient approach to contact detection cannot be overemphasised, as the performance of a code in the solution of large scale problems is crucially linked to this aspect.<P>
<B>3. Element Modelling</B><P>
In a combined finite/discrete element simulation, elements must be employed for both phases which are capable of appropriately representing the material deformation. Although discrete elements are primarily introduced in problems that cannot be modelled by a continuum and where description of the large scale movement of particles is essential, it is still necessary to model discrete elements as deformable bodies for the purpose of monitoring their further fracture. Discrete elements undergo at least large translations and large rotations and in some cases large strains can also occur. This arises in rock blasting problems where the pressure load levels are extremely high and the rock is also subjected to highly constrained conditions. Therefore, for complete generality a finite strain formulation is necessary.<P>
The transition from a continuum to a discontinuum, or the further fracturing of a discrete element, requires introduction of a fracturing criterion. For quasi-brittle materials, the most convenient approach to fracture modelling is offered by softening plasticity (viscoplasticity) models which employ fracture mechanics concepts based on the energy required to open a crack or induce a shear slip. A crack is assumed to develop along the line of strain localisation, with the material softening law being related to the fracture energy release rate of the material. To avoid problems associated with mesh dependent solutions, a local control length based on the area related to each element Gauss POint must be introduced.<P>
 At the stage when the strength of the material in some Gauss point is reduced to zero, a crack is assumed to open and a remeshing procedure must be performed whenever element breakage occurs.<P>
<B>4. Gas Pressure Interaction</B><P>
In rock blasting problems, the interaction between the detonation gas pressure and the deformation of the rock mass results in a coupled transient dynamic problem, since the modelling of blast loading by a specified pressure-time history is only a crude approximation of the actual process; which involves a complex reaction between the gaseous and solid phases. During rock fracturing the volume of pores increases and the consequent drop in pressure is controlled by the equation of state. Therefore, an experimental pressure-time history is clearly only a very restricted representation of such a process - limited to cases where a borehole of the same diameter is employed in the analysis and the actual rock mass has similar deformability, strength and fracture characteristics as the one in the experiments.<P>
An improved representation of the explosive gas/rock interaction can be accomplished by employing a staggered approach with dual meshes. A discrete/finite element mesh for the rock mass is coupled with a background mesh simulating the gas flow. The solution within the rock mesh is driven by the current pressure loading, which is defined from the solution of the gas flow equations using the background mesh. The current gas pressure distribution, in turn, depends on the state of fracture within the rock mass.<P>
<B>5. Applications</B><P>
The potential applicability of finite/discrete element methods to industrial problems is illustrated by some selected examples.<A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil:80/fig45.htm"> Fig. 4</A> illustrates the problem of the impact of a bridge column by a 50 tonne vehicle. The bridge structure consists of a concrete slab 1.20m thick, 7m wide supported over a total span of 39m. The central column is 5m high, 0.8m thick and 5m wide. <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil:80/fig45.htm">Fig. 5</A> shows progressive stages of collapse.<P>
<A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil:80/fig67.htm">Fig. 6</A> illustrates simulation of the demolition of a 100m tall chimney by an explosive charge. A 400kg mass of ANFO explosive is detonated at the left hand side of the base of the stack and <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil:80/fig67.htm">Fig. 7</A> shows the progressive fracturing sequence during collapse.<P>
Finally, <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil:80/fig89.htm">Fig. 8</A> illustrates the modelling of a bench blasting operation. The rock is magnetite ore and the explosive loading is a 9m long ANFO charge. The remote boundaries are modelled as non-reflecting boundaries to prevent internal stress wave reflection. The developing fracture pattern is illustrated in <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil:80/fig89.htm">Fig. 8</A>(a)-(c) and comparison of the final particle size distribution with that predicted by the comrnercial code SABREX is shown in <A HREF="http://www.ehis.navy.mil:80/fig89.htm">Fig. 9</A>.<P>
<B>6. Future Developments</B><P>
In view of the large scale nature of practical industrial problems, the use of parallel processing strategies in computational solution is particularly attractive. The explicit central difference algorithm employed in solution is naturally concurrent and parallel implementation is straightforward and promises high efficiencies. The situation is however complicated by the fracturing and contacting conditions that take place throughout the transient process. In particular. both phenomena will result in a progressively changing data structure, which will have strong implication on interprocessor communication requirements.<P>
A major computational task in any discrete element analysis is the search procedure for establishing inter-element contact. Since the present approach is based on a space search procedure employing a binary tree structure, considerable possibilities exist for efficient parallel implementation of this phase of the analysis.<P>
There are many additional potential applications for discrete element methods. Current areas of activity include the simulation of granular flows in silos and the kinetics of crowd control at public events.<P>
A combined finite/discrete element approach in which progressive fracturing under elasto-plastic material conditions can take place in a random manner has further potential application. A current investigation is centred on the development of micro mechanical models for frictional wear, in which the progressive break-off of asperities on two contacting surfaces is modelled together with their effect on subsequent frictional sliding conditions.<P>

<H3>ONR Trip Report<P>
IFIP TC2 Working Conference on Programming <BR>
Concepts, Methods and Calculi<P>
Yellamraju V. Srinivas</H3>

<H4>ONR Contract N00014-93-C-0274 (A Topological <BR>
Approach to Data Types)<BR>
July 26, 1994</H4>

<B>1. Organization</B><BR><P>

The IFIP Technical Committee 2 Working Conference on Programming Concepts, <BR>
Methods and Calculi (PROCOMET'94) was jointly organized by three working <BR>
groups: WG2.1 on "Algorithmic Languages and Calculi", WG2.2 on "Formal <BR>
Description of Programming Concepts", and WG2.3 on "Programming Methodology".<BR>
<P>
The conference brought together these three working groups for the first <BR>
time in a decade.  However, the integration and cross-fertilization was not <BR>
as good as one might have expected: both the presentations and attendance were<BR> 
somewhat stratified.<BR>
<P>
The major topics covered in the conference were program derivation, semantics <BR>
of concurrency, design and refinement of concurrent systems, types in specification, <BR>
and program analysis. The trend of the conference was largely theoretical, <BR>
sometimes more so, e.g., process refinement and concurrency. This is unfortunate, <BR>
because, as we have observed at Kestrel, experience with an implemented system <BR>
resolves many theoretical questions quickly.<BR>
<P>
<B>2. Program Derivation</B><BR><P>

The talks on program derivation were the ones most closely related to my ONR <BR>
sponsored project at Kestrel. Mario Sudholt introduced data distribution algebras <BR>
for the systematic development of parallel programs. These algebras allow flexible<BR> 
decomposition of data, including decompositions which have overlapping parts. The <BR>
abstract idea is that of Grothendieck topologies, which were first applied to the <BR>
description of data types in my dissertation (summarized in TCS, vol. 112, <BR>
pp. 53-97, 1993). For example, a matrix can be covered by a set of columns. Program <BR>
skeletons can then be built which capture paradigmatic computation and communication <BR>
patterns corresponding to data decompositions.<BR>
<P>
Anne Kaldewaij and Victor Dielissen described several algebraic properties of a data <BR>
structure called leaf tree. A leaf tree is a tree in which only the leaves are labeled. <BR>
Leaf trees can be used to represent the decomposition trees of divide-and-conquer <BR>
algorithms, and algebraic transformations on such tree can be used to systematically <BR>
derive algorithms. From a topological viewpoint, leaf trees are just covers of sequences. <BR>
An interesting research direction to pursue is whether a topological view simplifies <BR>
program derivation and whether it introduces additional flexibility, e.g., derivation<BR>
of parallel algorithms.<BR>
<P>
James Boyle described a strategy for the partial evaluation of programs. The strategy <BR>
works by transforming a program through a sequence of canonical forms. The pivotal step <BR>
in this sequence is that of applying elementary laws which simplify the program taking <BR>
advantage of constant values; the rest are preparatory and cleaning-up steps. The strategy<BR> 
appears to be practical, and capable of controlling the well-known problem of infinite <BR>
unfolding; however, the theoretical basis still needs to be fully worked out.<BR>  
<P>
<B>3. Concurrency</B>
<P>
The best work presented on this topic was that by Martin Abadi and Leslie Lamport on <BR>
modular proofs for concurrent systems described using TLA (Temporal Logic of Actions). <BR>
Systems are specified by formulas in TLA and the specification of a composed system is <BR>
just the conjunction of the formulas specifying the component systems. The implementation<BR> 
relation between two systems is logical implication.  The focus of the paper was the <BR>
decomposition of a proof about the composite systems into proofs about the component <BR>
systems. This decomposition is not straightforward; the interconnection of components <BR>
forces the introduction of environmental assumptions into proofs about the components.<BR>
<P>
This work is supported by a practical implementation. A declarative description <BR>
of behavior is a powerful method of system specification, as has been demonstrated <BR>
by algebraic specifications and logical theories (for specifying non-concurrent <BR>
systems). However, the use of conjunction for composition is only a first step. <BR>
It would be interesting to explore how the categorical operation of colimit <BR>
(i.e., a generalized form of shared union) can be applied to theories of <BR>
concurrent systems. Similarly, the notion of refinement or implementation can <BR>
be represented by a morphism or interpretation (a more general form of implication).<BR>
<P>
Bernhard Moller described an elegant calculus of streams using ideals (i.e., prefix <BR>
closed sets of traces) and related algebra. The algebraic operations allow one <BR>
to reason about non-eterministic and concurrent programs at a high level (close <BR>
to informal, yet precise), and are suitable for systematically deriving programs. <BR>
This work is part of the effort to identify recurring patterns in concurrent <BR>
programs and study their algebraic properties, similar in spirit to the shift <BR>
from low-level programming to structured programming and then to program synthesis.<BR>
<P>
Ehrig et al. showed how the derivations of a graph grammar correspond to <BR>
configurations in an event structure. Thus graph grammars can be used to specify <BR>
concurrent systems and are, in this sense, a generalization of Petri nets (a <BR>
state can be a graph instead of a multiset). The categorical machinery used in the<BR>
paper, although simple and straightforward for a category theorist, will be <BR>
daunting for others. Nevertheless, the work brings a fresh approach to structured <BR>
descriptions of concurrent systems.<BR> 
<P>
<B>4. Process Refinement</B>
<P>
Process refinement was the underlying theme of several papers. The notion <BR>
of refinement, i.e., a precise statement of how a process or program B is <BR>
an implementation or realization of another process or program A, is essential <BR>
for the systematic synthesis and transformation of programs. Refinement seems <BR>
to have become important only recently, with an active exploration of several <BR>
formulations. Once the differences are ironed out and an acceptable definition <BR>
is found, it can form the basis of higher-level structuring mechanisms similar <BR>
to those used in algebraic  specification.<BR>
<P>
<B>5. Types and Program Semantics</B>
<P>
In my talk, I showed how to extend the standard framework of algebraic <BR>
specifications with the kind of subsorting that is characteristic of <BR>
object-oriented programming: by explicitly specifying the internal structure <BR>
of types and by using quotients for subtyping. The use of quotients for <BR>
subtyping was surprising to many; however, once it was recognized that the <BR>
duality between algebraic and object-oriented specifications leads to the <BR>
duality between subtyping using inclusions and subtyping using quotients, <BR>
quotients seemed natural. In conversations with researchers in this field, <BR>
I gathered that others had similar intuitions, but formalization was not <BR>
easy because subtyping notions in object-oriented programming are usually <BR>
defined at the level of programs and not at the level of specifications.
<P>
Steffen and Pierce's paper represented the trend in the field of type <BR>
theory of studying the complexity of typechecking in some variant of <BR>
the polymorphic lambda calculus. They proposed a meta-theory for <BR>
F-omega-sub (higher-order polymorphic lambda calculus with subtyping) <BR>
with the objective of specifying typechecking algorithms. Both typing <BR>
and subtyping were shown to be decidable.  Borger et al. showed the <BR>
correctness of an abstract compilation scheme for the language Occam. To<BR> 
start with, a high-level formal model of Occam is constructed using <BR>
the framework of evolving algebras. The proof of correctness uses <BR>
a sequence of refinements of this high-level model. The work is <BR>
characterized by a careful balance between formal and pragmatic <BR>
aspects, an approach which evoked skepticism in several members <BR>
of the audience. On the other hand, fully formal models of real <BR>
languages are only barely feasible; thus it seems prudent to attempt <BR>
coverage of all the important aspects of a language, possibly at <BR>
the expense of some informality.<BR>

The purpose of this trip was to attend the CONCUR '94 conference,<BR>
which was held in Uppsala, Sweden, Aug. 22--25.  This year's meeting<BR> 
represented the fifth in the annual CONCUR series.  Originally begun<BR> 
as a project review for the CONCUR Esprit Basic Research Action funded <BR>
by the European Community, this meeting has evolved into the premier <BR>
conference for theories of concurrent systems.  Previous meetings have <BR>
been held in Amsterdam, Stony Brook, NY, and Hildesheim, Germany; next <BR>
year's meeting will take place in Philadelphia, PA. The organizers of<BR> 
this year's meeting were Bengt Jonsson of the <a href=3D"http://www.docs.uu.se">University of Uppsala</a> and<BR>
<a href=3D"http://www.sics.se/people/joachim-parrow.html">Joachim Parrow</a> of the
<a href=3D"http://www.sics.se">Swedish Institute of Computer Science</a>.

<p>

This year's conference featured invited and contributed presentations and<BR>
tutorials on a variety of concurrency-related topics, as well as demonstrations<BR>
of different verification tools.  In what follows I briefly recap some of <BR>
the "highlights" (from my perspective) of the conference.

<strong>Invited Talks</strong>
</a>

<p>

The five invited talks covered a wide range of topics, from a<BR>
category-theoretic treatment of bisimulation equivalence (Mogens <BR>
Nielsen from Aarhus University in Denmark) permitting the extension <BR>
of this notion to many different models of concurrency, to hierarchical <BR>
models for specifying and verifying of hardware circuits (David Dill <BR>
from Stanford University) developed to support the "piece-wise" verification <BR>
of large circuits, to a framework in for rigorously analyzing trade-offs <BR>
between efficiency and redundancy (for purposes of fault-tolerance) in <BR>
distributed systems (Paris Kanellakis of Brown University).  Prakash <BR>
Panangaden of McGill University in Montreal talked about a categorical <BR>
semantics for concurrent constraint programming languages, and Jean-Yves <BR>
Girard of the Laboratory for Discrete Mathematics in Marseille delivered <BR>
an invited lecture on the modeling of concurrent computation in linear <BR>
logic using manipulations of proofs of statements in the logic.

<strong>Contributed Presentations</strong>
</a>
<p>
The contributed presentations spanned a number of topics in concurrency<BR>
theory; there was a general emphasis, however, on algebraic models of <BR>
concurrency this year.  A synopsis of each paper would be beyond the <BR>
scope of this report; instead, I focus on some of prominent research <BR>
themes that emerged from my point of view.
<p>
<b> Algorithms and decidability issues for infinite-state systems</b><BR>
featured prominently in the program this year. Traditional work in automatic<BR>
verification has focused finite-state systems, since the verification<BR>
techniques proposed rely on the (explicit or implicit) enumeration of all<BR>
system states.  Recent work, however, suggests that certain properties<BR>
can be decided automatically for some classes of infinite-state systems,<BR>
and several papers in the conference expanded on this theme. I was impressed<BR>
by a paper by Yoran Hirshfeld and Faron Moller of Edinburgh University that <BR>
gave a cubic-time algorithm for determining when two <i>context-free</i> <BR>
systems were bisimulation equivalent.  Most results in this area have been <BR>
decidability results; this is the first to suggest that in fact the decidability<BR>
problems might be feasible to solve in practice.
<p>
<b>Value passing</b> also received a fair share of attention from the papers<BR>
presented.  Traditional models of concurrency have tended to stress issues<BR>
relating to parallelism and synchronization while downplaying data exchange.<BR>
Within the past five years, however, various researchers have begun studying<BR>
issues associated with message passing.  One of the most notable of these new<BR>
theories is Robin Milner's pi-calculus, which permits the modeling of processes<BR>
that can pass communication channels as data among themselves. CONCUR '94<BR>
featured several papers analyzing different semantic equivalences for the<BR>
pi-calculus.  Chief among these was a paper by Xinxin Liu of Sussex University<BR>
in England. in which the author presented a new characterization of bisimulation <BR>
equivalence for this language that appears to suggest directions for computing <BR>
this relation for some processes.  Other work on value-passing at the <BR>
conference focused on developing techniques for reasoning about processes<BR>
that exchange more traditional data values.  Emblematic of this work was the <BR>
<a href=3D"ftp://science.csc.ncsu.edu/pub/papers/concur94a.ps.Z">paper</a><BR>
 by my student, James Riely, and me, which applied techniques from the field<BR>
 of <i>abstract interpretation</i> of sequential languages to develop mechanisms<BR>
for reducing the work associated with establishing that systems have certain<BR>
properties.
<p>
Several papers considered various <b>extensions to process algebras</b>. The<BR>
constructs typically featured in such languages provide a minimal basis for<BR>
modeling systems; the addition of other operators can in many cases simplify<BR>
the task of describing system behavior.  As an example, a paper by Andrew<BR>
Uselton and Scott Smolka of SUNY-Stony Brook developed a process algebra that<BR>
supports <i>state refinement</i> in the style of the graphical design language<BR>
Statecharts.  State refinement provides an extremely useful mechanism for<BR>
structuring large systems; these authors gave a syntax including this operation<BR>
and others from the Statecharts language and established that the traditional <BR>
semantic equivalence for Statecharts is <i>not</i> preserved by this operation. <BR>
They remedied this deficiency (which presents obstacles to "component-wise" <BR>
reasoning about Statecharts system designs) by defining a new equivalence <BR>
relation and showing it to be the largest "compositional" equivalence <BR>
(i.e. congruence) contained within the traditional equivalence.
<p>
<b>Models for real-time and probability</b> formed the subject material for<BR>
another group of papers at the meeting. One particularly interesting paper on<BR>
real-time was written by Rajeev Alur (Bell Labs), Costas Courcoubetis<BR>
(University of Crete, Greece), and Tom Henzinger (Cornell University). Titled<BR>
"The Observational Power of Clocks," the paper established a hierarchy of<BR>
different semantic equivalences for timed systems based on the number of<BR>
"clocks" that external observers to the system may use to determine the amount<BR>
of time between different system events.  The gist of their main result is that<BR>
as the number of clocks grows, so does the distinguishing power of observers<BR>
using the clocks.  Research on probabilistic systems aims at providing a<BR>
framework for analyzing reliability and fault-tolerance issues in distributed<BR>
systems; the papers on this topic at CONCUR '94 concentrated mostly on<BR>
developing different semantic models of probabilistic processes. As an<BR>
example, one <a href=3D"ftp://science.csc.ncsu.edu/pub/papers/concur94b.ps.Z">paper</a> by Shoji
Yuen, Zeynep Dayar, Scott Smolka and me <BR>
defined an alternative characterization of a semantic ordering between <BR>
processes that is designed to capture a notion of "more reliable than".  <BR>
The original definition of this ordering is highly noneffective to compute, <BR>
since it requires examining the behavior of a system in response to all possible <BR>
tests.  Our work provides a basis for determining this relation solely on the <BR>
basis of a very restricted class of tests and will, we hope, serve as a basis <BR>
for decision procedures for finite-state systems.

<strong>Tutorials</strong>
</a>
<p>
An appealing aspect of the CONCUR series is its emphasis on tutorials; regardless <BR>
of how expert one is in a particular area, an introduction and summary of <BR>
existing results in another field can be extremely helpful in understanding <BR>
relationships among different fields.  This year featured the following tutorials.
<OL>
<LI> <b> "Model-based" verification tools.</b> Given jointly by Robert de Simone of <BR>
INRIA-Sophia Antipolis and Jean-Claude Fernandez of the University of Grenoble, <BR>
both of whom have been involved in major implementation efforts for such tools, <BR>
the tutorial focused on tools and techniques developed within the process algebra <BR>
community in Europe for verifying finite-state systems. In general, these techniques <BR>
revolve around the uses of behavioral equivalence to support verification methodologies <BR>
in which one system is used as a specification for another (lower-level) system.

<LI> <b> Algorithmic verification of continuous real-time systems.</b> This tutorial, <BR>
which was presented by Costas Courcoubetis of the University of Crete in Greece, <BR>
surveyed results obtained over the past five years on the development of algorithms <BR>
for determining if "continuous" real-time systems satisfy certain temporal properties.  <BR>
The challenge of analyzing such systems is that, since time is not discrete, systems in <BR>
general have an infinite number of states.  This infinitude notwithstanding, certain <BR>
classes of properties are decidable for certain systems, and Courcoubetis reviewed <BR>
these results in the context of a common framework that he has developed.

<LI> <b> Trace refinement of action systems.</b> Ralph Back of Abo Akademi in Finland <BR>
gave this tutorial, which, despite its name, gave an overview of the traditional <BR>
"refinement calculus" for sequential programs. This calculus provides a theoretical <BR>
basis for the stepwise-refinement approach to the development of programs; it relies <BR>
heavily on the use of simple lattice-theoretic principles, in which the lattice ordering <BR>
represents a notion of "more developed than".

<a name=3D"5" href=3D"#6">
<strong>System Demonstrations</strong>
</a>
<p>
Although CONCUR is primarily a theoretical conference, time was set aside for<BR>
demonstrations of verification tools for concurrent systems. Among the systems<BR>
shown were the AUTO/AUTOGRAPH tool set from INRIA-Sophia Antipolis in France;<BR>
these systems permit users to describe hierarchical networks of finite-state<BR>
systems using a graphical notation and then compare them to specifications<BR>
given as finite-state machines using <i>observational equivalence</i>, a semantic equivalence. <BR>
The XESAR tool set from the University of Grenoble in France provides similar <BR>
capabilities for systems expressed in LOTOS, an ISO standard protocol specification <BR>
language. Finally, the <a href=3D"ftp://science.csc.ncsu.edu/pub/ONR/misc/factory.ps.Z">Concurrency
Factory</a>, a joint effort between North Carolina State <BR>
University and SUNY-Stony Brook, offers a graphical interface for designing <BR>
hierarchical networks of finite-state systems; it also includes a graphical <BR>
simulator for "executing" designs, facilities for determining if systems satisfy<BR>
certain properties, and a compilation feature for generating distributed code <BR>
(in the FACILE programming language) from a design that may then be directly executed.

<strong>Informal Contacts</strong>
</a>
<p>
One of the best aspects of attending conference is the informal interaction<BR>
that occurs between conference attendees. The following list highlights some<BR>
of the contacts I had at CONCUR '94.
<ol>
<li> Scott Smolka and I had several conversations regarding future plans for<BR>
the Concurrency Factory, a verification/design tool for distributed systems<BR>
that we and Phil Lewis of SUNY-Stony Brook are building.

<li> I talked at length with Eric Madelaine and Robert de Simone, of<BR>
INRIA-Sophia Antipolis, about a tool we are jointly producing that would ease<BR>
the task of generating front ends for verification tools based on process<BR>
algebras.  It should be noted that the student at N.C. State who is working on<BR>
this project is being supported by my ONR grant, N00014-92-J-1582.

<li> I also spoke with Chris Verhoef, of Eindhoven University in the<BR>
Netherlands, about work he and Jos Baetan of the same university, have done on<BR>
frameworks for defining process algebras.  This work has direct bearing on the<BR>
tool being developed by Madelaine, de Simone and myself.

<li> Ivan and Linda Christoff, both of Uppsala University in Sweden, and I<BR>
discussed a joint paper that we and student of mine, who is also being<BR>
supported by ONR N00014-92-J-1582, are writing on the modeling of interrupt<BR>
mechanisms.  This <a href=3D"ftp://science.csc.ncsu.edu/pub/papers/fsttcs94.ps.Z">paper</a>
has been accepted for publication in the proceedings of <BR>
the Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science, <BR>
to be held in Madras, India.

<li> Kim Larsen (Aalborg University, Denmark), Bernhard Steffen (University<BR>
of Passau, Germany), and I finalized plans to organize a workshop on<BR>
verification tools and methodologies, to be held in Aarhus, Denmark, in <BR>
conjunction with the TAPSOFT conference in late May.  This workshop will aim <BR>
at a bringing together researchers in tools devoted to the analysis of concurrent <BR>
systems.</ol>

2.	Significant activity:<P>

	a.  POL/MIL ISSUES: <P>

		ASA(RDA) VISITS UK, 2-5 Sep:  The Honorable Mr. Gilbert Decker, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development and Acquisition (ASA(RDA)), attended the United Kingdom Farnborough International Air Show '96 as the senior Army representative, 3-4 Sep.  During his visit, Mr Decker attended a reception at Ambassador Crowe's residence and had an office call with Mr. James Arbuthnot, MP, Minister of State for Defence Procurement at the Ministry of Defence, Whitehall.   Key US industry visits included: Hughes Aircraft, Allied Signal Aerospace, United Technology Sikorsky Aircraft, McDonnell Douglas, General Electric, and Boeing.  He also visited the following UK defense companies:  Grasby Ionics, British Aerospace, GKN Westland, Pilkington Optronics, GEC-Marconi, Rolls Royce and Shorts Brothers PLC.  The discussions with the UK firms stressed the importance of cooperative programs between the US and the UK and the maintenance of a healthy market in international defense trade. (COL Henry J. Atwood, Jr, and LTC Robert J. Beatty, AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).<P>

	b.  Standardization Division Activities:<P>
		
		(1) FUTURE US FSCV AND UK TRACER COLLABORATION: A Letter of Intent has been drafted for signature by LTG Ronald Hite for forwarding to the UK Master General of Ordnance (MGO), Lt Gen Robert Hayman-Joyce.  The purpose of this Letter is to express the US desire to explore the feasibility of establishing a cooperative effort for a future armored reconnaissance vehicle.  It is envisioned that US DOD and UK MOD will agree to jointly approve and sign a formal Statement of Intent during the MGO's visit to the US, 3-15 Oct 96.  (COL Henry J. Atwood, Jr,  AMXIP-UK, 44-171-514-4911).<P>

				(2) VISIT OF DEPUTY UNDER SECRETARY OF THE ARMY OPERATIONAL RESEARCH:  Mr. Walt Hollis, DUSA-OR and Mr. Edgar Vandiver, Director of the US Army Concepts Analysis Agency were in country 27 August through 12 September 1996 to attend the Thirteenth International Symposium on Military Operational Research at the Royal Military College of Science, Shrivenham and other meetings with UK MOD officials.  On 10 September Mr. Hollis and Mr. Vandiver traveled to the Center for Defence Analysis (CDA) Fort Halstead for briefings and discussions on a number of items of interest.  Subjects of briefings and discussions included:  Sensor Mix Study, TRACER Trade-off Analysis, Future Infantry System Technology (FIST), Remote Detection of Minefields, Electro Thermal Combustion Guns, Radio Frequency Weapons, and Lasers.  CDA Farnborough was visited on 11 September where the subjects of briefings included: Apache Long Bow, human factors aspects of the soldier's world, Combat Identification, and simulation in support of digitization trials.  Discussion included: the UK's interest in US approaches to integrating Apache Longbow radar information into the common situational awareness system; the possibility of the US running some testing on the UK Magpie millimeter wave Combat Identification beacon; and the difficulties the UK has had in receiving certain technical data on the Longbow Radar.  Both USARDSG-UK and TRADOC UK representatives have been working directly with the UK point of contacts to achieve closure on the issues discussed.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).  <P>

		(3) UK/US ARMY STAFF TALKS '96:  Attended the subject talks at Upavon 17-19 September.  The meetings were very informative and provided a valuable arena for frank and open briefings and discussions between the two armies.  Briefing and discussion topics included British and US Army updates, Lessons Learned from Bosnia, a US Army AH64D Apache Longbow briefing, future force structures, training strategies, joint doctrine visions, logistic operations, The Army After Next, and the Army and society.  Despite the relative size difference between our two nations' armies, we are facing similar issues in respect to technology, societal changes, world commitments, and reducing force structure and budgets.  The common ground of similar issues led to discussions benefiting both nations.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(4) TECHNICAL ADVISOR ON DIGITIZATION NAMED:  Dr. John Hinsley, formerly the Director of Land Systems Sector, Defence Research Agency (DRA), has become the Technical Advisor on Digitization to the Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff Operational Requirements (Land Systems) (ACDS OR (Land)).  In this position, Dr. Hinsley is the principal technical advisor to Maj Gen Burton on all UK MOD Digitization matters.  In an initial meeting with Dr. Hinsley, USARDSG-UK support was offered to assist him in obtaining information and points of contact with US Army Digitization offices.  (LTC Kindel, AMXIP-UK-SC, 44-171-514-4935).<P>

		(5) PEO-FAS HOME-ON-HOME REVIEW:  At the invitation of MG Michitsch, PEO-FAS, I attended my first PEO-FAS Home-on-Home Review at Fort Sill, OK, 28 Aug.  Conducted semi-annually and alternating between Fort Sill, OK; and Picatinny Arsenal, NJ, this review is intended to provide a forum for the materiel developer and user representative to discuss program status and user concerns on all the programs managed in PEO-FAS and within the US Army Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center.  It also provides senior field artillery officers the opportunity to meet first-hand and discuss current issues within the field artillery community. (LTC Robert J. Beatty, AMXIP-UK-SA, 44-171-514-4939).<P>
		
	(6) Farnborough International Air Show (Fias) '96: was held 2-8 September at DRA Farnborough, UK.  USARDSG-UK hosted US Army visitors and made hotel and ticket arrangements for more than sixty official DOD representatives.  The ranking member of the US Army Delegation to FIAS was the Honorable Gilbert Decker, Assistant Secretary of the Army (Research, Development and Acquisition).  MG Michael S. Davidson, CG, Security Assistance Command also attended the first three days of the show.  The DOD was very well represented at this year's show, with the US Army able to display both an AH-64A Apache and an AH-64D Apache Longbow, as well as a AH-1W Cobra, Kiowa Warrior, Black Hawk, Chinook Helicopter and the Ground Station Module for JSTARS.  (LTC Robert J. Beatty, AMXIP-UK-SA, 44-171-514-4939).<P>
	
	(7) IIIrd EUROPEAN GUNS, MORTARS AND AMMUNITION SYMPOSIUM:  The Royal Military College of Science, School of Engineering and Applied Science, in Shrivenham, United Kingdom, held their IIIrd European Guns, Mortars and Ammunition Symposium 17-19 Sep.  The Symposium was attended by over 200 people representing over 22 different countries.  The US representations included presentations by LTC McChesney, Product Manager, Crusader Munitions and Resupply, and COL Steve Ward, USMC, Joint Program Manager, LW 155.  (LTC Robert J. Beatty, AMXIP-UK-SA, 44-171-514-4939). <P>

		(8) JPM LW 155 Holds MOU Discussions with UK MOD:  COL Steve Ward, USMC, Joint Program Manager, Lightweight 155 (LW155) Howitzer held a very constructive meeting to discuss, review and negotiate a draft Shoot-Off MOU with UK MOD at Shrivenham, 17-19 Sep.  The draft US/UK MOU is for cooperation only in the Shoot-Off Phase of the LW155 Program.  Early UK participation in the Shoot-Off phase will assist harmonization and facilitate potential cooperation in the later EMD phase of the US program.  MOU milestone for completion is Jan 97, designated signature authority is ASN(RDA) for DOD, and DCDP for UK MOD.  (LTC Robert J. Beatty, AMXIP-UK-SA, 44-171-514-4939). <P>

		(9) LOAN/LEASE REQUEST FOR THE CHIRPSOUNDER RADIO RECEIVER:  This US 1108th Signal Brigade request for a receiver and Pakrat Modem for use by the UK 31st Signal Regiment is still not fulfilled a full two years later.  Complications from the onset included the USAF being the procurement authority for the original Chirpsounder and ultimate authority to handle the lease/loan.  This authority was delegated back to the US Army some months ago.  Another hold-up was in the AMC legal department which did not deem this an R&D loan to be dealt with under Section 65 AECA, even though the loan and trial of this equipment will determine whether some ongoing communications problems experienced during regular exercises will be cured.  A recent UK letter strongly requests a Letter of Offer (LOA) and Acceptance for the lease or purchase of this equipment to finalize arrangements and copies have been faxed to all relevant offices.  (Ms J. Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(10) NATO COMMON FUEL REQUIREMENT (NCFR): The USMC approached USARDSG-UK on this matter after referrals from mutual POCs at both TACOM and other R&D offices at USMC, Quantico Va.  Both the US Marines and the UK (British Army and Royal Air Force) have a requirement to field motorcycles.  They cite commencement dates within a six months period, i.e. Oct 98 - Apr '99.  The US and UK will also need to conform to a NCFR, which requires a common fuel for all military vehicles by 2004.  Although these motorcycles will be at the end of their service life by the required time, both nations consider it advantageous to conform early to the NCFR and so they are seriously looking at the feasibility of embracing the NCFR for this procurement.  To that end, the UK MOD had previously invested in the conversion of a gasoline powered motorcycle into an Applied Technical Demonstrator (ATD) diesel engine motorcycle.  The USMC Project Manager, CWO4 Don Kaufman, visited DRA Chertsey and met with members of the UK MOD Procurement Executive, the DRA and Dr. Stuart McGuigan of Royal Military College of Science, Shrivenham who headed the team which built the ATD.  CWO4 Kaufman also rode the ATD and found it to be a most functional and interesting concept.  Upon return to Quantico, he discussed what he had seen with his superiors who will now see the UK ATD when they come over for a USMC exercise at Portsmouth on 28 Oct '96.  (Ms J.  Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

				(11) A LESS THAN LETHAL/NON-LETHAL FACT-FINDING MISSION, UK, 23-17 Sep:  This group included representatives from the Joint Services, USAREUR, USAF, US Army Military Police School, US Army ERDEC, US Marine Corps and USAF.  Following initial briefings and presentations taking in the whole technological spectrum, the visit concentrated on those technologies that are currently fielded for police or military anti-riot activity.  The week also included briefings from both the UK police and military user communities (including the RUC of Northern Ireland) who have had more than 25 years of experience in using non-lethal and less than lethal technologies in Northern Ireland, Cyprus and other areas.  The team received briefings and trials on the Royal Ordnance Anti-Riot Weapon Enfield (ARWEN) and the riot control products and future developments of Paines-Wessex and Haley-Weller (a subsidiary of Paines Wessex).  During contractor visits all team members were given the opportunity to use training rounds of the various non-lethal stores.  The visit culminated in briefings on the research and development work done at CBDE, Porton Down on non-lethal and less than lethal technologies. Major Frazier McDonald of the UK MOD Procurement Executive briefed the team on future plans for various non-lethal stores within the UK MOD to include a possible update of the L11A1 CS Gas Grenade to a more modern specification.  The US teams were most interested in this work since that grenade is being considered for use in the US Army's LVOSS Program in which gas grenades may be launched from a vehicle to disperse crowds.  There may be potential for the US to have a part in those future upgrades of the L11A1 to assure standardization and to assure that the grenade meets our future needs in the Operations Other Than War (OOTW) role in the LVOSS Program.  A follow-up visit on the cooperative opportunity between the US and UK on the L11A1 CS Gas Grenade will be taking place the week of 13 Oct '96.  (Ms J. Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

		(12) THE DEFENCE CLOTHING AND TEXTILES AGENCY (DCTA), COLCHESTER, UK DEVELOPS CHAMELEON MATERIALS:  These materials will change colors to camouflaged soldiers and alert them to threats in their proximity such as chemical and biological weapons.  Dr. Richard Scott, the Chief Scientist, says changes to blacks and browns are the most difficult hurdle.  Ongoing work in this area is part of the UK's Crusader 2005 Program and includes work on fabrics designed to cause the material to automatically increase their insulation properties.  Military engineers are convinced that by combining advanced fabrics and electronics it is possible to make "cyber uniforms", that is, those designed to react automatically to environmental changes.  Some fabrics are being designed to be so sensitive to temperature that they turn white in severe cold and sand-colored in extreme heat, allowing the soldier to "blend" into snow or desert.  Another area of study at DCTA is in fabric that self-regulates air as an insulator in clothing.  Changes in the amount of air trapped at any time in a piece of cloth will increase or decrease its insulation properties.  It will soon be possible to develop sensors that monitor external temperature and use that information to adjust the air and therefore level of insulation.  DCTA future endeavors include work on fabrics designed to camouflage soldiers against radar and infra-red detectors by using thin metallic coatings.  New and unconventional polymers are being studied (such as polyphenylenes) to determine whether or not they can provide fabrics that are light but can also afford ballistic protection and flame retardency.  Related to this work are current studies being undertaken to look at the design of fabric that is able to indicate when clothing (such as bullet proof vests) has been damaged in combat.  (Ms J. Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).<P>

	(13) UK VIEW OF NEW TANK DEVELOPMENT:  In the ongoing argument of the value of armored vehicles on the battlefield of tomorrow, the UK have come down on the side of keeping tanks but changing them radically from the Challenger 2 being fielded today.  The UK considers that the most important aspect of new tank development will be the advent of plastic ARMOR, a fraction of the weight of current steel plate (up to 12" thick) with other important advantages.  Current investigations include multi-layered compounds designed to absorb or deflect an incoming missile.  Alternative plastic skins could be used depending on enemy faced.  Using "smart" technologies, armor could be designed to adjust its color and/or profile (using angled panel design) to effectively self camouflage and minimize radar profile.  The tank of the future will eschew the current V12 gas engine for electric motors which will improve manoeuverability/turning speeds, as well as reduce noise and heat emission, therefore minimize the signature of the vehicle.  The UK tank of the future will have increased firepower that would include anti-aircraft systems.  It is also envisioned that the tank of the future will be less expensive to buy and to operate.  (Ms J. Hess, AMXIP-UK-SE, 44-171-514-4941).

<H2>Proposal submitted to European Office of Aerospace and Development (EOARD)</H2>

<B>Note:</B>  To enhance your chances of receiving the best evaluation possible from as many scientists as possible in the shortest time, please make this proposal short (two to three pages total).  Our evaluators are looking for substantial advancements in key technologies.  You must precisely define in your proposal what key technology that you will develop, and the application of the new technology once you have developed it.  Our labs rarely fund a scientist to perform research in a general area.  Additionally, research dollars are scarce -- we receive hundreds of proposals and only a few are funded.  But, our job is to try to build the collaboration efforts between you and the scientists in the lab -- we will do my best to find scientists that you can work with.  Thank you.  Also, we recommend that you keep your proposal below $25K -- larger proposals must be sent to AFOSR for additional staffing.<P>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>EOARD had a banner year in FY96!  As the end-of-year
statistics show, the level of overall activity reached a new high.
 While very nearly equaling last year's record number of WOS visits,
the EOARD staff significantly exceeded FY95's totals in every
other program. In achieving this prodigious output, nine EOARD
scientists visited some 205 sites in 22 different countries. 
FY96 totals are discussed below and depicted in the accompanying

<TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=435><I><FONT SIZE=2>Special Contracts:</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>  As mentioned above, there was a significant increase in the level of external funds made available to EOARD for special contracts.  FY96's total of over $1.6M represented a 31% increase over the $1.26M total of FY95.  The number of contracts was up dramatically, from 53 in FY95 to 96 in the last fiscal year.  Fully 71 of those contracts were with researchers in the FSU and Eastern European countries.  These data indicate that our customers were following up on many of the WOSs sent in FY95 with contracts in FY96, which of course is exactly the primary goal of a WOS visit.  They also attest to the success of our continuing effort to locate top researchers doing work with a high degree of Air Force and DoD relevance in the FSU and Eastern Europe, demonstrating again the leveraging capability of EOARD's unique programs.</FONT>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=332><I><FONT SIZE=2>Conference Support Program:</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>  This program too saw a significant upswing, as we realized a 25% increase (from 48 in FY95 to 60 in FY96) in the number of conferences and workshops supported by EOARD.  The trend at EOARD has been away from supporting large conferences that will take place with or without our involvement, to sponsoring small conferences and workshops which our support actually make possible.  We consider these an excellent, cost-effective means to bring experts in a given area together for a week or so of intense work.  Such workshops can be an excellent follow-up to a successful WOS or series of WOSs.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Maj. Jerry Sellers represented EOARD at the International
Workshop on the Monitoring of Aircraft Structures, held in Fergana,
Uzbekistan, 18-20 September 1996.  The country of Uzbekistan,
a Former Soviet Union (FSU) Republic that has been independent
since 1991, is located in central southern Asia and has a population
of 22 million people.  The government is trying to chart Uzbekistan's
own destiny in the international community, although it still
retains strong economic and technical ties to Russia and other
FSU Republics. The workshop was supported with funding from EOARD.
 It included over 50 delegates from Russian institutes, universities
and design bureaus such as CIAM, TsAGI and SibNIA, as well as
Uzbek representatives from Tashkent, Uzbekistan Airways, and Fergana
University.  Maj. Sellers was the sole Western representative.
 Twenty-seven technical papers were presented covering a range
of topics relevant to monitoring the health and safety of aging
aircraft, a problem which has gained increased emphasis within
the USAF research community.  Maj. Sellers presented a briefing
prepared by Mr. Mike Zeigler (WL/FI) outlining USAF interests
in aging aircraft research. Prof. Shamirzaev, of the Uzbek Physical-Technical
Institute, presented results from research funded by EOARD/Wright
Labs into structural models of fatigue damage using surface-mounted
semiconductor devices.  Other papers discussed in-flight monitoring
of aircraft loading, the use of polymer composite structures,
lifetime assessments for gas-turbine engines, and the potential
for new semiconductor material creation using continuous solid
solutions.  Complete proceedings, in English, will be available
from Jan 97. Contact Maj. Sellers for more information.</FONT>

University of Limerick is situated at the heart of the National
Technological Park, on 650 acres along the banks of the River
Shannon at city of Limerick.  The university opened in 1972 and
now has a total of 8080 students, 313 faculty and 422 staff. 
The research budget for the last academic year reported (AY94/95)
was $8M.  The areas of strategic research that the Air Force may
be interested m include information technologies, materials, environmental
science, and aerospace engineering.  Much of the laboratory structure
is still being built or planned, but there are 92 students currently
pursuing PhDs (24 graduated in 95).  Their materials program is
probably the most advanced, with good work ongoing in polymer
composites, corrosion prevention/control, and ceramics.  In aerospace
engineering, most of the work is theoretical -- CFD codes -- but
some work is ongoing on laminar flow airfoils and the design/repair
of composite aircraft structures. The College of Informatics and
Electronics has ongoing work in telecommunications and adaptive
intelligent networks.  In addition they have a power electronics

Laser <I><B>and </B></I><B>High Power Laser Conference, 25&#173;30
August 1996, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK.</B></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
 This conference involved participants from industry, government
labs and universities from throughout the world.  The major topics
included solid state lasers, metal vapor and near-infrared lasers,
CO<SUB>2</SUB> lasers, beam shaping and delivery systems, nonlinear
optics, excimer lasers, CO and gas dynamic lasers, laser machining
and welding, chemical oxygen iodine lasers and laser applications.
 Of particular interest was a number of papers on using phase
conjugation techniques (usually stimulated Brillouin scattering)
as part of the laser system to compensate for distortions in solid
state lasers.  There was also an interesting report on overtone
lasing in CO and the use of the active medium in CO and CO<SUB>2
</SUB>lasers as a four-wave mixing medium.  Several groups reported
on parametric studies of the jet generator for producing oxygen
in the singlet delta state.  A particularly interesting talk presented
a set of experiments on using one and two beams for laser welding
of aluminum.  They concluded that two beams at a slight angle
with respect to each other had distinct advantages.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visit to Max-Born Institute, Berlin, Germany.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
 Point of contact: Dr. T. Elsaesser.  The Max-Born Institute was
reopened after the unification of East and West Germany with a
reduced staff and a charter to concentrate in nonlinear optics
and ultrafast spectroscopy.  At the present time there are a little
less than 200 employees in the institute.  Current topics of research
include: gas phase clusters and molecules on surfaces, high intensity
physics including laser fusion and multiphoton effects in atoms,
nonlinear fast phenomena in condensed matter, and femtosecond
spectroscopy of semiconductors.  Much of the recent work in Dr.
Elsaesser's group has been involved with ultrafast phenomena in
GaAs.  As an offshoot of this work, they have developed a femtosecond
laser system that is continuously tunable from 3.3 to 10 1&#181;m.
 There is also some interesting work in the use of liquid crystals
to phase lock semiconductor lasers.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visits with Lt Col Don McGillen to the General
Physics Institute, P.N. Lebedev Physical Institute, and the Institute
for Information Transmission Problems, all of the Russian Academy
of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>  </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>All
of the institutes that we visited are suffering from the large
decrease in funding available from the state.  Current funding
levels cover only a portion of the minimum operating budget. 
In some cases the state money is barely sufficient to pay for
the utilities.  This means that necessary repairs and maintenance
is often being deferred and the payment of salaries is often in
arrears.  As an example, those scientists in the General Physics
Institute without outside contracts have been told that they will
not be receiving any salary for October and December and may receive
something like a third of their salary in November.  In order
to understand the full impact of this state of affairs it is necessary
to understand that even if they did receive their full salary
they would still be near the official poverty line because of
inflation and lack of raises.  Nonetheless, the scientists and
engineers employed by these institutes continue to work.</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>General Physics Institute of the Russian Academy
of Sciences, Moscow, Russia</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>.  </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>This
institute was formed in 1982 when the P. N. Lebedev Physical Institute
was divided in half.  One part retained the name while the other
part became the General Physics Institute.  The current director
of the institute as he was at its inception is Academician A.
M. Prokhorov, Full Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences and
Nobel Laureate.  This was and probably still is one of the premier
institutes devoted to the physics of light and light interactions.
 The institute is divided into ten departments each of which consist
of several laboratories. Many of the departments reside within
the Moscow complex although some have their main research facilities
in Troitsk, a suburb of Moscow.  There are also assorted facilities
spread throughout Russia.  The five largest departments are: Plasma
Physics, Oscillations, Fiber Optics, Solid State Lasers, and Interaction
of Coherent Radiation with Matter.  The remaining five departments
are likely to be absorbed by the largest departments in the reorganization
currently under way.  The largest of the departments is Oscillations
which is headed by Acad. Prokhorov.  It is concerned with high
power laser development, quantum electronics, and laser fusion.
 The Plasma Physics Department is mostly concerned with the study
of stellarators and high-current accelerators.  The Fiber Optics
Department is probably the most solvent of the groups.  They are
involved in all aspects of fiber optics technology from the manufacturing
of the fibers to the theory of propagation in nonlinear fibers.
 The Solid State Laser Department is concerned with the design,
growth, characterization and testing of new laser materials. 
The remaining large department, Interaction of Coherent Radiation
with Matter covers most laser interaction phenomena.  This includes
laser fusion studies, interaction of laser light with biological
samples, and nonlinear optical processes.  Of particular interest
was some work by Dr. Apollonov's group on environmentally safe
HF-DF high power lasers and the use of high-power CO<SUB>2</SUB>
lasers for lightening protection.  The HF-DF laser operates with
SF6 and some other relatively inert chemicals such as Methane
or Ethane thus overcoming many of the environmental and safety
objections to using these lasers.  These lasers are pumped either
with a stable electrical discharge or with a microwave source.
 The lightening protection program uses high-power CO<SUB>2</SUB>
lasers to create an ionization channel in the atmosphere thus
providing a preferred path for lightening discharge.  There is
also some interesting work on an iodine laser pumped by a self-sustained
discharge.<BR>

<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>P.N. Lebedev Physical Institute of the Russian
Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>. 
</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>This institute of roughly 2000 employees
constitute the other half of the old Lebedev Physical Institute.
Its director is Academician Basov, Full Member of the Russian
Academy of Sciences and Nobel Laureate.  This institute is also
considered to be one of the best physics institutes in Russia.
 Although many of the departments and laboratories are in the
Moscow complex, there are major research facilities at Samara
outside Moscow and at least one major radio telescope in the south.
 The Samara branch was a closed facility until shortly after the
break up of the Soviet Union.  It is now more of a technology
development center and is the home of the Russian chemical oxygen-iodine
laser facility and several other high power lasers.  The Lebedev
institute has research projects in just about all areas of physics.
 It has a particularly strong theoretical physics department that
has been home to several well known theorists such as Dr. Ginzburg
and Dr. Sakharov.  The institute is particularly strong in lasers
and interaction of laser light with matter.  One research area
of particular interest is a spin off of the thermonuclear fusion.
 The scientists in this area are studying the possibility of using
glass micro-balloons filled with hydrogen at 1000 Atmospheres
as a means of providing a safe method for using hydrogen as a
conventional fuel.  Another interesting area is the study of ferroelectric
liquid crystals.  They have demonstrated switching times of 3
&#181;lsec.  In the bistable regime they have created a durable
1000 line multiplexed memory with a read/write time of 30 &#181;sec
per line.  In the multistable regime this material is capable
of storing a grey scale at each address or can be used as a color
switch.  There is also some interesting research in polymer dispersed
ferroelectric liquid crystals.  These can be formed into free
standing thin films and could be the basis for some interesting
electro-optic elements.  In the Samara branch there is reported
to be a 10 Megajoule CO<SUB>2</SUB> laser with a phase conjugation
element for beam cleanup.  The chemical oxygen-iodine laser is
also located at this facility.  Current work in this area seems
to be on perfecting and understanding the jet singlet-oxygen generator
that they invented.<BR>

Optical Research Center, 11 Sep 96.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contact:
Prof David Payne, Director.  ORC was set up m 1989 by a UK government
funding agency known as the Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council (EPSRC).  ORC consists of over 120 people with
annual funding of $6 million (60 percent from government funds).
 ORC has been structured to perform only research, producing over
100 papers and 15 patents per year.  They also had 10 invited
plenary talks during this past year and are focused primarily
on fiberbased optical devices: sensors, lasers, gratings, and
other optical components--especially on the generation of femtosecond
to picosecond pulses at operating wavelengths of 1.3 and 1.55
microns.  They are also particularly strong in optical materials
research. For example, their poled glasses lead to inexpensive
electro-optic control of light, while photosensitivity provides
the Bragg-grating fiber and planar wavelength filters that are
essential to new multichannel optical-communication concepts.
 ORC also developed an optical parametric oscillator in periodically-poled
lithium niobate.  This produced very wide tuning of the output
wavelength from 1.65 to 2.8 microns (eye-safe region) by changing
the crystal temperature from 60 degree centigrade to 180 degree
centigrade.  ORC's primary market is telecommunication emphasizing
all optical switching and routing, third generation optical transmission
and distribution system, wavelength division multiplexing (WDM),
and time-division multiplexing (TDM) with substantial sales of
&quot;research-grade&quot; components and sub-systems.  However,
ORC is expanding in other markets such as environmental monitoring,
industrial sensing and processing, and military and civil aerospace
(lidar, target designation, range finding).  For example, their
new chalcogenide glasses lead to large non-linearity, acousto-optic
devices and mid-IR lasers for pollution monitoring.  ORC's mission
is to establish optics as a friendly technology for signal processing,
telemetry, sensing, and process control.  They have an advanced
fiber fabrication research capability to prepare and study standard
and rare-earth doped materials, novel geometries, and special
fibers for a broad range of applications.<BR>

21-23 August 1996, Venice, Italy.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>  This
workshop was sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Computer
Society Committee on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence.
 Fifty-five papers on theoretical foundations, experimental results,
and practical applications were selected among 97 papers from
27 countries world-wide.  Some of the novel presentations include
the following: (1) neural network modelling of electromagnetic
field problems using the finite element method to generate training
sets for neural networks was presented by Dr I. Ratner from the
University of Ottawa; (2) use of adaptive inverse control based
on linear and non-linear adaptive filtering presented by the keynote
speaker, Dr Bernard Widrow of Stanford University.  Dr Widrow's
method is applicable to linear or non-linear, single input-single
output, or multiple input-multiple output plants using signal
processing techniques.  The control scheme can be partitioned
into smaller sub-problems which can be independently optimized
while using a variety of signal processing schemes; and (3) the
use of neural networks for active drag reduction was presented
by Dr. David Babcock from the California Institute of Technology.
Experimental numerical results show that active feedback control
can achieve significant drag reduction of 25 percent.  AFOSR and
ARPA help sponsor this last effort under their grant program.
There were 15 technical sessions in identification, learning and
models, signal processing, image processing, control, robotics
and a poster session.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>International Conference on Mid-infrared Optoelectronics
Materials and Devices, 17 &amp; 18 September 1996, Lancaster University
- School of Physics and Chemistry, United Kingdom.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
 This two-day conference consisted of seven sessions: (1) materials
growth, (2) novel devices and applications, (3) photodetectors,
(4) LEDs and lasers, (5) quantum wells, heterostructures, and
superlattices, (6) device physics and theory, and (7) poster presentations.
 Papers that involve cascade lasers were non-existent.  Most of
the delegates were from universities with few from industry while
a majority of the papers focused on materials rather than devices.
 The emphasis on devices were primarily on emitters for gas sensing
applications.  Laboratory emitter devices that were presented
resulted in an output power of 100-400 microwatts having a potential
to operate at room temperature. The processing of mid-infrared
materials and devices is an immature technology with tremendous
growth potential given the well controlled fabrication processes
of Molecular-Beam Epitaxy (MBE), Metal Organic Chemical Vapor
Deposition (MOCVD), and Liquid Phase Epitaxy (LPE).  The fundamental
limitation on building these devices is a phenomenon called Auger
recombination that prevents efficient output power. There is little
theoretical modelling to accurately describe the process and to
calculate the Auger recombination rate is prohibitively and computationally
expensive.  Techniques to suppress this phenomenon were presented.

Research, 2-6 Sep. Academgorodek, Novosibirsk, Russia.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>This
conference is the eighth of its kind to be organized by the Institute
of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics; one of 25 research and academic
institutes in this scientific city of the Siberian Branch of the
Russian Academy of Science.  Attendees from nine countries participated,
although 35 of 50 of the written papers and 107 of 110 of the
posters were from Russian institutes, particularly from Novosibirsk
and Moscow.  Topics included flow diagnostics, instrumentation,
modelling, and computational development and verification over
the full range of sub/trans/super/hypersonic flows.  Significantly,
12 of the papers presented were co-authored between Russian and
non-Russian partners.  One area for consideration for further
collaboration is in boundary layer transition, where the host
organization presented several relevant papers, and where they
have collected significant amounts of experimental data, both
historically and currently.  A related area for consideration
is in MEMS active control for Tollmien-Schlichting boundary layer
wave cancellation.  The institute considers this to be an important
area for cooperation because they do not have the hardware technology
to produce MEMS, but they think they have better understanding
of the aerodynamic physics involved.  Very recently Academgorodok
received direct internet access with the help of the Soros Foundation.
 Consequently, web sites for these institutes are expected shortly.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>New facility at the Lavrentyev Institute of Hydrodynamics,
Academgorodek, Novosibirsk, Russia.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>In
the late 1980s, a new concept was devised for a high pressure
hypersonic wind tunnel facility which utilizes a two-stage hydraulic
piston multiplier to achieve a stagnation operating pressure of
3000 atmospheres.  At the time, the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute
(TsAGI) agreed to fund a proof of concept prototype to be designed
and constructed at the Institute of High Rate Hydrodynamics in
Novosibirsk.  Much of this system was completed, but construction
was abruptly halted when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. 
The system has now been moved to the Lavrentyev Institute of Hydrodynamics
with funding for completion promised by the Siberian Branch of
the Academy of Science.  The initial system will be the AT-303
Hypersonic Adiabatic Compression Wind Tunnel, which will operate
at Mach 10-25 with a total temperature of 2500K and a nozzle diameter
of 300-600 mm.  The tunnel is expected to yield pure undissociated
air for research such as scramjet testing, although specific tests
and customers are not yet known.  The tunnel should be on line
by the end of the calendar year, and an upgrade to the facility
(AT-303M) has already been designed.<BR>

founded in 1944 to produce avionics systems for Soviet aircraft,
and today nearly all Russian aircraft contain a Leninetz system.
In 1994, the company became the first Russian military defense
enterprise to become a stock holding company, and it is now the
largest enterprise in St Petersburg and sells its shares both
domestically and internationally on the St Petersburg stock exchange.
Also in 1994, the company coordinated the formation of the New
Hypersonic Technology Problem Directorate, which has united nearly
all Russian institutes involved in hypersonics research. This
Directorate has the government mandate to coordinate hypersonic
activities, and it uses Leninetz to do so. Leninetz itself has
been involved in hypersonics research for the past 15 years, and
is highly vested in a hypersonic vehicle concept known as AYAKS,
which would reduce vehicle drag through upstream plasma generation,
and control the flow by magnetohydrodynamics. Currently, Leninetz
is keen to attract international cooperative investment in AYAKS
research, and is frustrated that countries such as the US have
downsized hypersonic activities so drastically since the cancellation
of the NASP.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site Visit to the Central Research Institute of
Structural Materials, St Petersburg, Russia.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>This
institute is the primary materials research organization in St
Petersburg.  It employs approximately 2500 people between its
research center in St Petersburg and its experimental facility
complex 40 km outside the city.  Established in 1939, the institute
was involved in protection and materials processing for tanks
through WWII, and then became active in material development and
processing for submarines and nuclear power stations.  Today,
research includes a wide range of structural steels, alloys, composites,
energetic metals, and novel functional materials.  One area of
development is in heat protection technologies utilizing catalysis
film-type coatings and volumetric catalyzers.  An example is a
coaxial heat exchanger for a plasma stream tube where the institute
has increased the heat transfer rate from 100 kW/m2 developed
by industry to 300 kW/m<SUP>2</SUP> now.  The hope of this particular
research is to find the physical upper limited for this type of
heat exchange, possibly 1-2 MW/m<SUP>2</SUP>, and apply the technology
to protect hypersonic vehicle components.  Other technologies
include super fast cooling, where quenching rates of one million
degrees per second are used to create a broad range of materials
with unique physical properties such as microwires of high carbon
steel that are &#189; &#181;m in diameter and 10 km long, and
woven alloy sheets with electromagnetic wave absorption coefficients
as high as 97%.  Welding technologies include applications such
as attaching glass to steel, and coating research includes a coating
for surgical instruments that kills germs.<BR>

discovered the destruction of shockwaves in flows with fluorocarbons.
 Further research could not produce the same effect in air alone,
but it was found in plasma flows, and the effect has been attributed
to vorticity disturbances in reacting gases. More recently, effects
of ultrasound disturbances on shocks has been investigated and
published, and similar upcoming experiments are planned in flames.
 Facilities include a ballistic tunnel with optical and spectral
instrumentation, three types of plasma generators, a powder gun

Eastern Europe, AGARD has moved forward in promoting scientific
cooperation by participating in the organization of Eastern European
conferences, including Eastern European scientists in AGARD courses
and lectures, and inviting Eastern European participation at Panel
Symposia.  This meeting, however, marked the first time ever that
an AGARD Symposium was held outside of a NATO country. The theme
of the meeting dealt with the fact that very few new wind tunnel
facilities have been constructed in recent years, and that many
of the design &quot;artists&quot; have since retired or may do
so before the next generation of facilities is funded.  This meeting
was the opportunity the gather, review, and document existing
knowledge on wind tunnel design.  In addition, holding this meeting
in Moscow allowed for a strong Russian delegation to attend, particularly
from TsAGI, Russia's premier wind tunnel development and testing
organization.  Therefore, in addition to examining the current
state-of-the-art in NATO and Russia, scientists from both groups
exchanged information, ideas, and visions. 16 of the 33 papers

</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Moscow, <B>Russia.  </B>The purpose of
this visit was to see the result of an Air Force collaboration
with Dr Vladimir Simonov to create a television vibration measurement
system for Wright Laboratory. Construction of this system is complete,
and the operation is simple and user friendly.  The television
unit is focused on the object of interest, the initial object
position and brightness are calibrated, and any subsequent movement
of the object is quantified by the signal processor and can be
output to an oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, or PC.  Frequencies
from zero to 10,000 Hz are measured as accurately as the system
is calibrated, absolute displacements can be measured to 1% of
range, and amplitudes can be measured within 15% or less for all
objects.  The unique capability of this system is that it can
detect motion of a wider range of objects than anything currently
on the market.  The intended application at Wright Lab is the
measurement of severely overheated bodies in structures testing
facilities, but other potential applications include vibration
measurement during building construction, and remote vibration
detection of bridges and pipelines.  Due to downsizing and reorganizing
at Wright Lab, application of the system has been postponed. 
Consequently, the system will remain at MAI for an additional
year of evaluation and further enhancement.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site Visit to Uzbekistan.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Tashkent,
with a population of 2.5 million, is the fourth largest city in
the Former Soviet Union. Uzbekistan has significant natural resources,
but is still heavily dependent on Russia because of the old centralized
Soviet economy.  This trip was EOARD's first technical visit to
this part of the FSU.  The trip was made possible as part of an
exchange of scientists between the US, Russia, and Uzbekistan.
 Russian and Uzbek experts in optical tracking of satellites travelled
to the United States to visit facilities at the Air Force Phillips
Lab, Los Alamos National Lab, and Space Command.  In a reciprocal
gesture, scientists from Phillips Lab, Los Alamos, EOARD, and
Space Command were invited to visit a unique laser satellite tracking
facility in southern Uzbekistan.  We also seized the opportunity
to get a feel for the Uzbek's current state of technology by visiting
a number of other technical institutes.  The general feeling was
that the Soviets left behind an impressive array of technical
institutes, including a number of unique, technically advanced
facilities.  The Uzbeks were warm, open hosts.  They were always
eager to show us their research and readily answered all our questions.
A highlight of the trip was a meeting with the Minister of Defense
of Uzbekistan.  The most important outcome of the meeting was
the commitment by the Minister (authorized by the President of
Uzbekistan) to support any and all forms of cooperation/collaboration
with the US.</FONT>

 </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contact: Dr ALA. Kuznetsov, Director.
 For a description of the areas of active research at IPPI, see
the site visit write-up by Col Pletcher in the last issue of the
Eurogram.  Since that visit, EOARD has funded a project by a team
of three researchers in the Laboratory of Image Processing and
Digital Optics, whose goal is to develop effective nonlinear methods
for image enhancement and restoration, and to construct a wavelet-based
image compression algorithm.  Their method involves use of a new,
image-specific subband structure and smart, object-oriented vector
quantization of wavelet coefficients.  It is expected that the
research will provide a robust basis for new computational approaches,
methods, and algorithms for a variety of image processing problems.
Perhaps as a result of EOARD having provided support for one of
their scientists, the reception by the Director and members of
his staff was considerably warmer than it was the last time EOARD
visited.  IPPI has had, and continues to have, extensive collaborations
with universities and research centers in many countries, including
the US, Canada, Germany, Britain, France, Israel, and more.  The
Director indicated a strong desire for increased interaction with
US DoD research agencies, and the Institute has a large reservoir
of talent.  The 17 laboratories into which IPPI is organized include
such titles as <I>Stochastic Dynamical Systems; Data Analysis,
Error Correction Codes, and Cryptology;lntegrated Service Digital
Networks (ISDN); Sensory Information Processing; and Problems

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visit to the Institute of Solar&#173;Terrestrial
Physics, Irkutsk, Russia, 25 September - I October 1996.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
 Prof. Geily Zerebtsov, Director.  Solar-terrestrial physics has
been done here since a magnetometer station was established 130
years ago.  This became an ionospheric observatory in 1948.  The
institute was founded in 1961.  It is the oldest of the Russian
laboratories that covers the disciplines of solar-terrestrial
physics.  It is responsible for several radio and optical observatories
in Central Siberia, reaching from the Mongolian border to the
Norilsk, in the arctic. There is also a strong theoretical effort
in the area of HF propagation and middle atmospheric dynamics.
 Remote sites include a coronagraph on the border with Mongolia,
a site to study short period pulsations on a radio-quiet island
in Lake Baikal, three cosmic ray observatories (not currently
in use), and magnetic stations in Irkutsk and Norilsk.  They are
beginning an effort to investigate stratospheric ozone in response
to evidence of an ozone hole over Siberia.  The institute has
built on graduates of Siberian universities, and emphasizes the
fact that their observatories were designed and built locally.
 The director and personnel of the Institute are very progressive
and forward-looking.  Many efforts are being made to establish
contacts with the West.  A major problem is lack of Internet access.
 We were able to visit some of the observatories near Irkutsk,
which include a solar radio telescope, optical solar telescope,
chirp sounder, and incoherent scatter radar.  The institute has
recently acquired a military radar that is being used for incoherent
scatter observations.  Access to the radar requires crossing about
100 m of a military establishment, making it impossible to visit
by persons with US military connections. The radar itself is not
restricted.  The radar has been contributing to World Day experiments,
mainly with temperature profiles.  Spectrum analysis of the signal
has been hampered by Faraday rotation of the signal and the inability
to receive more than one linear polarization.  The Siberian Solar
Radio Telescope at Badary is an interferometer array consisting
of a cross of 256 antennas operating at 5.5 GHz. The director
is Dr. T. A. Treshkov. The angular resolution of the telescope
is 20 arc sec for 1-dimensional, and 15 arc sec for 2-dimensional
array.  There is no telephone or radio access to the site.  A
forest fire in May of this year burned the entire area around
the observatory.  Most of the buildings housing the optical equipment
and HF diagnostics were burned, but the radio telescope itself
was saved.  The Large Solar Vacuum Telescope is located on the
shore of Lake Baikal.  The director is V. I Skomorovsky.  The
location of the telescope near the lake is to reduce atmospheric
turbulence.  The telescope is a 40-m tube with an outer jacket
for air flow and an evacuated inner cylinder to minimize temperature
gradients and the resulting turbulence. Three smaller telescopes
nearby provide support with observations of H, Ca, and UV.<BR>

Dr. G. F. Tulinov, Director.  The Institute was founded in 1957

organization in Russia for solar and geophysical service.  For
twenty years the Institute has fulfilled the function of the Eurasian
(Moscow) Regional Center of the former International URSIgram
and World Day Service (IUWDS), now called International Space
Environment Service (ISES), or Space Weather Service.  In the
scope of ISES, the Institute is connected to other Regional Warning
Centers (Boulder, Sydney, Tokyo, Ottawa, and others) by a real
time round-the-clock exchange of observational data and forecasts.
 In the Institute there are special divisions aimed to develop
the principal directions of the space weather monitoring and forecast:
Sun, magnetosphere, ionosphere, upper neutral atmosphere.  The
Warning Center collects on a real time basis all the available
data of the ground-based ionospheric and magnetic measurements
from around the former Soviet Union, as well as original measurements
of charged particle fluxes (to evaluate the magnetosphere state
and possible radiation hazard for manned space flights) on board
the &quot;Meteor&quot; satellite.  A special effort is being made
to model the principle processes in the near-Earth environment,
including the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. Some of the results
obtained in the Institute contribute to international projects
and programs such as IRI, PRIME, and CEDAR.<BR>

four laboratories: Physics of the Ionosphere and Long Wave Radio

the Atmosphere and Ionosphere, Prof. Victor Rapoport, director;
Physics of the Ionosphere and Wave Propagation, Prof. Valery Uryadov,
director; and the Sura Radio Observatory, Dr. Georgi Komrakov,
director.  A major focus of the institute is ionospheric modification.
 The heater at Sura is the second most powerful in the world.
 It is well maintained, and used on a regular basis for international
campaigns.  There are active theoretical projects mainly in the
area of artificial turbulence and small-scale irregularities.

radiation or by <I>IQW </I>frequency sound. This allows, for example,
the measurement of electron density and vertical drift velocities

at 40 Hz is used by Prof. Rapaport's group to develop a refractive

<FONT SIZE=2>EOARD promotes technical interchange by supporting
and co-sponsoring (with other governmental agencies) technical
workshops and mini-symposia at overseas conferences.  We often
receive free proceedings and attendance for one or more Air Force
representatives.  Air Force R&amp;D personnel attending or considering
to attend European conferences should contact EOARD for information
and to determine whether free registration is available.  We have
also listed conferences being supported by our sister-service
London offices, ERO and ONREUR.  <B>Bi-service and tri-service
support efforts are in bold print.  </B>We also announce lecture
series given by the Von Karman Institute (VKI) or AGARD (the aerospace
research arm of NATO), however, these lecture series are normally
not sponsored by EOARD, and free registrations will not be available.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Perhaps the most effective means EOARD has to initiate
and promote technical liaison between Air Force and European scientists
is the Window on Science (WOS) program.  Through this program
we can arrange and fund the visits of European scientists to selected
Air Force facilities.  To nominate a WOS candidate contact your
laboratory Chief Scientist and/or your EOARD Laboratory representative.
 Below is a list of some WOS visits planned for the upcoming months.
 For further details regarding a visitor read the expanded details
in the Laboratory representative section of the <I>EUROGRAM</I>
or contact the LO, the point of contact at the visit site, or
the EOARD Chief of International Programs. <B>Bi-service and tri-service
coordinated visits are in bold print.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The <I>EUROGRAM</I> is published bimonthly by the
US Air Force European Office of Aerospace Research and Development
(EOARD), Detachment 1 of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research
(AFOSR).  It contains reports on European research, a complete
list of current EOARD points of contact, and a summary of recent
work in our primary programs  The purpose of the <I>EUROGRAM</I>
is twofold: first, to alert the Air Force technical community
to research developments in Europe from which a technical dialogue
may begin, and second, to provide an executive summary for Air
Force management of work discovered by EOARD. The opinions and
assessments in this periodical are solely those of the authors

at Southampton</FONT></B></I></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A Workshop on Methodologies for Ground Simulation
of the Space Environment was held from 17 through 19 July at Southampton
in the United Kingdom.  Sponsored by EOARD through the University
of Southampton, this workshop was the brainchild of Dr Charles
Stein, Chief of the Phillips Laboratory Space and Missiles Technology
Directorate's Space Environment Interaction Branch.  The workshop
was intended to provide a forum in which research scientists could
explore experimental techniques and exchange ideas on improving
ground simulation of the space environment so that ground results
more closely corroborate those from space experiments.  Co-chairs
were Dr Stein and Dr Nick Wood of the Department of Aeronautics
and Astronautics at the University of Southampton.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The venue, Chilworth Manor, is owned by the University
of Southampton and is located in the village of Chilworth, just
outside of Southampton.  With its excellent meeting facilities,
restaurants, and accommodations, Chilworth was ideal for fostering
an environment that allowed maximum discussion and exchange of
ideas among the participants and encouraged interaction between
presenters and attendees outside of formal sessions.  Participants
took all their meals together and enjoyed the relaxed ambiance,
the charming common rooms, and the lovely gardens and terrace
of the early twentieth century manor house in its peaceful setting.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The pace of the sessions gave session chairs the
freedom to allow unlimited questions and discussion.  Likewise,
the poster session was an excellent opportunity for interesting
technical interchanges.  A Round Table discussion held the final
afternoon was widely attended with much energetic discussion taking
place under the leadership of the Workshop Organizing Committee.
 This committee was comprised of Dr Stein, Dr Wood, Dr V.I Toupikov
of the Obinsk Branch of the Karpov Institute of Physical Chemistry;
Obinsk, Russia; Dr Rod Tennyson of the University of Toronto,
Institute for Aerospace Studies, Ontario, Canada; Dr Alain Paillous
of CERT-ONERA Space  Technology  Department, Toulouse, France;

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Planning for the workshop began in September 1995, when a planning session was held at EOARD's offices in London and attended by the members of the organizing committee.  This planning session, also sponsored by EOARD, was key to the success of the Workshop which followed.  At that time the topics to be covered were outlined, strategy formulated, and Southampton picked as the Workshop site.  The University of Southampton was able to offer an attractive rate for accommodation, meals and use of conference facilities.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Workshop was well attended by a broad spectrum of researchers actively involved in ground simulation of the space environment.  Participants included US scientists from Phillips Laboratory (Kirtland AFB and Edwards AFB), NASA, Lewis Research Center, Johnson Space Center, the University</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>of Florida, and Montana State University.  There
were representatives from ESA/ESTEC and ONERA as well as scientists
from Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands,
Germany, Israel and Russia.  A total of 45 participants attended,
which was right in the range of 40-50 attendees which was viewed
by Workshop organizers as optimum for the type of interaction
they desired.Ten major areas were covered, each of which was the
subject of a dedicated session.  These areas were: Atomic Oxygen
(AO) Sources, AO Beam Diagnostics, AO Testing Standards, Ion Sources,
Radiation Sources, Contamination/Outgassing, Thermal/Vacuum Testing,
Synergistic Testing, Tribology and Hypervelocity Debris. As a
result of holding many mutually beneficial technical exchanges,
the group was able to reach consensus in several areas.  Participants
agreed that the importance of synergism has not been sufficiently
addressed and that there is value to having international standards
for conducting synergistic testing.  There was much discussion
regarding ashers for production of AO, resulting in agreement
that, while ashers do not simulate energy or flux of AO as it
exists in the space environment, their use for screening materials
for further in-depth study may have value.  Significantly, it
was agreed that accelerated testing for some materials is not
valid.  Since this approach is frequently taken with the vacuum
ultraviolet, this agreement may impact  future approaches to testing.
 It also came to light that, with a couple of exceptions, very
few international facilities combine theory and modeling with
testing and data gathering in the study of erosion rates.  Consequently,
most researchers are not in a position to recommend suitable materials
modifications to assure increased effectiveness and longer life.
   </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>One very positive outcome of the Workshop is that
the Space Environment Interaction Branch has confirmed that it
is a world leader in low earth orbit combined effects testing.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At EOARD, we have noted the success of this and other
recent workshops and small conferences which we have supported.
 We  believe that providing an opportunity for a small group of
international specialists to meet to address a focused area of
research is a very exciting way  of facilitating international
cooperation.  EOARD would like to identify other areas which would
be appropriate for consideration in such a forum.  If there are
technologies that you would like to see examined in an international
environment, contact your EOARD liaison officer and present your
ideas.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>BACKGROUND:  After the breakup of the Soviet Union,
centralized R&amp;D support and leadership have been in decline
throughout the FSU.  Many leading scientists and engineers from
academia and the military-industrial complex in the FSU have started
their own R&amp;D companies, which sometimes represent the best
of R&amp;D in some areas.  These companies invariably stay underground,
as they are afraid of organized crime.  There is also very little
support from the government.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>ONREUR will conduct a tri-service sponsored workshop-review
wherein private R&amp;D companies that excel in areas of interest
to DoD will report to representatives of both US federal agencies
and private industry on their science and technology developments.
 We will review only non-classified R&amp;D and will coordinate
with appropriate Russian authorities.</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=2>We would like to attract representatives of
various R&amp;D federal agencies and DOD tri-service representation
for participation in the review.  Please contact EOARD for further

 Contact: Dr G. N. Kulipanov, Deputy Director.  This institute
has close to 3000 employees of which 550 are scientists. The research
can be divided into four major areas: particle physics, plasma
physics, accelerator physics, and synchrotron and free-electron
lasers.  Of particular note is their research on free-electron
lasers (FEL).  A table top FEL is under construction that will
generate 1 Watt of average power at wavelengths around 30 m. 
The optical klystron that was installed on the VEPP-3 accelerator
in Novosibirsk is now at Duke University and will be used to generate
radiation in the 0.24 - 0.05 m region of the spectrum.  In 1994
the Siberian Center for Photochemical Research was formed from
members of the Institute for Nuclear Physics and the Institute
for Chemical Combustion.  The heart of this project is a FEL that
is tunable between 3 and 20 &#181;m with an average power of up
to 100 kW.  The building to house this laser is approximately
50% complete and construction of the laser has begun.  This project
is currently on hold due to a lack of funds, but the people responsible
for the laser believe that some funds for this project are pending.
 In addition to research on the laser itself, there are several
projects associated with using the radiation that would be available
from a FEL.  One of the more interesting is associated with the
photodissociation of exhaust gases to render them inert.  The
particular application that they have in mind is the removal of
the unburned portions of poisonous gases that result from the
incomplete incineration of chemical weapons.</FONT>

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Laser Institute.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>  Contact:
Prof Sergei N. Bagayev, Director.  This institute currently employs
around 300 people excluding the facility near Irkutsk.  There
is notable research in the areas of high resolution spectroscopy,
highly stable lasers, femtosecond spectroscopy, atomic interferometry,
laser-produced plasmas, and laser applications.  The key to much
of the research in this institute is the construction of ultra-stable
lasers.  These lasers are typically diode-pumped solid state lasers
with a long term stability of / &lt; 10<SUP>-13</SUP>.   Most
of the laser crystals, as well as many of the nonlinear crystals,
are grown and processed in house.  Due to the current state of
funding, much of the research in this institute has shifted towards
applications.  These include high resolution spectroscopy of biological
samples from the UV to the near IR, gravitational wave detectors,
LIDAR, measurements of small displacements, and medical applications.
 In the latter area, they are field testing devices for use in
dentistry, surgery, and reconfiguration of the cornea.  They also
claim to have developed a system that is capable of measuring
displacements of 10 &#181;m over distances of 10 km through the
atmosphere.  Besides high resolution lasers, they have a major
research effort in plasmas produced by CO<SUB>2</SUB> lasers.
 This portion of the research effort was closed before the breakup
of the Soviet Union.  One project of interest is the simulation
of explosive cosmological phenomena.  The facility where this
research is performed was originally used to simulate the effects
of a nuclear explosion in the upper atmosphere.  The second project
studies the detachment of a shock wave from a supersonic projectile
due the formation of a laser-produced plasma in front of the object.

 </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contact: Dr S. T. Vaskov, Director. 
This institute has approximately 500 staff members, of which 230
are scientists and the rest are engineers.  This was the first
institute to be created in the Academic City in 1957.  Research
falls into two main categories: laser and nonlinear physics, and
new information technologies. I did not talk to anyone in the
areas covered by new information technologies, but did discover
that the main areas of research  include photo-induced phenomena
on micro and nanoscales, optical computing systems, and control
of spectral, spatial, and polarization characteristics of laser
radiation.  All of my discussions were with scientists in laser
and nonlinear physics.   Dr Mezentsev and his group are using
analytical tools such as inverse transform methods and truncated
models to study solitons and self focusing in nonlinear solid-state
materials.  They are particularly interested in soliton solutions
and their stability in one- and two-dimensional periodic areas
of nonlinear elements.  They have some particularly interesting
work on soliton solutions for one-dimensional arrays of optical
fibers and pulse propagation in nonlinear transmission lines.
Another group is doing theoretical studies on light propagation
in photorefractive materials. They are particularly interested
in the stability of the gratings formed in these materials by
counter-propagating beams.  Dr Komarov and his group are doing
calculations on pulse formation in passively mode-locked lasers
with intracavity nonlinear Kerr elements.  They are particularly
interested in understanding the regions of stability in the parameter
space so that self-phase modulation of the pulses can be suppressed.

 </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contact: Prof V. M. Teshukov, Deputy
Director.   This institute currently employs approximately 500
people, of which around 150 are scientists.  Research can be divided
into four broad categories: mathematical problems of continuum
mechanics, applied hydrodynamics, solid mechanics, and detonation
and explosion processes.  The group associated with the mathematical
problems of continuum mechanics is interested in the mathematics
underlying a number of problems.  These include the use of symmetry
properties of model materials to determine the properties of solutions,
 the study of nonlinear wave propagation in polydispersive media
such as liquids with bubbles, the development of models of phase
transitions, and mathematical models of the dynamics of inhomogeneous
media.  Applied hydrodynamics includes both experimental and theoretical
efforts.  Areas of particular interest are experimental investigation
of wave motion, hydrodynamic stability, and turbulence and motion
of bodies in liquids. The theoretical effort is largely devoted
to various problems in computational hydrodynamics, such as the
theory of numerical methods of solving initial boundary value
problems, problems of heat and mass transfer for multiphase flows,
and dynamic flows in machines with turbine blades, (aircraft engines,
fans, etc.) to name a few.  Research in solid mechanics has both
theoretical and experimental components also. This group is involved
in studies of static and dynamic strength of materials, numerical
methods for use in solid mechanics, and the mechanics of fracture.
 Of particular interest to me was the modeling of material fracture
in the vicinity of the tip of a crack on the atomic level.  In
the area of explosions, studies are carried out in detonation
processes, explosion physics, impulse gas dynamics and underwater
explosions.  The underwater explosion facility was particularly
interesting.  It consists of a large tank in which up to 1.5 g
of explosive can be detonated.  Studies are conducted on cavitation
effects, effects of air-water interface, fluid fracture under
explosive loading, and numerical simulation of underwater explosions.
 Also of interest are the pulsed x-rays tubes that have been developed
for studying fracture dynamics and diffusion of liquids such as
water through rock.  These tubes span the range of energies from
100 KeV to 1.2 MeV.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Discussions with Prof V. A. Gurashvily and Dr
I. V. Kochetov, Troitsk Institute of Innovative and Thermonuclear
Research.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> As is true with many of the
scientific institutes in Russia, this one has suffered since the
breakdown of the Soviet Union. For example, the institute currently
employs a little over 2000 people in contrast to the 6000 employed
five years ago.  Also, they are currently without electricity.
 Research is mainly involved with high power lasers and thermonuclear
fusion.  Discussions were confined to research in high-power lasers.
  The development and investigation of high-power CO lasers at
Troitsk is particularly noteworthy.  They specialize in electron-beam
controlled discharge CO lasers with a cooled gas mixture (100
K) flowing through the cavity.  They have built and studied a
number of CO lasers.  When operated on the fundamental the largest
laser could generate nearly 50 KW of average power with 20-30%
efficiency.  Of particular interest is the CO laser operating
on the overtone with lines between 2.9 and 3.8 &#181;m, an average
output power of a few kilowatts, and an efficiency around 3%.
 There were also studies on using the active CO medium for phase
conjugation.  Associated with the experimental group is a particularly
strong theoretical group which has developed several models of
the CO laser.  Unlike the experimental group, the theoretical
group is very active.  They have recently begun to work with Dr
Ionin's group at the Lebedev Institute (see following site visit
report).</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visit to Gas Laser Laboratory, P. N. Lebedev
Physical Institute, Moscow, Russia.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contact:
Dr A. A. Ionin.  This laboratory has approximately 30 people studying
e-beam pumped excimer lasers, ArXe lasers, and CO<SUB>2</SUB>,
CO, and N<SUB>2</SUB>O gas lasers.  Most of the current work is
associated with the gas lasers, particularly CO and CO<SUB>2</SUB>
lasers.  There are three chambers that are used for gas laser
studies.  All of them use electron-beam controlled discharges.
 Two of the chambers are static fill - one has a capacity of 4
liters and the other of 12 liters.  Both use gases cooled to liquid
nitrogen temperatures.  The remaining chamber is a mach 3.5 flow
chamber.  In this case the gas is cooled to around 100 K by expansion.
 This chamber is currently not in use.  There are currently three
active projects in the laboratory.  The first is the development
of a CO laser operating around 6 &#181;m with 0.05-0.1 J per pulse
of 1-5 &#181;sec duration and 6 kW average power.  The second
is a European Community project to study the feasibility of constructing
a 100 kW class CO laser for industrial applications.  The last
is an experimental study of phase conjugation in active media
of CO and CO<SUB>2</SUB> lasers.  The last project is being done
in collaboration with the theoretical group from Troitsk mentioned
above.  Dr Ionin and his group have also made extensive studies
of CO overtone lasers.  To date, they have achieved 50 J with
an efficiency of about 5%.  This same laser has an output power
of 50 kW when run on the fundamental. </FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visit to International Laser Center, Moscow
State University, Moscow, Russia.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contact:
Prof N. Koroteev, Director of the Institute and Vice-Rector of
the University.  The International Laser Center is a semi-independent
branch of the university that combines teaching duties with research
in lasers and nonlinear optics.  The permanent staff consists
of 30-40 people, with an approximately equal number from other
departments in the university holding joint positions.  As with
other institutes in Russia, they are facing difficult times because
of restricted budgets.  Nonetheless, they have managed to keep
a number of programs going by forming international collaborations.
 They  have active projects in the generation and use of super-intense
laser fields, adaptive optics, optical methods in medicine and
biophysics, and several applied fields.  The crystal growing facility
is particularly impressive not so much because of the equipment
but rather because of the people.  For instance, they have developed
a method for crystal growing that reduces the amount of time to
grow conventional nonlinear optical crystals by a factor of 50.
 This work is now being performed in collaboration with Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory.   The adaptive optics program includes
not only the traditional deformable mirror approach but also the
use of liquid crystals to provide a system with optical feedback.
 Another group has developed a program to predict the effects
of different turbulence spectra on the propagation of an image
through the atmosphere.  They are currently adding other atmospheric
effects to the model.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visit to the Department of High Power Lasers,
General Physics Institute, Moscow, Russia.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contact:
Prof V. Apollonov, Director.  This once very active group has
had its activities curtailed by the financial difficulties of
Russian science.  Nonetheless, they continue to work and generate
good science.  As the title of the laboratory indicates, they
are concerned with high power lasers.  Previously, this work was
heavily funded by the military and centered on gas lasers such
as CO<SUB>2</SUB> and DF.  More recently they have moved to  laser
diode development and cw solid-state lasers while continuing the
earlier work.  The DF laser is pumped by a self-sustained discharge
and can generate 30 J in 200 nsec pulses at 10-100 Hz. They believe
that they can boost the energy to 100 J with little effort.  The
CO<SUB>2 </SUB>laser oscillator will now generate 0.5 J in picosecond
pulses at 50 Hz.  The output from this laser will be fed into
an amplifier from which they expect to get several joules per
pulse.  This laser is to be used for the generation of terahertz
and gigahertz radiation.  The latter wavelengths were proposed
as means of generating a plasma ball to disrupt missiles.  The
research in semiconductor lasers is primarily concerned with phase-locking
of 2-D arrays.  Most of the effort is now concentrating on linear
arrays.  They can get 15 W  cw out of a 1 cm length at the present
time, and believe they know how to get to 100 W.  The most interesting
work is in the generation of cw green light using a frequency
doubled solid state laser.  As a result of progress in overcoming
the optical distortion that is inherent in these types of lasers,
they can now generate a green beam of close to 70 W cw.  The power
is currently limited by color-center formation in the doubling
crystal.  A 1 kW system is currently under design.</FONT>

and Dr V. N. Zakharov, Scientific Secretary.  This institute was
founded in 1983 and employs approximately 800 people, of which
91 are Doctors of Science.  In addition to the central complex
in Moscow there are branches in Kazan and Orel, as well as a joint
center with the Taganrog Institute of Radiotechnology.  There
are four main areas of research that are pursued in this institute:
 information technologies; system software and software tools;
design tools for telecommunications systems; and computer hardware.
 Under the general category of information technologies falls
image and voice processing (mainly applied to police work), some
work on processing of images from satellites, and applications
of information technologies to industry, medicine, economic forecasting,
etc.  System software and software tools includes development
of operating systems, parallel algorithms, and expert system shells,
to name a few.  Most of the work in telecommunications is concerned
with the design of regional and local networks.  The remaining
area, computer hardware, covers the development and design of
new and unconventional computer architectures and of the tools
for hardware design.  In particular, they have developed a basic
theory of self-synchronization and have begun development of the
methodology for designing self-synchronized circuits.  The people
that we talked with claim that this approach is not the quasi-self-synchronization
that is popular in the West.  Underlying all of these areas is
a strong effort in fundamental research on a variety of topics
related to representation of data, expert systems, and transmission,
encoding and protection of information.</FONT>

 This institute is one of the leading institutes in Russia for
the design, development and manufacturing of space-qualified devices
and equipment.  The laser-related projects in which they are involved
include development of corner cubes for laser ranging of satellites,
on- board laser ranging systems for satellite-to-satellite and
satellite-to-ground applications, laser communications for satellite-to-satellite
and ground-to-satellite communications, stationary LIDAR systems
for pollution monitoring, systems to measure wind velocities using
Doppler shifts, and space-based LIDAR systems based on pulse broadening
to study clouds and smoke dispersion.  They also control a network
of ground based stations for laser ranging and imaging of satellites
that is not fully operational at the present time due to funding
problems.  One of the current development projects is to upgrade
the existing ranging system by using shorter (picosecond vs. nanosecond)
laser pulses.  In addition to the laser-based systems mentioned
above, the scientists and engineers in the institute design and
manufacture space systems for resource studies and environmental
monitoring, for navigation (GLONASS) and for unmanned planetary
probes.  They are also responsible for much of the software associated
with telemetry.</FONT>

Deputy Director.   The Ioffe Institute was founded in 1918 and
is one of the oldest institutes in Russia.  Since its founding,
twenty other institutes have been spun-off from it.  It is also
known for having educated some of the most brilliant Russian scientists,
among whom are Landau and Kapitza.  It is undoubtedly the leading
research institute in semiconductor physics in Russia.  In fact,
four of the five divisions of  the institute are involved in research
 in semiconductor and solid-state physics.  The remaining division
encompasses plasma physics, atomic physics and astrophysics. 
Our discussions concentrated on a few select topics in the Division
of Semiconductor Heterostructures  and the Division of Solid State
Electronics.  A more complete list of research topics in these
divisions, as well as in the remaining divisions, can be found
on their web site, http://www.ioffe.rssi.ru.  The Division of
Semiconductor Heterostructures concentrates on research in the
physics and technological applications of silicon and III-V semiconductors
and semiconductor heterostructures.   This division grows its
own structures using LPE, MBE, and MOCVD.  They also have a complete
set of diagnostics for characterizing materials and structures.
 These include transmission and scanning electron microscopes,
x-ray diffraction, and Auger electron spectroscopy, to name a
few.  Topics of particular interest are:  the development of heterostructure
solar cells for space applications; semiconductor lasers based
on quantum-well structures and superlattices operating in the
3-5&#181;m region of the spectrum; opto-electronic devices for
2-4 &#181;m radiation; studies of group III nitrides for blue-green
diode lasers; electric field tuning of quantum well detectors;
and fast power semiconductor devices.  One of the most interesting
projects in the Division of  Solid State Electronics is the development
of a terabyte holographic memory based on multiplexed holograms
in bulk photorefractive crystals.  Also of interest is a new method
for 3-D imaging by generation of a &quot;selectogram&quot;.</FONT>

Prof R. M. Usupov, Director.  The Institute for Informatics and
Automation has approximately 300 employees, which is about half
of the 1990 level.  This reduction includes the loss of 150 people
to form the Center of Ecological Security.  The research within
the institute is divided into four divisions: hardware; algorithms
and programming theory; automation of research, design, and manufacturing;
and analysis and modeling of global processes.   Within the division
of hardware, computer systems with a dynamic architecture that
supports automatic parallel processing are developed for use in
a variety of applications, including computer aided design, telemetry,
and image processing.  As an example of this work we were shown
a board with  6 Intel FLEXLogic chips that operates like 15 Pentium
chips at 100MHz.  The development of automated systems for handling
and processing of data from remote sites also falls in this division,
as does the design, implementation, and maintenance of the Saint
Petersburg area net.  Fast prototyping of large software packages
for computers with limited resources and the development of mathematical
techniques for algorithms falls in the Division of Algorithms
and Program Theory.  An example of work in this area is a C compiler
implemented in 10k of space.  Projects in the Division of Automation
of Research, Design, and Manufacturing include configuration management
and development of adaptive computer systems and data structures
for image recognition.  A practical example of this work is the
real-time identification of aircraft against a background.  The
remaining division develops methods for dealing with uncertainty
in knowledge based systems, machine learning by example, models
of and strategies for dealing with complex nonlinear systems such
as unmanned aircraft, and remote monitoring of the earth's surface.

Institute had over half of its R&amp;D efforts directed to military
and space applications during the Soviet era.   Also, this institute
was and still is responsible for the establishment of optical
standards in the country.  In addition to research and development
work, they have a large manufacturing facility that produces a
variety of products such as optical components for space, optical
instruments, optical coatings, sensors,  and large telescope mirrors.
 One of the more interesting line of products is the large (up
to 1.5 m diameter) SiC mirrors and mounts.  In addition to the
design and manufacture of optical systems and components,  a large
number of research projects are carried out within the institute.
 Our discussions were with the scientists of the Institute of
Laser Physics.   This subdivision of the Vavilov Institute has
approximately 200 scientists and engineers who perform research
in theoretical laser physics, gas lasers, and solid state lasers.
 Among the gas lasers are CO<SUB>2</SUB>, CO (fundamental and
overtone), Iodine, and HF.  They claim to have active research
efforts in chemical lasers, but we were unable to get any further
information.  Solid state laser research involves Er, Ho, and
Tm doped materials for lasers operating in the 1.5 - 3 &#181;m
band, various nonlinear and holographic methods for beam cleanup,
medical applications and fiber transport of high power laser radiation.</FONT>

10-12 June, Elba International Physics Center, Italy.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
 This workshop was sponsored by the Commission of the European
Community, Consiglio Nazionale delle Richerche, Instituto di Fisica
della Materia, European Office of Aerospace Research and Development,
Office of Naval Research Europe, and Universit&agrave; di Pisa.
 This workshop brought together the leading experts in the fields
of Bose-Einstein condensation, atom optics, and atom lasers (atomasers)
to review the current level of knowledge in these fields and to
speculate on future developments.  Highlights of this conference
where several excellent reviews on experimental demonstrations
of Bose-Einstein condensation, progress towards and theories of
atomasers, atom optics, and atom traps and their uses.  On the
more practical side, there was a report on the use of a hologram
to manipulate a cold atomic beam and reports on various schemes
to develop a mirror for atoms.  The latter included the use of
evanescent waves and periodic magnetic fields, which in one case
where created on computer floppy discs.</FONT>

conference was convened under the auspices of UNESCO with additional
support provided by a variety of organizations in Turkey, and
by the European Office of Aerospace Research and Development,

country or region while others where of broader interest.  Topics
ranged from a specific case study in a country to general issues
such as the role of government, industry and universities in determining
the direction of basic research.    Although this was an interesting
conference and a spectacular chance to meet representatives from

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Azerbaijan Academy of Sciences, Baku, Azerbaijan.
</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>Dr Eldar Salaev, President of the Academy
of Sciences.  The Academy of Sciences is divided into seven departments:
 physical-mathematical and technical sciences, chemical sciences,
biological sciences, earth sciences, social sciences, Azerbaijani
culture, and the central scientific library.  These departments
encompass 33 institutes, 6 manufacturing units, and 2 experimental
factories.  Total number of employees is around 9000, of which
500 have Doctor of Sciences degrees and 2000 have PhDs.  The members
of the Academy are responsible for coordinating all science in
the Republic of Azerbaijan, including that performed in industry
and the universities.  As is the case with other republics derived
from the former Soviet Union, science funding has been drastically
cut since the breakup of the USSR.  This has resulted in a decrease
in the number of scientists employed by the Academy and a number
of scientists leaving for other countries, particularly Turkey
and Iran.  Another consequence of the financial plight of the
Academy has been the cancellation, three years ago, of subscriptions
to foreign journals.  In order to ease the financial problem,
the Academy of Sciences has been actively pursuing collaborative
efforts with other countries.  Iran, in particular, has been actively
courting them.  During the Soviet years Azerbaijan was one of
the principal research and manufacturing centers for infrared
detectors for the Soviet military.  When the Soviet military pulled
out of Azerbaijan they took the manufacturing equipment for the
detectors, although there are plenty of samples still available,
as is the technology. A list of materials that can be produced
by the following two institutes is available from EOARD.</FONT>

 Approximately half of the employees are scientists and engineers.
 The broad areas of research are solid state, particle physics,
and composite structures.  There is very little theoretical effort
in any area.  Of particular interest is the production and investigation
of chalcogenide semiconductors activated by rare-earth elements
and the studies on III-VI semiconductors, such as GaSe.  Current
work seems to be emphasizing the III-VI semiconductors and their
linear and nonlinear optical properties.  They are studying luminescence
of the III-VI materials when pumped near the damage threshold
and methods of creating harder materials.  A long term goal is
to get some of these materials to lase in the infrared.   </FONT>

and testing of detector assemblies.  They have also designed and
constructed thermoelectric coolers for systems that operate in
the 200-300 K temperature range, and claim to have the technology
to produce coolers for attaining  liquid nitrogen temperatures.
 Some projects of current interest include the development of
more sensitive materials for the 2 - 14 m region and the development
of multiple wavelength infrared detectors.  In the former case
this includes more work on  Hg<SUB>X</SUB>Cd<SUB>1-X</SUB>Te and

of 180 Russians and 73 foreigners had registered to attend the
meetings, however only about 50 Russians and 50 foreigners arrived,
causing a large number of papers to be canceled at the last moment.
 In addition, the host organizers were poorly prepared to handle
the logistics of such a large event, and at the last moment it
was found that NATO has strict rules limiting the percentage of
CP country attendees, so it was not possible for participants
to freely move between the two meetings.  Topics included production

ecological aspects, and fire and explosion safety.  Lessons learned

<B><FONT SIZE=2>3<B><SUP>rd</SUP> International Symposium on Small
Satellite Systems and Services, 28-28 June, Annecy, France.  </B></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>This
bi-annual symposium is sponsored by the French space agency, CNES.
 The symposium featured approximately 80 papers from researchers
throughout Europe, as well as Russia, South Africa, Israel, and
the U.S. Attendees numbered nearly 300.  Various new missions,
new technologies, and results from previous missions were presented.
 New mission concepts demonstrated the potential for flexible,
cost-effective small satellites to replace larger, more expensive
platforms for a variety of applications.  One timely example was
presented by Satellites International Ltd. of Newbury, UK.  They
proposed a replacement for the CLUSTER mission lost in the Ariane
V launch mishap earlier this year.  Their replacement would use
5 smaller, cheaper satellites rather than the 4 larger, more expensive
ones to collect the same data at lower cost and with greater overall
mission reliability.  Other proposals included small satellites
for dedicated remote sensing, synthetic aperture radar, military
communications, and multimedia communications.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It was interesting to note that while many new small
satellite missions are planned, few have identified an actual
launch provider.  Ariane defined an industry standard with their
Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads (ASAP), which can accommodate
up to 6 microsatellites (50-kg or less) at a very low price. 
Unfortunately, there are very few ASAP opportunities to low-Earth
orbit over the next few years.  Presentations by several Russian
launch providers such as EurROCKOT described efforts to convert
existing ICBMs into small satellite launchers.  Israeli Aircraft
Industries presented their entry into the market, the OFFEQ-3.
 They eventually hope to launch this all-solid launch vehicle
from Wallops Island in the U.S.  Orbital Science Corp. (OSC) presented
opportunities on the Pegasus and Taurus launch vehicles.  However,
while launch opportunities appear to exist, the launch price may
severely constrain some of these missions.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Various new satellite technologies were also presented.
 The emphasis in this research area was not so much in revolutionizing
capability, but in creating simple subsystems with reasonable
performance at low-cost.  In the small satellite paradigm, the
emphasis is not in using the best technology, but in using the
most appropriate technology for a given mission application. 
In the area of attitude control, M. Scharfe from AMSAT-DL presented
development of a magnetic bearing momentum wheel that will be
flown later this year on the OSCAR Phase-IIID (P3D) satellite.
 Built entirely by volunteers, this 400-kg satellite will be placed
into GTO later this year as a secondary payload aboard an Ariane
launch vehicle.  From there, it will maneuver to a 16-hr Molniya
orbit to provide coverage for amateur radio users in the Northern
Hemisphere.  Reaction wheels for the much smaller, 50-kg TUBSAT-C
satellite developed at the Technical University of Berlin along
with IRE were also presented.  These wheels, coupled with ring
laser gyros (LITEF) and a star sensor (Kayser Threde) should give
TUBSAT-C an impressive 4 arcminute (3</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Symbol">s</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>)
pointing accuracy per axis.  Several presenters emphasized the
growing need for increased satellite autonomy to offset operations
costs.  One of the most critical enabling technologies for this
capability is clearly GPS.  Practically all new missions envision
using GPS for navigation as well as attitude determination if
possible.  Ongoing research into propulsion systems for small
satellites at the University of Surrey, UK, was presented by Maj
Jerry Sellers (recently assigned to EOARD).  This work was done
as part of his PhD research and focused on the use of hydrogen
peroxide hybrid rockets as a cost-effective alternative to solid
motors.  Other propulsion work being done at the University of
Surrey by Capt Tim Lawrence, currently completing a USAFA/AFIT-sponsored
PhD, relates to the use of water as a safe, low-cost propellant
in a water resistojet for small satellite station keeping.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There were only a few highlights from previous missions
presented.  Presenters from Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL),
UK, discussed the uses for remote sensing data collected using
50-kg microsatellites such as PoSAT.   Such small, flexible platforms
can provide on-demand capability with 100-m or greater resolution
for only a few million dollars, providing an attractive alternative
to larger, more expensive national assets such as SPOT or LANDSAT.
 On-orbit status of CERISE, another UoSAT-class satellite built
by SSTL and Alcatel, France, was also presented.  CERISE is being
used for world-wide frequency mapping by the French Ministry of
Defense.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Overall, this symposium proved to be a valuable forum
for the presentation of ongoing research into small satellite
engineering.  In this age of shrinking budgets, small satellites
are being looked at to take on ever more demanding missions at
much lower cost.  Gradually, the industry is undergoing a paradigm
shift that allows for a greater number of small missions to ultimately
lower both costs and risks while retaining valuable space assets.</FONT>

 This workshop was the European portion of a two-part, international,
multidisciplinary workshop.  The American portion will be held
in Aug at Hanscom AFB MA.  The conference was very successful
with 51 participants representing 8 countries, 5 technical sessions
with 20 papers presented, 3 invited speakers (Mr Blaise Durante
of  SAF/AQX, Col Ron Adams of ESC,  and M. Giard of CESR-CNRS,
France), 3 panel sessions,  and  8 poster / demonstration displays.
 The site was the National Institute for Applied Sciences (INSAT)
in Toulouse.  This institute has 40 acres of property with 1,974
students, 200 teachers/researchers, and 230 administrators and
technicians.  Programs are offered in biochemistry, civil engineering,
electrical engineering with emphasis in mathematics or computer
science, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, physics,
and mathematics.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The sessions focused on the design and test of hardware
and software systems, dependability and design methods, spatial
applications, use of multimedia and decentralized means in education,
industry research and cooperation, and collaborative engineering.
 With strong international representation from industry, government,
and academia, this workshop truly sets the standard for conducting
research in the new 90's environment. This is evidenced in the
workshop's future plans to have a live virtual feed to students
at the University of Cantabria in Spain from the conference location
at Lockheed Martin in Georgia in the summer of 1997.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>EOARD promotes technical interchange by supporting
and co-sponsoring (with other governmental agencies) technical
workshops and mini-symposia at overseas conferences.  We often
receive free proceedings and attendance for one or more Air Force
representatives.  Air Force R&amp;D personnel attending or considering
to attend European conferences should contact EOARD for information
and to determine whether free registration is available.  We have
also listed conferences being supported by our sister-service
London offices, ERO and ONREUR.  <B>Bi-service and tri-service
support efforts are in bold print.  </B>We also announce lecture
series given by the Von Karman Institute (VKI) or AGARD (the aerospace
research arm of NATO), however, these lecture series are normally
not sponsored by EOARD, and free registrations will not be available.

<U><FONT SIZE=2>VKI Offers the following Lecture Series during
the 1996-1997 academic year.  Lectures will be given by active
specialists drawn from universities, research establishments and
industries in Europe and North America.  A detailed outline and
application form will be prepared approximately four months in
advance of each Lecture Series and will be sent to all those on
the Institute's mailing list who have expressed an interest in
relevant subject areas and also to those who request information.
 The fee is approximately 28,500 Belgian Francs, and participation
is normally restricted to NATO nationals.  For additional information

<FONT SIZE=2>Perhaps the most effective means EOARD has to initiate
and promote technical liaison between Air Force and European scientists
is the Window on Science (WOS) program.  Through this program
we can arrange and fund the visits of European scientists to selected
Air Force facilities.  To nominate a WOS candidate contact your
laboratory Chief Scientist and/or your EOARD Laboratory representative.
 Below is a list of some WOS visits planned for the upcoming months.
 For further details regarding a visitor read the expanded details
in the Laboratory representative section of the <I>EUROGRAM</I>
or contact the LO, the point of contact at the visit site, or
the EOARD Chief of International Programs. <B>Bi-service and tri-service

<FONT SIZE=2>1996 continues to be a year with significant personnel changes.  Even before having replacements on board from the departures of Dr Osama El-Bayoumi (RLC) and Ms Janet Johnston (PLG), five additional people are preparing for the end of their EOARD tours.  MSgt Harold Kaid has served as EOARD's Chief of Executive Services and Support since January 1989.  Now, as a SMSgt selectee, he is preparing for a one year tour to Korea.  His replacement, TSgt Marzett McCall, has arrived from Maxwell AFB, AL.  Maj Pat Bradshaw arrived to EOARD and is now preparing to teach biology at the Air Force Academy. His replacement, Maj Mark Smith, will be arriving from Tyndall AFB, FL.  Our Chief Scientist, Lt Col Don Erbschloe, will be returning to the Air Force Academy after a three year tour, to be replaced by Lt Col Don McGillen. Maj Dan Stech, who has</FONT>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD WIDTH=645><FONT SIZE=2>Belarus, formally the Belrussian SSR., is bounded to the north by Latvia and Lithuania, to the South by Ukraine, to the East by Poland, and to the West by Russia.  It has a population of 10.3 million people, and is approximately one third the size of France.  Although the political history of Belarus dates back 1000 years, the only time during its history that it has been independent has been during the past five years.  Belarus has had a difficult time economically since gaining its independence. As a consequence, it has recently agreed to an economic union with Russia which may allow people to travel freely between the two countries, and may replace the weak Belarus rouble with the slightly more stable Russian rouble.  Compounding the difficulties that many of the FSU republics have faced in transitioning to market economies and establishing a national identity, Belarus was hard hit by the Chernobyl disaster.  Radioactive  fallout  contaminated  23%  of  the  Republic's  territory to  include  30% of  their </FONT>

budget as a consequence.  Despite these difficulties, however,
the scientists we spoke with were optimistic that the worst was
behind and that their fortunes were starting to rise.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Like other FSU republics, Belarus has a strong background
in scientific research. It was the leading contributor for the
entire Soviet Union in several areas of mathematics, optics, physiology,
automation, and geochemistry.  Although most institutes have reduced
research staffs by approximately fifty percent since 1990, there
are still 50,000 researchers at 300 different institutes, universities,
and other technical organizations.  Only one year ago, government
support for research had dropped to one percent of the national
budget.  This year, however, it has been restored to its 1990
level of three percent.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>This April, representatives from EOARD had the opportunity
to travel to Minsk and visit the institutes described below. 
The scientists we met are aggressively pursuing international
contacts and contracts.  If you see anything described which has
the potential of enhancing your research programs, please let
us know.  We will be happy to provide you with any additional
information that we have, and to offer our help in developing

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site Visits to the Academy of Science of Belarus
(ASB):</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>  The ASB employs more than 12,000
people at approximately 50 research institutes and other research
centers, and is divided into 6 departments:  physics, mathematics
and informatics; physical-engineering of machine building and
energetics; chemical and geological sciences; biological sciences;
medical problems; and humanitarian sciences.</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>B.I. Stepanov Institute of Physics, ABS:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
 This institute employs approximately 300 people and has 20 different
laboratories.  Its three primary areas of interest are theoretical
physics, physical optics, and laser physics.  It claims to be
the pioneer of laser phase conjugation in the 1970's, and to have
simultaneously invented dye lasers with the US and Germany.  In
the <B>Laboratory of Non-Equilibrium Media Optics</B>, recent
achievements include unique methods for gas jet radiation plume
detection, far-field jet diagnostics by low resolution spectroscopy,
and dispersion in atmospheric boundary layers; in particular,
the dispersion of radioactive fallout from Chernobyl.  Currently,
the primary objective of the laboratory is to provide a physical
basis to methods of calculating radiation for rocket jets at various
altitudes, including the 50 to 120 km regime, and for rocket trails.
 They claim that their gas dynamic model of rocket trails is unique.
 They have developed methods of calculation of hot molecular gas
radiation useful for viewing sources through the atmosphere. 
In the <B>Laboratory of Remote Spectroscopical Sensing</B>, various
spectrometers have been developed for detection from spaceship
and aircraft towards earth, and past achievements include the
development of a spectrometer that was used aboard the MIR Space
Station.  Since Belarus has no space program of it own, most research
in this lab was shut down for two years after the collapse of
the USSR.  Now this lab is back again working with Russia and
its research includes spectral polarimetry, video spectrometry,
and simultaneous spectrum and image compensation for airplane
movement. In the<B> Laboratory of Non-Linear Optics </B>research
is following two main avenues.  The first project is concerned
with the influence of quantum fluctuations on stimulated Raman
scattering and the operation of optical parametric oscillators.
The second major area of research is the study of transient nonlinear
processes in organic compounds using nondegenerate coherent Raman
spectroscopy and transient cross-correlation spectroscopy with
time resolution of around 1 fs.  One of the interesting features
of this laboratory is the broadly tunable (200-8000 nm) SRS source.
 The<B> Laboratory of Gas Laser Physics </B>is concerned with
studies of gas discharges in active media, new gas lasers with
novel resonator design and new applications.  This laboratory
seems to have suffered greatly from the reduction in scientific
funding.  Their current work is almost exclusively devoted to
CO<SUB>2</SUB> lasers.  They have been studying the stability
and behavior of a CO<SUB>2</SUB> laser with an intra-cavity saturable
absorber.  Before the collapse, they had developed a cross polarized,
two-frequency laser gyroscope and a series of compact CO<SUB>2</SUB>
lasers. The<B> Laboratory of Molecular Kinetics </B>was previously
concerned with CO<SUB>2</SUB> lasers.  Their current efforts are
directed towards developing interferometers for aerodynamic measurements.
 They have developed a heterodyne interferometer based on a HeNe
laser operating with two orthogonal polarizations at different
frequencies.  When operated with orthogonal circular polarizations
the lines are separated by 2 MHz while with orthogonal linear
polarizations the line separation is 0.25-100 MHz.   The <B> Laboratory
for Laser Systems and Devices </B>was previously heavily concerned
with military applications such as the development of  a high-power
Nd:Garnet laser for welding.  Current research is almost exclusively
aimed at the interaction of laser radiation with biological systems.
 They are particularly interested in the reorientation of molecules
in cells under low level laser irradiation. The<B> Laboratory
of Laser Dyes </B>is concerned with the development and use of
dye lasers.  At present, the major effort is in the development
of distributed-feedback dye lasers.  The feedback in these lasers
is provided by a holographic grating on the dye cell window. </FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site Visits at the Belarussian State University
(BSU):  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>BSU is one of three traditional
universities in Belarus with technical curriculae.  There are
12 faculties which each have several departments and laboratories,
and there are three institutes within the university that are
engaged in fundamental and applied research.  There are 15,000-18,000
students, and it is claimed that the university was considered
one of the top 25 in the entire Soviet Union.  The university
also maintains strong ties with the Academy of Science, industry,
and the Belarussian State Polytechnic Academy, which is the largest
university in Belarus with 10 faculties and 30,000 students.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>The Faculty of Physics, BSU:</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
 This faculty is divided into 12 departments and 15 research laboratories,
and has approximately 700 students and 150 researchers.  A recent
achievement in the <B>Laboratory of Physics of Electronic Materials</B>
is the development of a new nonlithographic micro-fabrication
method of low dimensional submicron regular permanent networks
with nanoscaled bonds.  In the <B>Laboratory of Molecular Photonics</B>,
research includes the development of high density optical memory
in the frequency domain at liquid nitrogen temperatures, and broadly
tunable lasers based on stimulated Raman scattering in non-linear
crystals.  In the <B>Laboratory of Physics of Biosensors</B> research
is oriented towards the study of the temperature dependence of
electron and ion transfer in organic synthetic films and development
of intelligent materials including sensors for molecule recognition.
 There is also a project that uses Langmuir-Blodgett films for
modeling neural activity.</FONT>

the investigation of complex physical phenomena in the field of
radiative gas dynamics and dynamics of solid bodies.  Results
of several studies from this code are available on disk on request,
and include cratering and shock wave interactions due to explosions
or high velocity impact, plasma dynamics due to laser radiation
interaction with solid materials, and disintegration of asteroids
entering the atmosphere.  <B>The Department of Semiconductors
</B>has produced a semiconductor photo-memory capability for applications
in computer hard drives.  Current operation is at 20 degrees Kelvin,
but they are looking for an acceptable approach for operation
at room temperature.  In the <B>Department of Microelectronics
</B>they<B> </B>have developed an alternative approach to Monte-Carlo
techniques which has compared favorably to experimental results.

<CENTER><I><B><FONT SIZE=5>Tri-Service International S&amp;T Information
Technology Workshop</FONT></B></I><B><FONT SIZE=2>  </FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A tri-service workshop on information technology
was held at the Edison House in April.  The objective of this
two-day workshop was to examine, from an international S&amp;T
tri-service perspective, what information our customers want,
where the information originates, and how the information gets
from the originator to the customer.  Attendees included representatives
from </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>EOARD, ONREUR, ARO, AFMC/ST,
AOARD, ONR, AFOSR, and DTIC.  The meeting focused on &quot;three
tenants&quot; of an international program: strategy,  knowledge-base,
and implementation.  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>The conclusions of the workshop for
the first tenant was to focus on defining an overall country-by-country
and technology area strategy.  The burden of this responsibility
does not reside with the Edison House offices, but with the international
organization in the three Services in the respective headquarters
along with DDR&amp;E.  The group recommended adding these as an
appendix to the Technology Area Plans (TAPs).  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=#000000> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>The
second tenant refers to the actual database of all international
S&amp;T knowledge.  Currently, there are numerous databases, and
many of them are difficult to access.  The workshop recommended
that we build a distributed database centered on the WWW, and
that this database be an integral part of the day-to-day operations
of our organizations.  Hence, we do not need to build a new database,
but consolidate the information that we currently have and make
this available to customers via the WWW.   </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>As
a first step to demo this idea, the workshop recommended that
the Edison House consolidate the three Services conference support
database, which is used internally for tracking and approving
conferences, and making this database available on the WWW.  
 </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The third tenant of an international program is implementation,
and the workshop concluded that the programs in all three Services
were excellent.  These include the visiting science programs,
conference support programs, and small contracts programs. The
tri-service corporation is very good.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Other recommendations include the following: improving
the compatibility of all international computer LAN/WAN's, especially
the London and Tokyo offices, reactivating the JDL international
subpanel, which provides tri-service coordination at the headquarters
level, finding acceptable password and encryption systems to use
for distributed databases, clarifying the requirements for WWW
publishing, to include intellectual property rights, and requesting
that DTIC develop an international DoD homepage.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>There was overall agreement that to serve our customers
better, in an environment of scarce international resources, all
international offices must work closer together and we must exploit
the Internet fully to communicate our knowledge with that customer
base.</FONT>

 Dr Goncharov is the head of the Department of Medical Aid Under
Extreme Conditions.  They conduct research projects using subjects
exposed to 32 degree water for 1 hour (+).  They have been looking
at protective equipment and have found a fairly safe and reliable
method to rewarm someone exposed to freezing conditions. Their
equipment is not any better than ours at protecting subjects exposed
to cold water.  They also had a 220 cubic meter hypo/hyperbaric
chamber they use for training space station cosmonauts.  They
also use the hypobaric chamber for treating asthma.  They say
75% of the patients they treat do not have any recurring asthma
attacks for many years. Another area of research was protective
equipment for high G exposure and clothing to be used for increasing
performance in athletic events. The high G equipment is something
they would like to market and test.  They have to compete with
the Zvezda design bureau for trying to get into the G equipment
arena.  They have some very interesting and unique material they
are using for increasing subjects performance in many types of
environments.  They have a lower body garment they use on board
their shuttle missions which allows their pilots to tolerate reentry
problems without any adverse effects.  They also use the same
type of material for athletes to increase their ability to do
work more efficiently.  The garments are well worth investigating
from a G protection point of view as well as for increasing efficiency
during manual work and or athletic performance. </FONT>

 Contact:  Dr Bo Janzon.  Although Sweden has reduced defense
spending in the last few years, as a militarily non-aligned country
(with the European Union) it must still cover all areas of defense
except nuclear weapons.  They recently selected several areas
in which to establish international competencies.  Energetic Materials
is one of these areas.  This work is done at Grindsjon.    In
the propulsion laboratory they work with ramjets and ordinary
rocket motors and have recently begun research with a pulse detonation
engine. If proved feasible, these engines offer considerable advances
in efficiency, cost, specific impulse and variable velocity. 
Their goal is to develop an engine with specific impulse of 30,000
m/sec operating with hydrogen and air.  In the Terminal Ballistics
Laboratory they are using a light gas gun for research in penetration
mechanics and dynamic processes in materials and structures. 
Their gun can accelerate 300 grams at 2 km/sec or 5 grams at 8
km/sec.  This research is aimed at threat evaluation and weapons
assessment.  Work is underway in the Electro-thermal Chemical
Gun Facility to develop more efficient guns that get no more than
5% of their power from electrical sources.  The goal is to produce
a 40mm gun that can serve as an anti-aircraft or battle tank system.
 Laser Laboratory scientists are studying laser synthesis using
a degenerate four-wave mixing (DFWM) technique.  They are also
looking at techniques for laser ignition of propellants.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Joint Meeting of the Portuguese, British, Spanish
and Swedish Sections of the Combustion Institute, Funchal, Madeira.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
 This conference featured 102 papers from 16 countries, with over
half being from the UK.  The host and primary organizer for the
conference was the Instituto Superior Tecnico, from Lisbon, Portugal.
 Combustion and laser diagnostic research has undergone considerable
development at this institute over the past several years thanks
to EC monetary support and concerted academic support from the
UK.  Consequently, this institute has been hosting international
conferences on a regular basis which attract the leading European
researchers in these fields.  Notable work included A. Hayhrst,
UK, on mass spectrometer flame measurement error, K. Young, UK,
on the development of a novel pyrometer, G. Abu-Orf, UK, with
a new correlation for laminar flame speed in methane-air mixture
for use in developing a library of existing experimental data,
D. Spalding, UK, on a novel CFD concept using &quot;multi-fluid
models&quot;, J. Whitelaw, UK, on two new concepts for reducing
NOx emission, and M. Versluis, Sweden, who has made quantitative,
two-dimensional LIF water vapor measurements upstream of combustion.
 This conference also featured a unique presentation format. 
Oral presentations were limited to 10 minutes, so that parallel
sessions were not necessary, and each paper was also presented
as a poster and published as a proceedings.  This format was well
received and is likely to be employed in the future.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>9<B><SUP>th</SUP> European Aerospace Congress:
 &quot;Visions and Limits of Long-Term Aerospace Developments&quot;,
Berlin, Germany.  </B></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>This congress was
sponsored by the German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics.
 It included 20 papers from 7 Western European countries which
were primarily high level overview papers by upper management
on the European perspective of the state-of-the-art, requirements
for future development, and prospects for success relating to
civil aviation.  Western Europe is working towards becoming a
single aerospace entity which it hopes will maintain a share of
the global market in competition with the US.  Current challenges
include creating a single European air traffic control system
from the current 49 systems which use 30 different software programming
languages, and doubling the air traffic capacity over the next
10 to 12 years to handle the anticipated demand.  Related papers
addressing these issues included U. Schumann, Germany, on environmental
aspects of air transport, J. Roeder, France, on design aspects
of very large aircraft, and J. Huber, France, on new aircraft
design.  With regard to the next generation SST, France, Germany,
and the UK are currently involved in the European Supersonic Research
Program (ESRP).  It sees a replacement for the Concorde as having
a range greater than 10,000 miles (compared to 6500 currently),
a capacity of 250 people (compared to 100), and a kg-fuel/seat-km
factor of 0.06 (compared to 0.1). Current funding for the ESRP
is approximately 1/10 of the 1.5 billion dollar U.S. counterpart
program HSRP II.  However, the Europeans are confident that the
first phase of the ESRP will produce significant technical results
that will eventually lead to a single US-European program to produce
the actual aircraft.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visit to the International Aerospace Exhibition
(ILA'96), Berlin, Germany.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>  This week
long exhibition featured 600 exhibitors, 6 hours of flights per
day, and several aerospace related conferences and seminars. 
It had a strong civilian and military presence, and featured the
first ever flight demonstration of the next generation European
fighter aircraft EURO2000.  By holding this event in centrally
located Berlin, it attracted a tremendous number of Central and
Eastern European companies, and emphasized the continuing development
of East-West cooperation.  This included an East/West Aerospace
Center to aid in information exchange, contract brokering, and
supplying a database of prospective brokers.  In addition, the
Center ran an extensive workshop program on issues such as financing,
global aviation requirements, and international safety standards.
 Successful cooperative ventures included a display of a Russian
TU-154M aircraft which was modified in cooperation with the Tupelov
Design Bureau and is now in use by the German Air Force for observation
missions.  Also on display was a small transport aircraft produced
by the Russian Beriev Design Bureau which uses engines designed
by Pratt and Whitney.  Cooperative research for future aircraft
included a display of a Russian-German venture to develop a hydrogen
fueled plane, with a first test flight planned by the end of 1997.</FONT>

founded in 1918 and quickly grew to become Russia's premier aerospace
research and testing center in the areas of aerodynamics, structures,
and flight control.  The institute has approximately 55 operational
wind tunnels covering all flight regimes, 25 structural testing
facilities and laboratories, and 5 flight simulators.  Although
Zhukovsky was closed to foreigners during the Soviet era, they
now operate as an international organization.  During the past
few years several scientists from TsAGI have participated in the
Window-on-Science program, and they in turn have received several
visitors from the labs.  Economic conditions have caused a reduction
in personnel from approximately 11,000 in 1990 to 5000 now, but
the remaining work force is highly talented and has attracted
several contracts in the past few years from the USAF, Army, Navy,
and NASA.  Current efforts for the Air Force include the areas
of hypersonic aerodynamics and combustion.</FONT>

mandate to develop missile and rocket technology.  Ten years later,
the section of the organization responsible for ballistic missile
development split off to become Energia.  Since then, TsNIIMash
has been the Russian focal point for scientific support of space
vehicle and launch vehicle systems.  Currently, the institute
employees approximately 6500 people and is working in cooperation
with TsAGI and the Central Institute of Aviation Motors (CIAM)
to create a Russian national hypersonics program to replace the
now defunct Buran Space Shuttle project.  TsNIIMash is also the
home of the Mir Space Station Mission Control Center, and they
are working cooperatively with NASA on the Russian contribution
to the International Space Station program.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Aerospace Technology Transfer:  Past Record and
Current Potential, London, UK.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>This one
day workshop was sponsored by the UK Department of Trade and Industry
to review successful examples of technology transfer in the UK
and to explore the potential of additional applications.  It is
notable that the UK has the second largest international aerospace
industry in the world, following the US, and controls 9% of the
global market.  It has an output of approximately 1.6 billion
dollars a month, of which 70% is exported.  At the same time,
however, technology transfer must be recognized and exploited
to quantify the overall value of aerospace research.  In the UK,
there has been a 42% reduction in aerospace R&amp;D employment
in the past five years, and only 25% of the 1300 aerospace engineering
graduates in the UK can find jobs in the aerospace industry. 
Presentations included recent UK studies on identifying and documenting
successful examples of transfer, which included specialized glass
coatings, structural bonding adhesives, analytical methods such
as finite element analysis, e-beam welding, composite rotors,
and industrial gas turbines.  Many specific examples of transfer
are clearly evident in North Sea oil rigs and the automotive industry.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>The Sixth International Conference on Composite
Interfaces,   Zichron Yaacov, Israel.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>This
conference brought together composites researchers from all over
the world.  The following topic areas were addressed: molecular
interactions at interfaces, structural characterization, theoretical
aspects of the interfaces/interphases, theory and applications
of interfacial adhesion, surface characterization techniques,
surface treatments and modifications. There were 155 attendees
at the conference, approximately 80% of the presentations were
classified as polymer composite papers, 20% MMC and CMC papers.
It was clear from the conference presentations that much emphasis
is being placed on test techniques for measuring interface characteristics.
However, there seemed to be some doubt as to whether this interface
testing was providing useful results for designing improved interfaces.
Other areas of interest included the effects of frictional bonding,
high temperature effects and unwanted chemical bonding from chemical
interactions. Abstracts of the conference presentations are available

 SibNIA performs fundamental and applied research and testing
of aeronautical structures. The Institute was formed in 1941 after
it became apparent that aeronautical research institutes in the
Moscow area were vulnerable to damage from the war. After the
war, the Institute continued to operate, as it had become the
country's leading institute for ground effect aerodynamics research
and structural research and testing of landing gear. SibNIA has
also developed unique test facilities for full scale testing of
aerospace structures under hypersonic thermal and loading conditions
and space to atmosphere reentry. Their &quot;running wave&quot;
acoustic test facility can generate acoustic loads equivalent
to 172 dB. Other areas of research at SibNIA include aircraft
strength and service life evaluation, in-flight study of aircraft

 The group suffered a major setback when the Ariane 5 rocket was
destroyed shortly after liftoff recently.  On board were four
Cluster satellites which were programmed for a two-and-a-half
year study of the earth's magnetosphere.  The University of Oslo
was a principle partner in this project.  Prof Egeland is organizing
a NATO Advanced Study Institute to be held at Longyearbyen, on
Svalbard Island (Spitsbergen) sometime next year.  The subject
of the institute will be &quot;Boundary Layer Processes at Cusp
and Polar Cap Latitudes&quot;, with an emphasis, ultimately, on
effects at ground level.</FONT></U>

<U><B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visit to the University of Uppsala, Sweden.
 </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contact:  Prof Kai Siegbahn.  This was
a follow-up visit to one I made in May 1994.  Prof Siegbahn, a
Nobel laureate in Physics, is under contract with the Air Force
developing new methods and equipment for materials testing using
high resolution electron spectroscopy. Traditionally, electron
spectroscopy involves targeting a sample with electromagnetic
radiation or an electron beam and reading the energy spectrum
of the emitted (Auger) electrons.  The result is a characteristic
spectrum that reveals not just the composition of the material,
but identifies the chemistry as well (for example, oxidation of
a pure metal creates a &quot;chemical shift&quot; of the spectrum
that is straightforward to measure).  Prof Siegbahn's goals are
to improve, simplify, and extend the range of analytic tools.
 For example he wants to combine electron spectroscopy with laser
spectroscopy and he uses a small (10 cm diameter) rotating anode
to produce soft x-rays that otherwise would have required a large,
expensive synchrotron.  Prof Siegbahn might visit WL/ML sometime
this fall to discuss his progress.</FONT></U>
<P>
<U><B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visit to Ioffe Institute, St Petersburg,
Russia.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contacts:  Academician Yuri Denisyuk,
Dr Irina Semenova.  Prof Denisyuk is one of the grand masters
of optics.  He is the father of modern holography and now runs
the laboratory doing that work at Ioffe.  The Institute has numerous
projects involving holographic techniques and elements. A display
using holographic optical elements to multiply images produces
the impression of 3-D viewing from 2-D objects, with applications
to computer displays and training devices.  A non-spatial filter
for laser beam cleanup uses Bragg selectivity of thick holograms-eliminating
the hassle of alignment and special optics.  The Ioffe Institute
also tests optical elements and materials produced at the Vavilov
Institute.  (For more information on the Vavilov Institute, see
the write-up in Dr Jack McIver's column.)  For example, a polarized
glass uses porosity to build-up holograms with holographic recording
possible up to 500&#176; C. A photothermoplastic film for photographic
purposes has better resolution than silver halide (&gt; 400 lines/mm)
and can be developed in seconds.  This has application for imaging
from space.  Academician Denisyuk has been requested for a WOS
visit by the Armstrong Laboratory.  He should also visit the Rome
and Phillips Labs and, possibly, AFIT and the Air Force Academy.</FONT></U>

<U><B><FONT SIZE=2>WOS Visit: Dr Joseph Panossian (State University
of Armenia) to discuss atmospheric optics at PL.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>
Dr Panossian conducts quantum physics research in Yerevan.  He
will discuss his work on &quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>Quantum
size, two-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional surface excitons
and two-dimensional states' complicated structure account of the
valence band&quot; at PL and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial Narrow">Perhaps the most effective means
EOARD has to initiate and promote technical liaison between Air
Force and European scientists is the Window on Science (WOS) program.
 Through this program we can arrange and fund the visits of European
scientists to selected Air Force facilities.  To nominate a WOS
candidate contact your laboratory Chief Scientist and/or your
EOARD Laboratory representative.  Below is a list of some WOS
visits planned for the upcoming months.  For further details regarding
a visitor read the expanded details in the Laboratory representative
section of the <I>EUROGRAM</I> or contact the LO, the point of
contact at the visit site, or the EOARD Chief of International
Programs. <B>Bi-service and tri-service coordinated visits are
in bold print.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The <I>EUROGRAM</I> is published bimonthly by the
US Air Force European Office of Aerospace Research and Development
(EOARD), Detachment 1 of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research
(AFOSR).  It contains reports on European research, a complete
list of current EOARD points of contact, and a summary of recent
work in our primary programs  The purpose of the <I>EUROGRAM</I>
is twofold: first, to alert the Air Force technical community
to research developments in Europe from which a technical dialogue
may begin, and second, to provide an executive summary for Air
Force management of work discovered by EOARD.<BR>

<TABLE>

<TR><TD WIDTH=647><FONT SIZE=2>The Edison House has just acquired a PictureTel Video TeleConferencing System (VTC), which now enables us to host one-on-one discussions between two people or multipoint conferences of many small groups located world-wide.  EOARD, AOARD, AFOSR, AFMC/ST, and the main AF labs all have VTC set-ups.  This article will provide some background information on VTC's, discuss how to set up a conference, and provide a handy table of contacts and VTC phone numbers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Background: </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>These systems provide both video and audio of the party(s) that you are calling.  Each side is equipped with either a VTC system that is located in a conference room or a desktop system that is connected to a PC.  The systems normally contain one or two monitors, video camera(s), speakers, microphone and switching equipment.  During the conference, a camera is pointed at you and this image is shown on the far end's monitor (the </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>far end is the party at the other end of the line).
 Likewise, the far end has a camera which allows you to see them.
 Additionally, a second monitor can be used to view other items
coming from the far end, such as a camera that is focused on their
white board, document projector that permits you to see any of
their documents, 35 mm slide projector to view any slides they
may have, or a computer interface which allows you to see whatever
is on the monitor of a computer on their end, such as a PowerPoint
briefing.  The Edison House system contains all these features.
 Although the concept of a VTC has been around for over 30 years,
large scale implementation has not been economically feasible
until the recent expansion of the telephone infrastructure.  The
systems have been growing dramatically.  Picture Tel, which owns
about 50% of this market, has over 50,000 conference systems world-wide
along with over 80,000 desktop units.  The DoD has thousands of
these systems and one can obtain a desktop unit from most manufacturers
for around $5K plus connection charges.<BR>
</FONT>
<TABLE BORDER=1>

<TR><TD WIDTH=482><FONT SIZE=2>The world-wide format for almost all VTC equipment is the H320, hence most VTC's can communicate with each other regardless of manufacturer.  The communications between systems is generally via ISDN lines, which are the new high bandwidth phone/data lines that are becoming more prevalent throughout the world.  The exception to this is the DoD network called FTS2000, which allows for very cheap line charges because the entire network is contracted to a single vendor.  Although this may save money, it has complicated the connection between VTC's on the FTS2000 system and VTC's on commercial ISDN.  Fortunately, bridges are available that permit connection.  Although EOARD and AOARD are DoD systems, we are not located within CONUS and cannot get access to FTS2000-hence a bridge is needed to conference with us.</FONT>

VTC system has access to a commercial ISDN line, we need to agree
on a time for the conference, and then one of us calls the other.
 It's remarkable simple.  The system performs all synchronization
and handshaking.  If your VTC is on the FTS2000 system, we again
agree on a time for the conference, and then call the WPAFB VTC
Help Desk (see number below) before the scheduled time.  They

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The National Science Foundation Europe Office, located
in the American Embassy in Paris, extends the reach of the National
Science Foundation (NSF) into Western, Central, and Eastern Europe-a
vast area of critical importance to American interests.  Because
the NSF deals with a large array of sciences and engineering,
its European Office likewise has broad responsibilities.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Established over a decade ago, the National Science
Foundation Europe Office has essentially three important roles.
 It acts as the representative of the principal US government
agency dealing with basic research and science education.  In
this capacity, the Office deals with the corresponding agencies
in Europe, many of which have formal or informal agreements with
NSF.  Another important role is to keep tabs, from close up, on
important developments in Europe that can impact American science
and engineering and its administration; one of the outcomes of
this activity is the production of periodic reports dealing with
some aspect of European science.  (For copies of the reports currently
available, please contact the National Science Foundation Europe
Office at the address given below.)  Finally, and perhaps most
importantly, the Office seeks to find centers of excellence in
Europe so as to establish new links between them and appropriate
American laboratories supported by the NSF.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In recent years, the National Science Foundation
Europe Office has put special emphasis on dealing with, and reporting
on, developments in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe,
which are undergoing rapid change since the Iron Curtain was torn
down.  These countries have many talented scientists who had previously
been cut off from their American counterparts, and science policy
in Central and Eastern Europe is in a state of brisk evolution.
 The previous issue of the <I>EUROGRAM </I>gave a list of the
recent reports issued by this Office, several of which deal with
this area; since then a new report on science in Kyrgyzstan has
also appeared.  A visit to the Baltic countries will be carried
out by the head of the NSF Europe Office before the summer of
1996.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Among the activities of the NSF Europe Office currently
underway or planned are much greater emphasis than in the past
on the &quot;matchmaking&quot; of American NSF-supported university
research centers with leading European centers; reporting on the
programs of the European Commission so as to acquaint Americans
better with their potential for cooperation; and visits to selected
countries that had not received man NSF visitors in recent years.
 Cooperation with the DoD science agencies in Europe will also
be a priority.  The first joint site visit and subsequent report
with the Office of Naval Research, Europe (ONREUR) took place
in February 1996.<BR>

<CENTER><I><B><FONT SIZE=6>A Brief History of EOARD<BR>
</FONT></B></I></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>EOARD has had a rich and varied history.  The idea
for the organization was first proposed by Theodore Von Karman,
General H.H. (&quot;Hap&quot;) Arnold's science advisor, who urged
the Air Force to utilize European scientific and engineering advances
in order to augment its military capabilities.  The new Air Research
and Development Command (ARDC) implemented this idea in August
1952 by establishing a West European Office.  Brussels was chosen
as the site of the new office because it was centrally located
for NATO countries.  The main function of the West European Office
was to administer European contract programs of the ARDC research
centers. It also supported conferences, and its staff members
made numerous technical visits to Western European organizations.
 By the end of the 1950s the office was starting to reach out
beyond Europe, sponsoring its first contracts in Africa and then
India.<BR>
</FONT>
<TABLE BORDER=1>

<TR><TD WIDTH=564><FONT SIZE=2>Most of  the 1960s was a very flourishing period for military research. In 1960 the office was renamed the European Office of Aerospace Research (EOAR), and it was transferred under a new  headquarters dedicated to managing Air Force research, the Office of Aerospace Research (OAR).  Although concern was voiced that EOAR contributed to an adverse balance of  payments situation, the organization expanded.  It sustained a staff of about 60 and a portfolio of contracts and grants amounting to about $3 million annually during this period. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Towards the end of the 1960s some major changes that heralded future trends were set in motion.  As a result of Congressional pressure to increase tri-service coordination in the research area, the EOAR office was relocated from Brussels to London in 1970.  Both EOAR and the Army's Research, Development and Standardization Group (USARDSG) joined the London office of the Navy's Office of Naval Research, which had been established in London in 1946.  Since 1974, the three groups have been in residence at Edison House.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Air Force's growing concern with linking basic research to technology and system development was reflected in several changes in the early 1970s.  First of  all,  EOAR's headquarters OAR was abolished in 1970, and all its research organizations came under the Force Systems Command (AFSC).  Secondly, in 1973 &quot;development&quot; was added to EOAR's mission (and a corresponding &quot;D&quot;  to its name).   In a related move for administrative efficiency, the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR) was named the single manager of all the Air Force's basic research programs.  As of 1973 EOARD became AFOSR's Detachment 1, thus arriving at its current organizational configuration.  In 1992 </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2>Since the fall of the Soviet Union, EOARD has moved
into new arenas.  It was active early in working to open communications
with scientific organizations in the former Soviet Union  (FSU)
and in central and Eastern Europe (C/E Europe).  Site visits,
conference support, increased use of the &quot;Windows-on-Science&quot;
Program,  and new DoD &quot;seed money&quot; for contracts all
served to initiate technical exchanges with these countries. The
organizations at Edison House set up an ongoing committee which
publishes the Tri-Service FSU &amp; C/E Europe Activities Newsletter.

 Contact: Dr Christian Lohwasser.  The Austrian military uses
efficient computer programs for personnel job selection.  The
system is set up to test and evaluate up to 36 subjects at a time.
 Perhaps the best demonstration of their process is the screening
of pilot training candidates.  They identify 3,000 out of 34,000
applicants each year for UPT.  Of these, 700 decide to submit
for further testing .   Additional screenings eliminate all but
120 and finally just 10-15 students who will actually start UPT.
Ninety nine percent of the students that have started UPT successfully
complete the program.  They also have a comprehensive human factors
approach to optimize flight safety.  They did not report their
aircraft accident statistics but they did wish to extend into
other areas of transportation.  </FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Batsheva Seminar on Coherent Control, 3-8 March,
Neve Ilan, Israel.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2> This workshop was attended
by 82 scientists of whom 37 presented talks.  There were also
18 posters.  The conference was devoted to recent developments
in the theoretical understanding and experimental implementation
of the use of quantum interference phenomena to control atomic
and molecular processes, i.e. coherent control.  The interferences
are created by using lasers to excite the system to a desired
final state along multiple paths.  By varying laser parameters
such as pulse shape, duration between pulses, and the relative
phase between pulses, the final state of the system can be controlled.
 This is particularly important for photodissociation of molecules
where there may be several paths with different products.  There
are three main approaches to coherent control that were discussed
at this conference.  They are the time dependent methods of Tannor,
Kosloff and Rice; the time-independent approach of Shapiro and
Brumer; and the optimal control approach advocated by Rabitz and
Wilson. Theoretical advances in all of these approaches were discussed
during the meeting.  Of particular interest were the papers devoted
to applications of coherent control to bimolecular reactions,
isotope separation, laser cooling of atoms and molecules, and
dynamics of semiconductors. A significant fraction of the papers
reported observation of coherent control in weak and strong field
domains and in both gas and solid phases.  An interesting new
development was the proposal by Bucksbaum and Mies to use half-cycle
pulses for coherent control.  The possibility of using coherent
control for isotope separation was discussed by Averbuch and the
experimental observation was reported by Stolow.  Of practical
importance was the work by Shnitman et al who showed that by using
strong laser fields it is possible to exercise control over product
ratios when neither the molecules nor the lasers are in ideal
states (molecules are hot and lasers have phase jitter).</FONT>

 </B></FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2 COLOR=#000000>This flagship conference
covered a vast number of topics, to include fourteen tutorials
and eight major workshops.  The majority of papers were from academics
with very few from actual system developers.  The group is also
grappling with the issue that most of the advances in software
engineering have been in tools, language, and component improvement,
not in methods and procedures improvement. Representatives from
Microsoft gave an excellent discussion of their software development
process.  Their Product Teams have the typical six functions of
a software group, but they concentrate on a &quot;team of peers&quot;,
where no one has absolute authority and all decisions are resolved
by mediation and negotiation.  The conference raised the question

by Prof K Morton, University of Warwick, on results from two novel
numerical methods, one using a gridless system of discrete vortex
boundary elements, and another using a vorticity-velocity formulation.
 Dr M Imregun, Imperial College, presented a recently developed
unstructured three-dimensional code (AU3D) which de-couples and
then recombines the aero/structural components of the domain at
each time step.  Prof Cross, University of Greenwich, presented

University of Oxford, addressed the stability and accuracy issues
of coupling aero and structural algorithms.  On the applications
side, Dr F. Henry, City University, is applying a coupled aero/structure
code to cardiovascular flows for insight on the development of
heart disease, and Dr H Goyder, AEA Technology, showed recent

Institute of Aerospace research is the largest aerospace research
institute in Romania. Since the demise of the communist government
in Romania, the Institute has decreased in size almost 50%. It
has attempted to offset this by incorporating smaller institutes.
The ultimate goal is to promote the institute to a position analogous
to NASA in the United States. Romania has a significant aircraft
production capability. They have researched, designed and built
two aircraft, IAR93 and IAR99. The first is a ground attack fighter,
while the former is a training aircraft. They have a license from
Aerospatiale to build helicopters in country. It is important
to note that Romanian industry has developed on Western (European)
standards. This is significant since this makes integration into
the West much easier. For example, all their wind tunnels are
built to western European standards. Current topics of research
in the materials, structures and control areas include:  aeroelasticity,
aeroservoelasticity, material failure prediction, robust flight
control design.</FONT>

problems, statistical physics and nuclear physics.  The impressive
key technology at this institution is the application of electrical
field effects in a broad range of processes. For example, scientists
at the Institute of Applied Physics have developed a unique electro-spark
plating process that allows metallic coatings for dissimilar metals.
The coatings can add significant wear or corrosion resistance
to inexpensive aluminum or steel. Their electro-chemical micro-arc
oxidation process provides a simple method to coat aluminum parts
with ceramic-like oxides. </FONT>

plant employees 250 people and is commercializing materials technologies
developed in the Academy. For example, the plant has developed
the Institute of Applied Physics electro-spark plating technique
for repair of machinery parts. The technique is particularly well
suited to repair of metal parts because it is a &quot;cold process&quot;
and therefore, unlike a &quot;hot treatment&quot; such as welding,
does not change the properties of the part.  In addition the parts
can easily be coated with a more wear and corrosion resistant
metal. Parts treated in this fashion will last longer than a new
part. </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial Narrow">Perhaps the most effective means
EOARD has to initiate and promote technical liaison between Air
Force and European scientists is the Window on Science (WOS) program.
 Through this program we can arrange and fund the visits of European
scientists to selected Air Force facilities.  To nominate a WOS
candidate contact your laboratory Chief Scientist and/or your
EOARD Laboratory representative.  Below is a list of some WOS
visits planned for the upcoming months.  For further details regarding
a visitor read the expanded details in the Laboratory representative
section of the <I>EUROGRAM</I> or contact the LO, the point of
contact at the visit site, or the EOARD Chief of International
Programs <B>Bi-service and tri-service coordinated visits are

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial Narrow">EOARD promotes technical interchange
by supporting and co-sponsoring (with other governmental agencies)
technical workshops and mini-symposia at overseas conferences.
 We often receive free proceedings and attendance for one or more
Air Force representatives.  Air Force R&amp;D personnel attending
or considering to attend European conferences should contact EOARD
for information and to determine whether free registration is
available.  We have also listed conferences being supported by
our sister-service London offices, ERO and ONREUR.  <B>Bi-service
and tri-service support efforts are in bold print.  </B>We also
announce lecture series given by the Von Karman Institute (VKI)
or AGARD (the aerospace research arm of NATO), however, these
lecture series are normally not sponsored by EOARD, and free registrations
will not be available.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>The <I>EUROGRAM</I> is published bimonthly by the
US Air Force European Office of Aerospace Research and Development
(EOARD), Detachment 1 of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research
(AFOSR).  It contains reports on European research, a complete
list of current EOARD points of contact, and a summary of recent
work in our primary programs  The purpose of the <I>EUROGRAM</I>
is twofold: first, to alert the Air Force technical community
to research developments in Europe from which a technical dialogue
may begin, and second, to provide an executive summary for Air
Force management of work discovered by EOARD.<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In late July, 1994, the Director, Defense Research and Engineering (DDR&amp;E) asked EOARD to help place $1M in scientific contracts in Russia.  Our philosophy was to use the money to &quot;sample&quot; new Russian science by funding many small projects instead of a few large, established projects.  The short suspense meant using proposals already in-house. EOARD staff organized the proposals and sent them to Directorate Chiefs at Air Force laboratories to be selected and prioritized.  Key to the success of the effort was the help of our AF laboratory points-of-contact and the Contracting Office at RAF Croughton.  The result was that in less than a month we were able to place 41 contracts with 32 different agencies in Russia, greatly expanding the scope US Air Force laboratories had on the capabilities of Russian science.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The majority of the projects are finished now.  We are in a position to reflect on how well the projects fared.  We asked the contacts in the AF labs who monitored to provide us feedback on the 32 projects that have been completed and evaluated.  These contacts answered the following questions:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>  How did the project benefit the Air Force? </FONT>

<I>Your computer might be at risk if you received any e-mail message from the Edison House with an attached Word file during the period from late Dec 95 through mid-Jan 96.</I>
<P>
In December the Edison House was the victim of the Concept virus.  Concept is a macro virus that is transmitted via attached Word documents or templates. The symptoms of having this virus include a difficulty saving Word documents (your computer tries to save them as templates), the occasional presence of a dialog box showing the number &quot;1&quot; when you open a document, or the appearance of new macros named &quot;AAAZAO&quot;, &quot;AAAZFS&quot;, and &quot;Payload&quot;.  
<P>
If you received any attached Word file from us during this period you should scan your computer with a virus checker that searches for macro viruses.  If you don't have such a program, we can provide a public domain virus scan program to you.

 &quot;Overall this is exceptional work and well worth the time and money that has gone into it so far. It is an excellent physical description of mechanically induced ablation.

&quot;The work was outstanding.  The effort included not only the principals, but some of the staff of each scientist and two institutes (Ioffe and Mechanical Engineering Institute) as well as major support from Vavilov State Optical Institute where the project was appealing because of its excellence&#133;This $25K program resulted in major advances in two subject areas and resulted in a joint production venture in one of them with an American firm.  These results are the goal of typical $0.5M to $1M programs in the US.

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;To duplicate the effort in the US would have cost between $1-$2M and the success of the experiment, without the Russian expertise, would have been doubtful.  The Russians have a significant lead over the US in the area of explosive pulsed power generation, with over 30 times the man-years in experience&#133;Follow-on was a Joint US-Russian experiment in Explosive Pulsed Power Technology.  The experiment successfully demonstrated the generation of a very large current pulse (47 mega-amps), necessary to produce a number of electromagnetic radiation effects.

<FONT SIZE=2>Not all responses were positive.  EOARD ranked one project unsatisfactory (the AF lab POC labeled it &quot;minimally satisfactory&quot;) because of the unresponsiveness of the PI.

It is important to reflect on this effort and ask &quot;Could
we do this again?&quot; or, as important, &quot;Would we want
to do this again?&quot; if funds become available from Nunn-Lugar
or some other source.  We've done some soul-searching at EOARD
and have determined we would:
<UL>
<LI>need a longer lead time-to accommodate our support organizations
and to give best priority ranking of projects
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>want to do this as a tri-service effort at Edison
House</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2>like to open funding up to other FSU and Eastern-European
countries, not just Russia</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2></FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For the future, EOARD will continue to track the
progress of the remaining projects and follow-on actions.  We
will help our laboratory customers capitalize on the collaborations
they have started.  This was a valuable exercise.  The political
future of Russia is uncertain, particularly with the upcoming
June elections.  However the links we have created are strong
and, we hope, will continue to grow and flourish.</FONT>

<TR><TD WIDTH=505>The Republic of Moldova, formerly the Moldovian  S.S.R., has a population of 4.4 million people and is bordered by Ukraine to the north, east, and south, and Romania to the west.  Unlike many of the Former Soviet Republics, the geographical presence of Moldova was only created this century, in 1924, and the country is experiencing its independence for the first time ever.  Unfortunately, the country is ethnically split, with the western portion allied with Romania, and the eastern region of Transdneistria allied as an enclave of Russia.  Civil war briefly erupted in 1992, and today there are Russian troops stationed in Transdneistria at the invitation of the people in this region to maintain the peace and protect their interests.

Moldova as an independent, undivided country is less certain.
 Another difficult issue to overcome is the common practice of
ethnic discrimination. Many Russian scientists who have lived
in Moldova for decades, if not all their lives, now feel that
they cannot be promoted since they are not native Moldavian (and
their children, although born in Moldova, are not Moldavian).
 Obviously returning to Russia after such a long absence would
be difficult.<BR>

<P>
Scientifically, Moldova was an integral part of the U.S.S.R. research
structure, with 10 universities and dozens of institutes doing
world class research in areas such as solid state physics, abstract
mathematics, and genetics.  Today, the structure and institutes
of Moldovian science are undergoing considerable re-organization
as the country defines and re-focuses its scientific expertise
towards Moldovian needs.

<B>Site Visit to the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Moldova:
  </B>This visit was hosted by Brigadier General Ion Nanii, Deputy
Minister of Defense, who is working with the US to produce a signed
agreement for military and technical cooperation.  Although the
Moldovian Army is only three years old, it is a highly educated
and equipped force.  Therefore, the Ministry of Defense is seriously
considering the possibility of creating scientific offices within
its Ministry, and is working to define the structure and mandate
of the potential organization.<BR>

<P>
<B>Site Visit to the Academy of Sciences of Moldova (ASM):  </B>This
visit was hosted by the President of the Academy, Academician
Andrei Andriesh.  The Academy of Sciences is the leading body
for research in Moldova, with 22 institutes, 3 scientific centers,
100 Academicians, and a total staff of more than 3000 people.
 Traditionally, the Academy had three sections:  Physics and Math,
Biology and Chemistry, and Humanities.  Since 1990 they have experienced
a &quot;brain drain&quot; of nearly 35%, but they have also acquired
several institutes from other Ministries and have added three
new sections:  Medical Sciences, Engineering Sciences, and Agricultural
Sciences.  Funding for the Academy is currently provided by the
State.  However, they are striving to transition towards attracting
international support.  Their current emphasis is solving immediate
national problems, such as energy, agricultural, medicines, ecological,
humanitarian (language, folk lore), and economics.  The world-class
expertise developed during the USSR era, which is rapidly dwindling
from lack of funds, is solid state physics, electrochemical processing
of materials, abstract mathematics, new compounds in chemistry,
and genetics/physiology.<BR>

<P>
<B>Site Visit to the Institute of Applied Physics, ASM:</B>  This
institute has approximately 350 researchers and 30 laboratories
doing research in optoelectronics, semiconductor materials, electrophysical
problems, statistical physics and nuclear physics.  The impressive
key technology at this institution is the application of electrical
field effects in a broad range of processes.  For example, Ocean
Spray uses their filtering technique to make Cranberry Juice Cocktail.
 In fluid dynamics, substantial research is being performed in
the areas of  electrohydrodynamics and cavitation.  By using electrohydrodynamics
to increase the heat and mass transfer within the cooling system
of a 1.6 micron ytrium garnet solid state laser, the repetition
rate was increased from 3 Hz to 100 Hz.  Other applications include
control of convection in a space heater to maintain the temperature
to within 0.05K, control of aerosol atomization to produce monodispersed
particles, and producing charged aerosol clouds in a battle environment
to confuse radar.  In the area of solid state electronics, this
group has succeeded in growing fluorides on semiconductor substrates
that match lattices with additional layers of III-V materials,
mainly emphasizing InP. Scientists here have developed a unique
electro-spark plating process that allows metallic coatings for
dissimilar metals. The coatings can add significant wear or corrosion
resistant to inexpensive aluminum or steel. Their electro-chemical
microarc oxidation process provides a simple method to coat aluminum
parts with ceramic-like oxides.<BR>

<B>Site Visit to Moldova Elitron Plant:</B>  This company was
an experimental plant of the Academy of Science which has become
a common stock company in partnership with a US engineering firm
in Texas.  The plant employs 250 people and is commercializing
materials technologies developed in the Academy. For example,
the plant has developed the Institute of Applied Physics's electro-spark
plating technique for repair of machinery parts. The technique
is particularly well suited to repair of metal parts because it
is a &quot;cold process&quot; and therefore does not change the
properties of the part, unlike a &quot;hot treatment&quot; such
as welding.  In addition the parts can easily be coated with a
more wear and corrosion resistant metal. Parts treated in this
fashion will last longer than a new part. <BR>

(<I>Editor's Note:  </I>During a recent site visit to Romania,
EOARD scientists discussed many interesting issues with their
Romanian counterparts.  This report is the result of some frank
conversations on higher education in Romania and the experiences
of one researcher in particular.)
<P>
<CENTER><I><B><FONT SIZE=6>The PhD Fraternity - Romanian Branch</FONT></B></I></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In Romania, having a Doctorate degree in Engineering
is very much like belonging to an international club.  There is
a universal sense of commiseration when two PhD's talk about their
dissertation research days, because nearly every PhD faces a seemingly
insurmountable obstacle of some sort along the way which becomes
his or her rite of initiation and badge of respect.  For some,
they lose their advisor along the way, for a few their entire
department closes down or their funding dries up before they finish.
 Some discover that slave-labor is alive and well, and that their
advisors think that nine years of research is not a long time.
 And for nearly everyone, the research has so many twists, turns,
and dead ends, that the finish is never in sight until the advisor
finally and unexpectedly utters the magic words - &quot;go write-up&quot;.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If you've talked to many PhD's about their own experiences,
you may think you've heard it all, but you probably have not heard
the experience of Dr Mihai Neamtu, Scientific Director of the
Romanian National Institute for Aerodynamic Research.  Dr Neamtu
had been an exchange scientist to Virginia Polytechnic Institute
back in the 70's doing AFOSR funded research, and he graciously
hosted an EOARD visit to Romania this year.  In his own experience,
he submitted his PhD dissertation in 1974.  Unfortunately, the
communist government decided that year that a PhD denoted an accomplishment
that should be reserved for members of the communist party.  Dr
Neamtu, a staunch anti-communist who refers the KGB as Kappa Gamma
Beta, proceeded to join the party in order to receive his title,
a process which took two years.  Once again, he submitted his
dissertation, but then the government passed a law that in order
to conserve paper, all dissertations must be 1-1/2 spaced on two
sided paper rather than double spaced, single sided.  Considering
that his manuscript was several hundred type-written pages long
and was full of hand-made, meticulously crafted charts, graphs
and figures, he was ready to give up.  It was only with the support
of family and friends a few years later that he re-formatted his
dissertation and received his degree in 1980.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In describing his ordeal, Dr Neamtu stressed that
it is very important to Romanian researchers that we do not judge
their capabilities and expertise by the number of papers that
turn up in the course of a literature review.  In the 1970's,
when his institute was part of the Academy of Science, each researcher
was expected to publish five papers per year.  However, as the
communist regime became increasingly isolated and despotic, publishing
became officially discouraged to the point where very little research
was released to the international community during the 1980's.
 Now, it is the policy  of his institute to do whatever is possible
to insure that any researcher is able to attend an international
meeting where their work has been accepted.  Dr Neamtu hopes that
in return, the international community will judge Romanian achievements
and consider collaborations based on current merit, rather than
the lost decade of international contact.</FONT>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visits to institutes and universities in
Poland</FONT></B>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>General comments: </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>Poland
was well known for the strength of its physics programs before
the collapse of the Eastern Bloc.  During the transition period
from the centrally planned economy to the free-market economy
physics, along with other sciences, suffered a crippling blow.
 Salaries were static while inflation was rampant and there was
no money to modernize the labs or repair equipment.  This state
of affairs caused an exodus of some the better known specialists
and increased attempts on the part of others to establish collaborations
and find money outside of Poland.  The situation has improved
and Poland, finally, is experiencing economic growth.  This is
reflected in the institute and university labs and offices that
I visited.  Nearly everyone had a personnel computer, all had
access to a supercomputer and the majority of the labs had new
equipment (although by no means top-of-the-line).  Most optics
laboratories were equipped with Nd-YAG lasers and had a sprinkling
of new data collection and processing hardware.  With few exceptions
the experimental effort is  not world-class.  Before the transition
Poland was well known for its strong theoretical physics.  Because
it is not equipment-driven, theoretical studies have not suffered
as much as experimental research efforts, and much is of excellent
quality.  A long-term problem, particularly in Poland, is the
increase in the average age of the scientific staff.  Scientist
salaries are lower than those in the service sector and are not
sufficient to support a family of two. <B> </B>The low salaries
mean the scientific establishment is unable to attract and hire
young scientists.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The following is a summary of the details of the
science that I observed in the six institutes and universities
that I visited.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Institute of Physics of the Polish Academy of
Sciences, Warsaw.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> Contact: Prof J. Mostowski.
 This institute employs approximately 320 people of which roughly
half are in administration.  As is true of many institutes in
Poland the average age of the scientific staff is relatively old,
49.   Three-quarters of the scientific staff work in the area
of condensed matter physics.  The other large group is in atomic
and molecular spectroscopy.  These groups are also the best equipped.
 In the early 90's  the institute purchased a molecular beam epitaxy
machine.  This caused the condensed matter group to shift away
from semimagnetic semiconductors to quantum wells.  There is still
a strong group involved with the design and study of conventional
magnets although there is a trend in the group to move to high
T<SUB>C </SUB> superconductors.  The experimental spectroscopy
group is studying sodium clusters formed by a novel technique
and dimers.  The theoretical group is primarily in quantum optics
and is very active.  They are interested in a number of fundamental
issues of light interaction with atoms such as the determination
of the wave function from probability distributions for the position
and momentum.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Center for Theoretical Physics, Warsaw. </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>Contact:
Prof K. Rzazewski.  This theoretical  group is small but well
known outside of Poland.  It specializes in quantum optics and
the foundations of quantum mechanics.  The members of this group
are studying questions concerned with photon wave functions, construction
of wave functions from probability and momentum distributions,
intense field effects in atoms and molecules, and the relation
between correlation in time-dependent processes and quantum chaos.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Institute  of Physics, University of Warsaw, Warsaw.
</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>Contact: Prof K. Wodkiewicz.  This is
the physics department of the University of Warsaw.  The staff
consists of approximately 150 people covering most of the areas
of contemporary physics.  In the area of optics there are three
groups of interest.  The spectroscopy group is interested in the
potentials and kinetic energy transfer associated with collisions
of atoms and the spectroscopy of atmospheric pollutants.  They
have developed what they claim is the world's smallest LIDAR system.
 It is currently housed in a van and is in active use in Poland
and surrounding countries.  The LIDAR system is composed of a
titanium sapphire laser which is tunable over 100nm.  The device
has an effective range of 300m to 2km under typical operating
conditions.  In most cases they are interested in detecting ozone,
and oxides of nitrogen and sulfur.  This device seems to be well
constructed and rugged.  The nonlinear optics group is studying
the Kramers-Kronig relation for highly nonlinear materials using
femtosecond lasers and chaos in alexandrite lasers.  The theoretical
quantum optics group is studying phase operators, spontaneous
emission and vacuum fluctuations, and quantum tomagraphy.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Jagiellonian
University, Krakow.</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> Contact: Prof T. Dohnalik.
This faculty consists of approximately 100 professors and associate
professors and 200 lecturers divided into four institutes.  There
is a major effort in this faculty in the area of theoretical atomic
physics.  They have been developing Hartree-Fock codes to calculate
transition rates, hyperfine structure, and energy structures of
light atoms.  Work is under way to extend the theory to heavier
atoms.  The most interesting work related to optics is the study
of laser beam propagation in dense metal vapors and the resulting
nonlinear optical effects, such as four-wave mixing, conical emission,
coherent population trapping, and quantum interference. Other
groups study the ground state potentials of  molecules formed
from a metal atom and a noble gas atom and develop diagnostics
for low temperature plasmas.</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, University
of Gdansk. </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>Contact: Prof J. Fiutak. This
faculty consists of approximately 28 professors and associate
professors along with 140 lecturers. The most interesting research
in this department is carried out by two of the theoretical groups.
 One group is studying light-induced kinetic effects in gases.
An example of these effects is the change in the diffusion rate
of a gas due to light-induced changes in the size of atoms.  The
other group is calculating the propagation of a laser pulse through
a gas of two-level atoms with which it is nearly resonant. Unlike
more traditional calculations this one includes coherence relaxation
and homogeneous broadening due to elastic collisions with a buffer
gas.  This has led to some interesting generalizations of the
area theorem for the case when the pulse duration is comparable
to the coherence relaxation time.  There is also an interdisciplinary
study of the characteristic luminescence of various types of cancers.
 This research has led to the development of a system for the
detection of melanoma that is being tested in the local hospital.</FONT>

</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>Contact: Prof J. Szudy.  The Institute
of Physics consists of 90 faculty members divided among 14 divisions.
The Division of Computational Methods in Molecular Physics is
concerned with symmetry as applied to spectroscopic properties
of lanthanides and actinides, quantum dots, and hyperfine structure;
with electronic structure of thin films and surfaces; confined
many-electron systems such as quantum dots; and radiation of atoms
near dielectric and metallic media.  The Division of Optoelectronics
studies the optical properties of crystals, glasses and ceramics
activated by transition metal ions which could be used as tunable
solid state lasers as well as the spectroscopy of the active media
of dye lasers and molecular interactions in liquids. The Division
of Semiconductors is concentrating on II-VI compounds.  The current
emphasis is on the growth and characterization of  Zn<SUB>1-X</SUB>Mg<SUB>X</SUB>Se
mixed crystals with emphasis on the variation of the bandgap energy
with the magnesium concentration.  Ultimate goals are the development
of a blue-green laser. The Division of Molecular Biophysics is
studying the luminescence properties of human eye lenses, both
clear and with cataracts, and the eye lens photochemistry.  There
is also interest in molecular systems undergoing photophysical
and photochemical transformations.  </FONT>

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Institute of Physics, A. Mickiewicz University,
Poznan</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>.  Contact: Prof R. Tanas. This
institute consists of approximately 500 people of which roughly
half are scientists. As far as facilities are concerned, this
was the most impressive of the sites that I visited in Poland.
 The institute is in the process of moving into a new building
on the outskirts of Poznan. The top floor of one of the wings
is equipped as a laboratory for atmospheric optics where studies
on ozone and aerosol content in the atmosphere will be performed.
 The Laboratory of Quantum Electronics studies the spectroscopic
properties of rare-earth ions in stochiometric crystals and glassy
materials.  They are currently concentrating on erbium pentaphosphate
crystals.  The Division of Nonlinear Optics has research programs
in the theory of quantum optical phase, cooperative optical effects
in nonlinear materials, laser-induced auto-ionization, classical
and quantum chaos in optical systems, quantum effects in strong
laser fields, molecular nonlinear optics, and multiphoton resonant
and nonresonant Rayleigh and Raman spectroscopy.    The Division
of Molecular Biophysics is studying the nonlinear optics of macromolecular
solutions e.g. tRNA solutions and the initial stages of photosynthesis.</FONT>

is the only university in Germany with a Department of Aeronautics
and Astronautics.  The department consists of seven institutes:
 Aero and Gas Dynamics, Aircraft Design, Aircraft Propulsion,
Space systems, Aerospace Structures, Thermodynamics, Flight Mechanics
and Control, and Chemical Propulsion.  The Institute for Space
Systems performs research in electric propulsion with high power
magneto plasma dynamic (MPD) and thermal arcjet thruster development.
 They have excellent facilities for continuous testing of large
(up to 1 megawatt) thrusters.  The Institute operates four plasma
wind tunnels.  Two use MPD sources and operate at controlled pressures
down to 10 mbar with high specific enthalpy using N</FONT><SUB><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></SUB><FONT SIZE=2>,

 A third has an inductively generated RF source with adjustable
frequency.  This facility has been in operation for about six
months.  It is being used for heating effects studies of reentry
vehicles.  It operates at very low pressure with N</FONT><SUB><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></SUB><FONT SIZE=2>,
Ar, Air, CO</FONT><SUB><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></SUB><FONT SIZE=2>,
and O</FONT><SUB><FONT SIZE=1>2</FONT></SUB><FONT SIZE=2>.  A
fourth tunnel uses a thermal arcjet generator.   The Institute
of Thermodynamics has a supersonic combustion facility that can
be driven continuously for several hours. They are studying mixing,
ignition and burning.  They have the capability to separate mixing
and combustion.  Laser diagnostics and 2-D Raman Ramographics
are currently being used with a 3-D configuration being developed.
Since 1990, 15 Institutes at Stuttgart, including these two, have
been involved in a cooperative effort funded by the DFG (German
Science Foundation) known jointly as Collaborative Research Center
(SFB) 259 for High Temperature Problems of Reusable Space Transportation
Systems.  SFB 259 concentrates on thermophysical problems of reentry;
high temperature materials, hot load carrying structures, thermal
protection systems; and high-temperature aerodynamics. </FONT>

 JPC Technology, Isle of Wight, UK, has developed a high speed
Digital Data Filter. This SOS integrated circuit filters the 16
most significant data elements (8 bits) encountered in a data
stream, ranks them in hierarchical order, and tags them with their
original address at speeds of up to 20 million samples per second.
 The device may be scaled to fit the needs at hand, extracting
more data elements or scanning greater data fields through series,
cascade or parallel arrangements.  One application in development
is a &quot;stellar gyro&quot; for spacecraft, replacing heavy
mechanical gyros. Other potential uses include target recognition,
tracking, electronic warfare, and surveillance.</FONT>

Institute of Aviation Materials (VIAM) is Russia's premier aerospace
materials development institute. VIAM has been visited before
by personnel from Edison house. The previous trips however, examined
the general technical capability of VIAM and were broad in scope.
In this visit VIAM provided a detailed look at their high strength
aluminum, aluminum-lithium and titanium alloy research programs.
Researchers at VIAM claim the high strength aluminum alloys they
developed in the 70's are still competitive with new US aluminum
alloys. They have developed high temperature Al alloys which can
replace titanium for some high temperature applications. At VIAM
researchers have developed an entire concept of welded aluminum-lithium
alloy structures, including critically loaded structures. These
structures result in a 24% weight reduction over conventional
aluminum structures. They have also developed AlLi alloys for
superplastic forming, extrusion and welding. VIAM has developed
titanium casting technology to produce casted load bearing components.
Airbus is currently looking to VIAM for titanium casted landing
gear parts for the Airbus aircraft. The presented metals research
was only a portion of the research ongoing at VIAM. <I><B>It is

are scientists or engineers. There is a complete, but reduced
size (by Russian standards) metallurgical plant within the Institute.
The main areas of research are aluminum and aluminum alloys, aluminum
lithium alloys, superalloys, titanium alloys and magnesium alloys.
They have unique capabilities in the following areas: production
of super thin titanium foils and Ti on polymer films, weldable
aluminum lithium alloy production, and extrusion of complex aluminum
and extruded Al and AlLi parts, for example panels with integral
stiffeners.</FONT>

They work together with VIAM and VILS to ensure that their designs
utilize the most technically current materials and materials processes.
They can also request materials (from VIAM) with certain specifications.
The design bureau has over 5000 workers. They are working toward
United States certification of a light aircraft, IL-103. They

<U><B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visit to Demokritos, the National Center
for Scientific Research, Athens, Greece.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contact:
 Prof Emmanuel Floratos, Director, Institute of Nuclear Physics.
 Demokritos was a 5<U><SUP>th</SUP> century BC Greek philosopher,
far ahead of his time, who believed that nature was composed of
an infinite multitude of small, irreducible atoms, and that all
natural order derived from the interactions of these small entities.
 The National Center for Scientific Research is named after this
powerful thinker and includes institutes studying microelectronics,
material science, biology, chemistry,  reactor technology and
radiation protection, radiopharmaceuticals, and computer science.
 Overall there are some 300 scientists, 300 administrative personnel,
and 100 graduate students at Demokritos.  The students conduct
research and studies at Demokritos, but obtain their degrees from
the University of Athens. The Institute of Nuclear Physics is
rather foresighted as well.  The Institute no longer focuses strictly
on the high-cost, low-payoff world of particle and nuclear research,
but has branched out into a number of useful and interesting applications
such as neural networks, nonlinear equations (quantum cryptography
and quantum computing), and cartographic work for protection of
the environment.  They also maintain the capability to conduct
studies in low energy nuclear physics using a 5 MeV proton beam
(although they can use heavier elements in the beam).  They concentrate
on surface physics and nuclear astrophysics.<BR>

Crete.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>Contacts:  Dr George Tsironis,
Dr Gergory Athanasiu.  Both the University of Crete and FORTH
have brand new facilities which are very impressive.  <U><I><B>In
particular, FORTH has the potential to be a major center of excellence
for a variety of scientific studies.</B></I> The University has
7,000 students.  Half of these students come from Crete.  At age
18 students take national exams.  The best students get their
first choice of university.  Although the University at Crete
is well thought-of academically, the higher costs on the island
make it an unpopular choice for students from the mainland. The
Department of Physics has a faculty of some 35 permanent and visiting
staff.  They have approximately 50 graduate students at any time.
 One very impressive area of Dr Tsironis' research is using multimedia
for teaching.  They have already developed a multimedia format
(with CD-ROM) to teach math/physics at the high school level,
and are hard at work on a new CD-ROM text for a course in differential
equations.  Dr Tsironis also works in control of chaos, condensed
matter, and photonic bandgap materials with nonlinearities.  Dr
Athanasiu is a very versatile physicist who has worked at Stanford,
CERN, and the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.  At CERN
he got interested in the physiological nature of neural networks,
particularly in modeling them the same way the retina works. 
He succeeded in teaching his net in image recognition of characteristic
particle tracks.  He uses a technique called principle component
analysis that is very robust to noise.  His work in spin glasses
got him interested in quantum computation and cryptography.  FORTH
was created in 1987 to help Greece compete internationally in
scientific research, linking universities and industry. FORTH
has four institutes at Heraklion.  They are Molecular Biology
and Biotechnology, Electronic Structure and Lasers, Computer Science,
and Applied and Computational Mathematics.  The Electronic Structure
institute conducts many interesting applications with lasers including
the restoration of artworks, laser deposition on substrates, and
fiber sensors for aircraft wings.  They use a two-laser system
for mass spectroscopy-one pulse to ablate the material and then
a second to test for resonances.  They also perform spectroscopy
on atomic clusters, do real-time holography using photorefractive
crystals, and use femtosecond laser pulses for optical tomography
and high-intensity laser interactions with atoms. They use nanosecond
laser pulses to study photodissociation, destroy kidney stones,
and control the products of chemical interactions via laser interference
(coherent control).  They build and sell compact, powerful Nd:YAG
lasers with excellent characteristics (e.g. 22 ns pulses, up to
6 mJ/pulse, with a 100 Hz rep rate). FORTH also has an in-house
publishing house, Crete University Press, which translates many
popular scientific texts in affordable Greek formats.<BR>

technical workshops and mini-symposia at overseas conferences.
 We often receive free proceedings and attendance for one or more
Air Force representatives.  Air Force R&amp;D personnel attending
or considering to attend European conferences should contact EOARD
for information and to determine whether free registration is
available.  We have also listed conferences being supported by

candidate contact your laboratory Chief Scientist and/or your
EOARD Laboratory representative.  Below is a list of some WOS
visits planned for the upcoming months.  For further details regarding
a visitor read the expanded details in the Laboratory representative

<FONT SIZE=2>The <I>EUROGRAM</I> is published bimonthly by the
US Air Force European Office of Aerospace Research and Development
(EOARD), Detachment 1 of the Air Force Office of Scientific Research
(AFOSR).  It contains reports on European research, a complete
list of current EOARD points of contact, and a summary of recent
work in our primary programs  The purpose of the <I>EUROGRAM</I>
is twofold: first, to alert the Air Force technical community
to research developments in Europe from which a technical dialogue
may begin, and second, to provide an executive summary for Air

<TABLE BORDER=1>

<TR><TD COLSPAN=2 WIDTH=517><FONT SIZE=2>The Republic of Armenia has a population of only 3.3 million people, but boasts a strong tradition of scientific excellence and was likely the third largest contributor to research within the USSR, following Russia and Ukraine.  In recent years, however, the resilience and determination of the country to maintain its scientific infrastructure has been put to the test.  In December 1988, an earthquake devastated the northern portion of the country killing 55,000 people and swelling the capital, Yerevan, with refugees.  After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, this land-locked country found itself geographically and politically isolated.  Armenia is a strongly Christian country which went to war with its Muslim neighbor, Azerbaijan, over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a region which prior to 1991 belonged to Azerbaijan, populated by ethnic Armenians.  Consequently, Armenia's other Muslim neighbors, Iran and Turkey, enforced total land blockades along their borders while Armenia's one remaining neighbor, Georgia, was deeply embroiled in a civil war.  For the first few years of its newfound independence, virtually any imports and exports had to be transferred by air.  The country's nuclear power station shut down and a lack of natural fuel resources led to long periods of power outages, including the cold winter seasons.  In less than three years, the value of currency decreased by a factor of more than 100,000 while prices of many consumer goods inflated rapidly to western levels.</FONT>

</TD></TR>

<TR><TD WIDTH=457>Today, however, Armenia enjoys relative stability and an optimistic outlook towards the future.  There is a cease-fire with Azerbaijan and the land blockades are loosening.  The civil war in Georgia has ended, Armenia's nuclear power station recently re-opened, and their currency, the dram, has held a constant rate of exchange against the dollar for more than a year.  Economically, however, Armenia still has a long way to go, but is westernizing quickly and has attracted more foreign aid from the U.S. per capita than any other country in the world aside from Israel.  Although they were the first of the former Soviet republics to introduce privatization and economic reform, a typical research scientist for the Academy of Science earns a base salary of only $8.50 per month - half that of a scientist in Ukraine, and ten times less than a scientist in Russia.  Scientists are also frustrated by frequent power outages, and in some cases, loss of power due to the inability of institutes to pay the bills.  A majority of the institutes and universities are virtually unheated and will be closed completely during the coldest winter months.

Vodyanoy of ONREUR.  Despite the turmoil faced since the late
80's and the current economic conditions, several of the institutes
visited were found to be doing outstanding, world-class research.
 Institutes and the universities have done a brilliant job of
maintaining their infrastructure and potential during the worst
of times, and are optimistic that the international scientific
community will recognize the value of what they have to offer.
 The institutes use the typical Soviet scientific model of having
both testing and engineering facilities to follow-up on basic
scientific results.  <B>The Edison House scientists feel very
strongly that the timing is optimum for our labs to form a strong,
lasting  relationship with Armenian scientists and institutes
for the mutual benefit of both of our countries.</B>  Short summaries
of the individual visits follow, and additional information is
available on request.

<CENTER><U><B>Site Visits to Institutes of the Armenian National
Academy of Science</B></U></CENTER>
<P>
The Armenian National Academy of Science was founded in 1943 as
the primary coordinator of basic research within the Republic.
 The Academy is comprised of 34 institutes, and is divided into
departments of Physico-Mathematical and Technical Sciences, Natural
Sciences, and Humanitarian Sciences.  Approximately 4,000 researchers
work among the various institutes--about 1,500 fewer than five
years ago.  Economic conditions have lowered governmental funding
to less than one million dollars annually, causing increasing
emphasis on the need to attract outside funding sources.  Last
year 428 researchers within the Academy received Soros grants,
giving them the largest number of any FSU country aside from Russia.
<P>
<B>Institute of Applied Problems in Physics:  </B>This institute
of approximately 250 people (90 scientists) was formed just 10
years ago, and boasts good, young experimental facilities, a design
bureau, and three manufacturing facilities.  They specialize in
solid state physics, nuclear physics, acoustics, particle physics,
and physics of low temperature plasma.  They are maintaining strong
relations with their Russian counterparts, and are building relationships
with American firms such as HP and GM.  A few of their recent
developments include a lightbulb based on plasma acoustic modulation
and electric heaters fabricated from a volcanic rock natural resource.
 The lightbulbs require only 20-25% of the power needed for conventional
fluorescent bulbs of the same output power and contain no mercury.
 The heaters are 20% more efficient than conventional electric
heaters.  This institute has particularly strong research efforts
in the generation and use of acoustic waves.  For instance, using
a method they call &quot;parametric dispersion&quot;, they have
used acoustic waves to modulate quasi-Cerenkov radiation generated
by electrons or positrons traversing crystals.  The resulting
distribution of x-rays is highly angularly dependent and thus
this method can result in x-rays of very high monochromaticity.
 The process also results in an increase in the x-ray intensity
by a factor of 1.5 to 2.  Acoustic waves have also been used to
spatially modulate low-temperature plasmas.  Particular applications
of this technology are improved performance of high-power, gas-discharge
lasers and the generation of monochromatic, coherent acoustic
waves from a plasma pumped by a microwave source.

1955 and employs approximately 140 people.  They specialize in
a wide variety of theoretical research relating to the mechanics
of solid media, and consider themselves as the world's best center
in the area of plates and shells (their monographs were translated
and used by NASA).  Previously, they were part of the USSR military
complex and  participated in the Sputnik program.  In the late
80's, their major funding source was for Soviet satellite strength
calculations.  Today they working to develop other international
relationships, of which their contacts with France and Japan are
the strongest to date.

<TR><TD WIDTH=415><B>Bjurakan Astrophysical Observatory:  </B>This institute employs nearly 200 people and has been doing research in astrophysics since 1946. It is located in the Ashtarak region of Armenia which allows viewing on 70% of the nights with 1.5-2 arcsec viewing on good nights. There are two telescopes that are currently in use, a 1.3 m Schmidt telescope and 2.6 m reflector.  The Schmidt telescope has a 4&#176; field of view and has three different wedge plates that can be inserted in the telescope to provide wavelength dispersion.  This telescope was constructed in the 1950s and is operating with its original drive and controls.  It is also restricted by the fact that it is currently only capable of recording images on glass plates. There are plans to modernize both the control/drive mechanisms and install a CCD camera. The 2.6 m telescope was constructed in the 1970s. This is also in need of maintenance and modernization, part of which is planned for the spring of 1996.  This telescope is somewhat unusual in having a relatively high slew rate which makes it a possible source for satellite tracking. Their current research includes investigations of galaxies, star formation regions, theoretical astrophysics and mathematical physics.  They have a long history of international participation and collaboration, and are credited with the discovery of stellar associations and galaxies with active nuclei.  They are very close to establishing internet access and creating a WWW site to make available over 2000 plates covering over 17,000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the sky.

<P>
The Armenians have initiated a project of using poisonous <I>gurza </I>snakes as biodetectors for earthquakes.  They have noticed that several hours prior to a quake, hundreds of thousands of these snakes surface, head to the river, and swim downstream to congregate until the earthquake is over.  (They only go as far as the spot where the local molybdenum mine dumps its refuse in the water.)  Then they return, also <I>en masse</I>. The Armenian scientists are looking at three possible explanations for the behavior of the snakes.  Although the snakes are deaf, they are very sensitive to infrasound and infrared.  It is also possible that they sense minute chemical changes in hydrogen sulfide concentrations.  The scientists don't feel it is an electromagnetic effect--<I>gurzas</I> placed in Helmholz coils showed no special sensitivity.  The snakes seem to provide the best advance warning of all animals studied--up to 18 hours.  Dogs seem to know when earthquakes are coming a few hours prior.  Goats, we are told, are not so good,  &quot;maybe 30 minutes to an hour ahead at the most&quot;.

<B>Institute of Radiophysics and Electronics:  </B>This institute
was founded in 1964, has approximately 300 employees, and specializes
in fundamental and applied research in radiophysics, electronics,
and automatic control.  Currently, much of their focus is on the
development of accurate, sensitive microwave radiometers for wavelengths
in the range of 2mm to 30cm, and the use of masers as receivers
up to 200 GHz.  There is a substantial effort in the development
of materials for detecting IR and submillimeter radiation.  Prior
to the breakup of the Soviet Union much of their research and
production capabilities were directed to military applications.
 This includes a series of rotation detectors, the largest of
which have a resolution of 0.3 arcsec and 22 bits of accuracy.
 A 14 bit accurate detector designed for fighter aircraft is available
for purchase at around $500/sample. Recently, they have developed
a six channel six centimeter wavelength radiometer to fly on the
MIR space station.  Current projects are oriented towards the
development of wavelength specific detectors for particular applications.
 These include: a 195 GHz high-T<SUB>c </SUB> superconducting
detector for mapping ozone distribution in the atmosphere, millimeter
band detectors for short-range communications and data transfer,
1-50cm band detectors to measure water content of the soil, and
94 GHz detectors for imaging to name a few.  The soil humidity
detector is already operational and is claimed to be more sensitive
than anything on the market. They also have ideas for developing
an amplitude and phase detector for microwaves with a sensitivity
ten times better than any device currently available.
<P>
<B>Institute For Physical Research:  </B>This institute of nearly
300 people was founded in 1967 and is located in the Ashtarak
region of Armenia.  Before the breakup of the Soviet union this
was probably the premier institute for fundamental research in
physics and optics in Armenia.  It was comparable in stature to
the Lebedev Institute in Moscow in the 70's. They are still engaged
in a wide range of scientific activities although their experimental
efforts have been and still are curtailed.   They specialize in
nonlinear optics, quantum optical electronics, solid state physics
and crystal structure, theory of radiation of charged particles,
theory of interaction of radiation with matter, quantum and classical
electrodynamics, and high temperature superconductivity.   Specific
research projects include:  extreme UV sources based on laser
pulses on targets; up conversion of light using the interaction
of laser pulses with metallic vapors; squeezed light in lasers
without inversion; the effects of erbium doping in solid state
lasers; the effects of different dopants on photorefractivity
in lithium niobate; and high T<SUB>c</SUB> devices for spectrometry.

<P>
The biggest problem facing Armenian science is information exchange, according to Academician Fadey T. Sarkissian, the President of the Academy of Sciences.  Power disruptions, a blockade by neighboring countries, and financial woes make it difficult for the Armenians to receive or send out scientific information.  They require support to publish and distribute several monographs and books on a wide variety of scientific subjects.  They would like to receive scientific journals, magazines, and papers.  If any of our readers have suggestions or ideas to help the Armenians, please contact EOARD.

<B>Institute of Microbiology:  </B>This institute was founded in 1961 and has nearly 200 employees, 10 laboratories, and a small chemical and drug factory.  It also has library of more than 20,000 living bacteria cultures which are available for international access.  They maintain a databank of information on all their cultures to include nomenclature, bacterial characteristics, and passport data (strains).  They are putting all this into an electronic database.  Of great significance is a databank of 2,500 species of biodestructors.  They have developed a scale to measure the degree of bacterial damage and procedures to protect people and equipment exposed to biodestructors.  Current research includes bacterial destruction of synthetic materials for waste treatment, bacterial enrichment of ore, synthetic production of fructose, bacterial insecticides, acido-lactic products for treatment of childhood diseases, and production of gunpowder additives/replacements.  In addition, the institute is developing a liquid protection coating to prevent biocorrosion and destruction of pipelines.  The bacterial agents in this coating are also being investigated for use as an additive to paints used for ship hulls to prevent mollusks from attaching.

free radicals, chain reactions, and combustion and explosion in
gaseous and condensed phases.  Recent achievements include using
a laser to deter oxide production in hydrocarbons at temperatures
between 350 to 500 K, which causes the hydrocarbons to break down
without oxidation, raising the temperature required for ignition.
<P>
<B>Institute of General and Inorganic Chemistry: </B> This institute
has more than 250 employees and was founded in 1957 to specialize
in research relating to the full utilization of mineral resources.
 Using silicates, they claim a 96% recovery rate for Au and an
88% recovery rate for Ag.  Current projects include the development
of an inexpensive, spray-on inorganic polymer anti-corrosion coating
based on silicates and phosphate, and thin layer chromatography
absorbents.  They employ an elastic wave process for making synthetic
diamonds and metal-on-metal coatings.  They claim this process
can speed up reactions up to 10 million times.
<P>
<B>L. A. Orbeli Institute of Physiology:  </B>This institute was
founded in 1943 and has approximately 210 employees.  Before the
dissolution of the USSR, this institute led all of the Soviet
Union in publications in neuroscience.  The main problem they
study is neuroplasticity, specifically restoration of functions,
including memory, after damage.  They are looking at different
synaptic mechanisms of regulation in the autonomic nervous system,
and claim to lead the former Soviet Union countries in research
on the hypothalmus.
<P>
<B>Institute of Geological Sciences:  </B>This institute, founded
in 1935, has approximately 330 employees and specializes in both
geology and geography.  Achievements include the publication of
a ten volume set of monographs titled &quot;The Geology of Republic
of Armenia&quot;, and the construction of an extensive database
of information from 50,000 earthquakes for use in developing theories
on earthquake prediction and movement of the continental shelves.
 Other research includes the geopathological zone (the influence
of geology on life) and the relation between volcanic and tectonic
activity.  Their theories account for hydrodynamics, hydroseismology,
and seismic tectonics.  Using photographs from remote sensing
satellites, they have studied tectonics throughout Russia.
<P>
<B>Institute of Informatics &amp; Automation:  </B> This institute
was founded in 1967 and has approximately 150 employees. The topics
of research fall into six major categories: theory of automata,
mathematical logic and algorithms, pattern recognition and image
processing, artificial intelligence, coding theory, and communications
systems.  Some specific areas of research are: paired forms of
multidimensional coverings to improve the performance of fast
transforms, computerized tomography, effective methods of signal
and image restoration including noise filtering, quasilinear systems
and spaces for construction and classification of wide classes
of nonlinear systems and methods such as median filters, pattern
recognition theory, earthquake prediction and computer assisted
drug design.  They are also compiling a database of earthquakes
 for Armenia.  They have partial earthquake records extending
from 1900 to 1960 and complete sets of data from 1961 to present.

<B>Laserayan Technica Armenia:  </B>This research company was
founded by Yerevan State University and includes a research institute,
design bureau, and production facility.  At its peak in the 1980's
it had a staff of 990 and income of $20-30M per year, primarily
from the USSR.  Today the staff has shrunk to 300 and the income
to $100-200K per year, but they have retained leading edge capabilities
in several areas and have a strong potential to rebuild themselves
within the world market.  Among their specialties are the design
and production of a wide range of optical coatings for high power
lasers, the growth of laser and nonlinear crystals, optical elements,
and the development of laser systems for remote sensing, such
as a helicopter based airborne laser fluorimeter for detecting
underwater chemicals, chlorophyll, and minerals.  Their crystal
growing capabilities are near state-of-the-art for three different
methods.   This facility can grow rods and slabs for a wide variety
of solid state lasers including YAG, YLF and Er.  They also grow
a wide range of nonlinear optical materials such as KTP, LiNbO<SUB>3
</SUB> and BBO. In addition, they are exploring commercial opportunities
for their capabilities in two and three dimensional engraving
and cutting with lasers.

<B>Yerevan State University:  </B>Yerevan State University was
founded in 1919, and has 19 faculties containing 110 departments.
 There are approximately 9,500 students and 3,150 employees, and
the university was considered one of the top 25 in science throughout
the USSR.  As with the research institutes, the university is
currently forced to shut down during the coldest months to conserve
on energy costs and adjust its summer calendar accordingly.  The
university has a printing house which publishes three scientific
journals and is working with Brown University to establish internet
access.  At the moment the university is transitioning from the
degree system model of the USSR to the degree system used in the
USA.  Tuition charges are also being introduced, with 50% of the
students now paying annual fees ranging from $200 to $1,000. 
The highest tuition costs are being levied against the most popular
study, law, while science and engineering are among the lowest
cost and interest due to the current lack of economic opportunities
with these degrees.  Much of the research that is currently pursued
in the institutes of the Academy of Sciences originated in this
university.

<P>
Dr Jack McIver and Lt Col Don Erbschloe visited Bulgaria as a follow-on to their visit to Armenia.  There were some similarities, but also some striking differences.  Science in Bulgaria is in a depressed state as in many of the former Eastern Block countries.  The institutes are operating with just enough money to pay salaries which are very low in comparison to many in the service sector.  The average salary for a scientist is in the range of $20-30 per month (this is below the cost of living).  As a result, much of the equipment is out of date and, when broken, is not repaired.  There is also a general feeling of helplessness that is in marked contrast to that observed in Armenia, even though the Bulgarians appear to have more contacts with Western Europe and have better access to current literature.

This university is pioneering the move in Armenia towards a western style degree and education system, and is working with Cal Tech on the reformation of its structure and management. The main directions of research in the university are: computer sciences, semiconductor devices, powder metallurgy, high-speed ground transport, machine design and simulation, alternate energy sources including solar cells and panels, robotics and micromanipulators, fiber optics for communications, tribiology, and new lubricants with synthetic additions.
<P>
<B>Yerevan Seismic Institute:  </B>Armenia sits between the Arabian and Eurasian plates and thus is ideally situated to monitor seismic events on either plate.  They have constructed a very impressive underground facility to detect and measure a variety of data.  Precisely engineered rails allow laser interferometry and the deformation of long quartz cylinders to measure seismic torsions on three axes (200m long north-south axis, 67m long east-west, and 8m long vertical axis).  They have several chambers for instruments such as inclinometers, accelerometers, and magnetometers.  This impressive facility is not being used currently as there is no reliable source of electric power and because of lack of funding.

 The conference was organized by Academician Micheal Ostrovsky
of the Institute of Chemical Physics in Moscow.  One goal of the
workshop was to exchange information between scientists in areas
of sensory physiology and biosensors in order to develop novel
ideas in both fields.   A second goal was to inform Russian and
US participants about possible areas of mutual interest. Topics
for the conference included: sensitivity and noise in sensory
systems, single-use electrochemical biosensors for medical applications
and environmental control, biophysics of auditory organs (mechanisms
of directionality), model of the modules and the visual pattern
recognition, the eye and &quot;nose&quot; in insects, Langmuir-Blodgett
films of monoclonal antibodies (immunological properties and application
as sensing elements for immunosensors), modelling knowledge acquisition
(neuro- cognitive and sensory prerequisites for learning strategies),
model of biosensor with photosensitive polymer membrane, enzyme
activity control in thermosensitive hydrogels, bacteriorhodopsin
based light-sensitive biosensors, reception  of  low-intensity
millimeter-wave electromagnetic radiation by electroreceptors,
central auditory neurons in frequency resolution, amplitude change
discrimination and complex sound analysis, new optical oxygen
sensor and its application to biosensing, electrochemical  immunoassay:
pushing  down  the  limit  of detection, invariant target perception
in echo-locating animals (dolphins)  based on the temporal resolution
mechanisms of  the auditory systems, photoreversible reactions
of octopus rhodopsin, membrane  surface  charge  and  synaptic
 transmission  from photoreceptors, biosensors based on scanning
probe microscopy, biosensor  models  based on potentiometric 
and  amperometric transducers for use in medicine, biotechnology,
monitoring of the environment, scanning probe investigations 
of Langmuir-Blodgett films and biological objects, and detection
of biologically active compounds by biosensors based on DNA liquid
crystals.  This workshop gathered the top sensory physiologists
and biosensor engineers in Russia (correspondence with the organizer
of the workshop).  They are very interested in working with their
Western colleagues in this area.  I believe there are a large
number of Window on Science participants who would be very interesting
to the Armstrong Laboratory particularly to Richard McKinnely

Garching, Germany.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>  This conference was
attended by over 165 scientists and engineers and had papers from
more than 30 countries. There were three sessions devoted to reviews
of adaptive optics telescope projects, many of which are under
construction or in the planning stage.  There were also sessions
on applications, computational methods, adaptive optics components,
non-conventional techniques, Russian and Asian adaptive optics,
novel concepts and site characterization, and adaptive optics
experimental results.  The session on Russian and Asian adaptive
optics had speakers from the Institute of Atmospheric Optics,
Tomsk; Beijing Institute of Applied Physics and Computational
Mathematics; V. I. Vavilov State Optical Institute, St. Petersburg;
Scientific Research Center for Technological Lasers, Moscow; and
several small companies based in Russia.  There were also a large

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Site visit to Laser Zentrum Hannover e.V., Hannover,
Germany.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>The Laser Zentrum was established
in 1986 to provide a place where fundamental research in lasers
and laser interactions could be transitioned to industrial products
and applications and physics-oriented techniques could be brought
to bear on industrial problems.  This institute is funded by the
German government, industry and a series of grants and contracts.
 The staff of the institute consists of scientists and engineers
who are on assignment from industry and universities and a number
of students in addition to a permanent staff. It contains an impressive
amount of industrial class lasers in addition to state-of-the-art
coating and testing facilities and research class lasers.  In
addition to the research there are groups involved in developing
safety standards, offering safety training and education courses,
and providing services such as on site measurements of emissions.
Of particular interest is their research in diode-pumped solid-state
lasers, diode-pumped fiber lasers, and tunable solid-state lasers.

Professors Ertmer, Wellegehausen, and Tiemann.  Prof Ertmer's
group is involved in experimental studies in the use of lasers
for cataract surgery, laser induced shock waves, optical tomography,
and the development of frequency time standards using a Ramsey
interferometer with laser cooled atoms. They currently have an
uncertainty of 1 Hz out of a few times 10<SUP>15 </SUP> Hz for
the frequency time standard. There are plans to perform experiments
in Bose-Einstein condensation.  Prof Wellegehausen's group is
involved in the experimental studies of femtosecond laser pulses
interacting with various forms of matter. Most recently they have
been studying the effects of polarization on two-color, high-harmonic
generation in atoms and the interaction of femtosecond pulses
with metal surfaces. The goal of the latter study is to determine
if there are advantages to using ultrashort pulses for drilling
holes in metals. Prof Tiemann's group is noted for its work in
photodissociation. They are studying two- and three-photon dissociation
of SbI<SUB>3 </SUB>, SbBr<SUB>3 </SUB>, and SbCl<SUB>3 </SUB>
and are working to establish a frequency standard in the near

 Director: N. Andreev The optical fiber laboratory consists of
two people at present.  Topics that have been of interest are
propagation in fibers and the effect of external influences on
propagation characteristics, spectral characteristics of Nd-doped
fibers, and nonlinear optical processes.  One of the more interesting
projects is the demonstration of an improved method for coupling
laser light into a fiber.  In this technique the polished end
of a </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Symbol">400</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>

fiber is used as a cavity mirror.  Experiments indicate that only
low order modes are coupled into the fiber.  In contrast to  conventional
coupling schemes this method defines a uniform alignment criteria
and is less sensitive to misalignment.  One can tune the light
by using a diffraction grating.  </FONT>

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Institute for Nuclear Research</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
Director: Prof Y. N. Stamenov    This institute employs approximately
400 people of which about half are scientists. The research interests
include: theoretical and mathematical physics, high energy particle
physics involving collaborations with CERN and Dubna, nuclear
metals, neutron physics, radioactive isotopes, and reactors physics
and nuclear energy.  The last area is closely connected with the
operation of the nuclear power reactor in Bulgaria.  A soliton
group is headed by Dr V. S. Gerdjikov and includes members for
the Institute of Electronics, the Institute of Solid State Physics
and foreign collaborators.  Their main area of interest is the
propagation and interaction of pico- and femto-second soliton-like
pulses in nonlinear media.</FONT>

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Institute of Solid State Physics</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
Director: Prof N Kirov This is the largest institute in Bulgaria
associated with condensed matter physics.  Some of the research
directions include: solid state theory, crystal growth including
solid state laser materials, optics and spectroscopy, microelectronics,
acousto-electronics, magnetic phenomena and metal vapor lasers.
 This is probably the most active of the institutes that we visited
certainly form the point of view of papers published, ~2 per person.
 One of their more active areas of research seems to be in fiber
optic sensors for measuring atmospheric parameters.  Part of the
reason for this research is interest by the Bulgarian Air Force.
 There is  also an active group in thin-film technology both for
optical coatings and in liquid crystal membranes.</FONT>

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Institute of Electronics</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>
Director: Prof P. A. Atanasov  The institute of electronics has
been closely coupled with the Ministry of Defense, particularly
through the Bulgarian Air Force.  The director claims that the
institute is very well equipped but suffers from the fact that
the equipment is at least five years old.  There are large projects
in remote sensing of pollutants and laser radar.  The current
LIDAR systems are based on diode lasers while the older ones used
either copper-vapor lasers or Nd:YAG lasers.  The latter have
a range of 10 km and have also been used to do wind measurements.
 Approximately a third of the employees of the institute are involved
in the laser processing of materials.  The current topic of interest
is the use of laser ablation and magnetic sputtering for producing
thin-films of high-T<SUB>c </SUB> materials. There are also groups
working on increasing the sensitivity of Russian radar systems,
developing new types of gas discharge lasers, and x-ray lasers.</FONT>

<I><FONT SIZE=2>Faculty of Physics, University of Sofia.  </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>The
faculty of physics at Sofia university consists of 112 staff members
with the rank of Associate Professor or higher,  1200 undergraduates
and 28 doctoral students.  The number of doctoral students has
declined from a maximum of 100 or so primarily due to the difficulty
in finding jobs when finished.  The faculty is further divided
into fourteen departments.  One of the two departments with optics
related research is the Department of Quantum Electronics.  Topics
of interest here include the development of a single shot autocorrelator,
development and use of a frequency doubling mirror for mode locking
and construction of an all optical switch and cascade nonlinearities.
 There is also a major effort devoted to the study of dark solitons
with emphasis on applications to their use in communications and
information transfer, in the shaping and compression of laser
pulses, and in deflection of pulses for the construction of an
all optical streak camera. The other department with optics related
research is the Department of Radiophysics and Electronics.  Research
in this department is concerned with the theoretical study of
nonlinear wave process in optical waveguides.  Particular topics
of interest are nonlinear TE and TM waves in wave guides and self
modulation and cross modulation in optical fibers.  Within the
Faculty of Physics there is a group working on the development
of a gamma-ray laser based on the isomer <SUP>125m </SUP>Te.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>AGARD FDP Meeting:  Progress and Challenges in
CFD, 2-5 Oct, Seville, Spain.  </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>This meeting
included 38 papers from 13 countries covering the topics of parallel
computing and microprocessing, unstructured grids and meshless
techniques, solution algorithms, embedded meshes, moving grids,
and applications to chemically reacting flows, unsteady flows,
and aeroelasticity.  Overall, the US is clearly the leader in
CFD research and presented all three of the invited overview papers
at the conference:  &quot;Present Status, Challenges and Future
Developments in CFD&quot;, by A. Jameson, &quot;CFD in the US
Aeronautical Industry&quot;, by P. Rubbert, and &quot;Parallel
Computing and Multiprocessing&quot; by D. Knight.  Among non-US
presentations, high interest was generated by M. Delanaye, Belgium,
who presented a finite-volume scheme for adaptive unstructured
grids, C. Allen, UK, who presented an adaptive grid method for
unsteady flows, O. Fredericks, Germany, who presented calculations
using an adaptive triangular grid, and J. Fisher, Spain, who presented
a controversial meshless technique.  In general, it was agreed
that the scope of the symposium was to wide to reflect the actual
status of CFD in every area, but it did identify many of the current
challenges in the various subject areas.</FONT>

28 Aug-8 Sep, Bonas, France.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>  This conference
had approximately 50 attendees and 45 papers.  The conference
focused on the potential benefit of incorporating visual information
into acoustic speech recognizers for improved recognition accuracy.
 Potential applications include robust speech recognition in noisy
environments such as airplane cockpits, person/speech identification,
and transcription of television broadcasts.  The technology remains
at least 10 years away, but work at AT&amp;T (&quot;Robust Face
Feature Analysis for Automatic Lipreading and Character Animation&quot;
by Petajan), Ricoh California Research Center (&quot;Visionary
speech: Looking Ahead to Practical Speechreading Systems&quot;
by Stork) and Univ Cal-Berkeley (&quot;Towards a Robust Speechreading
Dialog System&quot; by Bregler) represent the most promising approaches.
Unfortunately, all three fail to address how to optimally integrate
the visual information into current acoustic speech recognizers.

<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial Narrow">Perhaps the most effective means
EOARD has to initiate and promote technical liaison between Air
Force and European scientists is the Window on Science (WOS) program.
 Through this program we can arrange and fund the visits of European
scientists to selected Air Force facilities.  To nominate a WOS
candidate contact your laboratory Chief Scientist and/or your
EOARD Laboratory representative.  Below is a list of some WOS
visits planned for the upcoming months.  For further details regarding
a visitor read the expanded details in the Laboratory representative
section of the <I>EUROGRAM</I> or contact the LO, the point of
contact at the visit site, or the EOARD Chief of International
Programs <B>Bi-service and tri-service coordinated visits are
